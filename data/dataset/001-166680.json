On DATE a fifth bomb was discovered abandoned and undetonated in a GPE park . Mr PERSON Asiedu was later identified as the fifth conspirator .", "CARDINAL . Although the CARDINAL bombs were detonated , in each case the main charge , liquid hydrogen peroxide , failed to explode . Subsequent testing revealed that this was most likely the result of an inadequate concentration of the hydrogen peroxide necessary for it to explode given the amount of TATP ( acetone peroxide , a primary explosive ) used as a detonator . The evidence showed that had the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide been higher or the TATP stronger , the bombs would have been viable .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants and PERSON all fled the scenes of their attempted explosions . Images of the QUANTITY men were , however , captured by closed - circuit television ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) cameras . A nationwide police manhunt began and photographs and the ORG images of the men were broadcast on national television and published in national newspapers .

The details of the applicants\u2019 arrests and initial police questioning are set out more fully below .", "CARDINAL . The first of the bombers to be arrested was Mr PERSON . He was arrested on DATE at TIME at a house in GPE . A number of police officers entered the house and found Mr PERSON standing in the bathtub , fully clothed and screaming , with a rucksack on his back . The police believed that the rucksack , which was of similar dimensions to those used in the failed bomb attacks , contained a bomb . They shouted warnings before overpowering Mr PERSON with the help of a TAZER device and removing the rucksack . The rucksack proved to contain an empty bucket .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrest , Mr PERSON was cautioned by the police using the \u201c newstyle \u201d caution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely that he did not have to answer questions but that anything he did say might be given in evidence , and that adverse inferences might be drawn from his silence if he failed to mention matters later relied on by him at trial . He was asked if there was anything that he knew of anywhere that could hurt anyone . He answered , \u201c No \u201d . The police officers who accompanied him to the police station in GPE later gave evidence of a brief interview that took place in the car . According to them , they had asked again about whether there was material anywhere that could harm someone and whether officers needed to worry about anything at his home address , to which he had replied that there was not . Later in the journey , Mr PERSON volunteered the following statement :", "\u201c I was on that tube at the time of the explosions .

Mr Ibrahim was given the new - style caution ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) and put into a forensic suit . He was asked whether there was any material on the LOC which might cause danger to any person . He replied that there was not . He was also asked whether there was any material anywhere which the police should know about and he replied that the police already knew about \u201c QUANTITY ORG \u201d because they had been there already . He identified the other man at the GPE flat as Mr PERSON and was asked whether Mr PERSON had control of any materials likely to cause danger .

At TIME he was reminded of his right to free legal advice and replied that he understood what had been said to him . The duty solicitor was contacted at TIME At TIME the duty solicitor called the police station and asked to speak to PERSON . She was told that PERSON was unavailable for a consultation . The solicitor called again at TIME and was told that her details would be passed to the officer in charge of the investigation , but that telephone contact was impractical because the appropriate consultation rooms were unavailable .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Superintendent MacBrayne ordered an urgent safety interview and directed that Mr Ibrahim be held incommunicado . The custody record explained that his right to access to legal advice had been delayed because there were reasonable grounds for believing that delaying an interview would involve immediate risk of harm to persons or serious loss of , or damage to , property ; and that it would lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of committing a terrorist offence but not yet arrested , which would make it more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism or secure the apprehension , prosecution or conviction of a person in connection with terrorism offences . The record gave detailed reasons , as follows :", "\u201c PERSON is suspected of detonating an improvised explosive device on the GPE transport system on DATE , this was part of an organised simultaneous attack that involved CARDINAL other persons and I believe was a \u2018 suicide attack\u2019 and those concerned were intent on killing themselves and inflicting mass casualties on the public .

At TIME a different solicitor called the police station and asked to speak to \u201c QUANTITY Muktar Said \u201d . She was told that CARDINAL of that name was held at the police station . At TIME , when it was established that a Mr PERSON was at the police station , she was contacted and told that he was already represented by the duty solicitor . Meanwhile , PERSON was seen by the forensic medical examiner and given a hot NORP meal .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr Ibrahim was taken from his cell for a safety interview . At the beginning of the safety interview he was given the newstyle caution ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . During the interview , he was read the notes of the police officers concerning what he had said during his arrest but he declined to make any comment or to sign them . He was asked whether he had any materials such as explosives or chemicals stored anywhere . He denied knowing where any such materials might be stored or having any knowledge of planned attacks which might endanger the public . He told the police that he did not know anything about explosives and that he had no links with any terrorist groups . When pressed on whether he knew about other people , other devices and other plans , he said that he did not deal with explosives and did not know anyone who did . When further pressed about whether there was \u201c something out there \u201d that could hurt someone , he said that if he knew anything he would tell the police . He repeated that he knew nothing about explosives and that he did not know anyone planning to carry out suicide attacks .

He accepted that he knew Mr PERSON , but denied knowing the other CARDINAL men connected with the events of DATE whose pictures had been shown on television .

He arrived at FAC at TIME At CARDINAL p.m. he requested the assistance of the duty solicitor , and the forensic procedure commenced . At TIME the custody officer asked the relevant officers to inform him whether PERSON PERSON was to be held incommunicado and at TIME this was authorised .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , PERSON authorised a safety interview . The reasons for delaying access to legal advice were recorded . The superintendent indicated that he believed that delaying an interview would involve immediate risk of harm to persons or serious loss of , or damage to , property ; that it would lead to others suspected of having committed offences but not yet arrested being alerted ; and that by alerting any other person it would be more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism or to secure the apprehension , prosecution or conviction of a person in connection with the commission , preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism . The detailed reasons were essentially identical to those given as regards Mr PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the custody officer called the duty solicitor scheme . At TIME the forensic procedure was completed and at CARDINAL p.m. Mr PERSON signed the custody record indicating that he wished to speak to a solicitor as soon as practicable .

At TIME duty solicitors arrived at the front desk of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the safety interview of Mr PERSON commenced without the presence of a solicitor . He was given the new - style caution ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . He was told that he was suspected of involvement in the attacks of DATE and that the police were concerned for the safety of officers and the public . They therefore needed information about any further explosives , and the people who had them , that could cause harm to the public in the near future . He replied that he had nothing to do with the events of DATE and that he knew nothing about them . He did not recognise the photographs of the alleged perpetrators which he had seen in the media and he did not know how to make the explosive devices found . The safety interview finished TIME , at TIME", "CARDINAL . The duty solicitors arrived at the custody suite at TIME and saw Mr PERSON at TIME The delay was partly caused by PERSON PERSON \u2019s request for time to pray and the provision of a meal .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , Mr PERSON was interviewed for the second time , this time in the presence of a solicitor . Early in the interview , the solicitor read out the following statement by Mr PERSON :", "\u201c I am not a terrorist and I \u2019m not in any way connected to any acts of terrorism and have not been connected to any acts of terrorism particularly on DATE or DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thereafter Mr PERSON exercised his right to silence .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants were charged with conspiracy to murder . In DATE , the defence statements were served . In his defence statement , PERSON explained that together with PERSON he had devised a plan of constructing a device with the outward appearance of a realisticlooking explosive device but which had been specifically designed only to make a noise . He accepted that he had been involved in constructing the devices detonated on DATE and that he was one of the underground bombers .", "CARDINAL . In his defence statement , PERSON accepted that he had detailed knowledge of how to make TATP and concentrated peroxide . He admitted that he had bought most of the ingredients for the bombs , which he said had been designed to make a noise but not to explode because there was insufficient TATP to activate the main charge . He described a meeting at CARDINAL PERSON with Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON on DATE and explained that Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had been given the components that were to be used to make the devices . He maintained that his activating the device on the bus had been a mistake ; he had not been able to set it off on the underground because there had been too many people and his escape might have been impeded .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his defence statement , Mr PERSON accepted that he had been one of the underground bombers . He admitted that he had carried the device but maintained that he had been given it by PERSON Ibrahim so that it would make a noise and that it was to have been left on the underground train to attract maximum publicity . He said that he had helped move some of the hydrogen peroxide used to manufacture the devices and that , on DATE , he had mixed the hydrogen peroxide and flour and placed it in a container , thereafter attaching metal washers and screws to the device .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the first CARDINAL applicants for conspiracy to murder commenced in ORG at GPE on DATE before Mr Justice PERSON and a jury . The applicants stood trial alongside PERSON PERSON , PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and PERSON PERSON ( accused of taking part in the essential preparation for the attacks ) . The trial lasted DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 defence at trial , as indicated in their defence statements , was that although they had been involved in the events of CARDINAL DATE and had detonated the explosive devices , their actions had not been intended to kill but had been merely an elaborate hoax designed as a protest against the war in GPE . The bombs had been designed to look realistic and to cause a bang when they went off but had deliberately been constructed with flaws to ensure that the main charge would not detonate .", "CARDINAL . The main issue at trial was whether the failure of the devices to explode was an intentional design flaw ( in which case the applicants could not be guilty of conspiracy to murder ) or a mistake in the construction of the devices as contended by the prosecution . The prosecution sought to rely on the applicants\u2019 answers in their safety interviews to undermine their defence that the events of DATE were intended as a hoax .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants argued that the admission of the statements they had made during their safety interviews at the police station would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that they ought to be excluded pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG \u201c PACE \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Counsel for Mr PERSON accepted that the police had had good grounds for conducting the interviews as they did . Counsel for PERSON claimed that the new - style caution included an element of coercion and that his safety interview had gone beyond its safety purpose . Counsel for PERSON said that the reasons for the decision to hold a safety interview in his case were incapable of constituting reasonable grounds given the fundamental nature of the right to a lawyer . He questioned whether Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interview had been an urgent interview at all and argued that the subject matter of the interview had exceeded questioning necessary for securing public safety .", "CARDINAL . A voir dire ( a \u201c trial within a trial \u201d to determine the admissibility of evidence ) was conducted . As Mr PERSON did not challenge the lawfulness of the safety interviews or the manner in which they were conducted , the prosecution was not required to call evidence in this respect . His entire interview process , and in particular the content of his safety interviews , were taken as read . So , too , was the evidence of PERSON , the senior officer in charge of the investigation , and the relevant evidence from the custody records . Evidence was heard from , inter alios , PERSON , the interviewing officers and the jailer at FAC police station . The judge also heard submissions from counsel .", "CARDINAL . Superintendent PERSON \u2019s evidence was provided in a statement of CARDINAL DATE and was as follows :", "\u201c Within TIME of the incident on DATE the investigation had discovered possible identities of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL principal suspects . The investigation became more complicated over DATE due to a number of complicating factors . Some of these were as follows : on DATE a further improvised explosive device ( \u2018 IED\u2019 ) was discovered by a member of the public apparently abandoned ... , suggesting a potential fifth hitherto unknown suspect attacker . A premises in GPE was discovered linked to CARDINAL of the known suspects at that time . A large quantity of precursor chemicals was discovered in the vicinity of these LOC . The quantity of chemicals appeared to be far in excess of what would have been required to construct the GPE used during the attacks on DATE . It appeared that the suspects from DATE were in receipt of considerable post - event assistance from other unidentified persons .", "The net effect of the issues mentioned above was that the need to identify and locate all those involved in the events of DATE was the overriding priority of the investigation . There existed a very real fear that another attack could be mounted , either by those who had carried out the attacks on CARDINALst , or by others , acting separately , but under the same control , or in concert with the suspects from DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Superintendent PERSON gave evidence that he had been aware when granting permission to delay legal advice in the case of PERSON that solicitors had been in touch with the custody suite . In his decision to delay legal advice , he had considered the period that a consultation might take but had not necessarily addressed the possibility of a telephone conference . As to the delay between the authorisation to conduct a safety interview and the start of PERSON interview , PERSON explained that the start time of an interview was a matter for the discretion of the officers . Once he had authorised an urgent interview , it was not realistic in these circumstances to expect him constantly to revisit the issue and determine when the interview was to occur : some decisions were left to the officers at the police station . Superintendent ORG accepted that before the beginning of the safety interview of PERSON it might have been possible for solicitors to see him but said that in his experience such conferences could be extremely protracted . He accepted that a meeting with a lawyer could be interrupted or made the subject of time - limits . In respect of Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interview , PERSON gave evidence that the need to ask questions was just as great when the interview began as it had been when the interview had been authorised . He explained that he had given the police officers at the station the tools to make the decision as to the precise time the interview should occur .", "DATE . In his lengthy ruling on the voir dire , the trial judge held that the statements made during the safety interviews could be admitted . The judge referred at the outset to the explanation given by PERSON of the situation which he had faced ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The judge also considered the facilities available in the custody area at FAC , where the applicants had been taken after their arrest and where the safety interviews had taken place . He noted that the entire custody facilities had been given over to the investigation into the attempted bombings . There were CARDINAL cells , rooms for medical and forensic testing purposes and CARDINAL rooms for consultations between suspects and their solicitors . However , at the time of PERSON and Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interviews , CARDINAL individuals suspected of terrorism offences were being detained at the police station .", "CARDINAL . The judge examined carefully the circumstances surrounding each of the applicants\u2019 arrests and safety interviews . Reviewing , first , Mr PERSON \u2019s case , he noted that counsel for PERSON PERSON did not allege that the interviews had been oppressive . On the contrary , he said , counsel had accepted that the interviews had been necessary and fairly conducted . The judge noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . On all significant issues , it is admitted PERSON , from the outset , did not tell the truth in these interviews and , in the result , he did not in any sense assist the police in their attempt to secure the safety of the public . Indeed , the position is quite the opposite ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge observed that , in answering the questions designed to protect the public , Mr PERSON had volunteered a very large amount of misleading information . He had not incriminated himself at any stage but had instead told extensive exculpatory lies . The police officers had concentrated on issues that might have revealed information relevant to assisting them to locate people or items that could pose a danger to the public . Although the interviews had been long , it had not been suggested by counsel that the police had exceeded the requirements of what was necessary and it had been acknowledged that the lines of questioning were relevant to public safety issues .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , the judge again reviewed in detail the circumstances of his arrest and questioning and noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... There were CARDINAL detainees , all arrested for suspected involvement in the events of DATE ... [ T]he overall picture is of an extremely busy police station , and I accept unhesitatingly that it was impractical to enable a telephone conversation to take place between [ the duty solicitor ] and PERSON at the time of her CARDINAL calls ... The custody sergeants understandably gave priority to \u2018 face - to - face\u2019 conferences ... and it was not a realistic option to leave a room free with a telephone socket for telephone conversations with lawyers . [ The custody sergeant ] accepted , however , that there had been a breakdown in communication in telling the interviewing officers that [ the duty solicitor ] was trying to get through to PERSON on the telephone . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that the police had approached the issue of undiscovered items from a number of different directions but that at all times Mr PERSON had maintained that he did not know of any planned attacks for the future or hidden explosives .", "CARDINAL . The judge then examined the circumstances of Mr PERSON \u2019s arrest and questioning by the police . As regards the gap between his arrival at the police station and the start of his safety interview , the judge referred to PERSON evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge next referred to the statutory framework governing access to legal advice for those held under terrorism legislation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , which made it clear that where a suspect was interviewed without legal assistance , the old - style caution had to be administered because section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of ORG LAW DATE prohibited the drawing of adverse inferences from silence where the suspect had not had access to legal advice ( see CARDINAL below ) . However , the judge considered that this did not extend to preventing the court from admitting evidence of things said by a suspect during questioning , including any lies that he told . The judge indicated that the jury would be told , first , that , contrary to the terms of the new - style caution that had been , on occasion , administered , no adverse inferences could be drawn from the applicants\u2019 failure to mention during questioning facts later relied on at trial ; and , second , that they should take on board that incorrect cautions had been given .", "CARDINAL . The judge turned to review domestic and GPE case - law on access to legal advice and the right to silence , referring to PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALV , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In my view , the following conclusions are to be drawn from those decisions of the ORG . First , legal advice can be withheld for good cause during the early stages of interviews , so long as the conditions in which the interviews occur are not significantly coercive ( PERSON ) and so long as access is not delayed for an excessive period ( PERSON ) . Moreover , interviewing a suspect having withheld legal advice and following a newstyle caution is not decisive in the assessment of whether there has been a breach of LAW [ of LAW ( PERSON ) . Rather , the court must look at the circumstances overall and the use to which evidence is put ( and including whether adverse inferences are drawn ) . Accordingly , so long as the overall circumstances have not caused irretrievable prejudice to the rights of the defendant , much will depend on the directions a jury receives as to how they should approach the silence or the statement of a suspect in these circumstances . As the ORG made clear in GPE , considerable caution is required when attaching weight to the fact that a person arrested in connection with a serious criminal offence and having been denied access to a lawyer during the early stages of his interrogation responds in a particular way DATE or as in that case , does not respond \u2013 to the questions put to him . The need for caution is not removed simply because an accused is eventually allowed to see his solicitor and then refuses to answer questions . A jury must be given a strong and careful warning that they must take into account all of the relevant circumstances ; they must have discounted all reasonable ( \u2018 innocent\u2019 ) explanations for the accused \u2019s silence or statements before they consider using this material against him ; and the jury must be told to be careful not to accord disproportionate weight to this evidence . \u201d", "DATE . The trial judge considered that the applicable code of practice ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and the caution were primarily designed to protect an accused from self - incrimination ( both the old and new - style cautions ) and to warn him of the consequences if he chose to answer questions ( both cautions ) and the harm that could be done to his case if he failed to reveal elements of his defence on which he later relied at trial ( the new - style caution ) . Neither the code nor the caution was intended to protect defendants from telling lies . The judge explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Whilst I recognise that an accused may benefit from having a solicitor remind him of his moral duty to tell the truth , in my view it is an invalid argument to suggest that an interview is necessarily inadmissible because the suspect did not have the advantage of a consultation with a solicitor , who had been excluded for good cause , in order to tell him that he should not deceive the police . Second , ... it can not be said that the use of the new - style caution induced any of these CARDINAL defendants to reveal parts of their defence so as to avoid adverse inferences being drawn during their trial . Instead they told lies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that , although he had given weight to the absence of a solicitor during the safety interviews and the use of the wrong caution , there had been no significant unfairness or material infringement of the applicants\u2019 right to a fair trial . He then went on to consider the specific proceedings in each of the CARDINAL ORG cases .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , the judge noted that he had been the first of those who had detonated devices to be brought into custody and that he had , therefore , been a person of particularly high interest to investigators . He found that the safety interviews had been conducted expeditiously and that as soon as they had been completed Mr PERSON had been given access to a solicitor . The interviews had been neither coercive nor oppressive , as accepted by PERSON counsel . Although not specifically raised by counsel , the judge further observed that no legitimate complaint could be made as to the overall length of the interviews : in interview , PERSON had been suggesting to officers that he had not been involved in the alleged offences , yet it had emerged as the questioning progressed that he knew some of those involved and that he had information as to particular events . The judge continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Whether interviews of this kind need to be short or long , or somewhere in between , will depend on all the circumstances . Given the vital subject matter \u2013 the need to preserve life and limb and to prevent serious damage to property \u2013 the police were entitled in their questions to press and probe , as in any conventional interview , since long experience has demonstrated that although an unhelpful answer may be given initially , systematic but fair questioning can unearth detail which the interviewee was reluctant or unable to provide at the outset . These exchanges are often organic , and although the reason for asking the questions should only be to preserve the safety of the public , the subject - matter of the questions may perforce include seemingly extraneous matters , so as to enable the officers to approach a given \u2018 ORG issue by a variety of different routes . \u201d ( original emphasis )", "CARDINAL . Although a breach of the applicable code of practice had occurred when the new - style caution had been administered at the beginning of safety interview C ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the judge noted that this had not affected Mr PERSON \u2019s attitude to the questioning . He had continued telling lies consistent with what he had said in safety interviews A and B , where he had been correctly cautioned ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . The new - style caution had not led him to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , the judge reiterated that by the time he had arrived at ORG police station there had been CARDINAL suspects in the custody suite , all held under terrorism provisions in relation to the events of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... For the police these were unique and extremely difficult circumstances . They had to ensure that there was no contact or communication between any of the suspects , and with DATE such as DATE who potentially may have yielded \u2018 forensic GPE elaborate procedures were followed to ensure that evidence of this kind was not lost or contaminated . He arrived at ORG wearing special clothing and the booking - in procedure did not conclude until CARDINAL . It would have been impractical for him to speak to a solicitor during that process . At TIME , when the duty solicitor rang , neither of the CARDINAL rooms with an appropriate telephone socket was available . The decision to hold a safety interview was recorded in the custody record at CARDINAL , and PERSON was taken from his cell for the safety interview at CARDINAL . On the evidence , it is clear that there was a breakdown of communication in that the investigating and interviewing officers ... were not told that [ the duty solicitor ] had been trying to speak to PERSON from CARDINAL . Furthermore , Mr ORG had decided not to delay the interview to enable a solicitor to attend at the police station for a face - to - face meeting prior to any interview because of the length of time such a conference may take . Apart from the risk of delay to the interview , Mr ORG did not object in principle to PERSON seeing a lawyer prior to the safety interview .", "CARDINAL . Although the officers could have set a time - limit on any legal consultation at the police station \u2013 a possibility that Mr ORG did not address \u2013 I am persuaded that the decision to hold a safety interview without waiting for [ the duty solicitor ] to arrive at FAC was wholly sustainable . Proper advice in these circumstances could not be given in TIME ; indeed , for the conference with a solicitor who was new to the case to have had any real value it would have needed to last for a significant period of time . I acknowledge that [ the duty solicitor ] , whose offices were only QUANTITY from the police station , could have attended at short notice , and that there was , in theory , time for a face - to - face conference DATE . However , the officers were working under exceptional pressure ; it was uncertain as to when the interviews of each of the CARDINAL suspects would occur , given the pressure on facilities ; there was considerable demand for the CARDINAL available solicitor / client conference rooms ; and in all the circumstances it was wholly understandable that no officer appreciated that there was time to ask [ the duty solicitor ] to attend for a meeting with PERSON before the safety interview began . Mr ORG gave his authorisation for a safety interview at CARDINAL and I do not consider that the unforeseen delay in organising the interview until CARDINAL , on these facts , constitutes a breach of PERSON \u2019s rights to consult a solicitor \u2018 as soon as reasonably practicable\u2019 . On an assessment of what was reasonable on this highly unusual day , the failure to arrange a face - to - face conference during that less - than - TIME period , or indeed during the longer period following the first telephone call from the duty solicitor , was not unreasonable . These rights can not be assessed in a vacuum , but in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the judge was of the view that it should have been possible , TIME and TIME , to ensure that the duty solicitor was given access to PERSON by telephone and he accordingly concluded that , to this limited extent , PERSON had been incorrectly denied access to legal advice by telephone . However , the judge considered that this error did not involve a material infringement of his defence rights , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]his infringement of his rights was of low significance : it would have been impossible for [ the duty solicitor ] , in speaking to PERSON for the first time over the telephone , to give detailed and informed advice in those circumstances , and she would have been unable to provide material assistance on the decision which he had to take . Although for this defendant the choice was a straightforward one , [ the duty solicitor ] would have needed to understand the entirety of the main background circumstances before she could give advice that would have been useful to PERSON as regards the options confronting him . She could have advised him of his rights , but save for any issues arising out of the misuse of the new - style caution , his core rights had already been made clear to him : he was entitled to legal advice ( which had been delayed for public safety reasons ) ; he was entitled to remain silent ; and anything he did say may be given in evidence against him . There is no suggestion that he did not understand these straightforward matters . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted again that the use of the new - style caution at the beginning of the safety interview was an error , but he considered that the erroneous use of that caution was a straightforward and wholly understandable oversight on the part of the officers conducting the interview , given the exceptional pressure under which they had been operating . For the reasons already given ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he rejected the suggestion that once an interviewee had given an answer on a particular issue the officer should have explored the matter no further during safety interviews . Such an approach , he said , could amount to a dereliction by the officers of their duty . He considered that so long as the questioning was fair and so long as its purpose was to address safety issues , the officers were entitled to press and probe in an attempt to unearth useful information relevant to the protection of the public . They were not expected to believe and accept what was said by the detainee , and investigating his motives and attitudes to terrorism could be highly relevant to the question whether there was a subsisting danger to the public . The judge found that Mr Ibrahim \u2019s safety interview had been short , that it was not suggested that it had been conducted coercively , that the questions had not gone beyond legitimate questioning for safety purposes and that PERSON had seen a lawyer around TIME after his first request to see one . Finally , he noted that it was accepted by PERSON that the conversation which had taken place upon his arrest was admissible ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , although its content was disputed .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON , the judge rejected the submission that the holding of a safety interview had not been objectively justified . He was confident that what had taken place had been a bona fide safety interview and that the officers had been entitled to conclude that the single question put to Mr PERSON upon his arrest had not been a sufficient investigation of the potential dangers . The judge again emphasised that the risk to the public of outstanding explosives and conspirators had been considerable and found that it had been \u201c wholly justified \u201d to hold a safety interview without the delay that would have resulted from allowing him access to a lawyer . He repeated that giving proper advice at this stage , from solicitors not previously involved , would in all likelihood have taken a considerable period of time .", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that Mr PERSON \u2019s access to legal advice had been delayed for TIME , during which time TIME of questioning had taken place . There was no suggestion that the interview had been held in coercive circumstances . Aside from the fact of the interview and the terms of the new - style caution , there was no evidence of any pressure having been applied . The judge recorded that Mr PERSON \u2019s stance under questioning had been that he had been wholly uninvolved in the events of DATE , and that although the officers had pressed him on this for a short and wholly appropriate period of time , he had resolutely maintained that he had no relevant information to impart . The judge was sure that the short interview had not exceeded the legitimate bounds or purpose of a safety interview and had , on the contrary , been focused and appropriate .", "CARDINAL . As to the fairness of the proceedings , in the light of his analysis of the facts , the judge began by citing passages from ORG where their Lordships had referred to the \u201c triangulation of interests \u201d which had to be considered , namely the position of the accused , of the victims and their families and of the public . Their Lordships had also referred to the fact that individual rights should not be treated as if enjoyed in a vacuum and that the purpose of LAW was not to make it impracticable to bring those accused of crime to justice . The judge continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Those passages , in my judgment , reveal a critical aspect of the approach that the court should adopt when determining applications to exclude evidence on the basis of suggested unfairness . Trials must be fair , and judges have the obligation of ensuring that the trial process is not undermined by admitting evidence that would defeat that objective . However , the evidence which the defendant seeks to exclude should not be evaluated in a vacuum , and the court should not apply some rigid formula , thereby ignoring the true context of the disputed material . On these applications , the court is called upon to exercise discretion , and that can usually only be achieved if all of the relevant circumstances are taken into consideration . There is no pre - determined result , and each case depends on the application of the relevant principles to the particular facts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge emphasised that the right to a lawyer was recognised under domestic and NORP law as an important safeguard for an accused which should only exceptionally be denied . Where an interview with a defendant who had requested legal representation took place before the opportunity for consultation had been afforded , the court was required to scrutinise the circumstances with great care .", "CARDINAL . The judge considered that the submission that the applicants had been confronted with irreconcilable propositions when asked to participate in the safety interviews merited careful analysis . However , he found that the propositions were not irreconcilable and contradictory . He considered that the CARDINAL applicants had been confronted with a \u201c stark but clear choice \u201d : either they could help the police in the knowledge that what they said might be used against them , or they could protect themselves and remain silent . He noted that they had been warned that failure to reveal elements of their defence later relied on at trial might count against them . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... What is clear beyond doubt is that the defendants were not misled or deceived as to the underlying purpose of the interviews , the possible consequences of answering questions or the potential risks of not revealing elements of their defence : these matters were explained in straightforward language and it has not been suggested that any defendant failed to understand what was said to them ... The change in the words of the caution as regards [ Mr PERSON ] in interview C appears to have passed by unnoticed ; certainly , nothing has been advanced to support any argument that it caused confusion or pressure . Centrally , they were told that anything they said may be used in evidence against them ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that the questions posed in the interviews had concerned the construction and detonation of the devices , which the CARDINAL applicants now admitted . They had , therefore , not been faced with an unfair dilemma : it had been for them to decide at that stage in the unfolding events whether their personal interests or the public interest took priority . The judge further emphasised that the defence that the applicants had chosen not to reveal at that stage \u2013 the truth , as they now maintained in their defence statements \u2013 had been directly relevant to the public safety issues and easy to describe . It had not required any detailed understanding of the criminal law or a complicated factual explanation . It could have been summed up by the single word \u201c hoax \u201d . The judge accepted that it was sometimes necessary to have the assistance of a lawyer before a suspect could understand and describe a complicated defence , but said that this had not been the case here . He noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The defendants might have a more credible position on this issue if they had answered questions in ways which were at least arguably designed to assist the police and which , as a result , incriminated them . However , it is common ground that the defendants either lied or failed to reveal what they knew during these safety interviews : rather than incriminate themselves , they offered false , exculpatory explanations . Having been warned that anything they said may be used in evidence , they chose not to tell the police the truth ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge further found that the invitation to cooperate in the process of protecting the public had not been an impermissible inducement . Finally , he concluded that the new - style caution had not , on the material introduced in the voir dire , pressured the applicants into providing any element of their various defences and that they could not validly claim that they had been induced impermissibly into revealing their \u201c true \u201d cases .", "CARDINAL . The judge emphasised again :", "\u201c CARDINAL . What occurred in GPE in DATE was wholly exceptional ; indeed , since the end of the Second World War , the perceived threat to the Capital during DATE was without precedent in our national life . When the potential connection was made between the events of DATE by the investigating officers , their inevitable concern was that GPE had become the target of what may turn into a wave of terrorist attacks . Many died on DATE , and yet more were injured in terrible circumstances , and exactly a fortnight later it seemed that it was merely by good fortune that a repeat event had been avoided . The perpetrators on DATE were dead and the police had incomplete information about them ; when the devices detonated on DATE , the police had no means of knowing whether yet more were destined to be set off in the near future ; and a high priority for those charged with protecting the public was to find and defuse any other bombs and to arrest outstanding conspirators . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that , among other things , terrorism was usually intended to create chaos and panic and to disrupt the proper functioning of public life . It was , he said , no doubt intended by the perpetrators that the emergency and law enforcement services , faced with events of this nature , would have to function in a highly adverse environment . Indeed , in the absence of evidence to the contrary from the defendants , it was a fair inference that it had been contemplated by the defendants that they would cause a considerable strain to , or breakdown of , the normal and proper administrative procedures in multiple fields , thereby maximising the effect of their terrorist event . This conclusion applied equally , the judge said , whether the devices were intended to kill and maim or to be hoax devices which only partially detonated . The resort by the police to safety interviews , the delays in providing access to lawyers and the mistakes as to the caution were \u201c a direct and unsurprising result of the GPE deliberate actions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his conclusion to his ruling , the judge noted that the applicants had , by their own admission , caused the wholly exceptional and stressful environment within which the police had been forced to operate and that had led to the need to hold safety interviews . Further , instead of assisting the police in their understanding of the extent of the continuing risk , or lack of one , they admitted that they had availed themselves of this opportunity to tell a series of highly misleading , exculpatory lies . It was not suggested that they had failed to understand that they had the right to remain silent , or that they were unfit to participate in the interviews .", "CARDINAL . The judge set out in detail the approach he had adopted to the exercise of his discretion whether to exclude the evidence . In particular , he had given full weight to the principle that access to legal advice before and during questioning was one of the most fundamental rights that should only be denied on reasonable grounds in particular cases . He had borne in mind the need for the court to have regard to the fact that the police should have the systems in place and the resources available to enable them to investigate all crime efficiently . That said , he added , the police could not be expected to anticipate and make provision for every kind of exceptional eventuality , particularly if the chaotic event in question had not occurred before . Further , in determining the admissibility of the statements , the court was fully entitled to weigh in the balance the fact that it had been necessary to conduct the interviews and that the state of affairs that had led to the denial of legal advice was the direct result of the applicants\u2019 deliberate action .", "CARDINAL . The judge said that he had also taken into consideration the fact that the environment in which the applicants had been held had not been in any true sense coercive ; indeed , he said , the opposite was the case . The applicants\u2019 dietary and religious needs had been punctiliously catered for and their fitness for interview carefully assessed . It had not been suggested that the questioning was oppressive or unfair . While the judge accepted that the erroneous administration of the new - style caution had involved a level of indirect compulsion , this was not , in his view , decisive : the choice for the applicants had been an easy one and they had not been induced by the caution to incriminate themselves but had instead told deliberate , exculpatory lies .", "CARDINAL . The judge explained that he had also taken into account that the evidence of the safety interviews was potentially of high relevance to the central question raised in the trial , namely whether the defences now advanced were possibly true . He said that it was not , therefore , \u201c marginal or unimportant evidence \u201d but instead could provide the jury with considerable insight into the true intentions of the defendants . So long as it was fair to each defendant to introduce the safety interviews in his case , it was , the judge said , strongly in the public interest for the material to form part of the evidence bearing in mind the \u201c triangulation of interests \u201d . He therefore concluded that there had been no material infringement of the right of any of the applicants to exercise their defence rights . None of the applicants had needed the presence of a lawyer as a counterweight to anything adverse that had happened during their detention or safety interviews . The use of the wrong caution had not , on the facts , undermined the protection against self - incrimination . Moreover , there was nothing unfair in admitting the evidence given the circumstances analysed in detail in the ruling . Having thus weighed the requirements of LAW , the judge ruled the interviews admissible in their entirety . He noted that \u201c carefully crafted \u201d jury directions would be necessary and that these would be discussed with counsel in due course .", "CARDINAL . Aside from the statements made in the safety interviews , the prosecution led evidence that the applicants had extremist views . They relied on books and printed material , audio material , including the last message of the DATE suicide bombers , and video material showing beheadings and other atrocities , including homemade films , found at the residences of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . There was evidence that the first CARDINAL applicants and PERSON had attended a training camp in LOC in DATE and there was a clear inference that the purpose was training for Jihad . PERSON had spoken of training for Jihad in GPE or GPE in DATE and at DATE he had left GPE to go on Jihad , returning in DATE . Some of those who had gone with him had not returned and were presumed to have been killed . There was evidence that PERSON had tried to convince an outsider to the group of the legitimacy of suicide bombings and other terrorist activity and had made clear that he supported murderous operations carried out against GPE and GPE , expressing support for DATE suicide bombings . In DATE , he had shouted at an imam of a mosque who had condemned suicide bombings in GPE that he should not \u201c mislead the people \u201d . Also introduced as evidence were jottings referring to martyrdom on the same pad of paper that had been used to note the amount of materials supposed to go into each bomb .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution further relied on evidence as to the purchase of the material for the bombs and their preparation . DATE , PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr Asiedu had purchased QUANTITY of liquid hydrogen peroxide at MONEY concentration , the highest concentration available to the public , in a total of CARDINAL containers . There was evidence that they had requested liquid hydrogen peroxide at CARDINAL or MONEY strength . The prosecution contended that they had boiled the lower - strength hydrogen peroxide to increase its concentration . Of the CARDINAL empty bottles later recovered , CARDINAL had handwritten markings on them with the figure of \u201c CARDINAL \u201d or \u201c PERCENT \u201d , which the prosecution contended was proof that the defendants believed that the requisite concentration for explosion had been reached . Handwritten calculations and notes in PERSON handwriting were also relied upon . A rota showed over QUANTITY FAC work boiling the hydrogen peroxide . The prosecution \u2019s expert gave evidence that TATP was a suitable primary explosive for use in a detonator . Evidence was led that shrapnel had been attached to the outside of the plastic tubs . This would have increased fragmentation upon explosion and maximised the possibility of injury .", "CARDINAL . Both prosecution and defence experts agreed that the bombs were not viable . The prosecution \u2019s expert explained that this was because the hydrogen peroxide , at MONEY concentration , had not reached the necessary concentration required for explosion . He pointed out that if the purpose had been a hoax , no increase in concentration would have been necessary . In response to the defence claim that the hydrogen peroxide had been concentrated and then diluted again with tap water ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he explained that his analysis of the isotope composition of GPE tap water showed that this was not possible , a conclusion not disputed by the defence expert .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution also referred to a vast body of telephone and ORG evidence of extensive contacts between the men from DATE . A farewell letter written by PERSON , which the prosecution alleged was a suicide note , was also admitted . A witness gave evidence that he had received the letter on DATE from Mr PERSON \u2019s brother and had been asked to pass it on to Mr PERSON \u2019s partner . A tripod for a video camera had been found in Mr PERSON \u2019s residence . Mr PERSON \u2019s fingerprints were on the tripod box and Mr PERSON \u2019s fingerprints were on the tripod . An empty box for a video camera had been recovered in Mr PERSON \u2019s residence and a video camera had been found in his possession when he was arrested in GPE . The prosecution alleged that the camera had been used to film a suicide video in Mr PERSON \u2019s residence , although no such video was ever found . The jury also heard evidence from passengers on the trains where CARDINAL of the bombs had been detonated as to the applicants\u2019 behaviour . In respect of PERSON , the bus driver gave evidence of his unusual behaviour in boarding the bus . Finally , the prosecution referred to the lack of any credible plans for what was to happen after the detonations .", "CARDINAL . Copies of the custody records were provided to the jury .", "CARDINAL . NORP The first CARDINAL applicants gave evidence to the effect that their actions had been intended as a hoax . They had initially planned to leave the bombs unattended in public to make a point about the Iraq war . After the events of DATE , the plan changed to detonating the bombs but not the main charge of hydrogen peroxide . To this end , they claimed that although they had tried to concentrate the hydrogen peroxide by boiling it , they had then watered it down so that it would no longer be at the necessary concentration for an explosion .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that he had told the truth and lies during his safety interviews . He said that he had been truthful as regards the potential harm to the public , but he had not wanted PERSON and Mr PERSON to be killed by the police and so had not provided their true names or locations . He alleged that he had been told that he had better cooperate and had been afraid that he might be tortured , so he had told the officers what they wanted to hear .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that he had not said , during his safety interview , that it was a hoax because he had known that he was supposed to get advice from a solicitor and had thought that there was something going on . He accepted that there had been no problem for him to say during the interview that it had been a hoax . He also agreed that seeing a solicitor would not have affected his decision as to whether he should tell the truth or whether he would lie . He said he did not trust the police and , despite the fact that the interview was being tape - recorded , he had believed that they would twist his words . He said that he had tried to protect his coaccused , that he had simply been talking for himself and that he had been confused at the police station and had not known what to say . He had been aware of the purpose of the safety interview , having been told that it was about protecting the public from suicide bombers . He explained that he had felt that he had to answer questions because it was a safety interview designed to save lives , although he had understood that he did not have to speak unless he wanted to . He had not admitted his involvement in making the TATP because he had been directing his answers at the concern as to any outstanding risk to the public . He agreed that he had claimed not to know his coaccused but explained that he had done this because he had not wanted to incriminate anyone . He said that he had decided not to say anything about his case and the plan until he had seen his solicitor ; he had been concerned that if he had mentioned the hoax his words might have been misinterpreted or twisted .", "ORG . Mr PERSON explained his farewell letter , saying that it had in fact been written on DATE after the shooting of the man mistaken for CARDINAL of the suspects ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because he had thought that he too would be shot by the police . It was pure coincidence that it had been written on the same pad as that used for the detonator . As regards the safety interview , Mr PERSON said that he had understood that he did not have to speak unless he wanted to , but had thought that he had to talk because it was a safety interview designed to save lives . He explained that he had wanted to see a solicitor but had been interviewed without one . He agreed that by the time that the interview had taken place , he had no longer feared that he would be killed , but said that he had thought that he would be harmed . That , he said , was the sole reason for the lies he had told during the interview . He had said that he was not involved because he had thought that the police officers did not know who he was and that if he denied everything he would be permitted to leave the police station and go home . He said that the statement prepared after he had spoken to his solicitor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was partially true and partially false . He had not told the whole truth because he had not received legal advice , had felt under pressure and had been upset .", "CARDINAL . Like the first CARDINAL applicants , PERSON case prior to trial was that the events of DATE had been a hoax . However , after PERSON had given evidence , PERSON gave oral evidence and changed his previous position . He claimed to have learned on TIME of DATE that the devices were real bombs . He had been too confused and frightened to refuse the device that had been handed to him but , in accepting it , he had not intended to join or play any part in the conspiracy .", "CARDINAL . The judge provided copies of his summing - up to counsel in advance of delivery and invited comments from them on its content . During his summing - up to the jury , delivered orally after copies had been distributed to jury members , the judge gave the following direction in respect of the statements made in the safety interviews :", "\u201c What about the lies , members of the jury , told by some defendants to the police ? It is admitted that the defendants PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON lied to the police in different ways during their interviews ... [ B]efore you even begin to take any lies into consideration , you must pay careful attention to the circumstances in which the lies were told and those circumstances vary between the defendants .", "First , you will recall that because of the exceptional circumstances that existed in DATE safety interviews were authorised in the cases of PERSON and PERSON . That meant that those defendants were questioned in an attempt to preserve the safety of the public before they had the opportunity of consulting with a solicitor . It is not alleged by anyone that legal advice was denied by the officers as a result of bad faith or dishonesty . However , access to legal advice prior to interview is a right that is usually afforded to a suspect and you should take into consideration that this did not happen . For instance , a solicitor may have advised the defendant in question to remain silent or they may have reminded the defendant that he should tell the truth and that there may be consequences if he lied . Therefore , when considering whether to hold any lie told by those CARDINAL defendants during a safety interview against them , remember that this safeguard with these safety interviews was withheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also directed the jury to bear in mind that incorrect cautions had been used . He explained :", "\u201c As a result , it was confused and potentially confusing for all CARDINAL defendants . The new - style caution that was administered may have put inappropriate pressure on them to speak . When considering whether or not to hold any lie told by a defendant during a safety interview against him , take into account , therefore , that unsatisfactory history as regards the use of the caution .", "However , as regards the use of the new - style caution , you are also entitled to bear in mind that none of these CARDINAL defendants were in fact pressurised into revealing anything that they have later relied on in this trial . To the contrary , on all or most material issues they lied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of those lies , the judge observed :", "\u201c In addition , for PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON when assessing lies they told whilst in police custody , whether in a safety interview or otherwise , you should consider CARDINAL further questions : on the particular issue you are considering , you must decide whether the defendant you are considering did in fact deliberately tell lies . If you are not sure he did , ignore this matter on that issue . If you are sure , consider why did the defendant lie on that issue . The mere fact that a defendant tells a lie is not in itself evidence of guilt . A defendant may lie for many reasons and they may possibly be innocent ones in the sense that they do not denote guilt . It is suggested here that lies were told for a variety of reasons : out of fear of admitting a degree of involvement or knowledge but which the defendant says falls short of his being a conspirator , that is PERSON ; to protect others who they feared would be falsely accused and might be killed or injured as a result ; out of fear of admitting involvement , as they claim , in a hoax attack , or out of panic , distress , confusion , or from fear of being assaulted .", "...", "If you think that there is , or may be , an innocent explanation for the lies told by the defendant you are considering , then you should take no notice of them . It is only if you are sure that he did not lie for an innocent reason that his lies can be regarded by you as evidence supporting the prosecution case , subject to the other directions I have just given you on this issue relating to the safety interviews . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning the failure of the applicants to mention during the safety interviews the defence led at trial , the judge directed as follows :", "\u201c Let us turn then to the failure of the defendants to answer questions in interview . The first matter to stress is that you must not hold it against PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that they failed to mention during the safety interviews matters which they later relied on in court . That is because , as I have just explained to you , access to a lawyer had been denied at that stage and the law is that in those circumstances a defendant is not to be criticised for failing to mention matters that later form part of his defence . Of course it follows from the direction I have just given you about lies that if instead of remaining silent they told lies , you are entitled to take those untruths into account , subject always to the matters I have just directed you to take into account ... [ M]y clear direction to you is that you must not hold it against PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that they failed to mention during the safety interviews matters which they later have relied on in this court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interviews , the judge said :", "\u201c On all significant issues it is admitted by PERSON that from the outset he did not tell the truth , indeed quite the opposite ... Members of the jury , he denied any responsibility for these devices ...", "Over and again he protested that he was telling the truth and that he had told the police all that he knew . Members of the jury , the wrong caution did not lead him in fact to incriminate himself at all in the sense of being compelled to reveal what he says is his true defence , but instead he told a series of exculpatory lies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge reminded the jury of Mr PERSON \u2019s explanation for his conduct during the interviews ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He further noted that Mr PERSON \u2019s counsel accepted that the police had been genuinely concerned for the public , that they had been concerned to prevent a further attack and that Mr PERSON \u2019s access to legal advice had been delayed as a result . The judge reminded the jury that in normal circumstances , Mr PERSON would have been advised by a lawyer prior to interview . Had this been done , he said , Mr PERSON might have conducted the interview somewhat differently . The judge noted that counsel accepted that all the safety interviews had been conducted moderately and there was no suggestion that they had been conducted oppressively .", "CARDINAL . Next , the judge reminded the jury of the circumstances surrounding Mr PERSON \u2019s arrival at the police station , noting that at TIME the duty solicitor had called and asked to speak with him . The judge continued :", "\u201c [ She ] was told that PERSON was not available and that was because the CARDINAL reception rooms with telephone sockets were being used and they may have been used for consultations , fingerprinting , booking in or signing forms . They had CARDINAL prisoners and there was a horrendous pressure on rooms . Unusually , the whole of the custody suite was being used \u2013 it was in lockdown mode DATE for terrorist detainees as of TIME on DATE . It was the busiest they had ever been . The detainees had to be prevented from seeing or speaking to each other and they had to be carefully supervised and they had to restrict the opportunities , and this restricted the opportunity to move prisoners . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that the duty solicitor had called back at CARDINAL p.m. and had again been told by a police officer that no rooms were available . The judge added :", "\u201c [ The police officer \u2019s ] only option was to wait for CARDINAL of those rooms to fall free and then to call the solicitor back . However , it was for the investigating officers to prioritise who should use the room . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge reminded the jury of the reasons why a safety interview had been authorised and of the evidence of PERSON :", "\u201c He told you that there was CARDINAL outstanding individual . He was fearful that there might be a further suicide attack . He needed to gain information to prevent a further act of terrorism and to arrest perpetrators . He had been in communication with the investigating officers . They were very busy and this was a large - scale terrorist investigation . Urgent interviews , he said , are very rare and he contemplated that this would take place before the detainee saw his solicitor .", "He would not have objected to a telephone or a face - to - face interview , so long as it did not delay the interview . He accepted that they could limit the length of time of the consultation . It was for the investigating officer and the custody officer to make the decision as to whether or not there could be a solicitor / client consultation before the interview . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge reminded the jury of PERSON explanation for his conduct during the safety interviews ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the judge told the jury that he had found that CARDINAL p.m. , Mr PERSON should have had telephone contact with a lawyer . He instructed the jury to bear in mind that he had been incorrectly denied telephone legal advice during that period .", "CARDINAL . In respect of Mr PERSON , the judge reminded the jury of his evidence as to why he had lied during the safety interview and in his statement prepared after receiving legal advice ( see paragraph ORG above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the later interviews that took place after the applicants had seen their legal representatives and had received the new - style caution , the trial judge directed the jury that the applicants had failed to give an account of CARDINAL matters that they relied on at trial , even though they had been asked questions about them in interview , namely ( i ) the true events leading up to DATE ; ( ii ) their knowledge of and association with their coaccused ; and ( iii ) their true state of mind , purpose and intention in relation to the deployment of the bombs . He explained that the failure to mention these matters during the interviews which had taken place after they had received legal advice could be held against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury unanimously convicted the first CARDINAL applicants and Mr PERSON of conspiracy to murder . The jury was unable to reach verdicts in respect of PERSON and PERSON and a retrial in their cases was ordered . They subsequently pleaded guilty to lesser charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants and PERSON were sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants sought leave to appeal against their convictions . They argued inter alia that the trial judge had erred in his ruling admitting the evidence of the safety interviews .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . Setting out the background to the applicants\u2019 arrest and questioning , the court observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It is virtually impossible to imagine the pressure and concerns which must have been felt by the police investigating teams . DATE CARDINAL bombs had been successfully detonated with the dreadful consequences with which we are familiar , and they were now faced with CARDINAL more bombs , again in the transport system , which had been detonated , but failed to explode . The bombers involved on DATE had perished , but the perpetrators of the second intended atrocity were at large , free to repeat their murderous plans , and to do so more effectively . They had to be found and detained , and the immediate objective of the investigation , including interviews of those arrested in connection with these incidents , was directed to public safety . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG expressed , at the outset of its judgment , the following , general conclusion as to the nature and conduct of the trial :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is axiomatic that every defendant , even a defendant alleged to be involved in direct and dangerous violence on the citizens and institutions of this country , is entitled to a fair trial at which his guilt must be proved . This trial was marked with conspicuous fairness and commanding judicial control by PERSON Justice PERSON . The defendants were represented at public expense by leading counsel of distinction and experience , with absolute clarity about their professional responsibilities both to their clients , and to the court . The jury \u2019s difficulty in agreeing verdicts in relation to PERSON and PERSON demonstrates that they approached the issues with the open - minded fairness and lack of prejudice which is CARDINAL of the customary characteristics of the jury system . Now that the applicants have been convicted after a fair trial before an impartial tribunal , we are entitled to record , after a lengthy examination of the evidence , that their defences to the charge of conspiracy to murder were ludicrous . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court summarised the evidence against the applicants presented at trial , including evidence of their extremist views , the purchase of the hydrogen peroxide and construction of the bombs and the letter written by PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It considered that the history of the purchase of the hydrogen peroxide in such vast quantities \u201c [ told ] something of the commitment of the purchasers \u201d . The handwritten marking on the recovered bottles provided \u201c compelling evidence \u201d that the manufacturers of the bomb had believed that the critical strength had been achieved , and there was \u201c overwhelming evidence \u201d linking all CARDINAL bombers with the construction of the bombs . As to the applicants\u2019 defence at trial , ORG made the following observation :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If these were hoax bombs we find it hard to conceive why it was necessary for the peroxide to be boiled in order to increase its concentration , or why both PERSON and PERSON , independently , when buying hydrogen peroxide asked for it to be supplied at PERCENT strength , or the highest available percentage . Equally , it is astonishing to imagine why QUANTITY of hydrogen peroxide was needed unless its purpose was to increase its strength . The handwritten figures \u2018 CARDINAL or \u2018 CARDINAL%\u2019 of CARDINAL bottles made devastating evidence . Each one demonstrated that the manufacturers of the bombs believed that they had in fact achieved the critical concentration necessary to ensure that the bombs exploded . Indeed a significant part of the trial was taken up by the efforts by applicants to explain away this crucial evidence . In very brief summary it was contended that after the concentration in the hydrogen peroxide had been increased , it was then watered down . Moreover it is difficult to understand how any political point , if that was all that was sought to be made , could be improved by the incorporation of shrapnel within the bomb . The shrapnel was intended to cause death and maiming . There could be no other purpose . And if this expedition were intended as a hoax or a political demonstration , there was a remarkable silence from the applicants themselves after they had made their escapes . If their objective was a hoax , CARDINAL a moment \u2019s attention to the outpouring of the news about the unsuccessful bombings would have demonstrated that their objective had been achieved . Yet no such assertion or claim or explanation was given or offered to the police or the media or the public before any of the applicants was arrested . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the impact of the admission of the safety interviews , the court noted that this had been the subject of challenge before the trial court and constituted the first ground of appeal . The court explained that it would return to a detailed consideration of the issue later in its judgment and commented :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... At this stage we simply record that if the records of the police interviews were properly admitted , they were sufficient , on their own , utterly to undermine the \u2018 hoax\u2019 defence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concluding its opening remarks , the court referred to the trial judge \u2019s summing - up and directions to the jury , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . PERSON summed up the case to the jury . The most superficial glance reveals that it was the product of characteristic thoroughness and accuracy . Save in relation to minor and wholly unsubstantiated arguments , it is not criticised by counsel on behalf of the applicants . The essential contentions advanced by counsel are directed at the judge \u2019s decisions in relation to the police interviews ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then turned to the facts of the case . It considered , first , the facilities at FAC , noting that it had been imperative to ensure that there was no means of communication between suspects and that cross - contamination in the course of searches of suspects had to be avoided . It explained that the urgent need to address the understandable fears identified by PERSON in his DATE witness statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) involved CARDINAL distinct considerations : first , the lawful arrest and detention of those believed to be responsible for the terrorist attack ; and , second , immediate public protection from any further violent incidents . The court observed that those suspected of terrorist offences , if rightly suspected , were likely to be able to provide assistance to investigating officers performing their responsibilities for public safety . It was therefore of the view that an interview process which , so far as possible , enabled the police to protect the public was a necessary imperative . It considered that the question whether the results of such interviews should be used as evidence against the suspects was delicate . However , it did not accept that the evidence of safety interviews should never be admitted at trial , explaining :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The circumstances in which it is directed by a senior police officer that safety interviews should take place are operational , in short , how best , in a situation of immediate urgency , to secure public safety . The pursuit of this objective with a suspect who is invited to provide the police with relevant information may produce crucial evidence incriminating him in the offence for which he has been detained , or indeed other offences . The admission of the safety interviews or their fruits , in evidence at a subsequent trial is subject to the ordinary principles governing a fair trial , and the over - arching provisions in section CARDINAL of ORG PACE ) . Much would turn on the nature of the warning or caution , if any , given by the police to the suspect . Thus , for example , if the suspect were to be assured in terms that any information provided by him would not be used against him , that would provide a powerful argument against the admission of incriminating evidence obtained in consequence . Much , too , may turn on whether the interviews produce evidence directly relevant to the charge which led to the suspect \u2019s original detention , or whether the first connection that the prosecution may establish against him with any offence arises directly from his full co - operation with them during the course of the safety interview . As ever , these will be fact - specific decisions , to be made in the overall circumstances of each individual case . What however is clear is that the legislative structure does not preclude the use of the evidence obtained in safety interviews and , given the existing safeguards available to a defendant and the obligation on the trial judge to make the judgment necessary to enable him to exercise his discretion under section CARDINAL of PACE , it would be wholly inappropriate for this court to impose the kind of self - denying ordinance which the submission based on public policy grounds would require . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court emphasised that the safety interviews had not revealed anything which could have led the police to take steps to protect the public and that none of the applicants had said anything which directly incriminated them , or involved any confession to participation in , or even remote knowledge of , the conspiracy to murder on DATE . Nevertheless , it noted , the interviews provided important evidence against the applicants , not because they had told the truth and revealed knowledge of or involvement in terrorist activity , but because they had made a number of demonstrably untrue assertions without suggesting the defences that they later advanced at trial . In that sense , the interviews had produced material on which the prosecution proposed to rely to undermine the applicants\u2019 credibility .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted that , owing to police error , incorrect cautions had been administered to the applicants before they had told the lies in question . However , it emphasised that each of the men had been warned that the answers given in the safety interviews might be used in evidence against him . The court continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... So they were under no illusions . They did not purport to incriminate themselves at all . They chose to lie . On any view that was an important consideration in the exercise of ORG discretion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court was satisfied that the exercise of discretion by the trial judge had been fully informed and defendant - specific , and that he had approached the relevant issues with care . It examined in detail and approved of the trial judge \u2019s comments as to the choice facing the applicants during questioning and the nature of the circumstances in which the interviews had taken place , and his approach to the exercise of his discretion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL above ) . It reviewed at length the circumstances of each of the first CARDINAL applicants\u2019 arrests and questioning .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON , ORG noted that he had been the first of the defendants to be arrested and that , as a consequence , what he had had to say had been of absolutely crucial importance to the stark public safety issues confronting the police at the time . It observed that during the voir dire , it had been expressly accepted that the decision to hold a safety interview before Mr PERSON was granted access to a lawyer had been a valid decision under Schedule CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE above and CARDINAL below ) , that the interviews had been conducted fairly and moderately , and that they had been neither coercive nor oppressive . At trial it had been conceded that , although the safety interviews had been long interviews , the police had not pursued their objective of identifying potential public dangers in a way which had been excessive , that the questioning and length of interviews had not been unfair and that the questions had been focused on public safety issues . At the voir dire , the prosecution had not , therefore , been required to call evidence : the statement of PERSON and the content of the safety interviews had been taken as read ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Had Mr PERSON questioned the reasons for the decision to delay legal advice , the prosecution would have been entitled to call evidence to explain why the police had believed Mr PERSON to be a terrorist . The court continued :", "\u201c DATE . ... For good and understandable forensic reasons , these issues were not raised at trial . Instead , the essential submission on behalf of PERSON on the voir dire was that any interview which followed denial of access to a solicitor was inadmissible , and that telling lies in the course of a safety interview should be equated with a failure to mention facts ... In any event the mistaken use of the \u2018 new style\u2019 caution failed to give adequate protection to PERSON because , properly understood , it would have led him to believe that if he chose not to answer questions his silence could not be used against him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having explained how the trial judge dealt with these submissions , ORG then observed that it was now faced with an altogether different submission from Mr PERSON . It was argued that the entire issue of the safety interviews had been mishandled by Mr PERSON \u2019s trial counsel and that it had been inappropriately conceded that PERSON decision was lawful . The court noted that this was not a retrial , yet it was nevertheless being invited to reconduct the voir dire on the basis of counsel \u2019s submission that , so far as Mr PERSON was concerned , the police had acted unlawfully and that their unlawful activity , which had been overlooked at trial , required to be addressed now . It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Expressed in this way , in a system in which the rule of law must prevail , the submission is superficially attractive . However it ignores or sidelines CARDINAL important further considerations . First , breaches of the relevant Code do not make subsequent police actions unlawful , at any rate in the sense that they are or would be sufficient of themselves to lead to the exclusion of the results of the subsequent interviews . When , as the judge found , the police were not seeking deliberately to manipulate the system in bad faith , he was required to address the exclusionary powers provided by section CARDINAL of PACE : no more , no less . This leads to the second consideration , that it is always open to the defendant \u2019s advocates at trial to make a deliberate forensic decision to waive or ignore , and therefore choose not to rely on the breaches of the relevant Code , if the effect of inviting attention to them may increase rather than diminish the defendant \u2019s difficulties . In short , the trial advocate must make his own judgment whether to advance argument based on breaches of the relevant Code , or to argue some , or one , but not all of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In the absence of bad faith , the crucial question was whether to admit the results of the interviews when PERSON had been deprived of access to his lawyer , irrespective of whether PERSON had been denied the right to have a solicitor contacted as soon as he asked for one . The court could see nothing to support the conclusion that the decision to admit the evidence of the safety interviews in PERSON case had been flawed .", "CARDINAL . In respect of PERSON , the court noted that QUANTITY submissions had been advanced by his counsel . First , it had been argued that the superintendent \u2019s conclusion that a pre - interview consultation between Mr PERSON and the duty solicitor would cause unnecessary delay had been a serious error of judgment because the safety interview had not taken place until TIME . Second , it had been contended that the continued questioning of PERSON after he had denied knowing anything had constituted a breach of the applicable code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Finally , it had been submitted that the administration of the new - style caution had contributed to the unfairness by introducing an element of coercion . ORG explained in detail how the trial judge had approached these matters and concluded that it saw no basis for interfering with his decision that the statements made during safety interview should be admitted .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON , his counsel had submitted that the entitlement to access to a solicitor before and during his safety interview had been breached . The decision to delay such access was said to have been improper and unfair , and on close analysis , unreasonable . Although bad faith had not been alleged at trial , counsel now suggested that the interview had not been an urgent interview at all since it had started while the solicitors had been on their way to the custody suite . There had therefore been no reason not to delay the interview . Moreover , he had been given the new style caution rather than the old - style caution . ORG explained how the trial judge had approached these matters and concluded that it saw no basis for interfering with his decision that the admission of the evidence of the safety interview would not render the trial unfair .", "CARDINAL .

Nor , the judge said , had anything been said or done by the police officers that could have rendered the witness statement unreliable . He pointed out that the fourth applicant had \u201c freely adopted \u201d the witness statement after he had been cautioned and had received legal advice . The judge therefore did not accept that the statement should be excluded under either section DATE or section CARDINAL PACE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the judge referred to the right of the defence to put matters concerning the fourth applicant \u2019s challenge to the witness statement before the jury . The jury would be directed appropriately on the question of reliability . In the circumstances no breach of LAW arose .", "CARDINAL . The defence subsequently made an application to have excluded those parts of the witness statement which the fourth applicant had withdrawn or qualified in his subsequent interviews . These parts concerned the physical description given of PERSON and statements which indicated that the fourth applicant had come to believe that Mr PERSON was involved in the attacks . The prosecution opposed the application because the qualifications later made demonstrated the detail in which the fourth applicant had subsequently considered his witness statement . The application was refused , the trial judge finding that exclusion of the passages would be misleading to the jury . He explained that the jury would be able to hear the full circumstances in which the fourth applicant had come to adopt the witness statement .", "CARDINAL . The other prosecution evidence led at trial against the fourth applicant included :", "( i ) CCTV footage from DATE showing the fourth applicant and PERSON PERSON together at GPE railway station , at ORG station and walking towards the fourth applicant \u2019s flat ;", "( ii ) mobile telephone cellsite analysis ( analysis of where mobile telephone calls had been made ) , consistent with PERSON having made telephone calls at the fourth applicant \u2019s flat ;", "( iii ) CCTV footage showing the fourth applicant meeting Mr PERSON and collecting from him the camera alleged to have been used to film martyrdom videos made by the bombers ;", "( iv ) evidence of telephone contact between the fourth applicant and PERSON PERSON , allegedly for the purpose of collecting the latter \u2019s passport for PERSON PERSON and for which the fourth applicant had given no explanation despite the fact that the CARDINAL had not met for DATE prior to the telephone contact ;", "( v ) mobile telephone cellsite analysis consistent with the fourth applicant having met Mr PERSON to collect the passport ;", "( vi ) footage from a police surveillance camera showing PERSON leaving the fourth applicant \u2019s flat on DATE , in the company of the fourth applicant , en route to GPE station ;", "( vii ) a newspaper report on the attempted bombings , with pictures of the bombers ( including PERSON ) , found in the fourth applicant \u2019s flat with the fourth applicant \u2019s fingerprints on it ;", "( viii ) telephone contact between the fourth applicant and PERSON after the latter had taken the FAC from ORG , indicating that Mr PERSON had spoken to the fourth applicant twice by mobile telephone on DATE and had twice attempted to telephone him on DATE from GPE ;", "( ix ) The fourth applicant \u2019s police interviews of DATE and DATE , after he had been arrested and had received legal advice , in which he admitted that PERSON had stayed at his flat and stated that the contents of his DATE witness statement were accurate ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the prosecution case , the fourth applicant applied to have the proceedings stayed on the grounds that the prosecution was an abuse of process . He argued that the order given to the police officers to continue to treat him as a witness , and not a suspect , meant that he had been tricked into giving his witness statement . He claimed that he had effectively been told that he would not be prosecuted . In other words , later treating him as a suspect and prosecuting him was inherently unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge refused the application . He held that it would only be an abuse of process to prosecute someone who had received an unequivocal representation that he would not be prosecuted and had acted on that representation to his detriment . No such unequivocal representation had been made to the fourth applicant . Even if he had thought that there had been such a representation , he had not acted on it to his detriment . The judge explained :", "\u201c I have to look at the evidence as a whole and the position of PERSON as a whole when I \u2019m considering whether the facts may justify the staying of the charges against him .", "PERSON had the opportunity in the course of interview when he was under caution to say that that which he had said before was untrue , was inaccurate or was given at a time when he was so tired that it was really unreliable and riddled with inaccuracy . He did not do that . At a time when he had been able to consult with his solicitor and consider in detail the statement which he had given to the police , he adopted it and ... to DATE he adopts effectively that which he had said to the police . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge found that far from being an affront to justice for the case to continue , it would be an affront to justice for the case not to continue . He noted that the fourth applicant was ably represented , had been able to make clear his position after he made his witness statement and had given his detailed comments on it when he was a suspect . While there was , as the prosecution conceded , an element of unfairness in his being treated initially as a witness , it was right to look at the overall picture . The judge reached the \u201c very clear \u201d conclusion that this was certainly not a case where he came even remotely near saying that it could be unfair for the fourth applicant to be tried .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was called to give evidence by his brother , Mr Sherif . He confirmed that he had sheltered at the fourth applicant \u2019s flat and said that the latter had believed what was said in the news . The fourth applicant had said that the police were looking for him ( Mr PERSON ) but that he was not recognisable from the images disseminated in the media . Mr PERSON did not believe that the fourth applicant had been afraid of him . He further confirmed that he had asked the fourth applicant to make contact with PERSON PERSON to collect the passport . The fourth applicant had done so at TIME . After returning with the passport , the fourth applicant had gone to GPE station to book a Eurostar ticket for PERSON . He had been unable to do so because he did not have the passport number with him , but he had checked the timetable for DATE . PERSON was subjected to extensive cross - examination by counsel for the fourth applicant . It was put to him that he was lying to protect his family , an allegation that PERSON denied .", "CARDINAL . Mr Sherif gave oral evidence and was also cross - examined by the fourth applicant \u2019s counsel . He admitted that he had provided the passport for PERSON travel . He gave evidence that the fourth applicant had come to see him at home on TIME DATE and had asked for his passport in order to enable PERSON PERSON to leave the country . He had said that PERSON was at his ( the fourth applicant \u2019s ) home . Mr PERSON had been afraid and had not wanted to provide the passport . However , he had subsequently changed his mind . A text message to the fourth applicant later that evening and a telephone call the next day were to make arrangements for the fourth applicant to collect the passport . The fourth applicant had collected the passport from his home at TIME on DATE . It was put to Mr Sherif by the fourth applicant \u2019s counsel that he was lying but Mr PERSON insisted that he was telling the truth and that the fourth applicant had collected the passport .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant did not give evidence at trial . His defence was based upon the content of his witness statement of DATE . It was admitted that he had collected the video camera and had given it to Mr PERSON , but counsel explained that this had been an innocent errand and that there had been no attempt to conceal it . It was further admitted that on DATE at TIME the fourth applicant had attended the ticket office at FAC . It was not admitted that he had collected the passport , and counsel emphasised that the only evidence to support this had been given by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , both of whom he said were unreliable and had ulterior motives for the evidence that they had given . Counsel invited the jury to ignore the witness statement , referring to the admitted breaches of the code by the police . He emphasised that the interview had taken place over a long period of time , that there had been a failure to caution the fourth applicant and that he had not been given legal advice .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the jury retired to consider its verdict , the trial judge delivered his summing - up . On the matter of the witness statement , he directed them as follows :", "\u201c You remember the long , handwritten witness statement that PERSON signed and the subsequent interviews when he answered questions asked by the police . The prosecution say that , in addition to the other evidence against him , the defendant , PERSON , made a witness statement which amounts to a confession on which you can rely . The defendant says that you should not rely upon his written witness statement since it was obtained in circumstances likely to render it unreliable .", "He says that he was tricked by the police into providing an account by them treating him as a witness when , in breach of the codes of practice laid down for the police to follow , he should first have been cautioned ; secondly , allowed access to a solicitor ; thirdly , had his interview tape - recorded ; and fourthly , should have been given suitable and effective , uninterrupted rest periods .", "The law is this , when considering his case , the question for you to consider is whether PERSON \u2019s witness statement is something you should take into account as evidence in his case or whether you should disregard it . The question is not whether you think that it is fair that he \u2019s being tried . If you think that the statement was or might have been obtained by something said or done which was likely to render it unreliable , you must disregard it , even if you think that it was or may have been true .", "Breach of the code , however , does not lead to the automatic rejection as evidence of a written statement made by a witness who is later made a defendant . If you are sure that , despite the breaches of the code , the statement was freely given in the sense that he would have said those things whether or not he was cautioned and even if all the rules in the code had been followed and that it was true , then you will take it into account when considering your verdicts in relation to Abdurahman .", "The prosecution say that , whatever breaches may have arisen in respect of the codes of practice which the police should obey , you can safely rely on the written witness statement made and signed by PERSON because he clearly adopted it in his interviews as \u2018 valuable information\u2019 which he was providing to the police . Indeed he made detailed corrections which reflected accurately what he always wished to say at a time when he had been cautioned and had a solicitor to advise him . PERSON has chosen , as is his right , not to tell you on oath why he said the things he did and what he would have done if arrested and cautioned . Do not speculate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the fourth applicant \u2019s silence at trial , the judge directed the jury as follows :", "\u201c The defendant , PERSON , as you know , has not given evidence before you . That is his right , he is entitled to remain silent and to require the prosecution to make you sure of his guilt . You must not assume that he is guilty of any offence because he has not given evidence .", "CARDINAL matters arise from his silence . First , you try this case according to the evidence and you will appreciate that PERSON has not given any evidence at this trial to undermine , contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution . Secondly , his silence at this trial may count against him . This is because you may draw the conclusion that he has not given evidence because he has no answer to the prosecution \u2019s case or none that would bear examination . If you do draw that conclusion , you must not convict him wholly or mainly on the strength of it but you may treat it as additional support for the prosecution case .", "However , you may only draw such a conclusion against him if you think it \u2019s a fair and proper conclusion , if you \u2019re satisfied CARDINAL things . First , that the prosecution \u2019s case is so strong that it clearly calls for an answer by him ; secondly , that the only sensible explanation for his silence is that he has no answer to the prosecution allegations or none that would bear examination .", "The defence , I remind you , invite you not to draw any conclusion from his silence on the basis that there was an admitted breach of the code of practice which is in place to protect defendants such that they say you should reject the prosecution submission but you can safely rely on anything said by him to the police in his long written statement . If you think that the breaches of the code amount to a good reason why you should not draw any conclusion from his silence , then do not do so . Otherwise , subject to what I have said , you may do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge reminded the jury of the prosecution case and the various elements of evidence against the fourth applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He explained :", "\u201c The prosecution rely on the witness statement he made and signed because they say it was adopted by him and that he \u2019s an intelligent young man , apparently a capable employee at a solicitor \u2019s firm . There is no reference , they point out , to the camera , the passport , and he lied over the date and destination of PERSON \u2019s departure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also reminded the jury of the fourth applicant \u2019s defence , set out in his witness statement , and of the submissions of his defence counsel at trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the fourth applicant was convicted of assisting PERSON ( count CARDINAL ) and of CARDINAL counts of failing to disclose information about the bombers after the attacks ( counts CARDINAL ) . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on count CARDINAL and DATE imprisonment on counts CARDINAL , to be served consecutively . Mr PERSON was convicted of assisting Mr PERSON and failing to disclose information about him after the bombings . He was acquitted of having had prior knowledge of the attacks . He , too , was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on each count , to be served consecutively .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant and his codefendants appealed against conviction and sentence to ORG . The fourth applicant argued that the trial judge had been wrong to admit the witness statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal against conviction . It expressed some concern about events at the police station but considered that the trial judge had not erred in admitting the impugned witness statement . Concerning the fact that the statement had been made in breach of the applicable code , the court said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The way the police behaved is undoubtedly troubling . The decision not to arrest and caution PERSON when the officers interviewing him believed that they had material which gave them reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had committed an offence was a clear and deliberate instruction to ignore the LAW . But at that stage the police dilemma is understandable . PERSON was providing information about PERSON which could have been of critical importance in securing his arrest , which was the priority at that time . It seems to us that the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that the prosecution had established that nothing was said or done which could undermine the reliability of the witness statement . He was entitled to take into account the fact that in the prepared statement he made after caution he asserted that he was seeking to give assistance to the police . That was repeated in the later interviews . He said nothing therefore to suggest that the circumstances were such as to render it likely that what he said was not reliable . It seems to us , therefore , that the judge was also entitled to conclude from all material that PERSON , with the help of legal advice , was repeating , subject as we have said to some corrections , what was in the witness statement as his account of the part such as it was , that he played in relation to PERSON in DATE after DATE . Further , given the appellant \u2019s adoption of that witness statement , we do not consider that the judge \u2019s decision to permit the statement to go before the jury in the exercise of his discretion under s. CARDINAL of the LAW can be said to be perverse or affected by any error of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the refusal of the trial judge to stay the trial on grounds of abuse of process , ORG explained :", "\u201c DATE . ... The main thrust of the argument on PERSON \u2019s behalf is that to prosecute on the basis of a statement that he gave when being treated as a witness is quite simply unfair . He was , it is said , effectively being told that he would not be prosecuted and gave assistance accordingly . The judge in our view rightly rejected this argument . There was no evidence that this appellant made his statement because he believed he was not going to be prosecuted . He gave no evidence to that effect ; and there is nothing in the interviews after he was arrested to suggest that that was the reason for his having made the witness statement . On the contrary , he made the witness statement because he wanted to assist the police . In this type of case , the court is only likely to conclude there has been an abuse of process if a defendant can establish that there has been an unequivocal representation by those responsible for the conduct of the prosecution and that the defendant has acted to his detriment : see R v PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr App R DATE , [ DATE ] PERSON , in particular at paragraph DATE . That was not the situation here . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the appeal against sentence , the court acknowledged that personal circumstances such as youth or vulnerability might be pertinent to sentence , but emphasised that this was not the case in respect of most of the appellants before it , including the fourth applicant . The court noted that the appellants had acted without any regard whatsoever to their public duty , and continued :", "\u201c None except PERSON made any disclosure at all until they were arrested ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In conclusion , ORG partly allowed the fourth applicant \u2019s appeal against sentence , on account of the help he had given to the police :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The assistance that [ the fourth applicant ] gave to PERSON was of the utmost significance . We conclude , however , that we can and should reflect the fact that , albeit only after he had been seen by the police , he gave at least some help and information ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It reduced the sentences in respect of count CARDINAL and counts CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment each . It noted that the conviction for failing to disclose information about Mr PERSON added little to the criminality involved in assisting him , so the sentence on that count was to be served concurrently . The remaining counts , involving his failure to disclose information about the other bombers , were clearly a separate offence that justified a consecutive sentence . The consequence was a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In dealing with PERSON appeal against sentence , the court noted the critical role that he had played in enabling Mr PERSON \u2019s escape and considered that it justified \u201c a very severe sentence which can not be mitigated as it was in the case of [ the fourth applicant ] by his giving any information at any stage to the police \u201d . Taking into account DATE spent under home arrest , he was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on the count of assisting PERSON . A DATE sentence for failing to disclose information about Mr PERSON was to be served concurrently .", "CARDINAL .
