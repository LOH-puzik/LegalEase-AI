The property was taken over by ORG for the purposes of agrarian reform pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the Decree on agrarian reform . On DATE an entry was made in the land register .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are the legal heirs of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a claim against ORG in ORG . They each sought MONEY ( ORG approximately CARDINAL ) in partial compensation for the nationalisation of the forest land which had been owned by their legal predecessor . They relied on section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE on the preservation of the national character of the country \u2019s strategic natural resources ( ustawa o zachowaniu narodowego charakteru strategicznych zasob\u00f3w naturalnych kraju \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the alternative , if the court ruled that they could not seek indemnity under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act on account of a lack of separate provisions determining the rules of indemnification , the applicants sought compensation for legislative omission ( zaniechanie legislacyjne ) . In respect of the latter , they relied on LAW and subsequently LAW . In their subsequent pleadings , the applicants noted that they were seeking compensation equal to PERCENT of the amount due and wished to determine the principle of compensation for the nationalised forest .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants\u2019 case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . It found it unnecessary to take evidence with a view to determining the size and value of the various plots making up the estate , since the claim was in principle unfounded . The court acknowledged that the applicants\u2019 predecessor in title had owned the ORG Ordynackie Koz\u0142\u00f3wka estate , that at least part of it was forest , and that it had been nationalised pursuant to the Decree on agrarian reform .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the compensation claim for legislative omission , the court held that the applicants could not rely on LAW since that provision had only entered into force on DATE , while their claim concerned the DATE Act . However , ORG was liable for damage caused by legislative omission which had occurred after the entry into force of the LAW on DATE . LAW had entered into force after DATE and , accordingly , the applicants\u2019 claim for legislative omission could be based on LAW ( in the version applicable prior to DATE ) in conjunction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court held that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act could not constitute the basis of a compensation claim for legislative omission . It held that the provision was of a declaratory nature , in which the legislature had announced that persons who had been wronged in connection with the taking away of their property should have received some indemnity . That declaration had to be fulfilled in a separate statute specifying the amount of indemnity , the manner of calculation and the possible limitations . According to the court , the principal purpose of LAW was to preserve the national character of the country \u2019s strategic natural resources , including those which in the past had been taken by the ORG to the detriment of the owners . The DATE Act signalled the need to regulate the question of indemnities to former owners , but did not regulate it itself and left it to the legislature to decide subsequently . Furthermore , section DATE CARDINAL Act was of a very general nature . It did not specify the manner of calculating an indemnity , the amount , the possible limitations or the conditions to be fulfilled by claimants . In this connection the court held that it could not replace the legislature and encroach on its competences .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that there were various groups of persons whose properties had been nationalised without just or any compensation during the period of the Polish GPE . The legislature had decided to establish the rules and procedure for the payment of compensation to some of those groups , while in respect of others it had enacted no such regulations . An example of the first was the LAW of DATE on the realisation of the right to indemnity for property left beyond the present borders of the NORP State ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which provided that LOC claimants were entitled to compensation set at PERCENT of the value of their original LOC property . The legislature had entitled that group of persons to compensation and specified the procedure applicable to such claims .", "CARDINAL . The court noted , however , that the legislature had not to date enacted any rules on indemnifying persons who had been wronged on account of the Decree on agrarian reform or the Decree on the nationalisation of certain forests . It emphasised that , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Decree on agrarian reform , ownership of all the property referred to in subsections ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) had been immediately transferred to ORG without any compensation . The Decree on the nationalisation of certain forests did not provide for any compensation either . Consequently , there remained many groups of persons who had been wronged by the taking away of their property and the question of compensating them remained unresolved .", "CARDINAL . The court held that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act contained the legislature \u2019s declaration that it intended to regulate the question of indemnities , inter alia , to persons who had lost their forests . In the DATE Act the legislature had only determined that there would be no restitution in natura of , inter alia , lost forests . However , the question of indemnities remained to be determined by the legislature . The court held that section DATE CARDINAL Act could not be interpreted as a basis of a direct claim for indemnity . The provision did not specify the amount of indemnity or the applicable conditions , and in that respect the court could not substitute the legislature , who had the exclusive competence to create legal norms .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They argued , inter alia , that the firstinstance court had erroneously interpreted section CARDINAL of the DATE Act by holding that the provision could not constitute the basis of a claim for indemnity . They further maintained that the court had wrongly interpreted the same provision in conjunction with LAW and LAW by holding that the legislature had not perpetrated a legislative omission consisting of a failure to enact provisions regulating the payment of indemnities . The applicants invoked the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . PERSON , ECHR CARDINALV ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal , concurring with ORG interpretation of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that a claim ( roszczenie ) was a right , based in law , to demand that a particular person act in a specific manner . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act did not contain sufficient normative content to consider that it established a claim in that sense . Nor did it specify the subjective and objective scope of the rights of former owners , the specific nature of the claim , the exact meaning of the term \u201c loss of property \u201d or whether indemnity should be equal to whole or part of the value of the nationalised property . Accordingly , it could not be considered that section DATE CARDINAL Act constituted a norm imposing an absolute obligation on ORG to act in a specific manner , namely to pay a specific amount of money to an individually designated subject . ORG considered that determination of the rules concerning the ORG \u2019s liability required further statutory specification of the conditions for an effective claim than that which had been stipulated in section DATE CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . ORG concurred with ORG that section DATE CARDINAL Act was a declaratory provision ( przepis o charakterze blankietowym ) , reflecting the legislature \u2019s general assumptions . The provision did not specify the amount of indemnity or the eligibility conditions , and a court could not substitute the legislature in that respect . In ORG view , a certain confirmation of the ORG \u2019s liability towards former owners who had lost ownership of the properties referred to in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , without specifying the essential elements of that liability , was devoid of any protective significance ( znaczenie gwarancyjne ) and , as such , did not have legal effect .", "CARDINAL . There was no doubt for ORG that , prior to the entry into force of section DATE CARDINAL Act , persons who had lost property pursuant to the Decree on agrarian reform or on the basis of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Decree on the nationalisation of certain forests , had had no right to compensation in respect of the loss of their property because the abovementioned decrees did not establish that right . Nor did they establish the right to be compensated for the loss of property in any other form . Furthermore , the decrees at issue had not been declared unconstitutional . Thus , the taking of property by the ORG on the basis of the impugned decrees was not unlawful and could not be considered a tort .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further concurred with ORG that the principal purpose of the DATE Act was to prevent privatisation of the strategic resources of the country ( section CARDINAL ) and not establish claims for the loss of property .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further held that there had been no legislative omission in the applicants\u2019 case . In its view , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act did not contain even a promise of conferring a right to claim for indemnity on specific categories of subjects , including those who had lost forest land as a result of the operation of the Decree on agrarian reform . The provision was an expression of political premise , and its purpose was not to confer rights on specifically designated persons in a clear and unconditional manner . A simple declaration that a certain regulation would be enacted on an unspecified future date was not sufficient to conclude that the obligation to legislate had been breached . ORG noted that the legislature \u2019s obligation to enact a statute had to be expressed in another statute in an unequivocal manner , excluding the possibility of this being the result of judicial interpretation . Having regard to the purpose of the DATE Act , ORG noted that the legislature had had no intention of creating an obligation to enact a statute on the indemnification of persons who had lost property as a result of the nationalisation decrees . The legislature simply provided for such a possibility in a statute to be enacted on an unspecified future date .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a cassation appeal . Firstly , they argued that ORG had wrongly interpreted section DATE CARDINAL Act in conjunction with section CARDINAL ) of LAW . They submitted that the CARDINAL provisions constituted the basis of ORG obligation to compensate for the loss of forest land . Secondly , they argued that the court had erroneously interpreted section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act in conjunction with LAW and LAW by holding that the legislature had not perpetrated a legislative omission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG cassation appeal ( case no . I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of ORG judgment reads :", "\u201c With regard to the first of the appellants\u2019 arguments , it should be pointed out that in legal science a claim ( roszczenie ) is regarded as CARDINAL of the normative forms of a subjective right ( prawo podmiotowe ) , consisting of the possibility of demanding a specific act from a specific person . A claim is characterised , on the one hand , by the existence of an entitlement specified with regard to its content and subject and , on the other hand , by the directly assigned to it obligation of another subject . In other words , the equivalent of an entitlement is an obligation of a specific person to act in a specific manner , i.e. to undertake a specific action or to refrain from it ...", "The appellants ... are aiming to demonstrate that the regulation contained in section DATE CARDINAL Act create for them , as successors of the former owner of forests ... , claims for indemnity . LAW recognises inter alia , ORG forests as the country \u2019s strategic national resources , and LAW stipulates that the national resources listed in CARDINAL and owned by ORG are not subject to change of ownership , with the exception of provisions contained in particular statutes . Section DATE CARDINAL Act stipulates that claims of natural persons , former owners or their successors , in respect of loss of ownership of the resources listed in section CARDINAL , shall be satisfied in the form of indemnities ( rekompensaty ) paid from the ORG budget on the basis of separate provisions .", "As has been already noted by ORG ... it is apparent from the abovementioned CARDINAL LAW and the reasons for the relevant bill that the legislature \u2019s general premise was not to effect ( niedokonywanie ) changes of ownership in respect of the country \u2019s strategic national resources . When interpreting the purpose of LAW , it should be remembered that the relevant bill was being prepared in parallel with LAW DATE , which was [ successfully ] vetoed by the President of the Republic ....", "Having regard to the commonly accepted understanding of a claim in legal science , it is necessary to agree with ORG assessment that the regulation contained in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act does not entitle former owners or their successors to claim for indemnity in respect of loss of ownership of the resources listed in section CARDINAL of the Act ... [ The appellants ] correctly point out that CARDINAL legal provision may contain one , CARDINAL or more norms , but it may also contain only part of a norm . Such a specific relationship between a legal provision and a legal norm does not , however , result in it being possible to derive from section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act a claim for indemnity , by supplementing this legal provision , by analogy , with the regulation contained in the LAW on the realisation of the right to indemnity for property left beyond the present borders of the NORP State , which concerns an entirely different matter . The appellants have omitted to note that the legislature , while referring in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act to the satisfying of claims of former owners or their successors , has expressly stipulated that this would be done on the basis of separate provisions , i.e. provisions which were yet to be enacted . In addition , neither the content of the former owners or their ORG entitlement nor the content of ORG ( the debtor \u2019s ) obligation was sufficiently specified in section CARDINAL of the LAW . ORG has already adopted an analogous position in this regard in its judgment of DATE ( case no . I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , stating that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act does not allow for such a specification of the norm of substantive law contained in it , which would determine in detail the content of a specific addressee \u2019s entitlements and obligations . Such a position was also approved by ORG in the course of examining cassation appeals in cases concerning claims for compensation under section DATE CARDINAL Act initiated in administrative proceedings ( judgments of CARDINAL DATE , case no . I OSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , case no . I OSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , case no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , case no . I OSK DATE ) .", "The arguments drawn by the appellants from ORG rulings ... do not lead to opposite conclusions ... In the rulings referred to , ORG emphasised that the conferring of a [ right to ] claim by the legislature does not have to be formulated expressis verbis in a legal provision ; however , it is necessary to indicate [ there ] the essential elements indispensable for constructing a claim . Therefore , a claim could be derived from a given norm if it appears from its content that a specific obligation imposed on one party corresponds to an entitlement of another party to demand its implementation .", "Such essential elements , allowing a claim for indemnity to be constructed , are missing from the content of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "With regard to the second of the appellants\u2019 arguments , it should be noted that in accordance with the resolution of ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , of CARDINAL DATE [ case no . ] III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , ORG is liable for damage caused by non - enactment of a normative act , when a duty to enact it arose after the entry into force of LAW . LAW in the version [ applicable ] prior to DATE ... constitutes the basis of civil liability for legislative omissions , which began after the LAW \u2019s entry into force [ CARDINAL DATE ] , but before DATE , i.e. before the entry into force of the statute amending [ LAW ] of DATE . Article CARDINAL of LAW in the current version and LAW are not applicable to a situation where the state of legislative omission arose before DATE , even if the damage caused by this omission was sustained after that date . ... A detailed regulation governing the ORG \u2019s liability for its law - making activities was only enacted in DATE of LAW , but these rules could already be considered to be relevant from the date of the LAW \u2019s entry into force , since from that moment the ORG \u2019s liability for legislative omission had been recognised .", "In its resolution of DATE ( case no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG explained that ORG civil liability for legislative omission would only arise when a normative act , whose enactment was obligatory under the law , i.e. the LAW or a statute , was not enacted . The non - enactment of a statute where another statute provides for its enactment could also be regarded as [ legislative ] omission , since the legislature can undertake in CARDINAL statute to enact another statute . However , in order to assume that the legislature made such an undertaking , and not only provided for the possibility of regulating a certain matter in another statute , the obligation to enact that statute has to be expressed in an explicit manner , excluding the possibility of it only being deduced by means of judicial interpretation ; [ such a course of action ] would have constituted an encroachment by the judiciary on the competences reserved to the legislature .", "In the above - mentioned judgment of DATE ( case no . I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG did not agree with that suggestion , emphasising that the interpretation of legal norms by the courts was one of the basic functions bestowed on the judiciary . Accordingly , it accepted that a court could assess , applying the necessary means of interpretation , whether a statute contained an explicit obligation to enact another statute . A contrary proposition ... would have amounted to approval of the legislature \u2019s method of conferring virtual entitlements on citizens , even with a premise accepted in advance that it would be impossible to realise those entitlements , while approving , at the same time , the lack of legal basis for civil liability related to damage caused by such acts of the legislature .", "There is no doubt that a court of law , in carrying out its adjudicatory functions , interprets provisions of the law ; however , the issue is that this can not be a law - making interpretation . In the process of interpretation a court has to respect the principle , expressed in LAW , of separation of and balance between the legislative , executive and judicial powers on which the system of government of GPE is based . According to the adjudicating bench of ORG , it is the only manner ... of reading the assertion in the reasoning for the [ ORG ] resolution of DATE ( case no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that the obligation to enact a statute has to be expressed in an explicit manner , excluding the possibility of it being deduced by means of judicial interpretation . ORG in the present composition shares the view that for liability for legislative omission to arise , it is first necessary to establish that an obligation ... to enact a normative act was formulated in an explicit and specific manner . The contrary perspective on this issue could lead to an inadmissible interference by the judiciary with the competences reserved to the legislature . ORG took the same view , inter alia , in the judgments of CARDINAL DATE , case no . III CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , DATE , case no . I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... and QUANTITY DATE , case no . II CSK DATE ... , and [ this view ] was also approved by legal science .", "There is also agreement in legal science that a provision of the law containing an obligation to enact a normative act has to specify the essential content of such an act in such a way to allow the existence and scope of damage caused by an omission to be determined . In other words , it should be possible to establish the content of a nonenacted normative act without encroaching on the other State organs\u2019 legislative powers . A court of law can not make suppositions as to the possible content of a nonenacted normative act , being guided by its own axiological assumptions . ...", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , prescribing that claims of former owners or their successors shall be satisfied in the form of indemnities ( rekompensata ) paid from the ORG budget on the basis of separate provisions , does not stipulate to a sufficient degree the content of the said \u201c separate provisions \u201d . The legislature did not indicate the subjective scope of the normative act , which were to prescribe the rules of indemnification , the conditions to be fulfilled by persons eligible to receive an indemnity , or the manner of determining the amount of those benefits . These shortcomings can not be DATE as asserted by the appellants DATE complemented by the application of LAW , because it is not in the court \u2019s sphere of activity to independently indicate the object and scope of what should have been found in a non - enacted normative act .", "Therefore , it has to be accepted that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act is a declaratory provision ( przepis blankietowy ) , which contains only the legislature \u2019s declaration concerning the future regulation of indemnities in a statute to be enacted later , without being bound by the date of its enactment . Accordingly , non - enactment of a normative act , referred to in this provision , does not warrant ORG liability for legislative omission ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a constitutional complaint . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to consider it as it had been lodged out of time . On DATE the court dismissed an interlocutory appeal by the applicants .", "CARDINAL .

This provision indicates precisely the subject of an obligation , i.e. ORG , but does not prescribe the addressees of an entitlement . Prima facie , it seems that section CARDINAL expressly prescribes that a possible [ right to ] claim for indemnity was conferred on the persons referred to in this provision , i.e. natural persons , former owners , or their successors , of resources comprising lost ORG forests . However , the legislature did not specify more precisely the category of entitled persons , in particular , by stipulating whether it concerns all owners of the forests and their successors , which , regardless of the moment in time , of the legal basis and other circumstances ( e.g. the size of the property , the nationality of the owners , etc . ) were transferred to the ORG . It was not specified whether it concerns an unlawful or lawful taking of these resources , and then , in respect of the latter category of persons , this provision would be of a quasi - restitution nature .", "The concept of a claim ... concerns a situation in which a norm , arising from binding legal provisions , confers on an entitled subject the right to demand a specific act from the obliged subject , [ which is ] secured by the possibility of it being enforced . Consequently , it should be accepted that the concept of a claim of natural persons , former owners , or their successors , in respect of loss of the resources listed in section CARDINAL [ of the CARDINAL Act ] could only encompass only those , who , on the date of the statute \u2019s entry into force , had the right to claim in respect of the loss of those resources . This means that , in fact , this provision merely changes the content of previous claims of former owners or their successors , in that it replaces the previous compensation claims against ORG by a claim for indemnity . However , such a purpose of the regulation should be excluded , since LAW was enacted at a time when [ ORG ] was working in parallel on LAW . The beneficiaries of the indemnity referred to in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act were to be persons , who in the period preceding the enactment of LAW , asserted their restitution demands vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG in respect of the ORG \u2019s taking away \u2013 including by lawful means \u2013 of forests , [ demands ] which could not have been satisfied in the framework of the existing provisions . The term \u201c claim \u201d employed in section DATE CARDINAL Act does not then fully correspond to the accepted meaning of that term , because it comprises in fact , without further specification , a category of natural persons asserting vis - \u00e0 - vis the legislature their demands in respect of loss of ownership of the resources prescribed in section CARDINAL [ of LAW ] , and not persons who were conferred specific claims by the legal system subsisting previously .", "Moreover , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act simply prescribes that a claim comprises a benefit in a pecuniary form \u2013 an indemnity DATE which was to be paid from the ORG budget ; however , the scope of this benefit has not been further specified . LAW does not contain a definition of the term \u201c indemnity \u201d ( rekompensata ) , it only determines that it is a pecuniary benefit . LAW does not define this term either . Its analysis in the previous regulations concerning indemnities \u2013 included in ... LAW DATE Act on the realisation of the right to indemnity for property left beyond the present borders of the NORP State \u2013 leads to the conclusion that the legislature , in conferring a subjective right of this kind , does so in a comprehensive manner , specifying precisely not only the category of entitled persons , but also the amount of indemnity due . With regard to this kind of benefits , the legislature had further prescribed a particular procedure for determining eligibility for indemnities , fixed their amount , [ as well as set ] time - limits for bringing claims , payment of indemnities , the statute of limitations and the extinguishment of such claims , and established a specific indemnity fund . An indemnity represented a fraction , determined arbitrarily by the legislature , of the full compensation . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act does not comprise any of these elements .", "[ Legislative omission : ]", "The essence of the legal issue comes down , however , to ascertaining whether , despite these gaps in the construction of a claim , it could be considered that section DATE establishes a subjective right , in assuming that this provision also establishes the legislature \u2019s obligation to enact separate provisions complementing the missing elements of the subjective right in issue . In such cases , a failure by the legislature to execute this obligation could give rise to ORG liability for legislative omission , since it was accepted in ORG case - law that enactment of incomplete or fragmentary [ legislative ] solutions could give rise to a finding of legislative omission .... Where [ the legislature ] creates a subjective right with deficient characteristics , civil liability for legislative omission becomes a form of protecting this right , which can not be fully or at all realised .", "The ORG \u2019s civil liability for legislative omission DATE both on the basis of the currently applicable LAW and , on the basis of LAW of the [ Civil Code ] in conjunction with LAW ... applicable to the case in issue \u2013 can arise where there is a specific obligation to enact a normative act under [ the legal ] provisions . In such a case , it is also required that a legal provision imposing an obligation to enact an appropriate regulation indicated a certain minimal content of the subjective right , and in particular , persons entitled to bring a claim and persons obliged to execute a deed constituting the content of a claim , as well as its scope . The textual and logical interpretation of LAW does not lead to the conclusion that this provision comprised an obligation to enact specific provisions concerning indemnities since it employed a formulation that claims of natural persons referred to in it were to be \u201c satisfied in the form of indemnities paid from the ORG budget on the basis of separate provisions \u201d . This provision does not contain either a statutory authorisation to enact appropriate executive regulations prescribing the scope of that regulation .", "ORG case - law admitted the possibility of the ORG \u2019s civil liability for legislative omission consisting of a failure to enact a statute where another statute provided for an obligation to this effect ( resolution of DATE , case no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ...", "[ With regard to the obligation to enact a specific statute ] ... It can not be accepted that such a situation arose with regard to an obligation to enact separate provisions , which are referred to in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . As ORG held in its judgments of DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... and I PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL and I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , an interpretation in this context can not be a law - making interpretation , since it has to respect the principle , expressed in LAW , of separation of and balance between the legislative , executive and judicial powers on which the system of government of GPE is based ... In cases concerning compensation for legislative omission the courts can not ascertain the content of non - enacted provisions ; in order to accept the existence of a legislative obligation whose nonexecution would result in the ORG \u2019s civil liability , it is necessary that the provision imposing an obligation to enact another legal regulation indicated its minimal content with such a degree to allow the scope of the ORG \u2019s obligation to compensate to be determined . Such a situation does not arise in respect of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , this provision stipulating that only separate provisions enacted at a future date were to determine the content of the subjective right in the form of a claim for indemnity .", "The possibility of ascertaining the existence of an obligation to enact a normative act was also accepted in ORG case - law , where such an obligation has not been formulated expressis verbis in the [ legal ] provisions , and where the rights of individuals \u2013 conferred in a self - evident and unconditional manner \u2013 could not be realised as a result of a failure to enact an appropriate normative act ... However , even in such cases provisions conferring those rights have to prescribe the essential characteristics of the latter . The acceptance of the ORG \u2019s hypothetical legislative omission DATE concerning subjective rights with an undefined content or an unclearly determined category of entitled persons DATE would result in the ORG \u2019s civil liability in respect of legislative omission also being illusory . The courts could not decide who was entitled to bring a claim for compensation or about the amount without entering into the law - making role . It should be remembered in this context that the rules concerning civil liability , including for legislative omission , serve to protect the existing subjective rights , and are not the basis for creating these rights or specifying their scope . From this standpoint too , section DATE CARDINAL Act does not prescribe in a sufficient manner the content of a subjective right in the form of a claim , in particular with regard to the category of entitled persons and the amount of compensation .", "The foregoing considerations warrant the conclusion that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act does not contain a legal norm giving rise to specific rights or obligations comprising the content of a subjective right in the form of a claim , nor does it contain a norm imposing an obligation to enact provisions , referred to in it , concerning indemnities . Therefore , it should be concurred that this provision is of a declaratory nature , it solely contains a proclamation of the legislature \u2019s intention as to the means of satisfying in the future , on the basis of separate provisions , claims asserted against ORG by owners ( natural persons ) of forests or their successors in respect of loss of ownership ... It should also be remembered that the provisions of LAW originated from a civic bill ( projekt obywatelski ) , which was debated [ in ORG ] in parallel with LAW , and the latter were to prescribe the right to indemnity characterised as a subjective right in the form of a claim . LAW alone , without LAW Bill \u2013 as evidenced by the analysis of the legislative process DATE was not to give rise to any financial obligations [ for the ORG ] or to determine solutions concerning indemnities . The purpose of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW was only to express the legislature \u2019s intention that the future realisation of restitution demands of former owners or their successors , accomplished on the basis of separate provisions , took the form of indemnities , and so that it was carried out while preserving the resources prescribed in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW , without effecting changes of ownership , as stated in LAW CARDINAL of the same Act ... The object of the regulation in the DATE Act also points out to a limited meaning of the provision in issue ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In this judgment , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The content of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act does not comprise formulations which could be regarded as grounds for the claimant \u2019s claim for indemnity in respect of forest land taken over by ORG . ... The textual , logical and systemic interpretation of section DATE CARDINAL Act leads to the conclusion that this provision does not confer a subjective right on the relevant persons , from which it would result an entitlement to demand from ORG a specific act and the possibility of enforcing it . There is no regulation in LAW on the right to indemnity . The formulations employed in section DATE CARDINAL Act are of a declaratory nature , since the claims referred to in it should be satisfied in the future , as is evidenced by the phrase \u201c shall be satisfied \u201d , and the form of satisfying them ( those claims ) are indemnities \u201c to be paid \u201d from the ORG budget , and the basis for their payment will be in separate provisions . Therefore , the term \u201c claims \u201d employed in this provision , can not be equated with a \u201c claim \u201d as understood in the civil law . It should be pointed out that the purpose of LAW , as evidenced by the reasons for the bill , was to guarantee stability of ownership with regard to the country \u2019s strategic natural resources . In parallel with this LAW , a restitution bill was being prepared , the latter being prompted by the restitution demands of persons who lost their property in the process of nationalisation , including the property referred to in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW ; [ it ] was to prescribe the right to indemnity . However , LAW has not been enacted . It can not be concluded that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act concerns solely the claims of those persons who asserted them prior to the enactment of the CARDINAL Act ; LAW does not properly indicate the category of eligible persons . There are no grounds to equate indemnity with compensation ...", "There is reference in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act to future indemnification , but the indemnity is not specified with regard to an eligible subject , its nature or the amount . The plaintiff \u2019s claim concerns compensation for damage caused by legislative omission , and thus the failure to have a claim due to her satisfied . Therefore , the lack of necessary elements of a claim in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act can not be supplemented with reference to the amount of a benefit ( indemnity ) , if a [ right to ] claim has not been conferred , regardless of the possibility that a court would determine the scope of indemnity on the basis of the rules laid down in LAW and regardless of the defendant \u2019s obligation to compensate ...", "The content of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , analysed in accordance with the rules of textual , logical and systemic interpretation leads to the conclusion that it does not contain an obligation to enact specific provisions concerning indemnities , the eligible subjects and the entity responsible for indemnification . It ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) does not indicate the subjective scope of the future normative act , which was to prescribe the rules of indemnification , the criteria to be fulfilled by the eligible persons and the means of determining the amount of benefits . It is not feasible that these deficiencies would be fulfilled in by a court alone ... It should be emphasised that the rules of civil liability , including for legislative omission , were a means of protecting the existing subjective rights , and not the source of their creation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The appellant is not right [ in saying ] that the interpretation of section DATE CARDINAL Act and Article CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with LAW does not respect the protection of property as provided by these regulations and the relevant case - law .
