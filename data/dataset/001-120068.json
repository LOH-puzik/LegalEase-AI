The ruling stated , in particular , that the impugned legal provisions were , in the circumstances , necessary and justified . The court reached the following conclusions regarding the legitimate aims and necessity of the legislation in question :", "\u201c ... At the same time the interest in fighting terrorism , and in preventing terrorism in general and specific terms and providing redress for the effects of terrorist acts , coupled with the risk of mass disorder , clashes between different ethnic groups and aggression by DATE those involved in terrorist activity against the population at large and law - enforcement officials , and lastly the threat to human life and limb , may , in a given historical context , justify the establishment of a particular legal regime , such as that provided for by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , governing the burial of persons who escape prosecution in connection with terrorist activity because of their death as a result of the interception of a terrorist act ... Those provisions are logically connected to the provisions of paragraph LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG of ORG on combating terrorism through culture , dated DATE , in which it was stressed that extremist interpretations of elements of a particular culture or religion , such as heroic martyrdom , self - sacrifice , apocalypse or holy war , as well as secular ideologies ( nationalist or revolutionary ) could also be used for the justification of terrorist acts .", "CARDINAL .

The ruling further noted that the application of the measures prescribed in the legislation concerned could be regarded as justified if proper procedural safeguards , such as effective judicial review , were in place to protect individuals from arbitrariness . The court noted that ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for such review ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the court upheld the impugned provisions as being in conformity with the LAW but at the same time interpreted them as requiring that the authorities not bury bodies unless a court confirmed the competent authority \u2019s decision . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ... The constitutional and legal meaning of the existing norms presupposes the possibility of bringing court proceedings to challenge a decision to discontinue , on account of the deaths of the suspects , a criminal case against or prosecution of participants in a terrorist act . Accordingly , they also presuppose an obligation on the court \u2019s part to examine the substance of the complaint , that is , to verify the lawfulness and well - foundedness of the decision and the conclusions therein as regards the participation of the persons concerned in a terrorist act , and to establish the absence of grounds for rehabilitating [ the suspects ] and discontinuing the criminal case . They thus entail an examination of the lawfulness of the application of the aforementioned restrictive measures . Until the entry into force of the court judgment the deceased \u2019s remains can not be buried ; the relevant ORG bodies and officials must take all necessary measures to ensure that the bodies are disposed of in accordance with custom and tradition , in particular through the burial of the remains in the ground ... or by [ cremation ] , individually , if possible , and to ensure compliance prior thereto with the requirements concerning the identification of the deceased ... the time , location and cause of death . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a separate opinion in which he agreed that the impugned provisions were in conformity with the LAW but held a different view as to how they should be interpreted .

The burial must take place with the participation of the relatives , in accordance with custom and tradition and with humanitarian respect for the dead . The administrative authorities of a ORG governed by the rule of law must respect the cultural values of a multiethnic society transmitted from generation to generation . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a dissenting opinion in which he described the legislation in question as incompatible with the LAW . In particular , he noted :", "\u201c ... The impugned norms , banning the return of the deceased \u2019s bodies to their relatives and providing for their anonymous burial , are , in our view , absolutely immoral and reflect the most uncivilised , barbaric and base views of previous generations . ...", "The right of every person to be buried in a dignified manner in accordance with the traditions and customs of his family hardly requires special justification or even to be secured in written form in law . This right is clearly self - evident and stems from human nature as , perhaps , no other natural right .

The court concluded that the above - mentioned statutory provisions were unconstitutional , in so far as they provided for a possibility of terminating a criminal case owing to the death of a suspect ( or an accused person ) without obtaining the consent of that person \u2019s close relatives . The court noted , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... the respect for fundamental procedural guarantees of individual rights , including the presumption of innocence , must be secured also in resolving the question concerning the termination of a criminal case with reference to non - rehabilitating circumstances .

By this logic , the person in question , without the adoption or entry into force of any verdict , is declared guilty , and this constitutes a breach by the ORG of its duty to secure the judicial protection of that person \u2019s honour , dignity and good name protected by [ various provisions of ] ... the LAW , and as regards the persons whose interests may be affected by this decision \u2013 it constitutes a breach of their right of access to a court ...", "... [ in other words , ] the termination of a criminal case with reference to nonrehabilitating circumstances in general is possible only if the rights of the participants in the criminal proceedings are respected , which means , in particular , that there is a need to secure the consent of the suspect ( or the accused person ) to take [ such decision ] ...", "... If , however , the person in question objects to [ such a decision ] , he must be entitled to have the case against him proceed to the stage of its examination by the trial court ...", "[ The court , having analysed the applicable domestic provisions , concludes that ] LAW does not provide that [ the relatives of the deceased person in respect of whom the criminal case was discontinued ] have any rights which would allow them to protect the rights of their deceased formerly accused relative . Since the interested persons , and first of all the close relatives of the deceased , are not allowed to take part in the proceedings , the [ relevant ] procedural decisions ... are taken by an investigator or a court DATE without participation of the defence ...", "Such limitations do not have an objective or reasonable justification and entail a breach of [ the constitutional rights of the persons in question ] ...", "[ The court further decides that ] the protection of the rights and legal interests of the close relatives of the deceased person ... aimed at his or her rehabilitation should take place by the provision to them of the necessary legal status and the resulting legal rights within the framework of the criminal proceedings ...", "[ The court concludes that the rights provided for by LAW were insufficient to guarantee an adequate level of judicial protection to the interested persons ... ]", "[ Thus , in cases where ] the close relatives object to the discontinuance of the proceedings owing to the death of the formerly suspected or accused person , the competent investigative body or the court should proceed with the examination of the case .
