The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Before the Second World War the applicant 's mother occupied a dwelling house ( \u201c the house \u201d ) on a plot of land measuring QUANTITY ( \u201c the plot \u201d ) in the centre of the tourist resort of GPE on LOC coast . Following the NORP occupation of GPE in DATE , the land was nationalised and the house was demolished in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , by reference to ORG , decided to \u201c restore the property rights \u201d of the applicant and her sister in regard to their late mother 's land . No form of restitution was specified in the decision .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE was not implemented as no land was returned and no compensation was offered . In DATE the applicant brought a court action against the local authority , claiming that the plot should have been returned to her and her sister . ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE dismissed the applicant 's action . By reference to LAW ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) , the court held that the applicant was not entitled to recover the plot , but that she should have been offered an alternative parcel in compensation as required by the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , stating that the plot had to be returned to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG . ORG found that the decision of ORG of DATE did not comply with LAW as the local authority had not decided whether land or money and , in either case , which land or what amount of money should have been offered to the applicant as a compensation . ORG held that the local authority had to resolve these questions . The court required the administration of GPE to \u201c adopt , by DATE , a decision on the request by ORG to restore her property rights in regard to the plot of land ( iki DATE m. bir\u017eelio QUANTITY priimti sprendim\u0105 pagal PERSON pra\u0161ym\u0105 d\u0117l nuosavyb\u0117s teis\u0117s \u012f \u017eem\u0117s sklyp\u0105 atstatymo ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , no such decision was taken as the applicant refused an alternative parcel of land in another area of GPE . The applicant 's sister accepted an alternative parcel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained an execution warrant for the judgment of DATE . She put the matter in the hands of bailiffs who were unable to execute the warrant against the county administration . The executive authorities took no further decision as the applicant had again refused an alternative parcel of land .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the GPE Governor stated that the applicant had misinterpreted the judgment of DATE . In the Governor 's opinion , ORG had only required the county administration to adopt a decision in accordance with ORG . As the applicant had no buildings or other property on the plot , she was not entitled to its return . The Governor requested the applicant to approach planners at ORG to choose an alternative parcel . He warned her that a different parcel would be allotted without her consent in order to comply with the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the Prime Minister , stating that she had been entitled to the plot , that the alternative parcels offered by the local authority were located in the outskirts of GPE , and that their value was thus not equivalent to the plot in the centre of town .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Director of ORG of the Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry stated that on DATE ORG had decided to restore the applicant 's property rights notwithstanding the fact that there had been a lack of relevant documentation proving her late mother 's ownership of the plot . Moreover , the Director stated that from the decision of DATE it was \u201c unclear in respect of which owner or land the property rights were restored [ ; ] the form of the restitution of property was also unclear ... \u201d . The Director requested PERSON to re - examine the lawfulness of the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the applicant was proposed and refused CARDINAL offers by GPE for alternative parcels of land in various areas of GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the executive authorities informed the applicant that she had not proved her mother 's ownership of the original plot in accordance with the governmental instructions of DATE , i.e. she had not submitted the original papers confirming the purchase of the plot by her mother , or a court decision proving ownership . The executive authorities held that they could not proceed with a decision on compensation until the applicant presented these papers .", "CARDINAL . The Restitution of Property Act ( Nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 ... atk\u016brimo \u012fstatymas ) ( of DATE , amended on numerous occasions ) provides for CARDINAL forms of restitution : CARDINAL ) the return of the property in certain circumstances , PERSON ) compensation in other cases ( compensation can be made in land or money ) .", "On DATE ORG examined the issue of compatibility of the LAW with the domestic laws on restitution of property rights . In its decision ORG held inter alia that possessions which had been nationalised by the NORP authorities since DATE should be considered as \u201c property under the de facto control of the ORG \u201d . ORG also stated : \u201c The rights of a former owner to particular property have not been restored until the property is returned or appropriate compensation is afforded . The law does not itself provide any rights while it is not applied to a concrete person in respect of a specific property item . In this situation the decision of a competent authority to return the property or to compensate therefor has such a legal effect that only from that moment does the former owner obtain property rights to a specific property item . \u201d ORG also held that fair compensation for property which could not be returned was compatible with the principle of the protection of property .", "In decisions of DATE and DATE the ORG emphasised that the notion of restitution of property rights in GPE essentially denoted partial reparation . In this respect ORG noted that the authorities of GPE as a re - established ORG in DATE were not responsible for the NORP occupation DATE , nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation . ORG held that since DATE many private persons had bought , in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time , various property items which had been previously nationalised . The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible , and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners , but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts .", "On DATE ORG also said that the choice by ORG partial reparation principle was influenced by the difficult political and social conditions in that \u201c new generations had grown , new proprietary and other socio - economic relations had been formed during DATE of occupation , which could not be ignored in deciding the question of restitution of property \u201d .", "On DATE ORG ruled that a person who qualifies for compensation for property which can not be returned is entitled to choose the form of compensation ( land or money ) by giving written permission for the authorities to proceed with the decision . ORG also held that the executive authorities have discretion to decide on appropriate compensation in each case , but that a person is entitled to contest that compensation by way of a court action .", "Under LAW ( all versions until DATE ) , the authorities were required to obtain the written permission of the person concerned before they determined the actual compensation for the property which could not be returned .", "Pursuant to the version of ORG as amended from DATE , the executive authorities are now entitled to decide the question of compensation without the person 's approval . That decision can be appealed to a court in accordance with the procedure established in LAW . No stamp duty is required to file such an action .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a court judgment which has come into force is binding and must be executed .", "The Code of Civil Procedure nonetheless requires the individual concerned to obtain an execution warrant ( vykdomasis ra\u0161tas ) from the court which has delivered the final judgment ; the execution warrant must be presented to bailiffs for immediate enforcement ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .
