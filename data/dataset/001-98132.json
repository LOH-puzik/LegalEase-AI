The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of murder by ORG , sitting as an assize court , and sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( PERSON ) against the local electoral register ( NORP ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , complaining that his name had not been entered in the register although he met the general conditions such as minimum age , citizenship and residence in the community . He alleged that his exclusion from the electoral register under LAW of LAW ( Nationalratswahlordnung ) was unlawful as this provision was unconstitutional . He invoked , inter alia , LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE - beh\u00f6rde ) dismissed the appeal . It found that ORG had acted correctly in refusing to enter the applicant 's name in the electoral register and that it was not the task of these authorities to express a position on the alleged unconstitutionality of the law applied .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant requested ORG to grant him legal aid to lodge a complaint with that court against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant legal aid as it found that the applicant 's complaint lacked any prospect of success .

Article CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the time of the events and in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG is elected by the nation in accordance with the principles of proportional representation on the basis of an equal , direct , secret and personal vote for men and women who by the date of the election have completed DATE .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) All men and women who on the date of the election are in possession of NORP nationality and have completed DATE shall be eligible for election .", "( CARDINAL ) DATE Forfeiture of the right to vote and to stand for election can only ensue from a court sentence .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The electoral register shall be drawn up by the municipalities as part of their assigned sphere of competence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Anyone who has been convicted by a domestic court of CARDINAL or more criminal offences committed with intent and sentenced with final effect to a term of imprisonment of DATE shall forfeit the right to vote . Disenfranchisement shall end DATE . Time shall start to run once the sentence has been enforced and any preventive [ detention ] measure combined with the deprivation of liberty has been enforced or dropped ; if the sentence is enforced with the period of detention on remand being counted towards the sentence , time shall start to run when the judgment becomes final .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If the legal consequences [ of a conviction ] are suspended under other legal provisions or have lapsed or if all legal consequences or the forfeiture of the right to vote have been pardoned , the convicted person shall not forfeit the right to vote ; nor shall he or she forfeit the right to vote if the court has imposed a conditional sentence .

If it can be expected that enforcement of CARDINAL sanction alone or of part of CARDINAL sanction will suffice , sections CARDINAL [ conditional remission of sentence ] and DATE [ conditional remission of part of a sentence ] may be applied .", "( CARDINAL ) Confiscation can not be the subject of conditional remission . If another subsidiary sanction is imposed it shall be conditionally suspended if the main sanction is also conditionally suspended and independent enforcement of the subsidiary sanction is not necessary .

In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG . DATE ) ORG examined the constitutionality of the conditions of the disenfranchisement under section CARDINAL of LAW of a person convicted of aggravated fraud and serving a DATE prison term .", "ORG held in particular as follows :", "\u201c The enactment of legislation providing for disenfranchisement under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ LAW ] on the basis of a final sentence ( imposed by a domestic court for CARDINAL or more offences committed with intent ) carrying a term of imprisonment of DATE lies , in ORG view , within the margin of appreciation afforded to the legislature in matters of election of the legislature . The fact that as a consequence of this rule citizens who are sentenced to DATE imprisonment for an offence committed with intent are stripped of their right to vote , whereas citizens who are sentenced to just under DATE imprisonment ( for an intentionally committed offence ) are not , does not make the legal provision in question unconstitutional ( cf . PERSON . MONEY ) . Nor do the factual submissions advanced by the complainant in this connection ( for instance with reference to FAC ) alter this conclusion in any way . \u201d", "In its decision of DATE ( BCARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG again examined the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . The complainant had been convicted of aggravated robbery and kidnapping and sentenced to DATE imprisonment respectively . In its decision , after referring at length to the judgment of ORG in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) , it held that in view of that judgment it maintained the findings adopted in its decision of CARDINAL DATE . It stated in particular as follows :", "\u201c In respect of the present complaint it is established that the legal position in GPE at issue in the judgment in the PERSON case differs decisively from the CARDINAL in GPE that is relevant here : section CARDINAL of the National Assembly Election Act does not provide for blanket forfeiture of the right to vote in respect of all convicted prisoners , irrespective of the type or seriousness of the offence they have committed or their individual circumstances . The precondition for imposing forfeiture of the right to vote is a final sentence for one or more intentionally committed offences carrying a prison sentence of DATE ; sentences to a fine , sentences to DATE imprisonment and conditional prison sentences do not result in forfeiture of the right to vote . Moreover , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) allows the judge to conditionally suspend the legal consequences of the conviction , including therefore disenfranchisement ; in this respect the NORP legal system also makes legal provision for consideration to be given to the individual circumstances of the person concerned . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
