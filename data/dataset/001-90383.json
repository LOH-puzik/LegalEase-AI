The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ship ORG , flying the flag of the GPE , was sailing in the NORP exclusive economic zone off the coast of GPE , carrying QUANTITY of fuel oil . The ship 's hull sprang a leak and the contents of the tanks spilled into LOC .", "CARDINAL . In view of the risk of shipwreck the maritime authorities launched a large - scale operation to rescue the crew . The applicant , who was the ship 's captain , was taken by helicopter to the offices of the ORG ( A GPE ) harbourmaster , where he was arrested .", "CARDINAL . The spillage of the ship 's cargo caused an ecological disaster whose effects on marine flora and fauna lasted for DATE and spread as far as the NORP coast .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG no . CARDINAL investigating judge considered that the facts disclosed sufficient evidence to justify initiating a criminal investigation . The judge remanded the applicant in custody with the possibility of being released on payment of bail set at MONEY ( ORG ) . The judge said that , although the oil - spill had been an accident , some of the elements in the file , which were provisional at that stage in the proceedings , pointed to irregularities in the applicant 's conduct , such as a lack of cooperation with the port authorities when they tried to take the vessel in tow . The applicant 's conduct could constitute an offence against natural resources and the environment and CARDINAL of failing to comply with the instructions of the administrative authorities . In the judge 's opinion , the seriousness of the presumed offences and the fact that the applicant was a foreign national who had no particular ties with GPE justified the high level of bail demanded .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested his release or , in the alternative , the reduction of bail to LAW . In a decision of DATE the PERSON ( Corunna ) no . CARDINAL investigating judge refused the request on the ground that the seriousness of the presumed offences justified keeping the applicant in pre - trial detention . Moreover , his continued detention conformed to the relevant principles established by the case - law of ORG , according to which the measure had to be exceptional , subsidiary , temporary and proportionate in nature . As to the amount of bail , the judge stated that it was essential to secure the applicant 's appearance for trial in order to elucidate the facts subsequent to the leak in the vessel 's hull . He also reiterated the arguments of the first investigating judge to the effect that the seriousness of the offences , the public outcry caused by the marine pollution , the applicant 's NORP nationality , the fact that his permanent address was abroad and the fact that he had no ties with GPE justified the high level of bail , which was designed to rule out any risk that the applicant might fail to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same investigating judge confirmed the decision , rejecting an application from the applicant to have it varied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In a decision of DATE the Corunna Audiencia Provincial", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL investigating judge deposited a bank guarantee corresponding to the amount of bail demanded . Accordingly , he ordered the applicant 's provisional release subject to the following conditions :", "\u201c ( a ) that [ the applicant ] supply an address in GPE ;", "( b ) that he report DATE before TIME to the police headquarters corresponding to the address supplied ;", "( c ) that he be prohibited from leaving the country and surrender his passport to the court 's registry . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relying on LAW ( right to liberty and security ) , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . While he did not appeal against his pre - trial detention , for which he also considered sufficient reasons to have been given , the applicant complained of the amount of bail , arguing that it was excessive and disproportionate in view of his financial circumstances , which made the prospects for his provisional release unrealistic . He stressed that the amount fixed did not take account of his personal circumstances as required by the case - law of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a reasoned decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It began by observing that , in accordance with its case - law , the fact that the applicant had been released did not render the amparo appeal devoid of purpose , given that :", "\u201c ... in the event of a breach of the fundamental right relied on , the court should allow the appeal and grant the applicant amparo relief . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , on the merits , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c ... in accordance with LAW , the amount of bail set should take into account , among other factors , the nature of the offence , the accused 's previous convictions and any other circumstances that might prompt him to evade justice . ORG , for its part , has ruled that the object of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at the trial ... and that the amount should act as a deterrent , dispelling any wish on his part to abscond .", "...", "In the instant case the various decisions gave ample reasons for the amount demanded and the refusal of the request for a reduction , namely : the overriding objective of securing the accused 's presence at the trial , the seriousness of the offences , the disastrous situation caused by the spillage of the ship 's cargo both domestically and abroad , the fact that the applicant is a non - national and the fact that he has no ties whatsoever in GPE .", "All the above circumstances led the courts to consider that the risk of the applicant 's absconding could only be reduced by setting such a high sum for bail ... They also took into consideration the accused 's personal and financial circumstances and the commercial environment in which he works ... The applicant 's NORP nationality , the fact that his permanent address is abroad and the fact that he has no ties with GPE constitute personal circumstances which were taken into consideration in fixing bail , in order to deter the applicant from absconding .", "Accordingly , bail was fixed on the basis of proportionality criteria ... The exceptional amount reflects the exceptional nature of the situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities later authorised the applicant 's return to his country of origin , where he is now living , on condition that the NORP authorities ensured compliance with the periodic supervision to which the applicant was subject in GPE .
