The applicant was detained on DATE further to an order issued on DATE by the preliminary investigations judge ( \" giudice per le indagini preliminari \" ) attached to ORG . The applicant was accused of belonging to a ORG type association , drug - trafficking , unlawful possession of arms and forgery . The accusation was based on the statements of a certain Mr M. , a pentito ( a mafioso who had decided to co - operate with the authorities ) .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for the order of DATE , the preliminary investigations judge found that PERSON 's statements should be considered credible and to have been made voluntarily . They could therefore constitute strong evidence of guilt ( \" gravi indizi di colpevolezza \" ) , which is a prerequisite under NORP law for remanding an accused in custody . The judge also considered that these statements were corroborated by the results of criminal investigations concerning similar crimes , as well as by statements made by other pentiti . Furthermore , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c GPE di GPE \u201d , hereinafter called LAW ) , the nature and the seriousness of the offences raised the rebuttable presumption that the conditions for remand in custody laid down in CARDINAL ( risk of tampering with evidence , of absconding and of re - offending ) applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the preliminary investigations judge committed the applicant and CARDINAL other persons for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , acting in accordance with section CARDINAL of the CPP ( which provided that the judge who found himself incompetent ratione loci should forward the case - file to the competent judge ) , declared that the case was outside its territorial jurisdiction and ordered that the case - file be transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an order of DATE , ORG confirmed the applicant \u2019s detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , the President of ORG committed the accused for trial and scheduled DATE first hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , ORG granted the prosecution 's request to suspend the maximum periods of detention on remand for the duration of the trial and deliberations at first instance , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) CPP . It considered that , given the fact that CARDINAL witnesses had to be examined and a considerable volume of documents , including a number of experts ' opinions , had to be produced , the proceedings could be regarded as being particularly complex . In the reasons for that order , ORG specified that , according to ORG well - established case - law , the suspension should cover the whole duration of the trial and not only DATE of the actual hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an application for immediate release with ORG . He observed that the interpretation followed in the order of DATE - according to which the suspension of the maximum periods of detention on remand should cover periods of inactivity between hearings - was inconsistent with the relevant provisions of the ORG , with the overall purpose of LAW and with ORG , CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , ORG , observing that the maximum periods of detention on remand had not been overstepped , dismissed the applicant 's claim .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , the applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG , considering that the lower court had not duly indicated the specific and concrete grounds for the decision to suspend the maximum periods of detention on remand , annulled the impugned order and referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , ORG confirmed ORG order of DATE and declared that the doubts raised by the applicant as to the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the CPP were manifestly ill - founded . ORG observed that the length of the proceedings was mainly due to the complexity of the case , to the number of parties and witnesses as well as to the circumstances preventing the attendance of the accused 's lawyers and of ORG judges . Furthermore , no significant periods of inactivity seemed to have occurred during the trial , given the fact that CARDINAL hearings had taken place from DATE until DATE . However , the court noted that some hearings had been adjourned for reasons which were not imputable to the applicant or to the requirements of the fair administration of justice in criminal cases , such as lawyers ' strikes , ORG illness and a lack of a proper hearing - room . It consequently considered that a global delay of DATE should be deducted from the maximum period of detention on remand , which had not been overstepped , even taking into account such deduction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed on points of law against that decision . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , ORG declared the applicant 's appeal inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In the meanwhile , CARDINAL trial hearings had taken place before FAC . CARDINAL witnesses had been heard and a number of expert opinions were examined .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the lawyers of the accused had contested the lawfulness of the order for committal for trial . They had noted that in a judgment of DATE , ORG had declared that section CARDINAL of the CPP was unconstitutional and that the incompetent judge should forward the case - file to ORG ( and not to the competent judge , as previously provided ) . Given the fact that in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had ordered that the case - file be transmitted to ORG , the lawyers had requested that the whole proceedings be declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer had declared that due to family reasons , he was unable to take part in the hearings scheduled in DATE and had requested to adjourn the case until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG had sentenced the applicant to DATE and DATE imprisonment for drug - trafficking and had acquitted him in respect of the remainder of the charges . The court had also ordered that the applicant 's case - file be transmitted to ORG in order to evaluate the desirability of instituting fresh proceedings against him for belonging to a ORG type association and drug - trafficking , crimes which appeared to have been committed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the question of the lawfulness of the order for committal for trial , ORG had observed that the decision of ORG had been adopted on DATE , while the invoked judgment of ORG had been published only on DATE . Therefore , in accordance with the principle tempus regit actum , the finding of the unconstitutionality of section CARDINAL of the CPP could not retroactively affect the lawfulness of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , ORG declared that the committal for trial and the first - instance judgment were null and void and ordered that the case - file be transmitted to ORG . It observed , in particular , that the finding that a provision was unconstitutional should in principle apply to all pending proceedings . Therefore , after ORG judgment of DATE , ORG had no power to commit the accused for trial and its President \u2019s order of DATE as well as all the acts done before it were invalid .", "CARDINAL .
