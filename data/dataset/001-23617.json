It eventually dismissed the appeals in CARDINAL separate but identical decisions on CARDINAL DATE . Like ORG , it considered the difference in treatment justified by the requirements of legal certainty .", "Prior to CARDINAL DATE , it was considered that pensions were by their very nature connected ( verknocht ) solely to the person nominally entitled to them ( see the judgment of ORG ( PERSON ) of DATE , Beslissingen in FAC ( Reports of Decisions in Taxation Cases \u2013 \u201c BNB \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . This meant that pension entitlements could not be included in divorce settlements .", "In a landmark judgment of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , ORG held that pension entitlements existing at the time that a marital community of property ( gemeenschap van goederen ) was dissolved by divorce or judicial separation were , in principle , part of that community of property even if they had not yet fallen due . This meant that they had to be taken into account in the settlement when the assets and liabilities belonging to the community were divided .", "The way in which such entitlements should be taken into account depended on considerations of equity ( redelijkheid en billijkheid ) , as applicable to the dissolution of a marital community of property . In many cases , the party nominally entitled to the pension would be faced with an obligation , conditional on the survival of both parties , to pay a certain percentage of the pension instalments to the other party as they became due . However , equitable considerations might dictate other solutions , for example the purchase by the party nominally entitled to the pension of an annuity for the benefit of the other party . In certain cases , for example if adequate arrangements had been made for the maintenance of the other party in some other way , it might be equitable to reduce the other party \u2019s claim to part of the pension or even to cancel it altogether .", "ORG recognised that this judgment involved a reversal of its case - law since DATE . It realised that many marital communities of property had been dissolved in the meanwhile without pension rights being taken into account . Although in principle ORG new approach could give rise to the reopening of such cases , considerations of equity coupled with interests of legal certainty entailed that , as a rule , the party nominally entitled to the pension should not be faced with hitherto unexpected claims .", "On DATE the Pensions Equalisation ( Divorce ) Act ( QUANTITY verevening pensioenrechten bij scheiding , \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force .", "In relevant part , it provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In case of divorce and in so far as CARDINAL of the spouses has accumulated pension entitlements after the marriage was contracted and before the divorce , the other spouse shall have a right to pension equalisation as provided in or under this Act ...", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the right to pension equalisation referred to in the first paragraph , a right to payment of a part of each instalment of the pension [ as it becomes ] payable shall come into being vis - \u00e0 - vis the implementing body ...", "CARDINAL . Payment shall take place subject to the conditions laid down in the applicable instrument . If the time at which the pension starts ( pensioeningang ) precedes or coincides with the time of the divorce , payment shall start at the time the pension starts ...", "CARDINAL . The right to payment shall end at the time when the right to the pension ends or at DATE in which the spouse entitled to pension equalisation dies ...", "... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . The part referred to in section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , shall be CARDINAL of the pension that would be payable if :", "( a ) the spouse who is under an obligation to equalise had participated solely during DATE of participation from the time the marriage was contracted until the time of the divorce ;", "( b ) he had terminated his participation at the time of the divorce ; and", "( c ) he were married or in a registered partnership during the period when he was entitled to the pension .", "CARDINAL . If the pension is increased or decreased after it starts , the sum resulting from the first paragraph shall be increased or decreased in proportion to the increase or decrease of the pension .", "... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . This Act shall not apply to a divorce that took place before the date on which this LAW entered into force .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , this Act shall apply by analogy ( van overeenkomstige toepassing ) to a divorce that has taken place before DATE , provided that the marriage lasted for DATE and there were , during the marriage , minor children of the spouses together or CARDINAL of them , it being understood that the part referred to in section CARDINAL , second paragraph , shall be CARDINAL of the pension that would have to be paid pursuant to section CARDINAL , first and second paragraphs , and that there shall be no right to pension equalisation to the extent that the circumstance that the spouse entitled to equalisation has accumulated insufficient pension or none at all has already demonstrably been taken into account . ...", "... \u201d", "The Explanatory Memorandum to the PERSON which later became LAW ( Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) , ORG of ORG , DATE , CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) explains that the Government \u2019s intention in introducing this legislation was to make the rule stated by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE more effective by replacing the claim of CARDINAL spouse against the other with an automatic claim against the body responsible for paying out the pension . It was felt that this would simplify the realisation of the rights of the spouse who was not nominally entitled to the pension , and in addition forestall litigation by making it unnecessary .", "An additional aim was to recognise a shared claim after divorce to the pension regardless of whether the parties had been married in community of property or had made other arrangements by a marriage settlement ( huwelijkse ORG ) , the question of the applicability of ORG case - law in the latter situation having given rise to problems in that regard ( Explanatory Memorandum , loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Initially , the proposed wording of LAW comprised only the present first paragraph . It was intended that the new Act should not affect divorces pre - dating ORG judgment of DATE , and that divorces which became final after that date but before the entry into force of the LAW should be dealt with in accordance with the case - law which that judgment defined ( Explanatory Memorandum , loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "The second paragraph of section CARDINAL resulted from an amendment proposed by CARDINAL members of ORG of ORG , PERSON and Soutendijk - van Appeldoorn ( LAW ( ORG amendement ) , ORG of ORG , DATE - CARDINAL , CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) . It was intended as a compromise between the requirements of legal certainty and considerations of an equitable nature . For that reason it granted a particular , limited , category of persons divorced before DATE a partial entitlement to pension rights accumulated by their former spouses , albeit a lesser one than that enjoyed by persons who were divorced after the entry into force of the LAW ( Memorandum in Reply ( PERSON ) , ORG of ORG , DATE , CARDINAL , no .
