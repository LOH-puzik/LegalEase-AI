DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He resides in GPE , GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At the material time the applicant was employed as a baker by ORG ( f\u00e6llesforeningen af PERSON ) . He was also a member of the trade union ORG ( N\u00e6rings- og GPE ) and his employment was governed by a collective labour agreement between the ORG and the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant left his place of work in circumstances which remain in dispute . The following day he received a letter from his employer by which his employment was terminated . The applicant protested against the dismissal and contacted his trade union . Following a discussion with the applicant the ORG sent a letter to the ORG on CARDINAL DATE protesting against the applicant \u2019s dismissal .", "Subsequently the ORG discussed the settlement with the applicant who , following consultations with his lawyer , could not approve the text but requested certain additional guarantees as to employment , wages and seniority .", "On DATE another meeting was held between the representatives of the ORG and the ORG . The applicant was aware of the date of this meeting but did not participate this time either . According to TIME of this meeting the above settlement was upheld with CARDINAL additional guarantees in respect of the applicant \u2019s salary and seniority . The settlement was approved and signed by the representatives of the ORG and the ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG Civilretten i Glostrup ) received a writ by which the applicant instituted proceedings against the ORG claiming CARDINAL ORG representing his salary from DATE until DATE . It appears that at this moment in time the applicant still considered himself employed by the ORG . However , subsequently he refused the ORG \u2019s offer of reemployment in accordance with the above settlement since he had found other employment .", "In the proceedings before ORG the ORG maintained , in particular , that the applicant could not submit further claims as he was bound by the settlement reached between the ORG and the ORG . The applicant maintained , however , that this argument would , if upheld by the court , amount to a violation of his rights as secured to him by LAW .", "ORG held an oral hearing in the case where the applicant , assisted by counsel , was heard . The court furthermore heard CARDINAL witnesses . On the basis of an evaluation of the available evidence ORG pronounced judgment in favour of the ORG on CARDINAL DATE . The judgment reads , in its relevant part as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c The settlement between the ORG and the ORG is final and it has been approved by [ the representative of the ORG ] on behalf of [ the applicant ] . It is noted in this connection that the ORG by virtue of the [ collective labour ] agreements has a standing and irrevocable authorisation to reach such settlements on behalf of its members .", "On the basis of the evidence submitted the terms of the settlement must be considered fulfilled .", "Accordingly , the court finds in favour of the defendant .", "It is noted in this respect that [ the applicant ] will not be precluded from claiming damages from the ORG during a possible lawsuit , if [ he ] finds that during the settlement negotiations the ORG did not take proper care of [ his ] interests . Thus , the settlement ought not to be set aside with reference to LAW ] . ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON landsret ) which also held a hearing during which the applicant and the witnesses were heard again . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . The judgment reads , in its relevant parts , as follows :", "( Translation )", "CARDINAL judges ... opine as follows :", "We find it established that [ the applicant ] himself requested his union ORG to secure that the dispute concerning his dismissal should be solved by negotiations between the ORG and the ORG . It must have been clear to [ the applicant ] that a solution in the case would hereafter be found in accordance with the rules governing labour disputes . Furthermore , we find it established that between the parties in question agreement was reached on the disputed settlement .", "We find hereafter that , also without [ the applicant \u2019s ] acceptance of the settlement , the ORG has had authorisation to reach it with binding effect for [ the applicant ] . With this reasoning we vote for [ upholding the judgment ] .", "Judge ... opines as follows :", "First , I do not find that the ORG by virtue of the collective labour agreements has a standing and irrevocable authorisation to enter into an agreement as the CARDINAL in question which does not concern a labour market dispute .", "Second , I find it established that the reservation in the draft settlement referred to the ORG 's approval as well as that of [ the applicant ] . ... I do not find it established that , when he received confirmation of [ the ORG 's ] approval of the settlement , [ the representative of the ORG ] believed or had any reason to believe that the agreement had not been approved by [ the applicant ] ... . Thus , the agreement is binding on [ the applicant ] . With this reasoning I vote as the majority . ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) rejected the applicant 's request for leave to appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "The NORP labour market is to a high extent governed by collective agreements concluded between the labour market parties . About CARDINAL per cent of all employees are organised and nearly CARDINAL per cent of all employees are covered by collective agreements .", "As a consequence of the high rate of organisation , pay and working conditions in GPE are mainly regulated by collective agreements between labour market partners .", "Pay and working conditions may further be agreed individually between the individual employee and the employer .", "There is an interaction among the CARDINAL elements - collective agreements , individual agreements and legislation - when it comes to identifying the rights of an employee in relation to the employer .", "A collective agreement has effect within the occupation field covered by the agreement . An employer who has concluded or adhered to a collective agreement has a duty in relation to the trade union to pay the employees the wage and salary fixed in the collective agreement whether the employee is or is not a member of the organisation concerned . However , a non - organised employee may not invoke rights under the collective agreement , but only under his or her individual agreement . On the other hand employees have no independent and direct rights which can be invoked under the collective agreement . Through the membership of a trade union , the union is considered empowered to act on behalf of its members .", "As regards cases settled within the machinery set up for settlement of labour disputes , i.e. by arbitration or by ORG , the right to take legal action is vested in the organisation which is a party to the agreement . It is also the organisation which decides about the subject - matter of the case . Before the ordinary courts of law it is the individual employee who has the right to sue .", "As regards rights based on legislation the rule is that such rights may always be enforced by the ordinary courts of law . The courts will hear the case whether or not the employee is a member of a trade union or other organisation . In such cases it is always the individual employee who is entitled to bring the action and who may dispose of the subjectmatter of the case .", "If the rights of the employee are based on a collective agreement , the legal situation may be summarised as follows :", "If the employee is not organised and thus not attached to any organisation , but his or her rights are , nevertheless , based on a collective agreement , the practice is that the ordinary courts of law will hear the case . Reference is made to ORG and U CARDINAL/CARDINALH.", "If the employee is organised , the starting point is that the matter should be settled by the special machinery for settlement of labour disputes , i.e. by arbitration or by ORG . In such cases the general rule is that the organisations have the full disposal of the subject - matter and the right to take legal action . An exception from this general rule follows from LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW which reads as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c An employee shall , however , be entitled to bring an action for award of outstanding wages in the ordinary courts of law unless the organisation , in proceedings before ORG , has waived this right on behalf of the employee or when the failure to pay wages is related to a labour market dispute . \u201d", "The ordinary courts of law have , inter alia on the basis of this provision , heard cases involving collective agreements , even if the organisation has failed to proceed with the case within the framework of the machinery set up for the settlement of labour disputes , cf . UCARDINAL/CARDINAL\u00d8 , PERSON and GPE in which express reference was made to the right of access to court under LAW .", "Any decision ( judgment ) of ORG is final . ORG is the first and only level of jurisdiction , since no appeal lies against its decisions . Consequently , the judgments of ORG are directly enforceable in accordance with the rules of ORG relating to enforcement of judicial awards , cf . LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
