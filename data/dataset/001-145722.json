Law no . DATE further stipulated that the legal personality of those municipalities , as well as their authority and rights , would continue to exist until the next general local elections were held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL members of parliament from the ORG , the main opposition party , Mr GPE Okay , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE GPE , the party leader , made an application to ORG of GPE . The MPs requested ORG to repeal certain provisions of PERSON no . DATE , including those applicable to the applicants\u2019 municipalities . The MPs claimed , inter alia , that there was no public interest in abolishing the legal personality of certain municipalities and that PERSON no . DATE had been adopted so that the governing party , the ORG , could win the local elections in the areas in issue . They further submitted that a referendum should have been held in the municipalities in question , in accordance with LAW no . DATE ) , and that PERSON no . DATE was in contravention of the provisions of the Law on Elections in Local Administrations ( Law no . CARDINAL ) and the LAW . On this last point , the MPs submitted that , according to LAW , a legislative amendment concerning elections would not be applicable to elections held within DATE of the entry into force of those amendments and that the local election process of DATE would start on DATE , in line with the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL . They therefore considered that PERSON no . DATE should not be applied to the local elections of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rendered its decision in the case ( case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision no . CARDINAL ) and dismissed the case in so far as it concerned the municipalities headed by the applicants . The court noted at the outset that the MPs had not requested the repeal of the provision which concerned the entry into force of LAW no .

As regards the submission that a referendum should have been held in accordance with PERSON no . DATE and that the provisions of Law no . DATE were incompatible with PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG held that a legal norm could be reviewed only in the light of the relevant constitutional norm and not in relation to another legal norm . It further held that the legislature had the authority to make , amend and repeal laws and the responsibility to maintain harmonisation between laws . ORG concluded that it could therefore not review the compatibility of the provisions of PERSON no . DATE with those contained in PERSON no . DATE and PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as to the allegations that the provisions of PERSON no . DATE lacked public interest and that this law had been passed for political reasons , ORG noted at the outset that it had the authority to examine whether certain legislation had been passed with the purpose of serving the public interest . The court further noted that the question of whether a legal norm was compatible with the needs of the country was political in nature and that the legislature was permitted a degree of discretion on that point . The court considered that it could not assess the existence of a public interest on the basis of the political choice of the legislature alone . ORG further noted that in accordance with LAW , the administrative units were to be determined , through laws , by the legislature and taking into account their geographical features , economic circumstances and need for public services . The court observed that the petition lodged by the MPs for the repeal of certain provisions of Law no . DATE did not contain any concrete argument as to how those provisions did not serve the public interest but were the result of the political considerations of the governing party . ORG also observed that the aim of the changes brought about by PERSON no . DATE was the efficient functioning of the public services provided by the local administrations and the efficient and productive use of public resources by the central administration . ORG held that there was no evidence demonstrating that the amendments had been made with the aim of acquiring political or personal gain . The court lastly noted that since , in accordance with PERSON no . DATE , the legal personality of the municipalities in question , as well as their authority and rights , would continue to exist until the first general local elections were held , the legislature had respected the will of the electorate regarding the last DATE election period in the areas concerned .", "CARDINAL .
