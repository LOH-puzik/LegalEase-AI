On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG notified the applicant of her intention to reject her third asylum request for the reason that it was not based on any nova as required under article CARDINAL of LAW . The Deputy Minister noted that the claim that the missions of GPE and GPE had indicated that the applicant was not a NORP or NORP national had remained unsubstantiated and that , as regards the risk of future circumcision of her son , the GPE asylum policy concerning a risk of circumcision only applied to potential victims of female circumcision . Moreover , as the applicant had not demonstrated that she hailed from GPE , no value could be attached to her claim that her son risked circumcision in GPE . The Deputy Minister further held , in the context of an ex officio examination of this question , that the applicant was not eligible for a residence permit for aliens who , through no fault of their own , were unable to leave the GPE as she had not demonstrated her alleged identity and nationality .

Consequently , the provisional - measures judge quashed the impugned decision but further ordered that the legal effects of this decision were to remain valid as the origin and citizenship of the applicant remained undetermined and it was consequently impossible to determine her son \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant could have filed an appeal to ORG , she did not do so .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant and her son were no longer considered as lawfully staying ( rechtmatig verblijf ) in the GPE pending the determination of a request for a residence title , the provision to them of ORG - sponsored shelter and care facilities under LAW Regeling verstrekkingen asielzoekers ) was discontinued as from DATE , .

Although in principle no further remedy lies against a multi - purpose decision , it also considered that in certain exceptional circumstances , such as a relevant change of circumstances having occurred during the delay between the refusal of the request and an act aimed at effective removal ( daadwerkelijke uitzettingshandeling ) , an objection ( bezwaar ) and subsequent appeal ( beroep ) may be filed against an act aimed at effective removal .", "CARDINAL .
