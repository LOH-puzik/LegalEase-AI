They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor from ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants were both participants in an anti - fishing protest that took place on TIME DATE . The applicants , along with CARDINAL other protestors , attended a fishing competition taking place in GPE , a public park in GPE . There were CARDINAL anglers fishing around a lake . The intention of the applicants was to effect a \" sabotage \" of the angling match by preventing fish from being caught , or reducing the number of fish caught , and raising public awareness of cruelty to fish . The applicants approached some of the anglers and explained that they were not there to cause any damage or violence but that they intended to frighten fish away from the hooks to prevent the fish being caught . The applicants threw twigs in the water close to the hooks to disturb the surface of the water , whilst other protestors sounded horns to create noise in order to frighten the fish . The applicants contend that no violence or threats of violence against the persons or property of the anglers took place . The Government contend that the applicants threw sticks at the NORP lines , creating the risk of damage to property .", "Police officers arrived at the scene and told the applicants to cease their behaviour . When the applicants refused they were arrested , along with CARDINAL other protestors , for \" breach of the peace \" . The arrests took place at TIME and the applicants were taken to GPE police station arriving at TIME .. Detention was authorised , the reason stated on the custody record being to , \" allow a period of calming , and to determine method of processing \" . The applicants were charged TIME of the same day with \" Breach of the Peace\".The charge read as follows :", "\" That you on DATE at GPE in GPE in a certain place namely PERSON , were guilty of conduct whereby a breach of the peace was likely to be occasioned .", "Contrary to Common Law . \"", "The applicants were then detained at the police station . This detention was justified on the following grounds :", "\" Bail denied to prevent the prisoner from disrupting the fishing event DATE , also CARDINAL scheduled for DATE . To appear at the next available court , ORG [ ORG ] AM CARDINAL .. \"", "The applicants appeared before ORG at TIME on DATE . The magistrates adjourned the case and the applicants were released .", "The applicants appeared before the court on DATE for a full hearing . The court found the charge of \" breach of the peace \" proved against the applicants and proposed to bind them over . The first applicant was invited to agree to be bound over in the sum of \u00a3 MONEY to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of DATE . The second applicant was invited to agree to be bound over in the sum of \u00a3 DATE to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a period of DATE .", "Both applicants refused to be bound over , stating they were not guilty of a breach of the peace . After CARDINAL brief adjournments the magistrates committed the first applicant ( then aged DATE ) to a LAW for DATE , under the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The second applicant was committed to prison for DATE , under section CARDINAL of ORG .", "The applicants appealed against the decision of the court by way of case stated . In the stated case , the justices found that the conduct of the applicants would clearly have disrupted and interfered with the lawful activities of the anglers involved in the competition , that their conduct was intended to prevent that lawful conduct , and that the consequences of the applicants\u2019 conduct would almost certainly have been a breach of the peace , as it was likely that some or all of the anglers would resort to forceful means of restraining the applicants , which in turn would have resulted in acts of violence . In ORG , on DATE , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c \u2026 Before the court can properly find that the natural consequence of lawful conduct by a defendant would , if persisted in , be to provoke another to violence , it should , it seems to me , be satisfied that in all the circumstances it is the defendant who is acting unreasonably rather than the other person . ... Putting it another way , the court would surely not find a [ breach of the peace ] proved if any violence likely to have been provoked on the part of others would be not merely unlawful but wholly unreasonable \u2013 as of course , it would be if the defendant \u2019s conduct was not merely lawful but such as in no material way interfered with the other \u2019s rights . A fortiori , if the defendant was properly exercising his own basic rights , whether of assembly , demonstration or free speech . \u201d .", "The appeal failed and leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "Breach of the peace \u2013 which does not constitute a criminal offence ( NORP v. GPE ORG , ex parte ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) DATE is a common - law concept of great antiquity . However , as Lord PERSON , giving judgment in ORG in the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Reports CARDINAL ) , remarked in DATE :", "\u201c A comprehensive definition of the term \u2018 breach of the peace\u2019 has very rarely been formulated \u2026 \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "He continued :", "\u201c We are emboldened to say that there is likely to be a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault , an affray , a riot , unlawful assembly or other disturbance . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "In a subsequent case before ORG ( PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON followed ORG in holding that there must be a risk of violence before there could be a breach of the peace . However , it was not essential that the violence be perpetrated by the defendant , as long as it was established that the natural consequence of his behaviour would be to provoke violence in others :", "\u201c The conduct in question does not itself have to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal law . It is sufficient if its natural consequence would , if persisted in , be to provoke others to violence , and so some actual danger to the peace is established . \u201d ( p. DATE )", "A person may be arrested without warrant by exercise of the common law power of arrest , for causing a breach of the peace or where it is reasonably apprehended that he is likely to cause a breach of the peace ( PERSON v Lavin [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL ) . This power was preserved by ORG sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) ) .", "Magistrates have powers to \u201c bind over \u201d under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , under common law and under LAW ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "A binding - over order requires the person bound over to enter into a \u201c recognizance \u201d , or undertaking secured by a sum of money fixed by the court , to keep the peace or be of good behaviour for a specified period of time . If he or she refuses to consent to the order , the court may commit him or her to prison , for DATE in the case of an order made under LAW or for an unlimited period in respect of orders made under LAW or common law . If an order is made but breached within the specified time period , the person bound over forfeits the sum of the recognizance . A binding - over order is not a criminal conviction ( NORP v. GPE ORG , ex parte ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) .", "In addition to the statutory procedure under LAW described in the case of Steel and Others , magistrates have powers to bind over at common law and LAW . These powers allow magistrates , at any stage in proceedings before them , to bind over any participant in the proceedings if they consider that the conduct of the person concerned is such that there might be a breach of the peace or that his or her behaviour has been contra ORG mores . It is not open to the justices to attach specific conditions to a binding - over order ( PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ; PERSON v.

These objections are , in summary , that the conduct which can be the ground for a binding - over order is too vaguely defined ; that binding - over orders when made are in terms which are too vague and are therefore potentially oppressive ; that the power to imprison someone if he or she refuses to consent to be bound over is anomalous ; that orders which restrain a subject \u2019s freedom can be made without the discharge of the criminal , or indeed any clearly defined , burden of proof ; and that witnesses , complainants or even acquitted defendants can be bound over without adequate prior information of any charge or complaint against them . \u201d ( ORG no .
