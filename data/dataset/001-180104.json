Still on DATE , the police questioned CARDINAL suspects in respect of the incident : the lifeguards employed at the pool , GPE and GPE , the medical officer at the pool , PERSON , and the deputy manager of the pool , PERSON", "CARDINAL . GPE told the police that when he and his colleague , C.A. , who had been positioned on the other side of the pool at the material time , noticed a person drowning in the middle of the pool , they jumped in and rescued him .

The other CARDINAL suspects , C.A. , PERSON and PERSON , gave similar statements to that of GPE \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the police also questioned CARDINAL eye witnesses , who gave statements along the same lines as the suspects .", "CARDINAL . The autopsy carried out on DATE confirmed the cause of death as drowning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office filed a bill of indictment with ORG against the CARDINAL lifeguards , GPE and GPE , the medical officer at the pool , PERSON , and the deputy manager , PERSON , for causing the death of Celal Ba\u015fkaya by their failure to take the necessary safety measures at the swimming pool .", "CARDINAL . The applicants joined the proceedings before ORG as civil parties not seeking compensation . In the petition which he submitted to the assize court , the first applicant , PERSON ( the victim \u2019s brother ) , claimed that the lifeguards had failed to pay attention to his brother \u2019s initial calls for help and had intervened too late .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the defendants repeated their previous police statements . The lifeguard C.A. informed the assize court that there had been DATE CARDINAL people at the swimming pool at the material time . At the start of the proceedings , the GPE lawyer challenged the autopsy report as being incomplete , given that it had not been established during the autopsy whether the victim \u2212 who had suffered from diabetes mellitus \u2212 had died because he had lapsed into a diabetic coma in the swimming pool . The lawyer requested from the court another autopsy to establish whether he had died of diabetesrelated causes . The matter was brought before ORG , which informed the assize court that blood samples taken after death would not be indicative of the glucose levels preceding death .", "CARDINAL . At the subsequent hearings the assize court heard statements from witnesses who confirmed that the victim knew how to swim and had drowned without making any noise or movements . The assize court also conducted an on - site examination of the university swimming pool in the presence of the defendants , the applicants\u2019 lawyer , and CARDINAL experts ( CARDINAL expert lifeguard and CARDINAL physician from ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In his report dated DATE the expert lifeguard stated that according to the information in the case file the victim , who apparently knew how to swim , had drowned without any attempts to attract attention . There was , moreover , no evidence to suggest that the lifeguards had neglected their rescue duties in any way . In these circumstances , the expert found that there were no grounds to hold the lifeguards accountable in connection with the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In his report dated DATE the medical expert found that at the time of the incident there were CARDINAL lifeguards and CARDINAL medical officer on duty at the swimming pool , which showed that the necessary safety measures had been in place . The evidence in the case file suggested that the victim knew how to swim , that he had drowned without calling for help or showing any other signs of distress , and that the lifeguards had intervened as soon as they noticed the victim at the bottom of the pool . Without expressing any view as to whether the victim \u2019s death had been related to his diabetes , the expert stated that strenuous physical activity could cause glucose levels to drop , which could in turn lead to loss of consciousness . If the victim had experienced such a hypoglycaemic attack while under water and had , as a result , lost consciousness , it was possible that the lifeguards or other people in the pool might not have realised right away that there was a problem . In the light of all this information , the medical expert stated that the defendants had no responsibility in connection with the victim \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested another expert report from ORG regarding the liability of the defendants in respect of the death of Celal Ba\u015fkaya .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected that request as being outside the scope of its duties . ORG therefore ordered another expert report from CARDINAL experts on occupational safety .", "CARDINAL . In their report dated DATE the experts on occupational safety made the following findings :", "\u2013 Considering that the victim knew how to swim , which was not contested , he must have experienced a health problem that caused him to lose consciousness and sink while halfway across the pool .", "\u2013 Although it was not possible to determine with any certainty what type of health problem had brought about his drowning , the victim was diabetic . The possible outcomes of hypoglycaemia caused by strenuous physical activity had been outlined in the medical expert \u2019s opinion dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "\u2013 It therefore appeared that the victim had silently sunk to the bottom of the pool without calling for help or showing other signs of drowning as a result of his underlying medical condition .", "\u2013 Bearing in mind that the victim had been CARDINAL of the many swimmers in the pool , it could not be expected for the lifeguards to follow all the movements of all the swimmers at all times and to intervene despite the absence of any signs of distress .", "\u2013 In these circumstances , the lifeguards , who had intervened as soon as they noticed the victim at the bottom of the pool , could not be held accountable for the victim \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . Relying on all the evidence and the information in the case file , on DATE ORG ordered the defendants\u2019 acquittal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment .
