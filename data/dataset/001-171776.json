NORP The majority ( CARDINAL judges ) noted that it was not until the proceedings on paternity that the applicants had informed the authorities that they had not had sexual contact in the fertile period as regards PERSON Moreover , despite giving the children the impression that PERSON was their biological father , the second applicant had continued to treat the children as his own , at least until DATE . In these circumstances , and since it was uncertain whether paternity would be established for the children if the paternity cases were to be reopened , they did not find a basis for reopening the case regarding PERSON under LAW . By the same line of reasoning , they did not find a basis for reopening the paternity case regarding LAW under the stricter conditions set out in LAW taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The minority ( CARDINAL judge ) agreed with the decision by ORG , mainly with the same reasoning . In addition he pointed out that the second applicant had not been aware until DATE that the first applicant and PERSON had had a long relationship , and that he was probably not PERSON \u2019s father . Furthermore , the second applicant had withdrawn from the children after learning about PERSON and he saw them mainly in order to help the first applicant .
