THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a public limited company , having its registered seat in PERSON ( GPE ) . It is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , who are both lawyers practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. PERSON , of ORG . ORG is represented by PERSON and PERSON , and PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant company 's activities include the operation of a sugar factory on GPE and the export of sugar to ORG ( ORG ) . Since GPE produces no sugar , the sugar is bought from cane sugar refineries in GPE and GPE . After purchase , the sugar is transported to GPE , where it is cleaned , milled and packed .", "The applicant company operates within the legal framework of the NORP Council Decision CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE . ORG is based on Part IV of LAW , relating to the association of overseas countries and territories with the ORG . GPE is CARDINAL of these \u201c overseas countries and territories \u201d ( \u201c DATE \u201d ) . Part IV of LAW provides the basis for the abolition of customs duties on goods originating from OCTs when imported into the ORG . In accordance with LAW , the details of and the procedure for the association of the OCTs with the ORG are set out in LAW .", "Since DATE , there have been several successive Implementing Conventions . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC is the sixth LAW . The original version of the sixth LAW provided for the possibility of importing goods originating from DATE to the ORG free of customs duties or charges . Goods were considered to be of DATE origin not only when they were wholly obtained within DATE concerned , but also if they were obtained from CARDINAL of the ACP ( LOC , LOC , GPE or the ORG and underwent work or processing in DATE .", "The sixth Implementing Convention was amended at mid - term by ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE . This amendment severely impeded the commercial operations of the applicant company , since it limited the levy free imports of sugar of ORG / DATE origin within the ORG to QUANTITY per year .", "Following the adoption of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , the applicant company instituted summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE seeking an interim order prohibiting :", "On DATE the President of ORG of The GPE declined jurisdiction to hear the applicant company 's claims against ORG and ORG , as ORG ( College van Beroep voor het GPE ) was the competent judicial body for claims concerning import levies , agricultural levies and/or import licences . As to the applicant company 's claim against the authorities of GPE , the President decided to refer a number of questions to ORG of ORG ( ECJ ) for a preliminary ruling , within the meaning of ( former ) LAW , on the validity of ORG of DATE and , pending the outcome of the proceedings before the ECJ , provisionally granted the interim measure sought by the applicant company against the authorities of GPE .", "A hearing was held before the ECJ on DATE and , on DATE , ORG to the ECJ presented his ORG . Under LAW of LAW of the ECJ and LAW , the submission of the Opinion of the Advocate General brought the oral proceedings before the ECJ to an end .", "The applicant company 's request of DATE to be allowed to respond to the ORG was rejected by the ECJ in an order of DATE . The ECJ held inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . LAW of ORG and the Rules of Procedure of the Court make no provision for the parties to submit observations in response to ORG .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG relies on the case - law of ORG concerning the scope of Article CARDINAL ) of ORG ) , and in particular on the judgment of DATE in GPE ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions , CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "...", "CARDINAL . As the ORG has consistently held , fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law , the observance of which it ensures ( see , in particular , Opinion CARDINAL of DATE [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . For that purpose , the ORG draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member GPE and from the guidelines supplied by international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member GPE have cooperated or of which they are signatories . The LAW has special significance in that respect ( see , in particular , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG [ DATE ] ORG , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , those principles have been incorporated in Article CARDINAL ) of LAW , according to which ' The Union shall respect fundamental rights , as guaranteed by LAW signed in GPE on CARDINAL DATE and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to ORG , as general principles of Community law ' . According to LAW , the ORG is to ensure that this provision is applied ' with regard to action of the institutions , in so far as [ it ] has jurisdiction under the Treaties establishing ORG and under [ the ] LAW [ on ORG ] ' .", "CARDINAL . It is also appropriate to recall the status and role of the Advocate General within the judicial system established by LAW and by LAW of ORG , as set out in detail in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG consists of ORG and is assisted by Advocates General . LAW lays down identical conditions and the same procedure for appointing both judges and Advocates General . In addition , it is clear from Title I of LAW of ORG , which , in law , is equal in rank to the LAW itself , that the Advocates General have the same status as the ORG , particularly so far as concerns immunity and the grounds on which they may be deprived of their office , which guarantees their full impartiality and total independence .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the Advocates General , none of whom is subordinate to any other , are not public prosecutors nor are they subject to any authority , in contrast to the manner in which the administration of justice is organised in certain Member GPE . They are not entrusted with the defence of any particular interest in the exercise of their duties .", "CARDINAL . The role of the Advocate General must be viewed in that context . In accordance with LAW , his duty is to make , in open court , acting with complete impartiality and independence , reasoned submissions on cases brought before ORG , in order to assist ORG in the performance of the task assigned to it , which is to ensure that , in the interpretation and application of the LAW , the law is observed .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW of ORG and LAW , the Opinion of the Advocate General brings the oral procedure to an end . It does not form part of the proceedings between the parties , but rather opens the stage of deliberation by ORG . It is not therefore an opinion addressed to the judges or to the parties which stems from an authority outside the ORG or which ' derives its authority from that of ORG department [ in the NORP version , \" minist\u00e8re public \" ] ' ( judgment in PERSON v GPE , cited above , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Rather , it constitutes the individual reasoned opinion , expressed in open court , of a Member of ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General thus takes part , publicly and individually , in the process by which the ORG reaches its judgment , and therefore in carrying out the judicial function entrusted to it . Furthermore , the ORG is published together with the ORG 's judgment .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to both the organic and the functional link between the Advocate General and the ORG , referred to in DATE of this order , the aforesaid case - law of ORG does not appear to be transposable to the Opinion of the Court 's Advocates General .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , given the special constraints inherent in Community judicial procedure , connected in particular with its language regime , to confer on the parties the right to submit observations in response to the Opinion of the Advocate General , with a corresponding right for the other parties ( and , in preliminary ruling proceedings , which constitute the majority of cases brought before the ORG , all the Member GPE , the ORG and the other institutions concerned ) to reply to those observations , would cause serious difficulties and considerably extend the length of the procedure .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , constraints inherent in the manner in which the administration of justice is organised within the ORG can not justify infringing a fundamental right to adversarial procedure . However , no such situation arises in that , with a view to the very purpose of adversarial procedure , which is to prevent the ORG from being influenced by arguments which the parties have been unable to discuss , the ORG may of its own motion , on a proposal from the Advocate General or at the request of the parties , reopen the oral procedure , in accordance with LAW , if it considers that it lacks sufficient information , or that the case must be dealt with on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties ( see , in particular , with regard to the reopening of the oral procedure , the order of DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Legros and Others , not published in the ECR , and the judgment of DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON and Others [ CARDINAL ] ECR I-CARDINAL ; the order of DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Meng , not published in the ECR , and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Meng [ DATE ] ORG I-CARDINAL ; the order of CARDINAL DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Peterbroeck , not published in the ECR , and the judgment of DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Peterbroeck [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL ; the order of DATE in Case PERSON , not published in the ECR , and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON [ DATE ] ORG ; and the order of CARDINAL DATE in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Verkooijen , not published in the ECR ) .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , however , ORG 's application does not relate to the reopening of the oral procedure , nor does it rely on any specific factor indicating that it would be either useful or necessary to do so .", "CARDINAL . ORG 's application for leave to submit written observations in response to ORG must therefore be dismissed . \u201d", "By a judgment of DATE , the ECJ gave the requested preliminary ruling in which it upheld the validity of ORG of DATE .", "The summary injunction proceedings before the President of ORG of GPE were subsequently discontinued ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
