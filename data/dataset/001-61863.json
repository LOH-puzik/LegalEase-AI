GPE was founded on the principle that the ORG should be secular ( laik ) . After the proclamation of GPE DATE , the public and religious spheres were separated through a series of revolutionary reforms : the abolition of the caliphate on DATE ; the repeal of the constitutional provision declaring ORG the religion of the ORG on DATE ; and , lastly , on DATE a constitutional amendment according constitutional status to the principle of secularism ( see LAW of DATE and LAW as set out in paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The main feature of the NORP system was the status accorded to women \u2019s rights , with women being granted equality in the enjoyment of individual rights . The process began on DATE with the adoption of LAW , which provided for equality of the sexes in the enjoyment of civic rights , in particular as regards divorce and succession . Subsequently , through a constitutional amendment of DATE ( Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ) , women obtained equal political rights with men .", "CARDINAL . At the time of GPE both the central government and religious groups required people to dress in accordance with their religious affiliations . The reforms introduced by GPE the question of dress were inspired by the evolution of society in DATE and sought first and foremost to create a religion - free zone in which all citizens were guaranteed equality , without distinction on the grounds of religion or denomination . The first enactment in this sphere was LAW of DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , which treated dress as an issue relating to modernity . Similarly , a ban was imposed on wearing religious attire other than in places of worship or at religious ceremonies , irrespective of the religion or belief concerned , by ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under ORG ( LAW of DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , religious schools were closed and all schools came under the control of ORG . This LAW is one of the laws enjoying constitutional status that are protected by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Wearing the NORP headscarf to school and university is a recent phenomenon in GPE , which began in DATE . There has been extensive discussion on the issue and it continues to be the subject of lively debate in NORP society . Those in favour of the headscarf see wearing it as a duty and/or form of expression linked to religious identity , whereas those against regard it as a symbol of a political ORG that is seeking to establish a regime based on religious precepts and threatens to cause civil unrest and undermine the rights acquired by women under the NORP system . The accession to power on DATE of a coalition government comprising the NORP PERSON , and the centre - right PERSON , has given the debate strong political overtones . The ambivalence displayed by the leaders of FAC , including the then Prime Minister , over their attachment to democratic values , and their advocacy of a plurality of legal systems functioning according to different religious rules for each religious community was perceived in NORP society as a genuine threat to NORP values and civil peace ( see PERSON ( ORG ) and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-II ) .", "CARDINAL . It should be noted in that connection that CARDINAL of the matters taken into consideration by ORG in CARDINAL judgments concerning the dissolution of political parties was the use of religious symbols to political ends ( judgments of CARDINAL DATE in LOC case and of DATE in the Fazilet Partisi case ) . It considered that the opinions expressed by the leaders of those parties , inter alia , on the question whether the NORP headscarf should be worn in the public sector and/or schools demonstrated an intention to set up a regime based on the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first piece of legislation on dress in higher - education institutions was a set of regulations that was issued by the ORG on DATE , which required staff working for public organisations and institutions and personnel and students at ORG institutions to wear ordinary , sober , modern dress . The regulations also provided that female members of staff and students should not wear veils in educational institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a circular on the wearing of headscarves in higher - education institutions . The NORP headscarf was banned in lecture theatres . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the regulations were lawful , noting :", "\u201c Beyond being a mere innocent practice , wearing the headscarf is in the process of becoming the symbol of a vision that is contrary to the freedoms of women and the fundamental principles of the Republic . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

A veil or headscarf covering the neck and hair may be worn out of religious conviction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE published in ORG of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the aforementioned provision was contrary to ORG ( secularism ) , CARDINAL ( equality before the law ) and CARDINAL ( freedom of religion ) of the LAW . It also found that it could not be reconciled with the principle of sexual equality implicit , inter alia , in NORP and revolutionary values ( see LAW and Article CARDINAL ) .", "In their judgment , the Constitutional Court judges explained , firstly , that secularism had acquired constitutional status by reason of the historical experience of the country and the particularities of ORG compared to other religions ; secularism was an essential condition for democracy and acted as a guarantor of freedom of religion and of equality before the law . It also prevented the ORG from showing a preference for a religion or belief ; consequently , a secular ORG could not invoke religious conviction when performing its legislative function .", "Stressing its inviolable nature , ORG observed that freedom of religion , conscience and worship , which could not be likened to a right to wear any particular religious attire , guaranteed first and foremost the liberty to decide whether or not to follow a religion . It explained that , once outside the private sphere of individual conscience , freedom to manifest one \u2019s religion could be restricted on public - order grounds to defend the principle of secularism .", "Everyone was free to dress how he or she wished , as the social and religious values and traditions of society also had to be respected . However , when a particular dress code was imposed on individuals by reference to a religion , the religion concerned was perceived and presented as a set of values that were incompatible with those of contemporary society . In addition , in GPE , where the majority of the population were NORP , presenting the wearing of the NORP headscarf as a mandatory religious duty would result in discrimination between practising NORP , non - practising NORP and non - believers on grounds of dress with anyone who refused to wear the headscarf undoubtedly being regarded as opposed to religion or as irreligious .", "ORG also said that students had to be able to work and pursue their education together in a calm , tolerant and mutually supportive atmosphere without being deflected from that goal by signs of religious affiliation . It found that , irrespective of whether the NORP headscarf was a precept of ORG , granting legal recognition to a religious symbol of that type in higher - education institutions was not compatible with the principle that ORG education must be neutral , as it would be liable to generate conflicts between students with differing religious convictions or beliefs .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of DATE , which was published in ORG of DATE , ORG noted that , in the light of the principles it had established in its judgment of DATE , the aforementioned provision did not allow headscarves to be worn in higher - education institutions on religious grounds and so was consistent with the LAW . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c In higher - education institutions , it is contrary to the principles of secularism and equality for the neck and hair to be covered with a veil or headscarf on grounds of religious belief . In these circumstances , the freedom of dress which the impugned provision permits in higher - education institutions \u2018 does not concern dress of a religious nature or the act of covering one \u2019s neck and hair with a veil and ORG ... The freedom afforded by this provision [ transitional LAW ] is conditional on its not being contrary \u2018 to the laws in CARDINAL . The judgment [ of DATE ] of ORG establishes that covering one \u2019s neck and hair with the headscarf is first and foremost contrary to LAW . Consequently , the condition set out in the aforementioned section requiring [ choice of ] dress not to contravene the laws in force removes from the scope of freedom of dress the act of \u2018 covering one \u2019s neck and hair with the headscarf\u2019 ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
