The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr S. was fatally injured by a shot fired at a travellers ' encampment ( campo nomadi ) in GPE . The initial statements taken by the police from witnesses indicated that the applicant had been responsible for the killing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE investigating judge made an order for the applicant 's detention pending trial . However , the order could not be enforced as the applicant had become untraceable . As a result , the NORP authorities considered that he had deliberately sought to evade justice and on DATE declared him to be a \u201c fugitive \u201d ( latitante ) . The applicant was identified as PERSON ( or PERSON ) PERSON ( or PERSON ) , probably born in PERSON on DATE , the son of PERSON ( or PERSON ) and the brother of PERSON ( ou PERSON ) PERSON ( or PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . As the NORP authorities had not managed to contact the applicant to invite him to choose his own defence counsel , they assigned him a lawyer , who was informed that his client and CARDINAL other persons had been committed for trial on a specified date in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyer took part in the trial , but the applicant was absent .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of murder and illegally carrying a weapon and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . CARDINAL of the applicant 's fellow defendants was sentenced to DATE and DATE imprisonment for the same offences , while the other CARDINAL were acquitted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer was informed that ORG judgment had been deposited with the registry . He did not appeal . The applicant 's conviction accordingly became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE by the NORP police under an arrest warrant issued by the GPE public prosecutor 's office . On DATE the NORP Minister of ORG requested the applicant 's extradition . He added that , once he had been extradited to GPE , the applicant would be entitled to apply under LAW of LAW for leave to appeal out of time against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the NORP authorities , the GPE public prosecutor 's office stated that it did not appear from the evidence that the applicant had been officially notified of the charges against him . The public prosecutor 's office was unable to say whether the applicant had contacted the lawyer assigned to represent him . In any event , the lawyer had attended the trial and had played an active role in conducting his client 's defence , having called a large number of witnesses . Furthermore , ORG had clearly established that the applicant , who had been identified by numerous witnesses as PERSON killer , was guilty . In the opinion of the public prosecutor 's office , the applicant had absconded immediately after PERSON death precisely to avoid being arrested and tried . Lastly , the public prosecutor 's office stated : \u201c A person who is to be extradited may seek leave to appeal against the judgment . However , for a court to agree to re - examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a ' fugitive ' . To sum up , a new trial , even in the form of an appeal ( during which new evidence may be submitted ) , is not granted automatically . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities refused the NORP government 's extradition request on the ground that the requesting country 's domestic legislation did not guarantee with sufficient certainty that the applicant would have the opportunity of having his trial reopened .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant had been released on DATE . He has never lodged an objection to execution ( incidente d'esecuzione ) or an application for leave to appeal out of time ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The validity of a conviction may be contested by means of an objection to execution under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the relevant parts of which provide :", "\u201c Where the judge supervising enforcement establishes that a judgment is invalid or has not become enforceable , he shall , [ after ] assessing on the merits [ nel merito ] whether the safeguards in place for a convicted person deemed to be untraceable have been observed , ... suspend its enforcement , ordering , where necessary , that the person be released and that defects in the service of process be remedied . In such cases the time allowed for appealing shall begin to run again . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG provides for the possibility of applying for leave to appeal out of time . The relevant parts of that provision were worded as follows at the time of the applicant 's arrest :", "\u201c In the event of conviction in absentia ... , the defendant may request the reopening of the time allowed for appeal against the judgment where he can establish that he had no effective knowledge [ effettiva conoscenza ] [ of it ] ... [ and ] on condition that no appeal has been lodged by his lawyer and there has been no negligence on his part or , in the case of a conviction in absentia having been served ... on his lawyer ... , that he did not deliberately refuse to take cognisance of the procedural steps .", "A request for the reopening of the time allowed for appeal must be lodged within DATE of the date ... on which the defendant learned [ of the judgment ] , failing which it shall be declared inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When called upon to interpret this provision , ORG has held that the rejection of an application for leave to appeal out of time can not be justified by mere negligence or lack of interest on the defendant 's part but that , on the contrary , there must have been \u201c intentional conduct designed to avoid taking cognisance of the procedural steps \u201d ( see ORG judgment of DATE ( no . DATE ) in ORG , and also ORG judgment no . DATE ) . More specifically , where a judgment has been served on the accused in person , the accused must prove that he or she was unaware of it and that there has been no negligence on his or her part ; however , where the judgment has been served on an absent defendant 's lawyer , it is for the court to establish whether the defendant deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the relevant steps ( see ORG judgment of DATE ( no . DATE ) in PERSON , where ORG set aside an order in which ORG had held that negligence could only be due to the wish not to receive any information , thereby treating negligent conduct as intentional without giving any arguments in support of that position ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ( no . DATE ) in FAC , ORG ( First Section ) observed that leave to appeal out of time could be granted on CARDINAL conditions : if the accused had not had any knowledge of the proceedings and if he or she had not deliberately avoided taking cognisance of the procedural steps . It was for the convicted person to prove that the first condition was satisfied , whereas the burden of proof in respect of the second lay with the \u201c representative of the prosecution or with the court \u201d . Accordingly , a lack of evidence as regards the second condition could only work to the defendant 's advantage . ORG accordingly held that , before declaring defendants to be \u201c fugitives \u201d , the authorities should not only search for themthey had intentionally avoided complying with a measure ordered by the court , such as a measure entailing deprivation of liberty ( see the First Section 's judgment of DATE ( no .

The new version of paragraph CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c In the event of conviction in absentia ... the time allowed for appeal against the judgment shall be reopened , on an application by the defendant , unless he had effective knowledge [ effettiva conoscenza ] of the proceedings [ against him ] or of the judgment [ provvedimento ] and has deliberately refused to appear or to appeal against the judgment . The judicial authorities shall carry out all necessary checks to that end . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Law no .
