AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a national of ORG , who was born in DATE and currently lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows :", "The applicant has been living in GPE since DATE . His wife followed him in DATE and their CARDINAL children were born there .", "On DATE ORG Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) imposed a DATE residence ban on the applicant pursuant to section QUANTITY of the DATE LAW ( PERSON ) . It referred to the applicant \u2019s conviction on charges of burglary and coercion , for which he had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Further , it had regard to CARDINAL convictions in relation to administrative offences for which he had been fined . It found that although the issue of a residence ban constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s private and family life , the public interest outweighed the applicant \u2019s personal interests in remaining in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ) confirmed the decision , but reduced the duration of the residence ban to DATE .", "Subsequently , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for suspensive effect .", "On DATE LAW DATE entered into force ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s complaint to be devoid of purpose and discontinued the proceedings .", "It noted in the first place that , pursuant to LAW , the conditions for issuing a residence ban differed from those set out in LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . In the present case , the requirements of LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW to discontinue proceedings were fulfilled for the following reasons : Unlike section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , under which the authority had to issue a residence ban if the conditions were met , section CARDINAL of LAW left a certain degree of discretion to the authority . In the proceedings conducted so far , the applicant had not had the opportunity to submit facts , which - having regard to the authority \u2019s discretion - could militate against the issue of a residence ban . Moreover , the residence ban against the applicant was not one which could obviously be based on the provisions of LAW . This was why the applicant \u2019s complaint had become devoid of purpose and the proceedings had to be discontinued . Referring to section QUANTITY , ORG found that the applicant had to bear his own costs . ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "As a consequence of ORG decision , the residence ban proceedings were remitted to the first instance authority .", "On DATE ORG again imposed a DATE residence ban on the applicant pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW . It had regard to the fact that , in addition to the conviction already relied on in the residence ban of DATE , the applicant had also been convicted of negligently causing bodily harm , of intentionally causing bodily harm and of poaching and , in each case , had been sentenced to a fine . Moreover , his convictions for administrative offences had in the meantime increased to a total of CARDINAL . The applicant had , thus , shown a continuous disrespect for the NORP legal order . Although the issue of a residence ban constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s private and family life , it was necessary for the prevention of disorder and crime .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal and his further complaint to ORG remained unsuccessful .", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act contains transitional provisions relating inter alia to residence bans . So far as relevant it reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A residence ban , which is being challenged in proceedings before ORG or ORG , ceases to be effective on DATE of entry into force of this LAW , unless it obviously has a basis in the provisions of this LAW . ORG ...", "( CARDINAL ) In cases falling under paragraph CARDINAL ... the complaint [ to ORG or ORG ] has to be declared devoid of purpose and the proceedings are to be discontinued without hearing the applicant . ... \u201d", "ORG has to decide in each of such pending cases whether the conditions for discontinuing the proceedings are met . Following a decision discontinuing the proceedings pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , the residence ban proceedings are remitted to the first instance authority .", "Section CARDINAL , so far as material , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ... section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) .. applies to proceedings which are pending at the time of the entry into force of this LAW and are ... not to be rejected as being inadmissible . The parties to these proceedings have to bear their own costs . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that the prevailing party may claim the reimbursement of their costs from the unsuccessful party ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
