The \u201c FAC paid for PERCENT of the gas it had consumed . For example , in DATE GPE consumed MONEY worth of gas , but paid for PERCENT ( MONEY ) . ORG explained that since the \u201c FAC was not recognised as a separate entity under international law , it could not have its own sovereign debts and GPE did not effect separate gas supplies for GPE and GPE . The bill for supplying gas to GPE was , therefore , attributed to GPE . The supply of gas to the region was organised through the NORP public corporation ORG and the joint stock company PERSON , which was owned jointly by GPE and the \u201c FAC . The debt owed by PERSON to GPE exceeded MONEY , of which MONEY related to gas consumed in GPE . ORG could not simply refuse to supply gas to the region , since it needed pipelines through GPE to supply GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further alleged that GPE provided direct humanitarian aid to GPE , mostly in the form of contributions to old - age pensions . The applicants claimed that official NORP sources stated that DATE the total volume of financial assistance to GPE was MONEY . ORG submitted that in DATE the \u201c FAC received financial aid from GPE totalling MONEY . ORG submitted that the amount of aid given to NORP citizens living in the region for humanitarian purposes , such as the payment of pensions and assistance with catering in schools , prisons and hospitals , was fully transparent , and could be compared with humanitarian aid provided by ORG .

In addition , the applicants claimed that CARDINAL individuals living in GPE had been granted NORP citizenship . These included many of the \u201c FAC leaders .

The declaration welcomed the initiative of President PERSON , hoping that it would become \u2018 a major factor in the achievement by GPE of its territorial and civil unity\u2019 .

It called for additional efforts by the international community and GPE in this respect .", "CARDINAL .

At all of their latest meetings they called for resuming direct , continuing dialogue on resolution of the conflict .", "CARDINAL . More delicate is the position of GPE . It is clear that through its military and economic presence and thanks to the strong cultural and linguistic links with GPE , GPE would like to retain its strong influence over the territory . The press recently reported the existence of an \u2018 Action plan of retaining NORP influence in LOC , details of which are kept secret . GPE is still strongly attached to the so - called \u2018 PERSON of DATE , which proposed to GPE a federal solution . GPE had nearly accepted the plan ; it refused to sign it at TIME , allegedly under Western influence .", "CARDINAL . Over DATE , there have been several signs of tension .

Both appeals adopted by the NORP parliament called on ORG for support and , concerning the democratisation of GPE , to engage actively in the process . During our visit in GPE our interlocutors repeatedly stressed the importance they attached to the expertise and experience of our organisation in this respect . The documents adopted by ORG were officially submitted by its Speaker to ORG \u2018 for examination in the framework of the GPE \u2019s monitoring GPE and for \u2018 analysis , comments and recommendations , as well as ideas of ORG that could contribute to the democratisation of the PERSON region and final settlement of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the first sight , the plan should be followed closely by ORG , as the leading organisation in the field of democracy , human rights and rule of law . The ORG has therefore entrusted us with the responsibility of visiting GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE in order to meet the main figures responsible for the NORP plan and get acquainted with all its details . On the basis of this information we will make specific proposals for the ORG to play an effective part in the plan \u2019s progress .", "CARDINAL . A number of questions remain about the implementation of the NORP plan and the conditions set by the NORP parliament .

Not only GPE , whose territorial integrity and sovereignty have been violated , but LOC as a whole can no longer afford to have this \u2018 black hole\u2019 on its territory .
