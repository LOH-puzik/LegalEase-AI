It was then that the fire brigade arrived \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP Deputy sergeant L. was also questioned on DATE . He stated that he had received instructions from his headquarters to go to a pharmacy and had been informed that PERSON \u201c suffered from psychiatric disorders \u201d . He confirmed that PERSON had put up a violent struggle before letting himself slide to the ground in front of the entrance to the pharmacy . He explained that constable PERSON had administered CARDINAL punches to the abdomen , using a technique known as \u201c diversionary blows \u201d . As regards the rest , he confirmed the above - mentioned conditions in which PERSON had been handcuffed in the police van .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy was carried out on CARDINAL DATE . The forensic doctor described and explained the traumatic injuries observed : the injury to the left eyebrow and the associated swelling did not suggest injuries following a blow but were related to an impact by that part of his face on a ridged surface . The other facial injuries suggested close contact on a rough surface . The injuries to the wrists were characteristic of handcuffing . Those to the lower part of the chest and in the abdominal cavity could have been incurred as a result of CARDINAL violent blows to that area . The forensic doctor specifed that the injuries had caused neither internal bleeding nor fractures . He mainly noted marks on the lungs and PERCENT stenosis on a heart artery . PERSON report , drawn up on DATE , contained the following conclusions :", "\u201c Death in all likelihood occurred as a result of heart failure .", "An atheromatous attack observed on an artery of the heart exposed him to a severe risk of cardiac rhythm disorders and sudden death .", "The state of stress and agitation presented by the victim on his arrest may have contributed to heart failure .", "Restriction of chest expansion may have occurred when the victim was restrained , but it can not be affirmed that mechanical asphyxiation was the cause of death . ...", "Recent traumatic injuries consistent with action by third parties were observed . In any event , the various injuries did not directly contribute to the death ; nor is there any injury consistent with blows to the face . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Ms S. , a shopkeeper , was questioned and stated that she had heard shouts from her shop opposite the pharmacy . She said that she had seen QUANTITY police officers with a man lying face down with his arms behind his back being punched and kicked . Through a side window of the police van she stated that she had seen a female and a male police officer trampling on the spot while hanging on to the roof of the van , CARDINAL administering CARDINAL punches in a downwards movement and lifting his knee up very high before bringing it down in CARDINAL sharp movement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the shopkeeper \u2019s minor son was questioned and stated that he had seen CARDINAL police officers trampling on PERSON in the road and that a female police officer had hit him several times with a truncheon in the stomach , back and face .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE chief brigadier PERSON , an instructor in defence and arrest techniques and in the psychological and behavioural aspects of police intervention , was heard as a witness . He stated that in the event of a dispute between people , \u201c the opposing parties should in so far as possible be separated \u201d : the police officers , in attempting to induce the PERSON to leave the pharmacy , had sought to avoid a fight in the shop . He said that the blows administered by constable PERSON and described as \u201c CARDINAL punches to the suspect \u2019s abdominal area with the aim of distracting and and securely handcuffing him [ were ] among the priority areas for attempting to weaken the resistance of the person concerned . They [ the police officers ] had not been over zealous and had completed the handcuffing in the front . The officers had also acted in an emergency situation . The technique used by constable PERSON appear[ed ] the most appropriate in the context of the intervention \u201d . He added that all the techniques taught were designed to weaken resistance to arrest . He specified that , with regard to the immobilisation of PERSON in the van , standing on a person \u2019s buttocks was not among the techniques taught and that positioning oneself across PERSON \u2019s shoulders , as sergeant PERSON had done , was one of the procedures taught . That technique enabled the officer to prevent the suspect from moving while avoiding postural asphyxiation . He concluded that the intervening officers , having regard to the context of the intervention , had acted with pragmatism and discernment .", "CARDINAL . Reports were produced by several experts appointed by CARDINAL of the investigating judges . On DATE Dr L. , professor of forensic medicine , and Dr NORP , lecturer in forensic medicine , provided a forensic medical report after examining PERSON \u2019s body on DATE . They stated that their examinations had revealed \u201c a series of cutaneous lesions that could not have contributed to the death \u201d . They did not indicate evidence of any \u201c factor suggesting death by chest compression \u201d . There was thus no evidence of \u201c petechial subconjunctival injuries or of facial petechial injuries \u201d . They stated as follows :", "\u201c our examination of the sealed evidence has not revealed any elements indicating the cause of death of [ M.B. ] . The sealed evidence shows that he was receiving psychiatric treatment for psychosis with several episodes of hallucination requiring the regular ingestion of antipsychotic medicines . ... At the levels measured , the ingestion of psychoactive drugs revealed by the toxicological investigations does not appear capable of explaining the victim \u2019s death by a process of direct toxicity . ... In conclusion , the death of [ M.B. ] ... is in all likelihood the result of myocardial failure . The death is due to natural causes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON produced their anatomopathological expert report after examining a copy of the autopsy report of DATE , a copy of the interviews with the members of the police patrol team who had arrested PERSON , a copy of the record of examination of CARDINAL witnesses , various sealed samples collected both by PERSON and by Professor PERSON and PERSON :", "\u201c [ ORG ] died suddenly of cardiac rhythm disorders owing to a coronary spasm triggered by a context of intense and prolonged emotional and physical stress . ... In conclusion , the intense and prolonged emotional stress , and the prolonged and severe agitation , which started in the pharmacy and contined during the arrest explain the series of physiopathological phenomena which caused the death : ( CARDINAL ) intense stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system ( adrenergic neuro - hormonal system ) , ( CARDINAL ) coronary - ischemic spasm , ( CARDINAL ) fatal cardiac rhythm disorders . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and DATE the QUANTITY police officers appeared for the first time as assisted witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a reconstruction was organised , by the CARDINAL investigating judges in charge of the case , in the presence of the civil parties\u2019 lawyers and the assisted witnesses . During the visit to the scene the forensic doctor stated that he had not noted any traumatic injury consistent with the violence described by the witness PERSON , the only injuries suggesting direct action by a third party being those corresponding to the punches administered to the stomach .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , university professor , neurologist and psychiatrist , and head of a forensic medical department , examined PERSON \u2019s medical file at his psychiatrist \u2019s surgery , his medical file at the casualty department of ORG , and the medical file kept by PERSON \u2019s general practioner . He stated that PERSON , who had been receiving psychiatric care for DATE , had been admitted to a hospital psychiatric unit several times and presented a psychotic disorder characterised by delusional notions of a betwitching , persecutory and interpretative type During his most recent hospital consultation he had been diagnosed with paranoid psychosis , which is related to schizophrenia . PERSON concluded his report as follows :", "\u201c [ M.B. ] presented a serious psychiatric disorder , namely , delusional psychosis , which explains the initial altercation with the pharmacist and his subsequent state of extreme agitation when the police officers attempted to induce him to leave the pharmacy . It is also possible that the intervention by the police was interpreted in a delusional manner .", "When the ORG [ mobile emergency and intensive care service ] intervened the criterion of seriousness was ... the fact that [ M.B. ] had been suffering from heart failure for TIME .", "The superficial injuries observed , during the autopsy , to the right - hand side of the face and the front of the knees [ appear to him ] compatible with immobilisation on the floor of the van and the petechial injuries to the upper abdomen and the left abdominal region are compatible with punches administered as described in the autopsy report . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , an institution independent of the ORG , having the task , inter alia , of ensuring compliance by the police with their code of professional ethics , to whom a member of parliament had submitted the case , produced a report . He found that whilst the police officers had been very quick to seek the assistance of the fire brigade and the emergency medical service , it was regrettable that the situation had been inaccurately described by the incident room to the firemen prior to their intervention ( the latter had been informed of PERSON \u2019s \u201c withdrawal symptoms \u201d ) . He considered that there had been no imminent danger to people or property in the pharmacy and thus no urgent need to remove PERSON as soon as possible . He stated that the immobilisation and compression procedures carried out in the van had been dangerous and disproportionate . He described as \u201c amouting to a serious infringement of human dignity and to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of LAW \u201d the techniques used by constables NORP and PERSON to the floor of the police van . The ORG also noted conflicting statements by the police officers regarding whethere there had been physical violence other than the CARDINAL diversionary blows and pointed out that no witnesses had been present throughout the entire incident . The ORG concluded that the precipitation with which the police had acted had led them to make an erroneous assessment of PERSON \u2019s situation and to react in a stereotypical manner rather than adjust their conduct during the intervention , despite the fact that they knew that PERSON was receiving treatment for psychiatric disorders and that they had been able to observe abnormal behaviour on his part . He recommended reinforcing the initial and continuous training of police officers with regard to dealing with persons suffering from a mental disorder . Lastly , he recommended that disciplinary proceedings be brought against the QUANTITY police officers who had arrested PERSON for \u201c disproportionate use of force or failing to cease using such force \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON supplemented their expert report of DATE . They confirmed the conclusion of their earlier report and ruled out mechanical asphyxia : \u201c PERSON died suddenly of cardiac rhythm disorders , with no occurrence of mechanical asphyxia . \u201d They reiterated the part played by extreme stress in the death , stating that \u201c the adrenergic stimulation was related to the extreme and prolonged emotional and physical stress . The stress lasted TIME , starting in the pharmacy and continuing throughout the arrest \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL police officers who had arrested PERSON were charged with manslaughter as a result of the manifestly wilful violation of a legal or statutory duty of caution and security .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the the public prosecutor at the ORG tribunal de grande instance filed submissions recommending that the charges be dropped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judges ruled that there was no case to answer . They found that whilst it was true that PERSON had been in a relatively calm state , the pharmacist had nonetheless considered his behaviour sufficiently disturbing to inform the police of the presence in his establishment of a person in an agitated state and suffering from psychiatric disorders . They observed that the police officers had not immediately used force and that , on being informed of PERSON \u2019s pyschiatric pathology , they had called the emergency medical service . The judges found that the evidence given by PERSON had been invalidated by the observations made during the reconstruction , the statements made by the pharmacists and the conclusions of the forensic doctor . The investigating judges observed as follows :", "\u201c ... pinning [ M.B. ] to the ground was not identified by the medical experts as the direct cause of the death . Whilst the intervention by the police inevitably generated stress , the victim had already been stressed well before their intervention . As the police did not know about [ PERSON \u2019s ] heart disease , of which he himself was unaware , they could not foresee that the combination of these CARDINAL factors [ stress and heart disease ] could create a risk for the victim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judges considered that the force used by the police officers had been necessary and proportionate \u201c even if being pinned down in the van , by L. and P. and PERSON \u2019s position \u2013 standing on [ PERSON \u2019s ] legs \u2013 may appear objectionable in absolute terms \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that ruling . On DATE ORG of ORG upheld the decision finding no case to answer on the following grounds :", "\u201c [ PERSON \u2019s death was due ] according to the forensic doctor who carried out the initial autopsy ... to heart failure in circumstances of stress and effort acting on a predisposed heart condition ; the second forensic report supported the finding of cutaneous injuries that could not have been a contributory cause of death and ruled out death due to chest compression ; the experts indicated that the death of [ PERSON ] was , in all likelihood , the result of myocardial failure and natural causes ; the anatomopathological report ... [ led ] the experts to conclude that [ PERSON ] had died suddenly of cardiac rhythm disorders owing to a coronary spasm triggered by a context of intense and prolonged emotional and physical stress , and formally ruled out mechanical asphyxia ; lastly , the forensic and psychiatric expert ... concluded that [ PERSON ] presented a serious psychiatric disorder ... which explained the initial altercation with the pharmacist and the ensuing state of extreme agitation when the police officers attempted to induce him to leave the pharmacy , as their intervention could have been interpreted in a delusional manner \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the conditions of arrest , ORG found that the agitated state and the \u201c recalcitrant , not to say violent , behaviour of [ M.B. ] had obliged the police officers to use force and intervention techniques , which they had been taught , to restrain him \u201d , including the CARDINAL punches administered by constable PERSON \u201c who explained that he had used a technique taught to police officers to assist in handcuffing suspects by creating a surprise effect , that explanation being confirmed by his colleagues and instructor \u201d . ORG found that PERSON had been pinned to the floor of the van in conditions that had been \u201c admittedly unusual , or even objectionable \u201d , but that these had preserved the respiratory capacity and ventilation of a person who \u201c was continuing to oppose strong resistance to the police officers \u201d . It concluded that \u201c no inadvertence , lack of care , inattention , negligence or breach of a statutory or legal duty of protection or care , or gross negligence [ could ] be attributed [ to the police officers ] in the death of [ M.B. ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... ORG is satisfied on the basis of the grounds of the judgment being appealed that in upholding the decision finding no case to answer ORG , after analysing all the facts referred to it and addressing the main grounds in the statement of appeal , gave sufficient and coherent reasons for their finding that the investigation had been thorough and that there was insufficient evidence on which to convict the persons charged with of manslaughter or any other offence ... \u201d", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
