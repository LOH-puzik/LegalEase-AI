Even if the defendant had received building permit ... for construction of a tennis court during the time the land was privately owned by the plaintiffs or afterwards , namely after the nationalisation of the land , the possession of building permit itself is not a [ legal ] basis for losing or acquiring the right of ownership or , after nationalisation , the right to use the land .", "By unlawfully retaining the plaintiffs\u2019 land in its possession , the plaintiffs being the holders of the right to use that land , and by not paying them any compensation throughout the entire period the land was in its possession , the defendant is obliged to pay the plaintiffs compensation at their request corresponding at least to the level of rent they would have received if they had been leasing that land to third parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the applicants brought a civil action in ORG , seeking compensation from the tennis club for the use of the land in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ruled for the applicants , and ordered the tennis club to pay the applicants a total of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) in compensation for the use of the land in the period DATE and DATE , together with the accrued statutory default interest . In particular , it held as follows :", "\u201c ... section CARDINAL of LAW as amended by the DATE Amendments provided that only those sports facilities which sports organisations and associations or other legal entities had the right to use passed into the ownership of townships and municipalities in whose territory they were located .", "The defendant does not have the right to use the sports facilities built on the plot of land in dispute , because the right to use the land was , on the basis of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of [ LAW of DATE ] , recorded [ in the land register ] in the name of the GPE ancestors , which situation remained unaltered until the entry into force of LAW whereby the right to use was converted into the right of ownership of those recorded as users , that is , of the plaintiffs ...", "The defendant did not acquire even an unrecorded right of use , because [ the defendant ] did not provide the court with relevant evidence [ to that effect ] .

The immovable property at issue was never taken out of the possession of the plaintiffs in accordance with the law [ and ] in the relevant proceedings ; there is no decision by the relevant authority to that effect ; this last is not disputed between the parties . The plaintiffs and their ancestors were recorded as users and now ( co- ) owners of the land in question . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the defendant , by a judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) reversed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . It held that the right to use the land in question had been transferred to the tennis club by ORG of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) , and that by a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , based on the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the local authorities had become the owners of that land . This meant that since DATE the applicants had not had the right to use the land or to claim any compensation from the tennis club . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c In DATE the defendant had commenced the construction of tennis courts on the land in dispute , which was then nationalised on the basis of [ LAW of DATE ] . GPE , which had built the tennis courts , took possession of them and long after the nationalisation [ had taken place ] transferred to the defendant ( the tennis club ) , the right to administer , use and maintain the tennis courts by the self - management agreement of [ DATE , in accordance with the law .", "By the entry into force of the [ DATE ] LAW to LAW the social ownership of sports facilities was transformed by the operation of law , before the entry into force of LAW .

On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) by the applicants . It endorsed the reasons given by the second - instance court . It added , in reply to the applicants\u2019 main argument in their appeal :", "\u201c The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that section CARDINAL of LAW [ as amended by LAW ] is not applicable in the present case because [ the case ] does not concern sports facilities in social ownership which sports organisations had the right to use , is unfounded . In particular , the disputed immovable property had passed into social ownership on the basis of [ LAW of DATE ] ; the GPE ... had entered into possession of that property and commenced the construction of tennis courts and by ORG of [ DATE transferred to the defendant the right to manage , use and maintain the tennis courts . Therefore , the present case concerns immovable property in social ownership the defendant had the right to use and which , on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW [ as amended by DATE Amendments ] , passed into the ownership of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) against ORG judgment . Relying on Articles CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they alleged violations of their constitutional rights to equality before the law , equality before the courts , fair hearing and the right of ownership .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that those proceedings are still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicants brought a civil action in ORG against the tennis club , seeking repossession of the land in question . They argued that the tennis club was in possession of the tennis courts situated on that land without any legal basis .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the tennis club to surrender possession of the land to the applicants . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The defendant has been using the immovable property at issue by building a tennis court on it , which thus serves the needs of the defendant as a tennis club . As can be seen from the [ first proceedings for compensation ] the disputed immovable property has never been taken out of the plaintiffs\u2019 possession even though the defendant on several occasions unsuccessfully sought possession from [ the relevant authority within ] the former GPE . It is therefore indisputable that until DATE the immovable property in question has not been taken out of the plaintiffs\u2019 possession , which means that the defendant has been holding it unlawfully without a valid legal title . The plaintiffs therefore have the right to seek that the defendant vacate the property and surrender it to them .", "Section CARDINAL of the [ LAW of DATE ] provided that nationalised construction land was to remain in the possession of its former owners until they surrendered possession of the land to [ the local authorities ] or to another person , for construction of a building or other facility or for other works , or to allow another person to use it for compensation , on the basis of a decision by the [ relevant municipal authority ] . Section CARDINAL of that Act provided that the former owner of the nationalised undeveloped construction land had the right to use that land ... as long as it remained in his or her possession , free of charge", "Given that the relevant authority has not so far issued a decision on dispossession allowing the disputed immovable property to be taken from the possession of the plaintiffs , [ they ] still have the right to use it permanently , and the defendant has been unlawfully disturbing them in the exercise of that right , and has not been paying compensation for the entire period during which it has been using the immovable property at issue .", "In the light of the foregoing , and given that the land in dispute was not the subject of a decision by the Split Municipality or of any other relevant authority , and has not been taken out of the possession of the plaintiffs and ... given to the defendant for use , this court finds that the defendant does not have any [ legal ] basis to use the land at issue and thus has to surrender it to the plaintiffs ... to whom that right lawfully belongs . [ The ] plaintiffs\u2019 claim is therefore well - founded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the defendant , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the first \u2013 instance judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . In so doing it held as follows :", "\u201c It is undisputed that the plaintiffs succeeded in [ the first set of civil proceedings for compensation ] .", "What is disputed , however , is whether the plaintiffs can successfully seek repossession and return of the nationalised land relying on the absence of a decision by the relevant authority whereby the defendant would be allowed to take possession of the immovable property in question .", "In the view of this court [ this ] dispute is to be resolved by applying the provisions of LAW . LAW regulated transformation [ of ownership ] ... of sports facilities ...", "By the entry into force of the DATE LAW sports facilities ex lege passed from social ownership ... into the ownership of those townships and municipalities on whose territory they were located .", "Section CARDINALa of LAW provided that those entitled [ town councils or municipal councils ] had to pass an act taking over sports facilities and other immovable property within DATE of the day of the entry into force of the DATE LAW ...", "In ORG of the Split Municipality no .

They relied on LAW paragraph CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint . It held :", "\u201c The legal views expressed in the contested judgment are based on a constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law . ORG finds that the ORG gave reasons for its views expressed in the contested judgment , which indisputably are not the result of an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law .", "The immovable property in question , being socially owned , had been passed on the basis of LAW of LAW [ as amended by DATE Amendments ] into the ownership of GPE , which transferred them to the defendant , who has thus been using them on the basis of a valid legal title . ORG therefore finds that the second - instance court correctly applied the substantive law when holding that the complainants were not entitled to sue the defendant acting as the owners .", "As regards the ORG argument that the relevant provisions of LAW ( in particular section CARDINAL ) should have been applied in the present case , ORG notes that this provision is not relevant in the present instance . ORG finds that in the instant case the [ statutory ] requirement for returning the immovable property in question , which in kind constitutes a sports facility ( the Firule tennis courts ) , to the complainants was not satisfied because [ that property ] had been transferred into social ownership when [ LAW of DATE ] was applied . [ That is so because ] the transformation of social ownership of sports facilities was regulated by LAW , which entered into force before LAW .", "Since the second - instance court by reversing the first - instance judgment correctly applied the relevant substantive law and dismissed the complainant \u2019s action , the Constitutional Court finds that the ORG constitutional right guaranteed by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW was not breached ...", "ORG protects the right of ownership at the constitutional level in a manner that prevents restriction or taking of that right by the ORG authorities , unless a restriction or taking is provided for by law ... interferences with ownership by other legal subjects ( natural or legal persons ) are property disputes of a private - law nature . The ORG examines also such decisions of judicial and other authorities if it finds that the contested decision , having regard to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the LAW , is based on an erroneous or unacceptable legal view .", "Given the subject matter of the civil proceedings that preceded these proceedings before [ it ] , the Constitutional Court finds that the ORG right [ of ownership ] guaranteed by LAW were not breached . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
