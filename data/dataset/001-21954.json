Point a ) of the information concerns transactions with ORG . It alleges that ORG , chosen by the applicant to carry out the management of ORG investment portfolio , had charged the latter excessive fees . It alleges further that the applicant had requested a refund of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) for entrusting ORG with these financial transactions .", "On DATE preliminary investigations were opened against the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ( Wirtschaftspolizei ) carried out searches at the applicant \u2019s LOC and at the LOC of FAC , the former director of ORG , who was at the same time a witness against the applicant . CARDINAL diaries and CARDINAL pages of other documentary evidence ( the so - called \u201c green folder \u201d ) were seized at ORG \u2019s home . The documents which were considered relevant to the investigation were listed in a report of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the investigating judge at ORG heard the applicant . According to the TIME , the questioning started at TIME The applicant was informed that preliminary investigations on the suspicion of a breach of trust ( PERSON ) under LAW of LAW ) and on the suspicion of offences under LAW ( Aktiengesetz ) were pending against him . He was first heard as regards the alleged breach of LAW and then about the transactions with ORG . In this respect , he was told that he was suspected of having received a refund from PERSON and indications as to the amount at issue and the date of receipt were also given . The applicant stated that he was aware of the allegations and handed over a written statement outlining his position . The questioning on the transactions with ORG ended at TIME whereas the further questioning , which lasted until TIME , concerned facts which are not relevant in the present context .", "On DATE the investigating judge decided that the defence was not entitled to inspect certain specified parts of the file .

The latter confirmed in writing the receipt of the green folder , which was subsequently transmitted to an expert .", "On DATE ORG filed a supplementary information against the applicant concerning transactions with ORG .", "On DATE ORG filed another supplementary information against the applicant concerning new facts . It alleged that he had introduced L. as a fictitious intermediary in order to carry out certain financial transactions of ORG , a subsidiary of ORG , and that the commission paid had caused financial damage to ORG .", "On CARDINAL and DATE ORG filed further documentary evidence and information .", "On DATE ORG received the applicant \u2019s request to obtain the green folder from the expert in order to enable him to inspect it . He submitted that , according to the report of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , documents which were relevant to the proceedings had been seized at ORG \u2019s premises and had apparently been handed over to the expert who referred in his written opinion to CARDINAL of those documents . The investigating judge at ORG did not take any decision on this request .", "On DATE ORG preferred the CARDINAL - page indictment against the applicant and his co - accused , PERSON , concerning charges of breach of trust under LAW of LAW . The applicant was accused , inter alia , of having in DATE and DATE demanded and received a \u201c refund \u201d of about ORG CARDINAL for financial transactions carried out by ORG , and for having introduced , DATE , L. as a fictitious intermediary in order to carry out certain financial transactions of ORG , thus , creating a fictitious claim for commission , causing damage of about ATS CARDINAL .

The indictment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the investigating judge , upon the request of ORG on DATE , discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant inter alia as regards point a ) of the information concerning \u201c excessive fees for transactions with the GPE \u201d ( see above , the information of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "On DATE the applicant repeated his request that the green folder be made available to him .

When the co - accused , PERSON , was heard , the presiding judge ruled that the applicant was not allowed to be present . Neither the applicant nor his counsel contested this measure . Defence counsel was present during the interrogation . The applicant was re - admitted to the court room as soon as the questioning of PERSON was finished and the presiding judge gave him a summary of PERSON \u2019s statements . At that stage , neither the applicant nor his counsel asked for further information or complained that the summary of PERSON \u2019s statements was insufficient . The former director of ORG , PERSON , was heard as a witness in the presence of the applicant and the defence questioned him in some detail .", "On CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE further hearings were held and numerous witnesses were heard .", "It is in dispute between the parties when the green folder was made available to the defence . The Government submit that it was available as of DATE of the trial , whereas the applicant submits that he only received copies of parts of it on CARDINAL DATE , i.e. on DATE of the trial .", "On DATE , the last hearing day , the applicant \u2019s counsel filed a further application for the hearing of witnesses . According to the minutes , he also requested that documents from the green folder be read out and - in case it was disputed that PERSON was the author of those documents - to hear PERSON and to appoint a handwriting expert . At the close of the hearing the presiding judge dismissed all outstanding requests for the taking of further evidence .", "On DATE the court gave judgment , convicting the applicant of a breach of trust within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , and sentencing him to DATE imprisonment for having demanded and received a \u201c refund \u201d of about ORG CARDINAL for financial transactions carried out by ORG . He was also convicted of having introduced PERSON as a fictitious intermediary in order to carry out certain financial transactions of ORG , thus creating a fictitious claim for commission and causing damage of about ATS CARDINAL . It found that , in both cases , he had not transferred the commission to ORG and that he had abused his position as the financial director of ORG , causing it financial damage . The court recalled that the case - law on the question of whether the acceptance of commission by trustees fell within the scope of CARDINAL of LAW had been contradictory for some time , but had been settled by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in another case . According to that judgment , LAW was applicable to the applicant \u2019s case .", "On DATE the applicant filed a plea of nullity and an appeal ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde und Berufung ) . He complained about the refusal to hear several witnesses he had called for , and the fact that he had not had access to the green folder before the trial hearings . Thus he had not been able to prepare his defence properly . He further noted that he had not been present when his co - accused had been heard . He alleged that he had been insufficiently informed about the statements made by the co - accused afterwards . Furthermore , he criticised the evaluation of evidence . As to the facts concerning ORG , he alleged that his conviction violated the principle of ne bis in idem because the investigating judge had ordered the criminal proceedings to be discontinued in this respect on DATE . Finally , he complained that the court had erred in law when applying section QUANTITY of LAW to his case . He argued that it was LAW which was pertinent to the offence concerning the acceptance of advantages by trustees ( Geschenkannahme durch Machthaber ) . As this section had entered into force after he had committed the acts in issue , he could not be punished at all .", "On DATE the Attorney - General ( ORG ) filed CARDINAL pages of observations ( PERSON ) on the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity and his appeal .", "On DATE the applicant was notified that the hearing before ORG would take place on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , who was at that stage still represented by the lawyer who had filed his plea of nullity and appeal , received the Attorney - General \u2019s observations and was informed that he could comment on them within a delay of DATE . He sent his CARDINAL - page reply by mail on DATE , which reached ORG DATE . He did not request an adjournment of the hearing .", "On DATE the hearing took place and ORG confirmed ORG judgment .", "As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that he had not been adequately informed about the statement of his co - accused L. , who had been heard in his absence , ORG noted that the presiding judge had given the necessary information by way of a summary of the statements . It would have been open to defence counsel to challenge the applicant \u2019s exclusion from PERSON \u2019s hearing and to complain about the alleged insufficiency of the summary of L \u2019s evidence , in order to obtain an interim decision from the court in this respect .", "Further , ORG found that the court of first instance had justifiably refused to hear certain witnesses as it had in any case considered that the facts to be proved by those witnesses had already been established . Thus , the refusal did not cause any prejudice to the applicant .", "As to the green folder , it noted that the applicant could have applied for the further questioning of PERSON after having obtained the folder , but that he failed to make such an application and had therefore not fulfilled the conditions for a plea of nullity in this respect .", "ORG found that the applicant \u2019s further submissions constituted an inadmissible attempt to challenge ORG assessment of the evidence , which was duly reasoned and free from contradiction .", "As to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG confirmed that it was applicable to the applicant \u2019s case . Finally , it found that the facts described in the investigating judge \u2019s order of DATE , namely \u201c excessive fees for transactions with the ORG \u201d were not identical to those facts underlying the conviction , namely the receipt of refunds by the applicant . Therefore , the conviction did not violate the principle of ne bis in idem ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
