The first applicant settled in GPE in DATE . On DATE he married the second applicant there . Shortly after the marriage he was granted a permanent residence permit . Their daughter , the third applicant , was born in GPE on DATE . Before DATE the first applicant worked as a driver for a limited liability company in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Regional Director of ORG in GPE made an order for the first applicant \u2019s expulsion . He also deprived him of the right to reside in GPE and excluded him from NORP territory for a period of DATE , \u201c on the ground that [ he ] present[ed ] a serious threat to national security and in view of the reasons set out in proposal no . PERSON by the head of the security department of ORG \u201d . The Director \u2019s decision relied on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , taken in conjunction with section DATE ) and ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . No factual grounds were given , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The order further provided that the first applicant was to be detained until it could be enforced . Finally , it stated that it was subject to appeal to the Minister of ORG , but not subject to judicial review , in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , and that it was immediately enforceable , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the first applicant was summoned to a police station in GPE , where he was served with the order and detained with a view to his expulsion . He was deported to GPE DATE , without being allowed to get in touch with his wife and daughter or a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Once in GPE , the first applicant hired a lawyer in GPE with the help of his wife \u2013 the second applicant DATE , and on DATE appealed to the Minister of ORG . He said that he had had an established family life in GPE for DATE and complained that while being held at the police station on DATE he had not been informed why he was considered a threat to national security . Nor had this become apparent from the decision to expel him , which had merely referred to the legal grounds on which it was made . The first applicant further complained that he had not been apprised of the proposal which served as the basis for the decision . All of this amounted to a failure to give reasons , in breach of the rules of administrative procedure .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE sent to the first applicant \u2019s former address in GPE , the head of the complaints department of ORG informed him that the Minister had dismissed the appeal in a decision of DATE , because the impugned order had been made by a competent authority , in due form , in compliance with the applicable substantive and procedural rules and in conformity with the aim of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant sought judicial review of the Minister \u2019s order by ORG . He argued that no reasons had been given for the order , depriving him of any protection against arbitrariness because he had been unable to discover which actions on his part had been deemed a threat to national security . He also argued that the measures against him had interfered with his family life . However , the authorities had disregarded this and had not examined whether a fair balance had been struck between his rights and the public interest , contrary to LAW , which formed part of domestic law . In that connection he relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , which had previously led ORG to change its caselaw in this sphere ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the first applicant that the case had been transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A hearing listed for DATE failed to take place because ORG had not received a copy of the application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was held on DATE . The court admitted in evidence proposal no . SCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , which had served as the basis for the decision against the first applicant . The first applicant was not allowed to familiarise himself with this document .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the application . To begin with , it held that the bar to judicial review set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was contrary to the LAW and was thus to be disregarded . It relied on LOC ( cited above ) and the relevant caselaw of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Examining the application on the merits , the court held :", "\u201c The coercive measures are based ... on the ground that the [ first applicant ] represents a serious threat to national security , for the reasons set out in proposal no . SCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ...", "In upholding the impugned order , the Minister of ORG states that the evidence gathered clearly establishes that the [ first applicant ] is a member of a criminal gang dealing in illicit narcotic drugs ; this , on the CARDINAL hand , constitutes grounds under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] , and , on the other , is a circumstance requiring the administrative authority to take coercive measures . Under section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] , \u2018 the expulsion of an alien must be carried out if his or her presence in the country creates a serious threat to national security or public ORG . On expulsion , the alien must also be deprived of the right to reside in GPE and be banned from entering it . The imposition of [ these measures ] is necessary in the cases set out in section CARDINAL of the [ LAW ] . The order refers to the grounds set forth in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , which [ provides for the mandatory expulsion of ] \u2018 an alien who is known to be a member of a criminal gang or organisation or to be engaged in terrorist activities , smuggling or unlawful transactions with arms , explosives , ammunitions , strategic raw materials , goods and technologies with a possible dual use , or in the unlawful trafficking of intoxicating or psychotropic substances or precursors or raw materials for their production\u2019 . The order states that there is information to the effect that the [ first applicant ] has participated in the unlawful trafficking of intoxicating and psychotropic substances and precursors and raw materials for their production . This has been established from the enclosed secret file ( classified in accordance with LAW and [ Schedule CARDINAL ] , Part CARDINAL , point CARDINAL of the [ Protection of Classified Information Act of DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ] ) containing the proposal to impose coercive measures to which the impugned order refers . According to this proposal , the data come from secret surveillance measures and information from operative sources gathered by ORG in DATE , showing that [ the first applicant ] has acted as an intermediary in the supply of narcotic drugs and maintains regular contacts with NORP citizens who distribute narcotic drugs and intoxicating substances in the territory of the towns of GPE and GPE .", "The CARDINAL measures imposed on the [ first applicant ] are based on section ORG ) of the [ LAW ] . ... According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of [ that LAW ] taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] , such an order must refer only to the legal and not the factual grounds for imposition of the coercive measures . As may be seen from the order , it fully complies with the requirements of [ these provisions ] .", "There is no dispute as to the competence of the authority which made the order . [ The first applicant alleges ] breaches of the rules of procedure , but none has been found by the court . Section CARDINAL of the [ LAW ] does not lay down any special rules of procedure ... No procedural violations have been found in the fact that the proposal for coercive measures was made secret , as from its last page it may be seen that it was made on DATE and was classified on DATE ...", "[ The court will now examine ORG [ first applicant ] \u2019s objections concerning the lack of factual grounds for imposition of the measures . The legal grounds cited in the order require the existence of information concerning the facts referred to in sections CARDINAL and ORG of the [ DATE LAW ] , taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) . Concerning the [ first applicant \u2019s ] objections in this regard , it must be stressed that the [ law refers to ] information relating to such facts rather than proof thereof . The availability of proof would produce different legal consequences for the [ first applicant ] .", "The impugned order imposes coercive measures which , according to LAW DATE ] , are applied in order to preempt and put an end to administrative and other offences , as well as to preempt and redress their harmful consequences .", "The information was gathered through the use of secret surveillance measures and through operative sources of ORG , as may be seen from the proposal cited in the order . According to the definition of the [ LAW ] , the measures concerned comprise technical means ( electronic and mechanical devices , as well as substances which are used for recording the activity of monitored persons and objects ) and operative methods ( surveillance , tapping , following , covert entry of LOC , marking and checking of correspondence and computerised information , which are employed during the use of technical devices ) used for the preparation of physical evidence in the form of videotapes , audiotapes , photographs and marked objects . Under LAW of this LAW , these may also be used for preventing offences ... They are used against persons who are suspected of preparing or perpetrating or of having perpetrated serious crimes . The evidence thus obtained is kept either by ORG until the institution of a preliminary investigation , or by the respective judicial authorities . Any item not used for the preparation of evidence has to be destroyed .", "The nature of the source of information which led to the issuing of the impugned order makes it impossible to adduce further evidence relating to the facts . However , this by no means leads to a finding that the coercive measures were unlawful . Moreover , the [ first applicant ] does not dispute the facts ; he merely challenges the use of information concerning them as grounds for the coercive measures imposed . The [ court ] finds that the facts set out in the proposal can serve as the basis for application of sections CARDINAL and ORG of the [ DATE LAW taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ] . In view of the foregoing , the [ court ] concludes that the impugned order was in accordance with the requirements of the substantive law .", "The [ first applicant ] \u2019s last objection concerns the noncompliance of the impugned order with the aim of the law . He relies on his longstanding family life in GPE , his marriage to a NORP citizen and the nineyearold child born from this marriage ( all facts which have been acknowledged by the parties and the court ) ...", "However , all these circumstances have no bearing on the lawfulness of the order under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the [ LAW ] , still less on its compliance with the aims of the law , as the law in question provides for the restriction of certain rights for the purpose of preventing the commission of offences .", "In this context , the [ first applicant ] \u2019s reliance on [ PERSON , cited above ] is misplaced , as this case concerns the right to seek judicial review , which is available to the [ first applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that the police had not adduced any evidence that he had done anything to put national security in jeopardy . They had merely presented a document which recounted information whose source was unknown . The socalled \u201c proposal \u201d contained only general conclusions which were based on facts not made known to the court . This was problematic , as the court \u2019s task was to guarantee that the executive \u2019s discretion had not been exercised in an arbitrary fashion . Moreover , there were no objective facts showing that the first applicant had committed any offence . This had to be proved , not merely alleged . The first applicant further submitted that the impugned order had seriously infringed his right to respect for his family life , contrary to LAW . He relied extensively on PERSON ( cited above ) and PERSON v. the GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , and asserted that the existing legal framework did not provide sufficient guarantees against arbitrariness . Moreover , the lower court had not examined the proportionality of the interference , contrary to the approach of ORG in all cases under LAW . The impugned order had broken off the longstanding relationships with his wife and daughter . If there was reason to suspect that he had engaged in unlawful activities , it would have been more appropriate to prosecute and try him , which would have entailed the production of serious evidence of his alleged wrongdoing .", "CARDINAL . After holding a hearing on DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment on DATE . Its opinion , in its relevant parts , reads as follows :", "\u201c ... [ This court ] finds that the conclusions of the firstinstance court as to the lawfulness of the impugned order were correct and wellfounded .", "According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ LAW ] , an alien \u2019s expulsion is necessary if his or her presence in the country puts national security or public order in serious jeopardy . LAW of that section provides that whenever [ a person is expelled ] his or her right to reside in GPE is also revoked and he or she is prohibited from entering the country .", "According to section ORG of the same LAW , the prohibition on entering the country is imposed under the circumstances set out in LAW [ of the LAW ] . The impugned order by the director of ORG states that the [ first applicant \u2019s case ] falls under points CARDINAL and CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the [ LAW ] , in that through his actions he has jeopardised the security and the interests of ORG or is known to have acted against the security interests of the country , to have been a member of a criminal gang or organisation or to have engaged in terrorist activities , smuggling or unlawful transactions with arms , explosives , ammunitions , strategic raw materials , goods or technologies with a possible dual use , or in the illicit trafficking of intoxicating or psychotropic substances or precursors or raw materials for their production .", "It has been established in the present case that [ the first applicant ] has acted as an intermediary for the supply of narcotics and maintains regular contacts with NORP citizens who distribute narcotics and intoxicating substances in the territory of the towns of GPE and GPE .", "The impugned order was issued on the basis of proposal no .

The administrative authority has no discretion as to whether or not to make the order . As the law does not provide for exceptions which might allow [ the authority not to make an order for expulsion ] , the expulsion is lawful provided the required conditions are in place .", "The impugned order was made in accordance with the purpose of the law and in accordance with the [ applicable ] substantive and procedural rules . The administrative authority elucidated the relevant facts and specified the legal grounds for making the order . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
