At the conclusion of the last - mentioned hearing , ORG pronounced its judgment dismissing the action . In doing so , it found that the applicant had failed to show that she had lawfully acquired title to the vehicle and concluded that the defendant had lawfully acquired it by way of purchase from the receiver appointed to act in connection with the insolvency of the vehicle \u2019s previous owner , a legal entity with which the applicant had been involved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal ( odvolanie ) contesting en bloc the ORG assessment of the facts and the interpretation and application of the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a specific written request by ORG dated DATE , she objected to having her appeal decided without a public hearing .", "CARDINAL .

No hearing of the appeal was held . In the written version of the judgment , no mention is made of the defendant \u2019s observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) . She relied on Article CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , under which such an appeal was admissible if the courts had prevented a party to the proceedings from pursuing a case before them .", "She also invoked LAW and argued , inter alia , ( i ) that ORG had ruled on her appeal without having held a public hearing , despite her objection to such a course of action ; ( ii ) that the defendant \u2019s observations in reply to her appeal had not been communicated to her ; and ( iii ) that ORG had not only failed to summon her to a public pronouncement of its judgment but had , indeed , failed to pronounce that judgment publicly at all .", "CARDINAL .

ORG added that , however , such observations \u201c should \u201d be communicated to the appellant only if they had a conclusive influence on the decision of ORG .", "In that regard , referring to the contents of the case file , ORG held that the observations made by the defendant in reply to the applicant \u2019s appeal had had no impact at all on ORG decision and concluded that , consequently , the failure to communicate those observations to the applicant was irrelevant in legal terms .", "CARDINAL . ORG also referred to Article CARDINAL of the ORG , pursuant to which a judgment must always be pronounced publicly ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and , in matters decided without a hearing , the time and place of the pronouncement must be announced on the official notice board of the given court DATE before the pronouncement ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .
