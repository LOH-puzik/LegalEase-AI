The [ CARDINAL Act ] is a manifestation of the common will of all political parties in ... ORG to ensure , as far as possible , the disclosure of all documents [ of the former security services ] and the exposure of all persons affiliated [ to those services ] who held or now hold public office , or who carried out or now carry out public activities within the meaning of this LAW ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) . The LAW was passed in response to the recommendations set out in the Declaration of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co - operation in LOC ( OSCE ) of DATE , in LAW ( DATE ) of ORG of ORG , on the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems , and in Recommendation No . R ( DATE ) CARDINAL of ORG on a NORP Policy on Access to Archives , adopted by ORG on DATE .", "The Act seeks to regulate the manner in which the documents of the [ former security services ] from DATE and DATE are to be accessed , disclosed , used and kept , and to expose the affiliation to [ those services ] of NORP citizens holding public office or carrying out a public activity . By section CARDINAL of the Act , such affiliation is to be exposed if the person concerned has acted as a regular staff member , a supernumerary staff member , or a secret collaborator of [ those services ] . Under section CARDINAL of the Act , the fact is established on the basis of documents from the information sources , which are different for regular staff members , supernumerary staff members and secret collaborators , and have been set out respectively in subsections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of section QUANTITY . In accordance with the impugned section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the fact under section CARDINAL that someone has acted as a secret collaborator is to be established not only on the basis of documents which have been handwritten or signed by him or her , but also on the basis of the following documents contained in the information sources : \u2018 documents drawn up by the regular or supernumerary staff member who was the handler of [ the person concerned ] , as well as information about the person in the reference records ( registration journals and card indexes [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] ) , records relating to the destruction of information , or other information ORG .", "According to a decision of ORG [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] , information about the organisation , methods and means used by ORG in its work , and information about its agents , as it relates to the period before DATE , is not a ORG secret ... Unlike the repealed [ DATE Act , see paragraphs CARDINAL above ] , the philosophy of LAW which can be gleaned from its structure , the explanatory notes to the bills , and the parliamentary speeches made at the time of its enactment \u2013 was to lay open the documents of the [ former security services ] , and expose all people under LAW , except for those mentioned in sections MONEY ) and CARDINAL ) . An important point that is not always fully appreciated is that the LAW relates to public documents , access to which is free for [ the people kept on file and researchers ] . It follows that there are other ways to expose those affiliated to the [ former security services ] as collaborators , which means that it is fitting that their affiliation be ascertained by an independent ORG authority .", "The LAW only provides for the exposure of the affiliation to the [ former security services ] of those mentioned in section CARDINAL , not the exposure of their real and specific activities for the benefit of those services . This is clear from the LAW \u2019s title , its subject matter ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) , the powers of the ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , the facts subject to proof ( section CARDINAL ) , the mandatory establishment of affiliation to those services or the establishment in the framework of a preliminary investigation ( sections CARDINAL ) and ORG ) ) , and the contents of the ORG \u2019s decision ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The legislature has used the term \u2018 ORG , which denotes someone \u2019s position as part of the composition of something . The legislature has not empowered the ORG to make a judgment on those found to have been so affiliated on the basis of the available documents . The ORG does not assess who has acted in favour of national security , against terrorism , and so on , and who has supplied other types of information .", "The [ referring court ] does not challenge the LAW \u2019s philosophy or main tenets , but simply part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , arguing that it is contrary to Articles DATE , without pointing to the specific paragraphs alleged to be infringed .", "LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] enshrines the right to a remedy in cases in which someone \u2019s rights or legitimate interests have been infringed or threatened . This right ... is personal , fundamental and universal ( see ... ) . It is an independent constitutional right which is by its nature chiefly procedural , because it serves as a guarantee of the substantive fundamental rights and legitimate interests set out in the preceding constitutional provisions . Although the right to a remedy is fundamental and belongs to everyone , LAW usually operates in tandem with other constitutional provisions . [ It ] is infringed when another fundamental constitutional right or legitimate interest has been infringed or threatened . The [ referring court ] does not point to another constitutional right alleged to be infringed by the impugned statutory provision . So , ORG , which can not stray ... beyond the terms of the referral , but at the same time is not bound by the alleged grounds of incompatibility with the LAW , must identify that other constitutional right on the basis of the reasons adduced in support of the referral .", "The referral does not spell out the part of LAW that the impugned statutory provision is alleged to offend against : paragraph CARDINAL , which proclaims the inalienability of fundamental rights ; paragraph CARDINAL , which prohibits the abuse of rights , as well as their exercise to the detriment of the rights or legitimate interests of others ; or paragraph CARDINAL , which governs the temporary restriction of rights . Based on the reasons for the referral , ORG finds that the allegation is of an infringement of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , which set out rights supplementing certain other fundamental rights .", "The specific rights which can be infringed or threatened by LAW ) of the LAW in its impugned part are those under LAW the right of defence against attacks on one \u2019s dignity and good name , and the right to the inviolability of one \u2019s personal data [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] .", "The Constitutional Court finds that the exposure of the objective fact that someone was affiliated to a ORG authority does not infringe the right to be free from interferences with one \u2019s personal life or attacks against one \u2019s dignity and good name . The activities of those who have collaborated with the [ former security services ] do not harm their good name , honour or dignity , as [ this ] court has already had occasion to point out ...", "The communication right to receive information under LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] is a fundamental constitutional right . As [ this ] court has already held , the right to seek , receive and impart information under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW belongs to all individuals and legal entities , and protects their interest in being informed . It applies to the press and all other media . On the other hand , LAW guarantees citizens access to information from ORG authorities or bodies on questions in which they have a legitimate interest ( see ... ) . This right is not absolute , but nor is the right under LAW to the protection of one \u2019s personal data [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . Here , these CARDINAL fundamental rights clash , but since they are not absolute , each of them can be limited in line with the principle of proportionality . To be constitutionally permissible , a statutory limitation of personality rights must not exceed what is required to ensure the exercise of the constitutional right under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL to obtain information . The individual right to obtain information is extremely important to enable citizens to make an informed choice . At the same time , this right is not absolute either , and can be restricted in the circumstances set out in LAW : it can not be directed against the rights or good name of other citizens , or against national security , public order , health or morals , and the information under paragraph CARDINAL must not be a ORG secret or another secret protected by law , or infringe another \u2019s rights .", "This court finds that the impugned part of CARDINAL ) of the LAW is not unconstitutional , because it does not run against constitutional principles or specific constitutional provisions . It is not unconstitutional to establish someone \u2019s affiliation to a community , authority , ORG body , organisation , and so on , except in cases in which there is a threat to national security . Nor is it unconstitutional for such affiliation to be established by a specific authority , in a manner provided for by law , on the basis of various types of documents which contain information . The legislature has decided to provide for an investigation into whether those who hold certain offices or carry out certain activities were affiliated to the [ former security services ] . The need for such an investigation is a question of expedience , and is to be decided by the legislature ( see ... ) . The legislature enjoys a discretion not only to grant access to the documents of the [ former security services ] , but also to choose the permissible modes of proof . Within its discretion , and in view of the destruction of a large number of the personal and work files of secret collaborators , ORG has determined that affiliation to those services can be established on the basis of all kinds of documents from [ the services\u2019 ] archives , and at the same time it has laid down guarantees for the rights of persons affected by that . By paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act \u2019s additional provisions , a \u2018 ORG is any written information , regardless of the medium used to record the information , including information in automated and complex information systems and databases .", "The impugned provision governs in part the manner in which affiliation is to be established on the basis of documents in the information sources . It sets out , by way of example and alternatively , the documents which , within the meaning of the LAW , may be used to establish that someone has acted as a secret collaborator , and , in fine , permits this to be done on the basis of unspecified documents within the meaning of the LAW . As a result of this legislative solution , affiliation to the [ former security services ] can be established not only on the basis of documents which emanate from the collaborator himself or herself ( handwritten or signed collaboration declarations , handwritten reports , remuneration receipts , documents handwritten or signed by the collaborator and contained in the operative target surveillance files ) , but also on the basis of documents which do not emanate from the collaborator and do not contain his or her signature . The legislature provided for resort to those latter documents when the personal and work files of the collaborator had been destroyed , because it is generally known that the files of some of the secret collaborators were destroyed . By including these documents among the modes of proof of affiliation , the legislature sought to treat those who had collaborated with the [ former security services ] in the same way , and not to place those who had , for various reasons , had their files destroyed in a privileged position . It must also be borne in mind that those recruited as collaborators were not always required to make a written pledge ( declaration ) of collaboration , or a declaration of non - disclosure of their links and work with [ the former security services ] at the time of their discharge . By DATE of Order No . CARDINAL of DATE of the Minister of ORG , adduced in the course of these proceedings , agents were only required to make such declarations when this was deemed necessary in specific cases .", "The LAW does not require the cumulative availability of a certain number or type of documents in order for someone to be established and exposed as affiliated to the [ former security services ] . On the contrary , the LAW ascribes to all documents within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of its additional provisions the quality of documents which can be used as proof of affiliation , and gives equal probative value to all of them .", "The Constitutional Court finds that the boundary between the CARDINAL fundamental rights in collision \u2013 the right under LAW and that under LAW [ see paragraphs CARDINAL above ] \u2013 has been set in a proportionate manner , because the Act lays down enough guarantees to protect the right to honour and dignity and the right to protection of personal data of those affected .", "Firstly , affiliation is established and exposed by a ORG , which is an independent ORG authority . It is independent , not only because section PERSON ) of the LAW proclaims it to be , but also owing to the way in which its members are elected under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW by ORG , at the proposal of the different parliamentary factions , and in a way ensuring that none of the parliamentary political parties has a majority .", "The Commission establishes affiliation on the basis of a centralised archive of the documents set out in LAW . To this end , under LAW of the LAW , the authorities must package and turn over to the ORG their archive files and card indexes ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) . This prevents the documents from being hidden from view or forged , and ensures that the Commission will be able to comprehensively study , compare and analyse the information .", "The documents kept in the ORG \u2019s centralised archive and used to establish affiliation to the [ former security services ] are public .", "The LAW devotes considerable attention to the manner in which affiliation is established and exposed . The procedure before the ORG is set out in detail in the LAW itself , not in statutory instruments .", "Not all of those who have collaborated with the [ former security services ] are to be exposed . The LAW only provides for this for those who hold or have held specified public office , or engage or have engaged in a specified public activity . Only those holding public office or carrying out a public activity within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the LAW are affected by the interference with the right to protection of personal data , because \u2018 the ORG as a whole , as well as political figures and public officials , may be subjected to a higher level of public scrutiny than private ORG ( see ... ) . As a rule , the level of protection of the personal data of the persons under LAW is much lower than in the case of other citizens . This is illustrated by the annual publication , in a special register , of data about their income , assets , bank accounts , receivables , and the declaration of other protected data , with a view to preventing conflicts of interest .", "The LAW provides for a special guarantee for those whose affiliation is exposed [ solely ] because their names and pseudonyms feature in the card indexes or registration journals of the respective services . By section ORG ) , although the Commission must expose them , it must also specifically mention that there is no data about them [ in the other types of records ] under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "The LAW does not provide for any legal consequences for those whose affiliation to the [ former security services ] is exposed .", "Those whose affiliation is established are entitled to consult the documents contained in their personal and work files ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) .", "Lastly , those whose affiliation is established are entitled to judicial protection , which is why ORG rejects the arguments in the referral that there is no right to a remedy . Unlike the repealed [ DATE Act , see paragraphs CARDINAL above ] , which did not provide for any judicial review of the decisions of the Commission under its section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , but only objections before the Commission itself ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , the [ CARDINAL Act ] now in force expressly states in CARDINAL places that the Commission \u2019s decisions may be challenged by those affected , in accordance with the provisions of LAW . The constitutional right to a remedy of those whose affiliation to the [ former security services ] is made public is governed by sections CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . They can challenge the ORG \u2019s decisions before the relevant administrative court and then appeal on points of law against that court \u2019s judgment to a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG .", "Under LAW , the ORG is a collective administrative body , and its decisions bear the hallmarks of individual administrative decisions . These decisions are acts which authenticate pre - existing rights and obligations , which means that they are declaratory administrative decisions ( LAW ) . The administrative authorities issue declaratory and authenticating administrative decisions under many other statutes , and have no discretion in this , because there is CARDINAL lawful way for them to act . The manner in which an administrative authority takes a decision does not affect the right to a remedy of those concerned by that decision . [ This ] court does not agree with the ... argument that the LAW is in effect being applied by the ORG , and that judicial review of the Commission \u2019s decisions has been trimmed down to verification of whether it has arrived at those decisions by following the correct procedure . Laws are not applied by the administrative authorities alone . By LAW , justice is administered by ORG , and by LAW the courts review the lawfulness of the administrative authorities\u2019 decisions and actions [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . If , as argued [ here ] , the courts only scrutinise the procedure whereby the ORG arrives at its decisions , then they are falling short of the paramount requirement of administrative procedure , set out in LAW , that all ... aspects of the lawfulness of administrative decisions be examined by a court of its own motion , without any prompting by the parties ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . In judicial review proceedings , claimants may support their allegations by all types of evidence available under LAW ( LAW ) .", "The possibilities for abuse in the creation of documents of the [ former security services ] were limited by the rules governing [ their ] activities , as evident from Order No . CARDINAL of DATE of the Minister of ORG , and Instruction No . I-CARDINAL of DATE [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . Under those instruments , secret collaborators had operative target surveillance files and personal and work files \u2013 recorded in a common register , where entries were regulated \u2013 and unique personal registration numbers . All secret collaborators were entered into a central database , consisting of card indexes CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL and statistical card index no . CARDINAL , all of which were kept in line with the relevant rules [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . In many cases , when the information supplied had no operative value , or when the secret collaborator had not drawn up a written account , the results of a meeting were noted down by the [ handling officer ] in a report ( paragraph CARDINAL of the Order ) . The use of the records provided for by the LAW in cases in which personal and work files have been destroyed does not affect the right to a remedy of those exposed as affiliated to the [ former security services ] , or infringe the LAW , as the matter boils down to conducting one \u2019s defence before the courts correctly .", "As required LAW , those wrongly exposed as affiliated to the [ former security services ] can also assert their rights by way of claims [ for damages ] under LAW ) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act [ DATE ] . They can also protect their rights under [ the defamation provisions ] of LAW .", "This court therefore finds that the right to a remedy of those found to be affiliated to the [ former security services ] has not been breached , which means that the impugned part of CARDINAL ) of the LAW does not run counter to ORG CARDINAL of the LAW .", "The third argument in the referral is that claimants in cases in which ORG is asked to review decisions of the Commission keep relying on [ the ORG decision which struck down parts of LAW see paragraph CARDINAL above ] .", "ORG must note that the bodies which bring proceedings before it under LAW are not parties to the cases [ before the ordinary courts ] , as stated in the referral , but the judicial formations of ORG or ORG . In such circumstances , a referral to ORG is only required when the judicial panel dealing with a case is itself satisfied that the applicable statute or part of it is unconstitutional . As is evident from CARDINAL of the statements by third parties , ORG case - law in all cases under the [ CARDINAL Act ] is settled , with the court dismissing the claims of all those whose affiliation has been established .", "In its decision [ relating to LAW ] , ORG found [ the provision ] which defined the notion of \u2018 card - indexed DATE NORP citizens whose names and pseudonyms feature in the card indexes and registration journals of the [ former security services ] \u2013 unconstitutional . The decision has been complied with : the provision that it declared unconstitutional was not applied until the [ DATE ] Act \u2019s repeal [ in DATE ] .", "In these proceedings , the [ referring court ] challenges some of the records which can be used to establish affiliation under LAW ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] . These include the ... databases ( registration journals and card indexes [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] ) used to establish the affiliation of NORP citizens who have covertly assisted the [ former security services ] as residents , agents , holders of secret meeting LOC , holders of secret ( conspirative ) LOC , informers , and trusted persons ( paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act \u2019s additional provisions ) .", "Having carried out a comparative analysis , the court finds that the subject matter of this case is the constitutionality of part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] , now in force , which has fresh content and a new rationale , and is not identical to [ the corresponding provision ] of the [ CARDINAL Act ] . The CARDINAL are not identical , because they are CARDINAL different provisions from CARDINAL separate statutes ( see ... ) .", "Although [ those provisions ] of the [ CARDINAL Act ] and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] are not identical , ORG accepts that their effect partly coincides , in as much as the result of both of them is that affiliation to the [ former security services ] can be established on the basis of data from [ the ] registration journals and card indexes . This case does not call for the application of section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , which precludes a fresh referral on a point which ORG has decided by means of a decision on the merits or an inadmissibility decision , because ORG has not previously ruled or been asked to rule on the constitutionality of CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] . But there remains the question of whether the rulings in the [ decision relating to LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL above ] bind the court in this case .", "By section PERSON ) of LAW DATE , ORG decisions are binding on all ORG authorities , legal entities and individuals . But the legal force of a decision has temporal limits , and ends when the facts relevant to it change after it has been handed down . Having given its decision , ORG can not revoke it , or regard statutory provisions that it has declared unconstitutional as still in force . But the [ court ] is not forever bound by its legal views . The law \u2019s development is an objective fact , which permits construing legal provisions in a manner open to alternative views , and taking into account significant social developments which have occurred in the meantime . Arguments based on the need to keep the case - law stable and approach similar cases in the same way can not outweigh those about the need to develop the law , as long as any straying from the settled case - law is well - founded and justified . When socially necessary , ORG may thus change its views and lay down new legal categories , influenced by the doctrine of evolutive interpretation and the need to take into account changes in circumstances which give new arguments greater force . There are previous examples of such reasoned changes of view in [ this court ] \u2019s case - law .", "ORG notes that this case concerns the application of a new statute , not the repealed CARDINAL , which it has already examined . The application of this new statute has given rise to a considerable number of precedents , both at the level of the administrative authorities which apply it and at judicial level . All those who hold public office or engage in public activities within the meaning of section CARDINAL of that Act and have been affiliated to the [ former security services ] must be treated equally . This means that the affiliation of those whose files are still available and those whose files have been destroyed must equally be exposed . All those whose affiliation has been established and those whose affiliation is to be exposed \u2013 both those whose affiliation has already been exposed and those whose affiliation is yet to be exposed \u2013 must [ likewise ] be treated without distinction . Another fresh development is that judicial review has been available for DATE , and ORG has settled case - law [ in such cases ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the light of what he considered to be an emerging divergence in ORG case - law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG asked the plenary session of that court to give an interpretative decision on ( a ) whether , in carrying out an investigation , the Commission should attempt to assess the probative value of the records of the former security services , with a view to determining the actual activities of those featuring in them , and ( b ) whether the ORG was bound to expose everyone whose name it found in those records , or could refrain from doing so in some cases . On DATE the court \u2019s plenary session turned down the request , because fewer than the requisite number of judges voted in favour of admitting it for examination ( see \u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0442\u044a\u043b\u043a. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , ORG \u043e\u0442 I \u0438 II \u043a. ) .", "CARDINAL .
