She referred to LAW .", "The representative of the Solomyansky ORG ( ORG \u0443 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0445 \u0434\u0456\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u2019\u044f\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0443 \u043c. \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 ) agreed that the child had been unlawfully held on the territory of GPE , but that his mother had provided him with all which was necessary for the child \u2019s development .

The materials submitted by the applicant about the child \u2019s living conditions in GPE had simply confirmed that the applicant had been properly performing her duties as a mother . T. \u2019s preference to stay in GPE could not by itself constitute a basis for legalising his abduction , particular regard being had to his young age . The court also noted that PERSON . had guaranteed financing the return of both PERSON and the applicant to GPE , where they had permanently resided before GPE abduction . Moreover , the child \u2019s return to GPE would be in his best interests , which included the need to ensure that he was developing in conditions allowing him free linguistic and ethnic self - identification in the future .
