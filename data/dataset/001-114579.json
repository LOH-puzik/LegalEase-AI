She stated that before his death her grandson had lived with her , as his mother lived in GPE and his father had another family . PERSON \u2019s death had caused the applicant severe emotional distress . In the applicant \u2019s understanding , the criminal court had already awarded her the sum of LTL CARDINAL in disposing of the criminal proceedings . She noted that although DATE had passed since the car accident , PERSON had not paid her the money . The applicant also referred to the possibility that , in the event that PERSON was in a difficult financial situation , compensation for the damage she had sustained might be paid to her in several instalments rather than as a lump sum .", "The Government have provided the ORG with an invoice from a law firm to the effect that on DATE the applicant paid LTL CARDINAL for \u201c legal services \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant presented the court with an estimate of her loss in connection with her grandson \u2019s death . She claimed LTL CARDINAL in total .

NORP In a written response PERSON asked the court to grant the claim in part and to award the applicant LAW .", "CARDINAL . Seeing the potential for the parties to reach a friendly settlement , on DATE the judge held a preliminary hearing . The applicant , an interpreter , PERSON and his lawyer were present . As is evident from the transcript of the hearing , after the judge had explained the parties\u2019 rights to them , the applicant asked the court to include a calculation of her expenses in the case file . PERSON \u2019s lawyer , without making any other observations or statements , asked that documents concerning PERSON \u2019s salary and family situation also be included in the file . Both requests were granted .", "When asked to present her arguments and claims on the merits , the applicant stated that during the criminal proceedings she , the prosecutor , PERSON and his lawyer had agreed that PERSON would pay her LTL CARDINAL in compensation under both heads . However , PERSON had paid nothing so far . The applicant argued that her financial situation was not good .

She noted that her family had been suffering for DATE and implied that no steps towards reconciliation had been taken on PERSON \u2019s part .", "CARDINAL . According to the transcript of the \u0160al\u010dininkai District Court hearing of DATE , the applicant , an interpreter and the lawyer for PERSON took part in that hearing . It was also noted that the judge had explained the parties\u2019 rights to them and that the parties understood them . The judge also asked the parties to put forward any requests , if they had any . The applicant asked the court to include her modified compensation claim in the case file . Given that the other party did not object , the judge accepted the modified claim .", "When hearing the case on the merits , the applicant again explained to the court that during the criminal proceedings the parties had come to an oral agreement that PERSON would pay her LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL , but to that day he had paid nothing . She presented a very detailed calculation of her expenses , based on invoices , for her grandson \u2019s funeral and headstone construction costs . All in all , the applicant asked the court to award her the sum of LTL CARDINAL in compensation for pecuniary damage and LTL CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "The lawyer for PERSON acknowledged that , given that her client had already been found guilty in criminal proceedings , only the question of damages remained . She also accepted that the applicant had suffered non - pecuniary damage because of her grandson \u2019s death . That being so , the lawyer asked the court to grant the applicant \u2019s civil claim in part and to award her payment of the costs which were justified by invoices . As to non - pecuniary damage , the lawyer asked the court to make an award which would be reasonable and fair , taking into account the economic situation in GPE and the fact that PERSON only had a low salary and had no other property .", "The judge noted that the court \u2019s decision would be announced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claim in part . The court took notice of PERSON \u2019s conviction for dangerous driving and held that , consequently , it was not necessary to prove his liability in the civil proceedings . PERSON was ordered to fully compensate the pecuniary damage he had caused to the applicant by her grandson \u2019s death . Having had regard to the documents before it , the court awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . As to non - pecuniary damage , the \u0160al\u010dininkai ORG took note of the applicant \u2019s claim that the loss of her grandson had caused her great mental suffering . For the court , it was nonetheless important to point out that the car accident had been caused by PERSON \u2019s recklessness , and not deliberately . It was also relevant that PERSON was relatively poor : he had a job but his salary was low ( the court did not specify the level of salary in the decision ) , and he had no other property or income . Moreover , PERSON was a young person , therefore \u201c the amount of compensation was not to ruin his life \u201d . Relying on the above arguments , ORG awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the award of damages was too low and asking that the case be remitted to the first - instance court for fresh examination , \u201c in accordance with LAW . She submitted , with references to specific provisions of that LAW , that the first - instance court had breached the principle of adversarial proceedings , the principle of the parties\u2019 procedural equality and a person \u2019s right to State legal aid . The applicant argued that she , as a LANGUAGE - speaking person of old age and little education , had not been able to properly exercise her rights at the hearing and effectively assert her claim . Neither had she been able to effectively support her claim by evidence .", "CARDINAL . In her appeal , the applicant also wrote that the judge hearing her case at ORG , just before the preliminary hearing concerning her claim and without noting it down in the transcript , had suggested to her that she find a lawyer . According to the applicant , the lawyer she approached had asked her to pay LTL CARDINAL for legal services . The applicant had no such money and had therefore had to represent herself before the court of first instance . According to her , the same lawyer in fact had represented PERSON before the court . Only after the first - instance court had adopted the decision on the merits had the applicant found out that she had had the right to free legal aid , paid for by the ORG . In her view , had she had a lawyer , she would have been in a much better position to defend her interests and to obtain a court decision that would have fulfilled her expectations .", "CARDINAL . The appeal hearing before ORG took place on DATE , in the presence of the applicant and an interpreter . Neither PERSON nor his lawyer took part in that hearing , although PERSON had been informed of its date . As is evident from the transcript of the hearing , after the presiding judge explained the applicant \u2019s rights to her , the applicant asked the court to admit in evidence CARDINAL documents about her and her husband \u2019s state of health . The request was granted . The applicant also submitted that she and her husband had been raising their grandson , PERSON , as of DATE . After his death , there was no one to help them in the household . The applicant asked the court to grant her civil claim on the basis of the submissions that she had already made in writing .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court noted that at hearings on DATE and DATE the first - instance court had explained the applicant \u2019s procedural rights to her , in the presence of an interpreter , and that the applicant had understood those rights . There was no information in the case file leading to the conclusion that ORG had breached the rules of civil procedure or the principles mentioned by the applicant . The court held that the applicant \u2019s suggestion that her claim would have been fully granted if she had had a lawyer was unfounded , as a lawyer \u2019s participation in proceedings could not guarantee a favourable outcome . Moreover , the fact that PERSON had been represented by a lawyer with whom the applicant had failed to conclude an agreement to represent her did not affect the lawfulness and fairness of the decision the first - instance court had adopted .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that before the accident , the applicant \u2019s grandson PERSON had lived with her for DATE and had often helped her , and that she had indeed lost the opportunity to communicate with him and to receive help from him . Nonetheless , the compensation award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage which the first - instance court had made was reasonable . The lower court had also been correct in taking into account the fact that the applicant \u2019s grandson had died because of PERSON \u2019s recklessness and not because of a premeditated crime , as well as PERSON \u2019s difficult financial situation . Lastly , ORG found that the written evidence about the applicant \u2019s state of health that she had submitted to the appellate court did not give grounds to annul the first - instance court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law , drafted by a lawyer . She reiterated her argument that because she was a LANGUAGE - speaking person of old age , poor health and with little education , she had been unable to protect her interests properly in court without professional legal assistance . The applicant drew ORG attention to its ruling of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , arguing that the lower courts should have taken the above factors into account . She also argued that the lower courts had wrongly established that PERSON had caused the car accident merely by not being careful . In the applicant \u2019s view , PERSON had been openly reckless : he had had no driving licence and had been speeding . She did not argue that PERSON had been driving drunk . The applicant asked ORG to grant her civil claim in full and to award her the money she had paid for legal representation .", "PERSON did not lodge a response to the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , in written proceedings , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It noted that non - pecuniary damage was always to be compensated when a loss of life had occurred because of a crime . In this case , PERSON had not questioned his liability , the dispute thus concerning only the sum to be awarded in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . ORG also observed that the applicant \u2019s grandson had died not because of PERSON \u2019s premeditated actions , but because of his being reckless when driving and violating traffic rules . The lower courts had taken all the circumstances into account when assessing the amount of compensation . It was also noteworthy that the award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL was close to the initial sum that the applicant had asked for in bringing the claim on DATE . Only later had she raised that claim by LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Should ORG raise the amount of compensation , it would mean re - evaluating the facts of the case de novo , and this was not within the competence of that court .", "ORG did not pronounce on the applicant \u2019s claim that she had not been in a position to effectively defend her interests before the first - instance and appellate courts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a request for information by the Government , on DATE ORG wrote that people living in the municipality are informed of free legal aid via a local newspaper , published in both the NORP and NORP languages . They can also obtain leaflets on the subject at the council \u2019s offices . Lastly , information about free legal aid is presented on billboards at ORG . Should a person request State legal aid , he or she can submit such a request without necessarily having to do so in the NORP language .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Civil Procedure ( hereinafter DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides that court proceedings are conducted in the country \u2019s official language , that is , NORP ( LAW ) . Civil proceedings are adversarial and each party must prove the facts it relies upon ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Practice direction no . CARDINAL of ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c ...
