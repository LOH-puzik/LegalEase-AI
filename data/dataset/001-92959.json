SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a private limited company with its registered office in GPE . The applications on its behalf were lodged by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , the Chairman and Vice - Chairman of its managing board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company concluded a contract with ORG , a public - law institution . Under that contract , taken together with CARDINAL additional ones concluded on DATE and DATE , the applicant company acquired the right , in exchange for compensation paid to ORG , to recover unpaid broadcast receiver licences in CARDINAL cases , plus additional sums for default in those payments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE I ORG confirmed the validity of the above contracts . The decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company was obliged to sue those persons who had refused to pay the debt which it had acquired the right to recover . The applicant company prepared individual actions with a request for payment orders to be issued against the debtors . Given the number of persons concerned , the actions were generated by means of computer software and recorded on DVDs . The DVDs were sent to the district courts concerned , accompanied by an explanatory letter .", "CARDINAL . Thus the applicant company , on DATE and DATE , lodged actions , in electronic form , with several district courts . On DATE , after officials of ORG had stated that courts were in a position to register such actions , the applicant company resubmitted the first group of actions to the courts concerned on DVDs . The courts refused to register the actions , indicating that they lacked the equipment to receive and process submissions made and signed electronically . Further relevant details of the applications under examination are set out in Appendix I.", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL case the applicant company submitted , on DATE , with the agreement of ORG , a printed version of the CARDINAL actions it had lodged on a DVD on DATE . The documents in support of the claims remained available on the DVD exclusively . The file numbers indicate that the ORG registered those actions as having been lodged in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company informed the ORG that its claims relating to the actions which the district courts had refused to register had become statute - barred .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the district courts\u2019 refusal to register the actions it had submitted on DVDs , the applicant company lodged a complaint with ORG in respect of each individual refusal . Referring to LAW and its constitutional equivalent , it alleged a violation of its right of access to a court .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the complaints in the cases under consideration as having been lodged outside the statutory time - limit of DATE . The decisions stated that the applicant company had earlier learned , in the context of its previous attempts to lodge actions electronically , that district courts lacked the necessary equipment for processing such actions and had failed to lodge a complaint with ORG at that time . ORG considered it irrelevant that the above - mentioned time - limit had been complied with in respect of the district ORG refusal to register actions in those cases which underlay the constitutional complaints under consideration ( further details of the individual proceedings are set out in Appendix I ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE several courts asked ORG for instructions as to how they should process the applicant company \u2019s submissions lodged in electronic form . ORG advised the courts to wait until the position had been analysed .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the ORG stated that as ordinary courts did not have an electronic registration facility , the conditions for receiving submissions in electronic form as laid down in PERSON no . PERSON . were not met .", "CARDINAL . At meetings with presidents of district and regional courts held on DATE and from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE ORG concluded that ordinary courts were duly equipped for receiving submissions bearing a secured electronic signature .", "CARDINAL . A press release issued by ORG on DATE indicates that ORG had published on its website the electronic addresses of individual courts and information about the filing of submissions signed electronically .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , as amended with effect from DATE , reads :", "\u201c Submissions to a court can be made in written form , by an oral statement which is recorded and transcribed , by means of electronic devices subject to the submission bearing a secured electronic signature in accordance with the applicable legislation , by telegraph or by fax . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regulation no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL governs , inter alia , the organisation of work within district courts and regional courts , including their registries . The relevant provisions read :", "\u201c Submissions received by the registry which contain a petition for proceedings to be brought shall be registered by means of technical and software devices approved by ORG and designed for processing the agenda of the courts . \u201d", "\u201c Receipt of submissions made by electronic means and bearing a secured electronic signature", "Submissions received by means of electronic devices and having a secured electronic signature shall be dealt with in accordance with the applicable legislation . Such submissions are to be transmitted to the central office of the court to be processed in accordance with section CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Act on Electronic Signature CARDINAL governs the establishment and use of electronic signature , the rights and obligations of persons in that context and the protection of documents signed electronically ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , Regulation no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL governed the use of electronic signature in , inter alia , administrative relations . It was issued by ORG and entered into force on DATE . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL set out details on the establishment and functioning of an electronic registry within public authorities which use secured electronic signature , the filing , processing and handling of electronic documents , as well as their format and transfer between the dispatcher and the addressee .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides that a complaint to ORG can be lodged within DATE from the date on which the decision in question has become final and binding or on which a measure has been notified or on which notice of other interference has been given . As regards measures and other interferences , this period commences when the plaintiff could have become aware of them .", "CARDINAL . In the majority of the cases examined in the course of DATE ORG took the same approach as indicated in paragraph CARDINAL above , namely that the period of DATE under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE had started running not later than in DATE , when the applicant company had learned for the first time that ordinary courts were not in a position to register submissions in electronic form .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a different decision delivered on DATE , ORG declared admissible a complaint in respect of the refusal , by ORG , to register actions lodged electronically on DATE ( proceedings no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In its judgment on the merits of DATE , ORG found a violation of LAW . It held that the relevant law entitled parties to file submissions to courts in electronic form . Public authorities were obliged to establish facilities for receiving and processing such submissions . In the above case ORG ordered ORG to proceed with the actions lodged on DVDs by the applicant company on DATE . Prior to that , the applicant company had informed ORG earlier refusal to accept a different set of actions which had been lodged on DVDs on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE all chambers of ORG have systematically approached cases of this type in the manner described in the preceding paragraph . Thus , in CARDINAL other cases concerning similar complaints lodged in DATE ORG counted DATE from the moment when the applicant company had been informed about the refusal to register each specific submission filed electronically . This approach has been applied even in cases which concerned a second refusal to register an identical submission .", "CARDINAL . In those cases ORG found a violation of the applicant company \u2019s right of access to a court under LAW , holding that the relevant law obliged courts to accept actions submitted by electronic means and that there existed no justification for their refusal to do so . It ordered the district courts concerned to accept those actions as having been lodged on the date when they had initially received them and to process any submissions signed electronically ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
