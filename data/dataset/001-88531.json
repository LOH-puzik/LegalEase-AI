In ORG view , there was no scope for subsequently altering such will .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General lodged a complaint in the interests of the law against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . The complaint was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The decision stated that the amnesty of DATE relating to the offences imputed to the applicant and his co - accused prevented the criminal proceedings against them from being pursued . ORG shared the lower courts\u2019 view that the investigator \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE not to pursue the case was final and that LAW contained no provision permitting the proceedings concerning the offences in question to be resumed after the matter had become res judicata .", "CARDINAL . ORG expressed the view that the Constitutional Court \u2019s decision no .

ORG shared the interpretation by ORG ( decision no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of the terms of the amnesty decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . It admitted that the rather unusual phrasing of those decisions had raised difficulties as to their interpretation .

The decisions on amnesty of CARDINAL March and DATE had been issued in accordance with the legal order of GPE . That was not the case , however , as regards the subsequent decision to revoke the relevant parts of those decisions . The courts were obliged to abide by the law in force .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE CARDINAL members of parliament requested ORG to give an interpretation of LAW ) of the LAW concerning the President \u2019s right to grant an amnesty . They argued that the quashing of a presidential decision on amnesty had no legal basis . The alleged reason for the decision of DATE had been the elimination of disputes concerning the conformity with the LAW of the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . However , only ORG was entitled to determine such disputes .", "CARDINAL . In his submission to ORG the Prime Minister , PERSON , argued that the point in issue was not governed by LAW . It followed from the principles of a ORG based on the rule of law , as laid down in LAW , that decisions which were not subject to any review should be permissible in exceptional cases only . It was generally known that ORG and its representatives were suspected of being involved in the offences covered by the amnesty . It was therefore in the general interest to have the matter elucidated . His predecessor \u2019s decision to grant the amnesty in issue had been an abuse of power and contrary to the interests of the citizens . DATE of the principles of a ORG based on the rule of law required that the situation be remedied . The President or the Acting President was allowed to use the rights vested in him or her by the LAW only within the scope of the constitutional principles in force in GPE . Reference was made to LAW adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE . The Prime Minister argued that a decision on amnesty could be amended or quashed exceptionally where the contents of such a decision were contrary to the LAW and the principles on which it was based .", "CARDINAL .

Decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL was published in LAW on DATE . In it ORG ( First Chamber ) had recourse to an extensive linguistic , logical , historical and systematic interpretation of the provision in issue . It stated that LAW did not envisage the possibility of resuming criminal proceedings following a decision to quash an amnesty . Reference was also made to LAW and to LAW . As to UN Declaration CARDINAL/CARDINAL , it related to the granting of amnesty and did not imply that an amnesty which had been granted should be revoked .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prerogative of granting an amnesty and the obligation to comply with it confirmed the separation of powers in a ORG founded on the rule of law , based on the principle of legal certainty and the necessity to protect acquired rights . An amnesty ( individual pardon ) did not belong to the category of fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and there existed no legal entitlement to have it granted . The President was therefore under no obligation to grant an amnesty . By making use of the right to grant amnesty , the President prevented the judicial branch of power from exerting an effect on citizens in certain cases . As a representative of the executive branch of power , the President took over the responsibility for such a decision .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , the alleged offences covered by the amnesty in issue were of a serious nature . However , no particular offence was excluded from the President \u2019s right to grant amnesty under NORP law . An amnesty was an individual act in respect of which no remedy was available . No retroactive effect of the decision on amnesty of DATE could therefore be envisaged .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of DATE ORG concluded that LAW ) of the LAW could not serve as a basis for any decision by which the President of the GPE adversely affected , from the point of view of criminal law , the position which a person had acquired as a result of an amnesty .", "CARDINAL . In a petition of CARDINAL DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his rights , including those under LAW , had been violated in that the criminal proceedings against him had been pursued despite the decisions on amnesty given on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Second Chamber of the Constitutional Court rejected the petition on DATE ( decision no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision stated , inter alia , that the decisions on amnesty of CARDINAL DATE and DATE were phrased in such a way that they did not rule out the applicant \u2019s prosecution for the offences in issue and his detention on remand , regardless of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the decision on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the LAW set out in decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE was of an abstract nature and had no legal effect in respect of any actions , omissions or decisions of the ORG authorities which had given rise to the point at issue . Decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE could not be effective prior to its adoption and publication in LAW . In any event , it did not affect the decision on amnesty of DATE . The above conclusions were later published in ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained that the authorities which had taken decisions leading to his detention ( ORG , police investigators , ORG in GPE and the Bratislava CARDINAL ORG ) had infringed his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( Second Chamber ) declared the submission inadmissible on DATE . It held that the proceedings in issue were still pending . The above authorities had acted in accordance with the relevant law and there was no indication that the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged another petition with ORG . He alleged a violation of LAW in that he had been prosecuted for offences which were covered by the amnesty of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the petition as being manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated , inter alia , that decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE concerned merely the interpretation of the relevant provision of the LAW . It did not , as such , retroactively affect the validity of the decision on amnesty of DATE as the decision on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the LAW had produced effects only following its publication in LAW on DATE . Finally , the decisions on amnesty of DATE and DATE respectively concerned offences relating to the \u201c notification \u201d of the abduction of PERSON and his \u201c reported abduction \u201d , but not any offences committed in the context of his abduction as such . The prosecution of the applicant for the last - mentioned offences was therefore permissible in any event .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared partly admissible a complaint by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused ( case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The decision addressed , inter alia , the question whether the ORG had authorised the Prime Minister , as required by LAW , to give a decision on amnesty on DATE . ORG had submitted only a decision of DATE authorising PERSON to exercise certain presidential powers including those under LAW ) of the LAW . No separate decision to similar effect had been submitted indicating that the new ORG set up following the parliamentary election held in DATE had authorised its Prime Minister , PERSON , to exercise the presidential power in issue . ORG concluded that the decision on amnesty of CARDINAL DATE had been given contrary to LAW and was therefore not a legal act ( non negotium ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed both PERSON M. Dzurinda , the Prime Minister , and the applicant to intervene as third parties in the proceedings . The former alleged that he had been duly authorised to use the presidential power under LAW ) of the LAW . ORG held that it had determined that issue in its above - mentioned decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found a violation of the petitioner \u2019s rights under LAW in that the investigator had brought criminal proceedings against him , on DATE , notwithstanding that the offences of which he had been accused were covered by the amnesty of CARDINAL DATE and DATE .

ORG also addressed the question as to the date from which its above - mentioned decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL was effective . That decision concerned the interpretation of LAW ) of LAW and , as such , was of a declaratory nature . Where relevant , such a decision was effective ex tunc . The fact that a public authority , prior to the finding of ORG , had considered its actions to be in conformity with the LAW could not serve as a justification for such actions once ORG had found that this was not the case .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( First Chamber ) dismissed the argument that its decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL had been effective only from the moment of its publication in LAW on DATE . In particular , neither LAW DATE nor LAW DATE provided for compulsory publication in LAW of a decision under LAW . The binding effect of similar decisions could not , therefore , depend on whether or not they were published in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judgment no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE was later published in ORG of ORG . The conclusion was highlighted , as relevant case - law , that prosecution of a person for actions whose criminal character had ceased to exist was contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON disagreed with the above - mentioned decisions by ORG composed of CARDINAL judges . At that time the relevant statutory provisions did not allow separate opinions to be published together with the judgment . His dissenting opinion was later published in the journal PERSON revue ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The view was expressed in the opinion that judgment no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL departed from the previous ( and established ) practice concerning the requirement to exhaust the other available remedies prior to lodging a complaint with ORG . Such a decision had caused legal uncertainty and could lead to confusion as to which authorities were primarily charged with the protection of ORG fundamental rights and freedoms . Such departure from the previous practice of ORG had no objective justification .", "CARDINAL . After delivery of ORG decision no . PERSON , ORG of GPE , on DATE , issued a statement expressing the standpoint of ORG . The statement indicated that the interpretation by LAW CARDINAL(i ) of the LAW was to apply for the future and had no effect on the binding character of decisions on amnesty which had been previously published in LAW .", "CARDINAL . There had been no reason for the proceedings against the applicant to be discontinued since a grammatical and logical interpretation of the relevant provisions of the amnesty decisions of DATE and DATE led to the conclusion that those decisions did not apply to the criminal offence of forcible abduction of PERSON junior to a foreign country , committed on DATE , as such or to other criminal offences which the criminal proceedings concerned .", "CARDINAL . Finally , reference was made to several sets of proceedings pending before ORG , whose outcome was decisive for the further examination of the charges against the applicant and his co - accused .", "CARDINAL .

ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG for reasons similar to those expressed in the above - mentioned article published by a group of lawyers .", "CARDINAL . Amnesty and pardon are the CARDINAL principal forms employed within the general concept of mercy in the Contracting Parties to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . As to the distinctions between them , firstly , amnesty is usually referred to as a measure which is impersonal and applies to all persons or to a class of persons , while a pardon concerns a specific individual or a group of individuals . Secondly , while a pardon typically serves to remit a sentence , an amnesty may be granted before criminal proceedings have commenced or at any stage thereafter . Thirdly , while amnesty is usually considered to fall within the realm of the legislature , the power to grant a pardon is seen as CARDINAL of the prerogatives of the head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In certain Contracting Parties the above distinctions between the CARDINAL concepts are not always present or are not clearly indicated , as a result of which , in legal theory , the clemency institutions are considered to have \u201c hybrid forms \u201d in relation to the above CARDINAL general notions ( for example , \u201c generic \u201d or \u201c collective \u201d pardons in GPE and GPE or \u201c gr\u00e2ce amnistiante \u201d and \u201c admission par d\u00e9cret au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019amnistie \u201d in GPE ) . There is no significant functional difference between the different concepts employed as their common purpose has been to remove the effects or consequences of a completed or pending criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . The powers of heads of ORG in the decision - making process in matters relating to measures of clemency and possible review of such measures depends on the constitutional model adopted by the country concerned .", "CARDINAL . In the Contracting Parties to the ORG , there is a general trend towards excluding the executive \u2019s decisions on pardon from judicial control on account of the discretionary and sui generis nature of such decisions . The Constitutions and other legal norms in GPE do not provide for the possibility of revocation of pardons granted unconditionally .", "CARDINAL . In legal theory a variety of views have been expressed . Several authors have argued that pardons are irrevocable on the basis of the classical theory of administrative law , maintaining that an individual administrative decision addressed to a particular person can not be subject to revocation . Other authors have argued that , even though there is no right to a pardon , once it has been granted , such a measure creates rights for the pardoned individual and the sphere of freedom granted by the executive power becomes inalienable . ORG have also been expressed that pardons can be revoked on the limited grounds of error , fraud on the part of the pardoned person , or the existence of concomitant or previous circumstances which were not known by the authority granting the pardon .", "CARDINAL . Pardons granted by the executive are generally conceived as atypical discretionary acts , granted in the framework of relations between the branches of power or in the sphere of execution of penalties . As such , they can not be construed as normal administrative measures subject to ordinary judicial review . In spite of the fact that the power to pardon is in principle delimited by the constitutional norms or principles of the rule of law ( such as the necessity of sanctions , legal certainty , protection of public order , separation of powers and equality ) , the possibilities for the judiciary to review or overturn a pardon seem to be very limited in the majority of GPE . The discretionary character of these measures does not , in principle , allow for their revocation .", "CARDINAL .
