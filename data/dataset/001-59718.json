The applicant and the child \u2019s mother lived together at the time of the child \u2019s birth . They separated in DATE . The child \u2019s mother prohibited any contacts between the applicant and the child . The applicant still met PERSON several times at school until such contacts were no longer possible . Subsequently the child \u2019s mother married Mr PERSON , the father of her child A. , born in DATE , PERSON being the common family name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access ( GPE ) to his daughter . Having heard the persons concerned , ORG advised against a right of access . ORG submitted that PERSON had established a close relationship with Mr. PERSON which would be adversely affected by contacts between PERSON and her natural father . It also stated that PERSON , when heard in the absence of her mother , had indicated that she was not keen to see the applicant and was suffering from his continuing efforts for access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M. , then DATE , was heard by the competent ORG Judge . She stated that the fact that the applicant was always standing at the fence of the schoolyard disturbed her and that she did not wish to visit the applicant even if access should be ordered by the court .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the court ordered a psychological expert opinion . On DATE , in CARDINAL - page submissions , the psychologist of ORG ( PERSON ) stated that , as the contacts between the applicant and PERSON were disrupted for DATE , no diagnosis of their actual relationship appeared possible . The psychologist considered that PERSON did not wish any personal contacts with the applicant who should give her the necessary time to take up contacts on her own motion . The psychologist noted that she had arranged a meeting between the applicant and PERSON which , however , had been cancelled by PERSON \u2019s stepfather .", "CARDINAL .

Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW , the ORG observed that the mother , in the exercise of her right to custody , determined the child \u2019s relations with third persons , and that therefore her will was decisive . The father could only be granted a right of access by court order , if this was in the interest of the child . According to ORG findings , in particular PERSON \u2019s statements in DATE and DATE , these conditions were not met . ORG considered that PERSON , then DATE and capable of forming her own will , unequivocally refused contacts with her natural father . In ORG view , it was not in PERSON \u2019s interest to enforce contacts contrary to her will , as her mental and psychological well - being would be endangered thereby .
