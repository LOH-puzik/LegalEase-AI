Its registered address is in GPE and Mr Stratis Andreadis was its sole shareholder .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under the terms of a contract concluded on DATE with ORG , which at the time was governed by a military junta , PERSON undertook to construct a crude oil refinery in the NORP region , near GPE . The refinery was to be built , at an estimated cost of MONEY , by a company which it was proposed to form , ORG , of which the second applicant was to be the sole owner . All the latter \u2019s rights and obligations were to be automatically transferred to the company upon its incorporation .", "The Government ratified the contract by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , published in ORG of DATE . Under LAW of the contract , the ORG undertook to purchase , not later than DATE , a plot of land in GPE suitable for the construction of the refinery . On DATE , by LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) , issued pursuant to Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on \" ORG from Abroad \" , the ORG authorised PERSON to import MONEY to finance the scheme .", "CARDINAL . ORG However , the project stagnated because the ORG failed to fulfil its obligation . On DATE the Ministers of Industry and Agriculture announced at a press conference in GPE the Government \u2019s decision to return to the proprietors the land which had already been expropriated in accordance with LAW . The following day the LOC police ordered that the work should cease .", "In DATE PERSON protested to the relevant authorities and sought permission to proceed with the work . On DATE it even issued an extra - judicial summons inviting the ORG to ratify the purchase of the land in question , but the ORG refused to revoke the police order prohibiting the continuation of the work .", "CARDINAL . ORG Once democracy had been restored , the Government took the view that the contract and Decree no . CARDINAL were prejudicial to the national economy ; they relied on LAW . CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on the termination of preferential contracts ( kharistikes symvasseis ) concluded under the military regime ( DATE ) . This PERSON , which was enacted by special authorisation under LAW ( Article CARDINAL - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , possessed superior force .", "The applicants did not respond to a proposal addressed to them by the Minister for Co - ordination on DATE inviting them to enter negotiations for the revision or termination of the contract . Accordingly , a ministerial committee on the economy terminated the contract on DATE . The applicants did not challenge this decision in the courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG Prior to the termination of the contract , Stran had incurred expenditure in connection with the scheme . In particular , it had concluded contracts for the supply of goods and services with foreign and NORP undertakings and had taken out loans .", "A dispute then arose between GPE and the ORG . On DATE Stran brought an action ( anagnoristiki agogi ) in ORG for a declaration that the ORG should pay it compensation in the amounts of MONEY , MONEY and MONEY . It argued that the ORG had been in breach of its obligations during the period of validity of the contract , in particular in so far as it had , since DATE , prohibited the continuation of work on the construction of the refinery at LOC and had not , since DATE , taken any steps to expropriate the land required for that construction . It also sought the return of a cheque for MONEY which it had lodged with ORG as security for the proper performance of the contract ; it further claimed reimbursement of the commission and the DATE stamp fee paid to ORG .", "The ORG challenged the jurisdiction of the court . It contended that the dispute should be referred to arbitration in accordance with LAW , the relevant paragraphs of which were worded as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . Any difference , dispute or disagreement arising between the ORG and the Concessionaire as to the application of this LAW and relative to the interpretation of the terms and conditions thereof and the extent of the rights and obligations deriving therefrom shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration by CARDINAL arbitrators according to the following procedure , no other arbitration agreement being required .", "...", "CARDINAL . The arbitration award shall be definite , final and irrevocable , and shall constitute an enforceable instrument requiring no further action for enforcement or any other formality . It shall be liable to no ordinary or extraordinary judicial remedies , nor shall it be subject to cancellation or suspension before ordinary courts of justice . The party failing to comply with the provisions of the arbitration award shall be obligated to make good any and all damage ( damnum emergens or lucrum cessans ) caused to the other party . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In a preliminary decision ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE , ORG Instance rejected the ORG \u2019s main submission . It held that the arbitration clause concerned solely the settlement of disputes arising from the performance of the contract and not the failure of CARDINAL of the parties to perform the contract . It found further that the ministerial committee on the economy had terminated the contract in issue in its entirety ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) which had the effect of rendering the arbitration clause void as it was not an autonomous provision . In addition , the court dismissed the ORG \u2019s argument that CARDINAL of the conditions subsequent contained in the contract , namely the lodging of a cheque as security and the payment of the second part of the minimum capital , had not been satisfied . Finally , the court ordered additional investigative measures , including the hearing of CARDINAL witnesses , in order to determine the existence and extent of the damage alleged by GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG filed an arbitration petition and appointed an arbitrator . It requested the arbitration court to declare that all the claims for compensation against ORG lodged by PERSON in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were unfounded .", "In its memorial of DATE Stran - which had appointed a professor of law at ORG as arbitrator - maintained primarily that the arbitration court lacked jurisdiction and requested that the arbitration be stayed until the proceedings instituted on DATE had been concluded ; in the alternative and in order to rebut the ORG \u2019s arguments on the merits , it referred the arbitrators to its pleadings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The arbitration court was constituted on DATE ; its president was chosen jointly by the CARDINAL other arbitrators ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the contract ) . It made its award on DATE .", "It found that it had jurisdiction in that , in its view , the disputes arising from the total failure to perform the contract were also subject to arbitration , which was not restricted to those deriving from non - performance of individual clauses as had been argued by the ORG . The wording of the arbitration clause in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was sufficiently general and clear to rule out such distinctions .", "On the merits , the arbitration court relied on the evidence adduced by the parties before ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It found that responsibility for the losses sustained by GPE was shared - PERCENT for the ORG and PERCENT for the company . The latter had commenced work on land which had been the subject of a contested expropriation order and without first obtaining the necessary planning permission . It therefore held ORG claims to be well - founded in an amount not exceeding MONEY , MONEY and MONEY , plus interest at PERCENT from DATE ; however , this reference to interest did not appear in the operative part of the decision . Finally , the court declared that the ORG was unlawfully retaining the cheque lodged as security ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant company sought an order from ORG requiring the ORG to return the security , but the court stayed the proceedings pending the conclusion of those instituted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG had asked ORG to set aside the arbitration award of DATE .", "It argued that the arbitration court had lacked jurisdiction to hear disputes arising from the contract in issue and ORG financial claims against the ORG . In the alternative , it affirmed that the contracting parties had intended to limit the jurisdiction of the arbitration court to disputes concerning the performance and interpretation of the clauses of the contract and the scope of the rights and duties deriving therefrom ; its jurisdiction could not therefore extend to disputes relating to the total failure to perform the contract . It followed that the dispute in question was a matter for the ordinary civil courts , as ORG had recognised in its judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In the further alternative , the ORG argued that the arbitration court \u2019s lack of jurisdiction was confirmed by the fact that ORG claims against it had become statute - barred following the termination of the contract . Finally , it stressed the declaratory nature of the action brought by GPE on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment ( no . DATE ) of DATE the GPE court dismissed the ORG \u2019s application , holding that the decision terminating the contract had not rendered the arbitration clause void . That clause continued to produce its effects in relation to disputes which had arisen during the period of validity of the contract .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant company withdrew its first action in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but sought to pursue its action for the return of the cheque lodged as security ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "When this action was heard in ORG , on DATE , the ORG , relying on LAW , opposed the discontinuance of the first action . It maintained that the latter action would have resulted in a finding unfavourable to GPE and that the ORG thus had a legitimate interest in seeking a final decision .", "However , the court again stayed the proceedings ( decision no . DATE ) on account of the appeal on points of law which was pending ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , basing its decision on the same grounds , upheld the judgment of DATE .", "It ruled , inter alia :", "\" In modern NORP legislation the principle of the autonomy of an arbitration clause in relation to the contract prevails . The termination of the contract , for whatever reason , does not bring an end to the power of the arbitrators designated to hear disputes which have arisen during the period of validity of the contract ... The decision of the ministerial committee on the economy did not annul the arbitration clause contained in DATE of the contract and , accordingly , it does not preclude the arbitrators from examining the merits of the dispute . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG appealed to ORG .", "The hearing was initially set down for CARDINAL DATE , but on that date it was postponed to DATE at the ORG \u2019s request , on the ground that a draft law concerning the case in question was before ORG .", "In reply to a question put by ORG at the hearing on DATE , the ORG lawyer maintained that ORG judge - rapporteur had sent his opinion , which had been favourable to the applicants\u2019 arguments , to the parties before DATE and this affirmation was not disputed by the Government .", "CARDINAL . ORG On CARDINAL DATE ORG enacted PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on \" the compulsory participation of the ORG in private undertakings ... and the redemption of shares \" , which entered into force upon its publication in ORG of CARDINAL DATE . This PERSON dealt principally with the renegotiation of a concession for the prospecting for and extraction of oil and natural gas in an area of LOC . However , LAW was worded as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . The true and lawful meaning of the provisions of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL concerning the termination of contracts entered into DATE and DATE is that , upon the termination of these contracts , all their terms , conditions and clauses , including the arbitration clause , are ipso jure repealed and the arbitration tribunal no longer has jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Arbitration awards covered by paragraph CARDINAL shall no longer be valid or enforceable .", "CARDINAL . Any principal or ancillary claims against ORG , expressed either in foreign or local currency , which arise out of the contracts entered into DATE and DATE , ratified by statute and terminated by virtue of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , are now proclaimed time - barred .", "CARDINAL . Any court proceedings at whatever level pending at the time of the enactment of this statute , in respect of claims within the meaning of the preceding paragraph , are declared void . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , after hearing the opinion of the judge - rapporteur calling for the appeal to be dismissed , ORG delivered its judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It held that LAW was unconstitutional on the following grounds :", "\" ...", "Not only does [ LAW confer superior force on Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , but it also prohibits subsequent amendments or additions thereto , or even authoritative interpretation thereof , in the form of ordinary legislation . The purpose of that superior force and of the provision in LAW requiring that a single law be enacted once and for all within DATE of the entry into force of the LAW was to ensure legislative stability and international confidence for investments in GPE . This opinion is based on the only possible meaning to be attributed to the expression \u2018 single law to be enacted once and for all\u2019 and on the ease with which the said provision would be flouted if amendments , additions or authoritative interpretation of that law were allowed ...", "It follows that ... the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which purport to provide an authoritative interpretation of and to amend and supplement LAW . CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL and which were enacted after the expiry of the time - limit laid down in LAW para . CARDINAL of the LAW are contrary to that instrument . In accordance with LAW para . CARDINAL of the LAW the court is therefore precluded from applying them . The ORG refuses to apply unconstitutional provisions and , pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , holds that it is bound to refer the case to ORG sitting in plenary session ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The hearing in ORG sitting in plenary session opened on DATE , but as a result of the death of CARDINAL of its members Stran sought a new hearing , which was held on DATE .", "ORG delivered its judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on DATE . It observed , inter alia :", "\" ... [ The LAW ] provides for the enactment of \u2018 a single law to be enacted once and for all\u2019 which by definition possesses superior force inasmuch as it may be neither supplemented nor amended by ordinary legislation ... However , the prohibition on supplementing or modifying the content of [ such ] laws does not mean that they may never be interpreted . The fact that they are sui generis , which gives them precedence over ordinary legislation , ... does not preclude their interpretation where the circumstances so require . The purpose of such interpretation is not to amend the substance of the law interpreted , but to clarify its original meaning and to resolve disputes that have arisen in connection with its application or which may do so in the future . [ The need for such interpretation ] will ultimately be determined by the court which will have to ascertain whether the meaning of the law interpreted actually gave rise to doubts justifying the intervention of the legislature ... Accordingly , the interpretation of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL is not contrary to LAW merely because it is a law of superior rank . It must nevertheless be determined , on the one hand , whether the interpretation was necessary in the specific case and , on the other , whether the non - interpretative provisions of this PERSON , which have a bearing on the solution of the case in issue , are contrary to LAW ... The wording [ of LAW para . CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] lacks clarity and creates doubt as to whether the arbitration clause survives the termination of the contract ... and as to the jurisdiction of the arbitration court . In the instant case doubt first arose in the course of the proceedings brought by [ the applicants ] in the ordinary civil court and again - following the preliminary decision of ORG - when those proceedings had been discontinued and recourse was had to arbitration , where diametrically opposed arguments were put forward ... Irrespective of those doubts , the main issue is the acceptance or rejection of the principle of the autonomous character of the arbitration clause and of its scope . For a long time this matter has been the subject of significant differences of opinion in international case - law and among legal writers . In some countries the principle of the survival of the clause to resolve disputes arising prior to the termination of contracts ... prevails . In other countries the dominant view is that termination of the contract entails the annulment of the clause and therefore the referral of all the disputes to the ordinary courts . In other countries again , the accepted view is that the autonomous character of the arbitration clause operates only in respect of certain types of dispute . It was therefore necessary to provide an interpretation of PERSON no . PERSON and that interpretation resolved the problem for the purposes of NORP law by opting for the annulment of arbitration clauses ... and the removal of jurisdiction from the arbitration court . The fact that the intervention of the legislature occurred ... DATE before the hearing in ORG of this ORG and following a previous adjournment does not mean that it was not necessary and does not render it contrary to LAW paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The dispute in question provided the opportunity to resolve a problem which had already arisen . Consequently , it can not be concluded that , in giving such an interpretation in this case , the legislature interfered with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and usurped that jurisdiction . It follows that , contrary to the finding of ORG , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of Law no . DATE is not in breach of the LAW ... \"", "ORG took the view that paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL was not unconstitutional as it essentially supplemented paragraph CARDINAL and sought to deprive of effect any arbitration awards that were made after the termination of contracts and that would not have been made if the meaning of PERSON no . PERSON had been clarified in time . In addition , the court refused to examine the constitutionality of paragraph CARDINAL , finding that it had no bearing on the case before it . Finally , it held that the adoption of paragraph CARDINAL shortly before the hearing purported to remove from the courts the possibility of determining the validity of the contested award . That provision therefore violated the principle of the separation of powers .", "CARDINAL .
