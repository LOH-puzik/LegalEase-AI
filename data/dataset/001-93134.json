SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant ( the applicant company ) is a NORP limited liability company , PERSON och ORG i Norden AB . The other applicants , PERSON ( the second applicant ) , Mr PERSON ( the third applicant ) , PERSON ( the fourth applicant ) and PERSON ( the fifth applicant ) , all of whom are NORP nationals and live in the south of GPE , are the owners of the applicant company . The applicants are represented before the ORG by the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant has also made some separate complaints . He is , regarding these complaints , represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG decided to perform a tax audit of the applicant company . On DATE a preliminary audit report ( f\u00f6rhandspromemoria ) was drawn up .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , on the basis of the findings of the preliminary audit report , ORG requested ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE to sequestrate ( bel\u00e4gga med betalningss\u00e4kring ) the applicant company \u2019s assets to the amount of MONEY ( SEK ) which corresponded to the company \u2019s tax debt , including tax surcharges , as estimated at that time . ORG further requested that the decision be taken without the applicant company having been heard or informed of the request .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted that it had discovered invoices that appeared false ( osanna ) , in that they gave the incorrect impression that the applicant company had hired labour from subcontractors ( under - entrepren\u00f6rer ) in order to make deductions for costs and ingoing value - added tax ( VAT ) , thereby avoiding paying employer \u2019s contributions ( arbetsgivaravgifter ) for its own employees . Furthermore , ORG pointed out several defects in the invoices , for example , that they lacked information proving the amount of TIME worked and who the customer was . ORG further claimed , inter alia , that most of the subcontractors had not , during the time they were supposedly supplying the applicant company with labour , accounted for any salaries paid to employees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for sequestration as it found that ORG had not , to a sufficient degree , proven that the applicant company had the alleged tax debt .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining its claim but no longer requesting that the decision be taken without the applicant company having been heard or informed of it . In particular , ORG stressed that a representative of CARDINAL of the subcontractors who had been heard during the preliminary criminal investigation ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) initiated by ORG ( DATE hereafter \u201c the Bureau \u201d ) had denied any knowledge of the applicant company and had denied that he had issued any invoices to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant company \u2019s request , an oral hearing was held before ORG . At the hearing ORG referred to some interrogation reports ( f\u00f6rh\u00f6rsprotokoll ) held with CARDINAL persons during the ORG \u2019s preliminary criminal investigation . These reports had , prior to the oral hearing , not been referred to by ORG . ORG adjourned the hearing for TIME to give the applicant company \u2019s representative time to consider the new material . When the hearing resumed , the applicant company objected to the fact that ORG had been allowed to refer to selected parts of the very extensive body of information to which only ORG had access .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the hearing the applicant company was afforded DATE to supplement the grounds for its plea .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company demanded that ORG reject ORG appeal and that the court grant it access to all the information in the GPE \u2019s criminal investigation . It submitted that the invoices corresponded to services ordered and paid for and that it had verified that all subcontractors had certificates proving that they were responsible for paying taxes and contributions for their businesses ( PERSON ) and who their legal representatives were .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rendered its judgment in the case . It found that the merits of the case were such as to make it probable that the applicant company would not be allowed to deduct the ingoing VAT . It further considered there to be an obvious risk that the applicant company would try to shirk responsibility for the debt . Therefore , and since the court did not find it disproportionate , it granted ORG request as regards the ORG . However , the court found that it would be in breach of LAW to sequester the applicant company \u2019s assets corresponding to the estimated tax surcharges . The court , therefore , rejected ORG appeal in that part . The court also found that it could not , within the instant case , try the applicant company \u2019s request to grant it access to all the information in the ORG \u2019s criminal investigation . Therefore , it dismissed that request .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed against the judgment . ORG requested ORG ( ORG ) to sequester an additional part of the applicant company \u2019s assets , corresponding to the debt regarding tax surcharges , whereas the applicant company requested the court to quash ORG judgment . In its appeal , the applicant company complained , inter alia , that ORG had been allowed to use selected information from the criminal investigation and that the applicant company had not been allowed access to the entire investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted ORG leave to appeal and , on DATE , it found that the sequestration of assets to cover tax debts concerning tax surcharges would not be in violation of the ORG , as long as the principle of proportionality and the limitations set out in the PERSON on sequestration for taxes , tolls and fees ( lagen om betalningss\u00e4kring f\u00f6r skatter , tullar och avgifter ) were respected . The court then noted that the tax debt , including the tax surcharges , had at the time of its judgment been confirmed by ORG . After having observed that the tax debt concerned a substantial amount , the court found that there was a considerable risk that the applicant company would try to shirk responsibility for the debt . Therefore , and since the court did not find it disproportionate , it granted ORG appeal and sequestrated additional property corresponding to the tax surcharges . In the same judgment , ORG refused leave to appeal in all other parts of the case .", "CARDINAL . At some point the ORG had initiated a criminal investigation regarding aggravated tax crimes and aggravated book - keeping crimes against several people involved with the applicant company , including the second applicant . In DATE the ORG conducted a search of the applicant company \u2019s premises , questioned several people and seized part of the applicant company \u2019s books . However , on DATE the ORG dropped the criminal investigation against the second applicant , since it considered that it would not be able to prove that he had committed any criminal acts . In DATE the criminal investigation was dropped against the other suspects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant company was declared bankrupt , as it was unable to pay its tax debts ( other than the ones concerned in this case ) and therefore found to be insolvent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant company was not entitled to certain deductions claimed by it in its GPE declarations for DATE . Therefore , it refused the applicant company ORG deductions amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and , in addition , found the applicant company liable to pay SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) , as it was considered to have supplied incorrect information in its GPE declarations . This decision was based on the results of the tax audit of the applicant company that had been carried out by ORG DATE and which had resulted in an audit report ( revisionspromemoria ) of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was not appealed against by the applicant company or any of its representatives .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time during DATE ORG requested ORG of GPE , in accordance with the rules on personal responsibility for representatives of corporations ( f\u00f6retr\u00e4dar - ansvar ) , to oblige the second applicant to pay SEK MONEY with interest to the ORG . ORG claimed that the applicant company , according to the audit report , had issued false invoices to cover up payment of salaries to the applicant company \u2019s own employees . By making deductions for the ingoing VAT in the invoices , the applicant company had , inter alia , wrongfully been awarded repayment of a surplus of ingoing VAT to the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . ORG further submitted that the second applicant , who owned shares in the applicant company and who had been its only board member and sole representative , had with intent or through gross negligence supplied the authorities with false information which had led to the applicant company being wrongfully awarded repayment of a surplus of ingoing GPE . Moreover , ORG noted that it had decided in accordance with the information in the tax audit and that neither the applicant company nor the second applicant had appealed against its decision , despite the fact that such a possibility existed before as well as after ORG had petitioned ORG in the present case . Therefore , ORG argued , no examination of the validity of the underlying tax decision should be made in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant contested the claim . He submitted , inter alia , that the applicant company had not been wrongfully awarded repayment of ingoing NORP and that ORG had not been able to prove that the invoices were false . The applicant company had not appealed against ORG decision of DATE because it had by then been declared bankrupt . Furthermore , he submitted that he had not acted with intent or gross negligence . He had come into an already on - going business and the actual administration of the company had been handled by CARDINAL other persons who had been responsible for all invoices . The invoices had also been inspected by the applicant company \u2019s accounting consultant , who had made no criticism of the invoices or how the company was run . The second applicant himself had made sure that all the subcontractors had certificates proving that they were responsible for paying taxes and contributions for their businesses and that the companies had complete boards of directors . Therefore , he had had no reason to believe that the invoices were false and no criticism could be made of his management of the company \u2019s administration . Moreover , the second applicant claimed that there were special reasons to remit liability , in full or at least partly , because his influence and involvement in the company \u2019s business had been limited and very brief .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rendered its judgment . It first noted that the second applicant had been a shareholder and the sole member of the board in the applicant company during the time when the incorrect information had been given and that he had signed the tax declarations which had contained the incorrect information . The court further considered that the second applicant had had an obligation to ensure that the applicant company promptly and correctly paid its taxes and fees . In its view , none of his objections were such as to call into question the validity of the underlying tax decision . In any event , the court observed that the second applicant had had the overall responsibility for the management of the company and that he could not relinquish this responsibility to his colleagues . Lastly , it stressed that he had been responsible for ensuring that the information given in the tax declarations was correct . Thus , the court found that the second applicant \u2019s insufficient control over the management of the applicant company amounted to gross negligence . Therefore , and since there were no reasons to remit liability , the court granted ORG request .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG in GPE , requesting , in the first place , that the court reject ORG petition . In the alternative , he requested that the liability be remitted in full or lowered . He maintained his claims and stressed , inter alia , that , despite a lengthy investigation into the applicant company by the ORG , no one had been charged with any criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . ORG disputed the appeal and submitted that the ORG had dropped the criminal investigation because it had not deemed it possible to prove whether the acts had been committed by the second applicant or another person involved with the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rendered its judgment . It first noted that the case before it had come to concern mainly the question of the significance of the underlying tax decision of DATE . In this respect , it noted that there had been no appeal against the tax decision and that the second applicant had not requested that the decision be tried in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( skattebetalningslagen ) . Hence , the court found that , because of the existing possibilities for the second applicant to have the underlying tax decision tried , before as well as after ORG had petitioned ORG in the present case , the validity of the underlying tax decision could not be tried within the instant proceedings . The court then considered that the second applicant \u2019s management of the applicant company had been lacking to such an extent he had to be considered grossly negligent . Therefore , and since there were no special reasons to remit liability , the second applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG where he maintained his claims . He also complained about the fact that ORG had refused to try the validity of the underlying tax decision within the instant proceedings . Furthermore , he stressed that the criminal investigation against all persons involved in the applicant company had been dropped , for which reason ORG should not have been allowed to refer to the allegedly false invoices . He further claimed that the courts had violated the presumption of innocence when they based their judgments on criminal acts which had not been proven .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON on sequestration for taxes , tolls and fees ( lagen om betalningss\u00e4kring f\u00f6r skatter , tullar och avgifter , FAC \u2013 hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) contains provisions that give the ORG a possibility to sequester property to ensure payment for a claim for taxes , tolls , or fees in situations where it is feared that the debtor might otherwise try to shirk payment . The provisions roughly correspond to the provisions on provisional attachment ( kvarstad ) possible in civil or criminal cases and their purpose is to secure temporarily payment of the ORG \u2019s claims until voluntary payment of the debt is made or it can be secured through attachment ( indrivning ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW states that a debtor \u2019s property may be sequestered to cover the ORG \u2019s claim for taxes , tolls or fees . If the claim has not yet been confirmed ( fastst\u00e4lld ) , sequestration may be utilised only if there is probable cause ( sannolika sk\u00e4l ) to believe that the claim will be confirmed and only to the expected amount of the confirmed claim .", "CARDINAL . From section CARDINAL of LAW it follows that sequestration may be used also as regards claims for GPE and tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , sequestration may be used only if there is a considerable risk that the debtor will try to shirk payment of the debt and the debt concerns considerable amounts . Furthermore , sequestration may only be used if the reasons for sequestration outweigh the encroachment or harm suffered by the debtor or any other opposing interest .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( skattebetalningslagen , ORG hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) contains , inter alia , provisions regulating how to account for and how to pay one \u2019s preliminary and final tax and ORG . It also prescribes responsibility regarding payment of taxes that can be levied on representatives of corporations .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL ( a ) of the DATE Act states that if a representative of a corporation , with intent or by gross negligence , has supplied incorrect information which has led to the corporation being wrongfully awarded a surplus of ingoing GPE , the representative is responsible for the repayment of the amount with interest , together with the corporation .", "CARDINAL . If there are special reasons ( s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l ) the liability for the representative may , according to LAW , section CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW be remitted , fully or in part .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act states that a representative of a corporation , against whom proceedings in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL ( a ) have been instituted , may institute proceedings before a court to have the validity of the underlying tax decision tried ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
