The merchant ship suddenly changed course and began to steer a course that was dangerous both for the frigate and for members of the armed forces who had boarded a speedboat . While the Winner refused to answer the attempts of the commander of the frigate to establish radio contact , its crew jettisoned a number of packages into the sea ; one of the packages , containing QUANTITY of cocaine , was recovered by the NORP seamen . After several warnings and warning shots fired under orders from GPE \u2019s maritime prefect for the LOC went unheeded , the NORP frigate fired a shot directly at the Winner . The merchant ship then answered by radio and agreed to stop . When they boarded the Winner , the NORP commando team used their weapons to open certain locked doors . When a crew member of the Winner refused to obey their commands , a \u201c warning shot \u201d was fired at the ground , but the bullet ricocheted and the crew member was wounded . He was immediately evacuated onto the NORP frigate , then transferred to GPE hospital , where he died DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the public prosecutor in GPE , a tug with a military doctor on board was sent from ORG to tow the Winner back to GPE harbour , escorted by the frigate FAC .

All GPE shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions .", "CARDINAL . Any ORG which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other GPE to suppress such traffic .", "Considering that , based on that text and \u2018 with GPE to the earlier LAW of DATE against international drug trafficking , the NORP authorities were within their rights to request GPE \u2019s cooperation with a view to obtaining that country \u2019s authorisation to intercept the Winner in order to put a stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew was suspected of being involved ; that as the provisions of LAW do not apply to GPE , it was for that ORG to ask the NORP authorities for all the relevant information concerning the alleged drug trafficking to enable it to assess the merits of the request using its unfettered discretion ; that the diplomatic telegram sent by the NORP embassy on DATE , which actually mentions the reasoned request submitted by the ORG , suffices to establish the existence of an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the government of GPE for the planned interception and all its consequences , and is authoritative until proven otherwise ; that on this point the applicants can not contend that the document does not meet the formal requirements of LAW of LAW concerning bilateral agreements between parties , when they are also arguing that LAW is not applicable to GPE because it has not signed it ; and that the value of the diplomatic document is not affected by the fact that the accused did not know the exact status of the person who signed the message or the person who transmitted the NORP government \u2019s agreement to the NORP embassy .", "Considering , on the other hand , that in proceeding to intercept the Winner it was the duty of the NORP authorities to comply with the procedures provided for both in LAW signed by GPE \u2013 in particular to \u2018 take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea , the security of the vessel and its DATE and in the Law of DATE , as amended by the PERSON of DATE adapting NORP law to LAW , Articles CARDINAL et seq . of which define the sphere of competence of commanders of naval vessels and the procedures for the search , reporting , prosecution and judgment in the NORP courts of drug trafficking offences committed at sea .", "Considering that the reports drawn up by the commander of the Lieutenant de vaisseau ORG , duly authorised by the maritime prefect for the LOC , which are authoritative until proven otherwise , state that when the frigate drew within sight of the Winner , off the LOC islands , the merchant ship was flying no flag and its captain not only failed to answer the requests to identify his ship , in breach of the rules of international law , and to stop his ship , but responded aggressively with a series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the NORP frigate and the lives of the sailors on board the speedboat ; that it was also reported that the crew of the Winner were seen to be throwing suspicious parcels overboard , CARDINAL of which was recovered and found to contain a large quantity of cocaine ; that all these elements together amounted to reasonable grounds for the commander of the frigate to suspect that he was in the presence of drug traffickers who had jettisoned their cargo before attempting to escape ; and that by using force to board the Winner and taking appropriate coercive measures to control the crew and confine them to their cabins and to take over and sail the ship , the commander of the frigate acted in strict compliance with :", "\u2013 the provisions of LAW of LAW under which , if evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found after a ship has been boarded and searched , appropriate action may be taken with respect to the vessel and the persons and cargo on board ,", "\u2013 the provisions of the PERSON of DATE as supplemented by the LAW DATE , which , in its general provisions ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) regulates recourse to coercive measures comprising , if necessary , the use of force in the event of refusal by a ship to submit to control and also , in the particular case of the fight against drug trafficking ( ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , makes provision for the implementation of the control and coercion measures provided for under international law .", "Considering that , regard being had to the distinctly aggressive conduct of the captain of the Winner in attempting to evade inspection by the NORP naval authorities , and to the attitude of the crew members , who took advantage of the time thus gained to eliminate any traces of the drug trafficking by deliberately throwing the evidence overboard , the members of the commando unit who boarded the ship found themselves in the presence of large - scale international trafficking and were likely at any moment to come up against a hostile and potentially dangerous crew who could threaten the security of their mission ; that they were obliged to use their weapons in response to the resistance put up by one of the ship \u2019s crew ; that it can not be claimed that LAW of DATE as amended provides only for administrative assistance measures and excludes any form of coercion in respect of people when it stipulates in general terms that the competent maritime authorities are authorised to carry out or have carried out \u2018 the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law\u2019 , and LAW ( c ) of LAW in Narcotic Drugs [ and Psychotropic Substances ] expressly mentions taking \u2018 appropriate action with respect to the persons on board\u2019 ; that although the nature of these measures is not specified , the text at least provides for the possibility for the competent naval authorities to limit , if necessary , the freedom of the boarded ship \u2019s crew to come and go , otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised ; that it can not be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew may have weapons hidden away and may seek to regain control of the ship by force ; that consequently , confining the members of the crew of the Winner \u2013 all but the wounded man , who was transferred to the frigate \u2013 to their cabins under the guard of the commando unit , so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted , fell within the appropriate measures provided for in LAW ( c ) of LAW .", "Considering that the Law of DATE necessarily requires some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas , in keeping with the rules of international law , and for the fact that it is impossible in practice , bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination , to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before a judge ; and , that being so , that the restrictions placed on the movements of the boarded ship \u2019s crew , as authorised in such cases by ORG signed in GPE on DATE , were not at variance with LAW of LAW and did not amount to unlawful detention ; and that it should be noted that as soon as the Winner docked in GPE , its crew were handed over to the police , immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody , then brought before the investigating judge .", "Considering also that the NORP courts have jurisdiction under LAW of DATE as amended .", "... the grounds of nullity must accordingly be rejected [ and ] there is no reason to disallow any other documents from the proceedings , which are lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants in the following terms :", "\u201c ... in so far as GPE , the flag ORG , expressly and without restriction authorised the NORP authorities to stop the Winner and , in keeping with LAW , only appropriate action was taken against the persons on board , who were lawfully taken into police custody as soon as they landed on NORP soil , ORG has justified its decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
