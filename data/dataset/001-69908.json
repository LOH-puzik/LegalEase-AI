NORP The applicant , born in DATE , originates from the former GPE ( currently the ORG ) . He arrived in GPE on DATE and immediately applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . On his arrival in GPE the applicant filed an asylum request written in LANGUAGE , stating that he had left the ORG DATE ; that he had been trained to join the presidential guards and had been working as an informant in Office D of the special force responsible for protecting the then President PERSON ( Division PERSON ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ; that he had belonged to the President \u2019s and the ORG Commander - in - Chief \u2019s inner circle ; that he had been arrested in GPE while in the possession of a ORG badge and a photograph of ORG ; that his life was in danger on account of his position and his GPE origin ; and that FAC regime ( who had seized the power in the ORG in DATE ) had put out a warrant of arrest on former ORG agents . The applicant named CARDINAL high - ranking officers within the ORG whose grades he also indicated .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of the asylum interview with the applicant on DATE , it was conducted with the assistance of a NORP interpreter . The applicant stated that he had been born on DATE in NORP in former GPE ; that he was a NORP of the NORP tribe ; that he had been a ORG agent by profession ; that he had resided at GPE no . CARDINAL at the presidential compound GPE in GPE ; that he was single ; that his mother tongue was PERSON and that he also knew NORP , PERSON and LANGUAGE . He indicated the names of his parents and sister . He had gone to elementary and high school for a total of DATE and had undergone a DATE training programme to become a garde civile . He had performed his military service in DATE , receiving the grade GT CARDINAL ( regional guard , class II ) . He also indicated his salary while working in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stated that he had been an asylum seeker in the GPE from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when he had been deported . On his return he had been living at FAC together with the President \u2019s nephew , a named general . He had had at his disposal CARDINAL rooms , a living room , a shower and parking spaces for his CARDINAL cars . He had also had a considerable amount of money at his disposal .", "CARDINAL . Asked why he did not carry a passport on arriving in GPE , he had stated that it had remained with a ( named ) Commander in the President \u2019s administration when the applicant had left the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Asked to describe his departure from the ORG , the applicant stated that he had left GPE by boat to go to the airport in GPE ( GPE ) on DATE . At DATE he had continued by train to Point Noir and from there by boat to FAC in GPE . There he had been staying for DATE in order to acquire an NORP identity card ; he had been living in a house owned by a local . He had then travelled to GPE by plane ; he had run into some difficulties as he had not been speaking NORP ; he had been arrested but had been allowed to continue his journey after he had paid some money . He had stayed in GPE in the GPE neighbourhood for DATE , following which he had been detained in the PERSON prison for DATE ( in DATE ) , the authorities having taken him for a soldier in GPE \u2019s forces as he had been unable to speak LANGUAGE . During his detention a rifle had been used to hit him in the shoulder and he had been forced to dig graves . In DATE he had been transferred to an army prison in Bengela , where he had spent a further DATE . Prisoners had been forced to take part in armed fighting but the applicant had managed to avoid this due to his injured and infected shoulder . The fighting had occurred at the diamond mines where NORP rebels ( the ORG guerrilla ) had been fighting President PERSON do PERSON \u2019s troops .", "CARDINAL . After a fellow detainee , GPE , had promised to help him out of prison the applicant had arrived in the NORP border town GPE on DATE . With the assistance of a \u201c merchant \u201d he had left for GPE through GPE on DATE , travelling under a cover on a truck . From GPE he had departed for GPE on a ORG flight on DATE . The airport staff had helped him embark on the plane even though he had possessed no documents . From GPE he had continued on a ORG flight to GPE on DATE . GPE had arranged for someone to explain to the applicant how to get to GPE . In GPE the applicant had been able to transfer to the plane for GPE simply by showing his boarding pass .", "CARDINAL . As for his reasons for leaving the ORG in DATE , the applicant stated that when President PERSON had fled and had been replaced by LAW , the latter \u2019s regime had started killing all who had been working under PERSON . Were the applicant to return to the ORG he too would be killed as a former ORG agent . In addition , he was of the GPE tribe to which ORG also belonged .", "CARDINAL . Asked how he had organised his trip the applicant stated that GPE had paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the whole \u201c package \u201d . The applicant had possessed some money of his own as well as diamonds . Before leaving the ORG he had stolen diamonds from \u201c the office of the NORP \u201d ; actually , it had not been a theft but \u201c a question of saving a life \u201d . The diamonds had belonged to PERSON \u2019s son ; the applicant had sold them in GPE for CARDINAL , aided by a friend named PERSON . The applicant had not seen which country \u2019s passport GPE had organised for him to use .", "CARDINAL . Asked about his political activities the applicant stated having worked as a secret agent for PERSON \u2019s army from DATE ( in the office of the ORG and ORG of the Bureau d\u2019Intelligence ) . Under the cover of a civilian in the street he had been listening in on the opposition \u2019s criticism of PERSON and had denounced various individuals critical of the regime . In DATE the ( named ) Commander of Office D had sent him to the GPE to denounce individuals criticising PERSON . After he had reported their names to the Commander their families in GPE had been apprehended . The applicant had travelled to the GPE on an NORP passport under the name of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Asked whether he had ever been convicted and sentenced , formally wanted by the authorities or tortured or threatened , the applicant answered in the negative .", "CARDINAL . Responding to a request for assistance from the NORP authorities , ORG , in DATE confirmed \u2013 after having matched the applicant \u2019s fingerprints \u2013 that he had applied for asylum in the GPE in DATE , that his request had been refused in DATE and that his objection to the refusal had been declared unfounded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . It emerges from the material forwarded by the NORP authorities that when seeking asylum in DATE the applicant had referred to his father as a military official ; that from DATE the CARDINAL had been leaking information about the ORG to the opposition group ORG and had eventually been arrested ; that the applicant had been playing on the same football team as President PERSON \u2019s son ; that on DATE he had been granted leave to play a match after which he had managed to escape during a meal with the team ; and that afterwards he had travelled to the GPE via ORG , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities had concluded that the applicant \u2019s account in DATE had not been credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ulkomaalais - virasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion to the ORG and prohibited him from re - entering GPE , or from entering GPE , GPE , GPE or GPE for DATE . The ORG found the applicant \u2019s account of his having belonged to President PERSON \u2019s and the ORG Commander \u2019s inner circle not credible . The applicant had also failed to prove his identity . If returned , the applicant would not face any real risk of treatment contrary to LAW merely on account of belonging to the same tribe as the former President or having worked as a lower - ranking official in his administration . As far as the ORG was aware , only higher - ranking officials who had been abusing their office risked prosecution by the PERSON regime . That regime had actually been quite accepting of officials having worked for PERSON and many such officials of senior rank had already returned to the country . The regime in the ORG had changed again in DATE , following which the general situation in the country had improved .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the applicant had been found guilty on CARDINAL counts of shoplifting in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant \u2013 assisted by counsel and an interpreter DATE stated that he was the son of an officer in the ORG and had been sent to military service at DATE . He had passed his school examination in DATE . His first missions for the ORG had involved infiltrating dissident student associations at universities . CARDINAL secret agents had been operating at different faculties . During a mission to GPE he had been investigating cobalt smuggling to GPE . He had travelled to GPE as a \u201c student \u201d and had denounced someone who had eventually been arrested . He had sworn CARDINAL oaths of loyalty , CARDINAL for the ORG ( Forces Arm\u00e9es Zairoises ) and a further one for President PERSON and the ORG . The latter had been responsible for the President \u2019s security and had been led by a general and his deputy , both of whom the applicant named . The President \u2019s son PERSON , a captain by rank had been ORG \u2019s friend ; they had slept in the same pavillon ( no . CARDINAL in the first zone of FAC ) , with the President \u2019s uncle PERSON and his children . The first zone of the compound had comprised altogether CARDINAL pavillons , intended only for the President \u2019s family . The compound had also comprised a second , less protected outer zone . ORG drew a map of the compound to show where pavillon no . CARDINAL had been located in relation to DATE . He also drew a map of the presidential offices as well as of those of the ORG and ORG . He indicated on the map the location of the President \u2019s special entrance and exit as well as the football field on the compound .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had returned from GPE the ORG commander had assigned him for a mission to the GPE . After he had disposed of his NORP passport in GPE \u201c people smugglers \u201d had handed him a different one . The aim of this mission had been to denounce people who were falsifying ORG signature to collect money . Moreover , as President \u2019s PERSON \u2019s son had not been allowed to enter GPE to trade in cobalt and diamonds the applicant and other ORG agents were assigned to organise his illegal entry into GPE on a regular basis so he could do his business . A further aim of this mission had been to denounce dissidents in the GPE so that reprisals could be taken on their families in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been escorted out of the GPE by police towards DATE . During a further ORG mission to the region of GPE , where troubles had begun with NORP refugees entering GPE , he had found out that LAW rebel troops had been infiltrating and poisoning GPE soldiers .", "CARDINAL . Around DATE it had been discovered that information on President PERSON \u2019s health was being leaked to PERSON \u2019s troops , involving a suspected traitor within ORG . The main suspect \u2013 the head of the postal and telecommunications services who had masterminded the tapping of mobile phones \u2013 had eventually fled to GPE but had returned when PERSON had taken over power .", "CARDINAL . As for the events surrounding the overthrow of President PERSON , the applicant had been woken up by ORG agents during TIME DATE as the ORG could no longer protect the President against PERSON \u2019s troops . The President had told his security staff he would leave for Gbadolite TIME and that a general within ORG / ORG \u201c had to die \u201d as he had asked the soldiers to lay down their guns and surrender to PERSON \u2019s troops . A general had been appointed Prime Minister during the emergency state . President PERSON had told his son PERSON that he should leave the country as the last member of their family . The applicant had been with ORG in the presidential ORG when word came that the general in question had been killed . In TIME of CARDINAL May the rebels had entered GPE . The ORG commander had already left for GPE after dispatching the President by plane to Gbadolite . The applicant and others ( CARDINAL persons in total ) had crossed the river to escape from GPE to GPE in cano\u00ebs rapides . From GPE they had planned to fly to Gbadolite . From the GPE airport ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) PERSON had telephoned to ask for a plane to pick them up . The pilot had refused to fly the plane out of GPE as it had been the property of GPE . The group had then decided to split up and to take different routes . The applicant and CARDINAL or CARDINAL others had gone by train to GPE and from there by boat to FAC in GPE . As he had spoken no local language , he had found a Lingala - speaker and had been able to procure an NORP identity document paper . The group had nonetheless been arrested at the FAC airport as they spoke no NORP . Immigration officials had detained them in a room but after the group had bribed a commander they had been able to leave by plane to GPE . It had been quite common for NORP to enter GPE by bribing border officials .", "CARDINAL . In Luanda N. had failed to obey a police officer in the street since he had not understood NORP . He had been detained at the Viam police station , where he had been assaulted . PERSON of this were still visible on his body . He had been transferred to FAC where he been forced to dig graves . Some prisoners had been \u201c recruited \u201d to fight in the army of the NORP leader PERSON against the rebel leader ORG . ORG had avoided this , as he had been injured in the shoulder and could not carry a fire arm .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had eventually been able to bribe a Lingala - speaking captain to let him \u201c escape \u201d . His friends had brought the necessary money and the captain had accompanied him to GPE at the NORP - Namibian border . In GPE , NORP shop owners had organised \u201c people smuggling \u201d to GPE via GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG agents had not intended to leave GPE for good . When President PERSON had been forced to escape to GPE to avoid being taken hostage by pro - PERSON agents , ORG had decided to go to GPE to join the ORG commander and another ORG general , following which they had repeatedly re - entered GPE to lead troops in the fighting against PERSON \u2019s army . The CARDINAL generals had eventually been arrested on the orders of President PERSON following a request by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Replying to questions from his counsel , the applicant further explained that President PERSON had left for GPE in a NORP cargo plane used for smuggling weapons to the rebel leader ORG in GPE . A ORG car had been driven onto the plane so the President could sit properly . While in GPE the applicant and others in his group had watched on ORG how civilians in GPE had been showing the houses of GPE \u2019s supporters to the rebels . The applicant would have been killed instantly had he returned then . PERSON supporters who had been denounced had either been shot , burned alive by being placed in a car tyre set on fire or burned inside cars , as ORG had shown . If the applicant were to be returned to the ORG , those in power and even civilians would recognise him and he would be \u201c attacked \u201d since he had been close to GPE . If returned to ORG , a soldier such as himself could even be killed by ORG soldiers currently protecting President PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Replying to questions from the lawyer for ORG , the applicant reiterated the name of President PERSON \u2019s son : PERSON ( a.k.a . \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . The applicant further contended that he had sought asylum in the GPE for infiltration purposes .", "CARDINAL . When asked by a judge whether he had had \u201c his \u201d passport on him when leaving GPE for GPE , the applicant answered in the negative . He had paid CARDINAL of the \u201c people smugglers \u201d who had been working with airport staff to let him go through to the gate only with a boarding pass .", "CARDINAL . N. had originally wished to go to GPE but this had not been possible to organise due to the number of transits and the need to show a passport . He had not wished to go to GPE , where many NORP were living and he could have been recognised as someone who had been close to GPE . The \u201c agent \u201d organising his trip had suggested GPE and the applicant had accepted . As the itinerary had been GPE - GPE - GPE he had received CARDINAL boarding passes already in GPE . The name on his boarding pass had been PERSON or something to that effect . There had been no need for him to show a passport . He had financed the ticket by having sold diamonds in GPE . The President \u2019s son had given him diamonds before they had parted . In GPE a person had showed the applicant to the gate for the plane for GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not been in touch with his mother , father or sibling as the phone numbers had changed with the new Government .", "CARDINAL . Questioned further by another judge the applicant stated that the President \u2019s son had authorised ORG agents to take diamonds from the mines . He had been able to cross the border to GPE without any verification taking place . When he had been detained , the diamonds had been in his briefcase which had been locked with a code . He had carried it personally to GPE and had left it in a house there . When he had been arrested the other members of his party had taken care of his belongings , including the briefcase . The diamonds had been unpolished . As he had had to bribe persons and help various friends out he had sold the last ones in GPE . Their total value had been CARDINAL . He had had \u201c a little bit \u201d of money left when he arrived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Questioned further by the third judge the applicant explained that his military service had lasted DATE in total ; he had been trained as a commando in ORG . After this he had returned to school . His training to become a garde civile had occurred at the age of CARDINAL . After DATE of training he had returned to ORG and had been expecting to be promoted to lieutenant . He had grown up with the President \u2019s son PERSON from DATE , when he had arrived in GPE . PERSON , DATE , had died in DATE . The applicant had not sought to contact PERSON \u2019s family and did not know their whereabouts . PERSON had had CARDINAL brothers , CARDINAL of whom had died in AIDS . The applicant had been sent to undergo military service as a punishment for being stubborn .", "CARDINAL . Questioned about his work and life in GPE the applicant stated that while he was volunteering in the GPE refugee reception centre , he was afraid of making friends with other NORP as they might find out that he had been in ORG and take revenge on him . CARDINAL other nationals of the ORG had received residence permits in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its final pleadings to ORG considered the applicant \u2019s account not credible . There were significant contradictions in his account of his military service as well as discrepancies between the asylum record and his oral statements . While he had recounted many facts , he was not generally credible .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant underscored that the asylum record from the interview on DATE had been very meagre . In his oral statement the applicant had given a detailed and coherent account and his credibility was beyond doubt . ORG was claiming on very weak grounds that he was not credible . If there was any hesitation as to his credibility , the scales should tip in his favour . He risked persecution in ORG due to his nationality , ethnicity and political opinion . He not only feared ill - treatment emanating from the current regime but also from individual civilians seeking revenge . As he had no home to return to in the ORG he would be easily recognisable as a stranger and risk being questioned . The general human rights situation in the ORG was poor : security forces were carrying out killings and torture was wide - spread .", "CARDINAL . Counsel noted that CARDINAL interpreters had experienced difficulties following ORG vivid account . The asylum record indicated wrongly that the applicant had been living in the presidential palace whereas he had been living within the presidential compound .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s appeal by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . The majority noted that he had been appearing under different names . As an asylum seeker in the GPE he had stated that he had been a player on the ORG national football team led by President PERSON \u2019s son . The applicant \u2019s father was said to have been working in the ORG . When seeking asylum in GPE the applicant had stated that he had worked in the ORG ; that he had formed part of ORG \u2019s inner circle ; that he had been the childhood friend of PERSON \u2019s son ; that he had been sent to the GPE to denounce asylum seekers from the ORG ; and that he had assisted PERSON \u2019s son in entering GPE from GPE . At the oral hearing the applicant had provided a fairly extensive and detailed account of his activities in the ORG following his removal from the GPE as well as of his escape via GPE to GPE during PERSON \u2019s coming to power . The account of his escape via GPE and GPE in DATE had resembled significantly the account he had provided to the NORP authorities when entering that country in DATE . ORG did not find credible the account of his itinerary in DATE , including his having been able to embark on the plane from GPE without a valid ticket and passport . In those circumstances and considering that it had not been possible to verify his true identity ORG was not convinced of his general credibility . Moreover , the information he had presented regarding the ORG , PERSON \u2019s son \u2019s family life and the presidential compound did not in itself show that the applicant had been in the ORG in such a position as to be of particular interest to the current regime . Hence he was not likely to have any justified fear of being persecuted or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or to any other serious violation of his rights , if returned to his country .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judge found the applicant \u2019s account inconsistent despite its richness in detail . It did not therefore permit the drawing of any reliable conclusion as to his relationship with President PERSON \u2019s administration or as to whether he had worked in the ORG and , if so , in what position . Considering his detailed account the applicant could , on the one hand , have belonged to ORG and his relatives\u2019 inner circle without having had any direct contact with the President himself . On the other hand , the applicant could also have received the information regarding ORG administration from other sources . As his identity and background had not been convincingly established it could not be assessed whether the reason for his departure from the ORG had been persecution within the meaning of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . He could therefore not be granted asylum . Despite the lack of clarity of his account it could not be excluded however that he had been one of GPE \u2019s personal guards . This lack of clarity should be interpreted to the applicant \u2019s benefit . According to ORG of DATE , soldiers of the ORG were assessed as being at a particularly significant risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or other serious violations of their rights . The applicant therefore remained in need of protection within the meaning of LAW and should have been granted a residence permit to that effect .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire , relying on essentially the same reasons as the dissenting judge , concluded that the applicant should have been granted asylum as being in need of protection from persecution within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal asked for stay of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was detained by the police and informed that he would be deported on DATE . His counsel was informed that ORG would not grant or rule on his request for a suspension of the deportation order . He was later informed that the applicant would be removed from the country on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government of GPE decided not to deport the applicant to the ORG until the ORG had examined the applicant \u2019s application , following the ORG \u2019s interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of ORG ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his common - law wife PERSON met each other in DATE in GPE while they were both asylum seekers . They lived together in a reception centre for DATE until her deportation on DATE , her first asylum request having been refused .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE E. visited the applicant for DATE after her prohibition on re - entry had expired . As a result of this visit PERSON became pregnant . After this they kept up the contact by phone and mail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE E. arrived in GPE and filed a fresh request for asylum DATE . She moved in with the applicant in the reception centre in GPE . On DATE ORG refused the request as being manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a child was born to the applicant and PERSON The applicant \u2019s acknowledgement of paternity was confirmed by ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal but went on to refuse his appeal without an oral hearing . It found it established that on DATE ORG had applied for asylum in the GPE , claiming to be a football player and alleging that his brother and father had been working in the ORG . On his arrival in GPE on DATE he had filed a hand - written statement in NORP to the effect that he had left the ORG DATE ( i.e. in DATE ) as President PERSON and his close entourage had been chased out of the country . In GPE he had been detained because he had been in possession of a badge issued by the ORG and a photograph of President PERSON . In his asylum interview on DATE the applicant had claimed to have been a secret agent in the ORG and an infiltrator , whose actions in the GPE had led to the arrest of asylum PERSON family members in the ORG . Following his deportation from the GPE he had allegedly been living with the nephew of the former President .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had claimed to have been detained for DATE in GPE , whereas in GPE he had not been arrested , tortured , threatened . Neither had any warrant of arrest been put out in respect of him .", "CARDINAL . When arriving in the GPE the applicant had presented a identity document issued in former GPE on DATE , indicating as his date and place of birth DATE in GPE . He had claimed to have gone to school in GPE in DATE . In GPE he had presented no identity document but had claimed to have been born in Gbadolite . He had allegedly gone to school for DATE and had performed his military service in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the records , the applicant had appeared under CARDINAL different names . In his appeal to ORG he had explained the reasons for using those different names . ORG nevertheless considered that his identity and ethnic origin had remained unclear , which weakened the credibility of his account .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that his statements about the reasons for his arrests in GPE had differed . In particular , his allegation that he had , on that occasion , been carrying a ORG membership card and a picture of President PERSON was not credible . Neither did ORG find credible all aspects of his account of his journey to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the applicant had not shown in a credible manner that he had remained in the ORG until DATE . Neither had it been established where he had been residing between his expulsion from the GPE in DATE and his arrival in GPE in DATE . Even assuming that he had been sent to the GPE to infiltrate other asylum - seekers from his country , ORG did not find it credible that he would have gone there as an infiltrator in the manner recounted by him had he really belonged to PERSON \u2019s close entourage . Taking all the elements into account , it was justified to suspect that his various accounts were not based on facts which had actually occurred . This also weakened his overall credibility . His account as presented to the NORP authorities could not therefore be used as the sole basis for the court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL judges on ORG unanimously concluded as follows :", "\u201c Taking into account the recent developments in the ORG which have taken place since the applicant has allegedly left the country , the period of time which has passed since his departure , the significant lack of credibility in respect of his allegations concerning the risks he will be facing on his return to the ORG , the fact that he has not even claimed that he has had any contact with the local authorities who have been in office since the change of the regime on CARDINAL DATE or that he would have come to their knowledge , ORG can not consider that the applicant is facing a real risk of becoming a subject of interest to the present rulers . Therefore , [ the applicant ] does not have a well - founded fear of persecution for reasons of his ethnic origin , membership of a particular social group or political opinion within the meaning of LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . Thus , he can not be granted asylum . Even though the general security situation in GPE , the capital of the ORG , is still very delicate , there is no well - founded reason to assume that [ the applicant ] would face a risk of being subjected to serious human rights\u2019 violations or to inhuman or degrading treatment in his country of origin . Thus , he can not be issued a residence permit on the basis of his need of protection either . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore found that the applicant \u2019s family life as established in GPE was not such as to attract protection under LAW , given that neither parent had a valid residence permit or any other connection with GPE .", "CARDINAL . K.K. arrived in GPE on DATE and filed for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds on account of her background in the ORG . She claimed to have been a soldier in the ORG . She had been arrested following the murder of President PERSON in DATE . She had been detained for DATE during which she had allegedly been raped repeatedly by guards . Her request was refused by ORG on DATE . She then appealed to ORG which held an oral hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one ( with the r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire also dissenting ) , upheld the refusal of asylum but referred the question of a residence permit back to the ORG , instructing it to issue PERSON with such a permit . ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c The appellant is no longer likely to be arrested in her country of origin on account of the investigations into the murder of ( President ) PERSON . The appellant \u2019s personal prison experiences do not result from ( her ) belonging to a ( specific ) group in society or from her political views . Hence she can not be granted asylum .", "Following the change of President in ( the ORG ) in DATE the general security and human rights situation in the country has improved . The appellant has stated having resided in GPE prior to leaving the country . The GPE area is relatively calm . The fact that armed confrontations are still occurring , particularly in the NORP parts , and that the country \u2019s human rights situation is not yet stable , is not as such a sufficient ground for granting ( the appellant ) international protection . When , however , account is taken of the entirety of the circumstances as recounted by the appellant as well as of the information available from international news sources regarding the treatment of soldiers serving the PERSON regime , it is justified to find that the applicant might , on account of her military background and her past experiences , risk being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in her country of origin . ( She ) is therefore in need of protection within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and shall , for this reason , be issued with a residence permit . \u201d", "DATE . The dissenters found , even assuming PERSON \u2019s account to be truthful , that there was no reason for supposing that she would still risk ill - treatment or other serious violations of her rights if returned to the ORG . The dissenters relied on the progress which had taken place in the country as well as on the fact that she had been of no particular interest to the authorities following the coup GPE in DATE . She was therefore not in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE submitted to the ORG in support of the applicant \u2019s case Ms. PERSON stated that she had formed part of the ORG as first sergeant - major based at FAC in GPE . She had been working in the reconnaissance unit of the FAC Commander ( au service des renseignements pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des militaires ) .

In guidelines issued by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in DATE regarding refugees and asylum seekers from the ORG , soldiers of the ORG were generally assessed as a category risking persecution on account of association with the former ( PERSON ) regime .

A ORG position paper of DATE urged GPE to exercise very serious caution in cases of involuntary return of individuals with a military profile or background . Security agencies and immigration authorities systematically arrested former militaries , in some cases even those returning voluntarily , where previous negotiations with ORG had not taken place .", "CARDINAL . A country report prepared for the Eighth ORG in DATE stated the following of particular relevance to the present case ( pp . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201d Former members of ORG )", "Not all , but many of the former PERSON soldiers have been persecuted since President PERSON came to power in DATE . Some were taken to GPE military base , ostensibly for ideological and military training . Many of them were caught up in that base at the time of the resumption of the war in DATE . Many are feared to have lost their lives there or have been accused of being in alliance with GPE or with the armed opposition , and indeed many of them have been targeted . There are some who have joined the new army , so it can not be said that all of them are targeted by the government , but indeed some have been . Another element that creates a potential problem for members of ORG and former PERSON soldiers is the aforementioned perception that some former members of ORG are plotting to launch an attack on GPE from GPE . Some of the ORG soldiers , particularly the members of the NORP sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9sidentielle ( ORG ) , which was the bodyguard corps of President PERSON , also fought in the wars in GPE and joined the GPE - GPE army . Many of them still remain there . Since DATE there have been reports and fears on the part of the ORG government that some of these people are organising and regrouping with an intention of returning by force to GPE and recapturing state power . So these people will still remain at risk , whether or not they may be directly or not at all involved in plots against the ORG government . Indeed some of them are currently in custody . There have been attempts by the CARDINAL governments to create an understanding by actual agreements not to attack each other , but there still seems to remain a kind of mistrust between them . As a result , at least the GPE regime fears that there could be an attack from GPE . Another significant factor is that many of these ex - FAZ joined the ORG armed political group and as a result were also evidently fighting against the GPE government . Now that some form of power - sharing agreement has been signed , if it is implemented , one would assume that these former soldiers will end up in the national army . This may happen , but again this agreement has yet to be actually implemented . By and large the risk of persecution will depend on the specific circumstances of the particular individual . As regards the question of how important the military rank of a former ORG soldier is in this context , it has to be borne in mind that in some of these armies a rank may not always mean what it does in better established armies . Particularly in the ORG , a low - ranking soldier may politically have more power than a top general . There have been cases where a sergeant would beat up a major . Yet , the major , coming from an ethnic group that is not closely allied to the president , would not hit back or get the sergeant , corporal or even private who attacked him punished . He would not dare to touch him , although he is e.g. only a private , because he comes from GPE . Without connections to influential persons at the top , being a general does not really mean much under such circumstances . In the case e.g. of GPE a NORP private may be able to challenge the power of a NORP senior officer , not because he has been ordered to do so by the president or by someone else , but because he feels that he can do anything with impunity , that nobody will touch him because he happens to come from the ethnic group that is supposedly or really in power .", "Family members of ORG officials", "It would be possible that the children of such a soldier , be it a high - ranking officer or a private , would be targeted by the new authorities due to the fact that their father held the respective position during the PERSON regime . Sometimes people are abused without any justification at all . On the other hand , even a civilian , linked to someone who was in a powerful position , may have been responsible for abuses for which he may be held liable or be subjected to reprisals . To cite an example , when a general \u2019s or minister \u2019s son drives an expensive foreign car or a military ORG , misuses power - or others only think he misuses power - or makes a lot of money , people would assume that he would not have that power and/or money if he was not related to the minister . Hence , when that minister leaves power , that individual , too , could be at risk . While this does not happen on a regular basis , it is however a real possibility . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to a further ORG assessment of DATE , certain individuals who had either been deported or had returned voluntarily to the ORG could face serious problems if interrogated by security forces upon arrival in GPE . Should the authorities discover that a deportee had a political or military profile , or had sought asylum abroad owing to such a background , he or she could be at risk of arbitrary detention and ill - treatment ( \u201c ORG from GPE \u201d , p.
