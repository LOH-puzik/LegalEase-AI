GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is a NORP national and residing in GPE . In the proceedings before the ORG , he is represented by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , in the context of divorce proceedings before ORG ( ORG ) , the applicant and PERSON , his wife , concluded a maintenance agreement . Under the terms of this agreement , the applicant committed himself to pay maintenance for his CARDINAL children PERSON and GPE , born in wedlock in DATE and DATE , in the DATE amount of DEM CARDINAL each , and for PERSON in the DATE amount of DEM CARDINAL . The agreement also indicated the considerations underlying the calculation of the maintenance payments , in particular the applicant \u2019s DATE net income amounting to ORG and his personal financial needs ( ORG ) .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , applied to ORG for legal aid with a view to institute proceedings against PERSON GPE , claiming that his maintenance payments for her as well as PERSON and GPE be reduced to CARDINAL as from CARDINAL DATE . He submitted that he had remarried in the meantime and that , following the birth of his daughter PERSON in DATE , he had agreed with his wife to take parental leave from DATE . His only income was therefore an educational allowance .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for legal aid on the ground that the intended action lacked sufficient prospect of success .", "In its decision , the court stated that the action was inadmissible to the extent that the applicant 's maintenance obligations towards his children PERSON and GPE were concerned , as PERSON was not the proper defendant in this respect .", "As regards his claim that his maintenance payments for PERSON be reduced , the court found that the applicant could not invoke his choice concerning the repartition of roles in his new family and resulting reduction of his income vis - \u00e0 - vis PERSON In this respect , the court noted that the applicant was obliged to pay maintenance to PERSON on the ground that she took care of their CARDINAL minor children . The court , referring to the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , stated that , for the purposes of maintenance , the divorced spouse only had to accept the termination of occupational activities in order to care for a new child , if such a repartition of roles had considerable advantages for the new family . The decisive factor in this respect was the overall amount of the family income . However , the solution envisaged by the applicant did not change the family income . It was only advantageous if his maintenance obligations towards PERSON and his minor children PERSON and GPE would be set aside . In such a situation , the applicant could not evade his primary maintenance obligations towards PERSON as well as PERSON and GPE .", "On DATE ORG , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal ( Beschwerde ) , confirmed its decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the ORG ( Oberlandes - gericht ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . ORG found that the impugned decision was consistent with the constant case - law of ORG . According to ORG , PERSON was entitled to maintenance under section CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) in order to be in a position to take care of the divorced spouses\u2019 minor children . PERSON Referring to section DATE of LAW , ORG observed that , for the purposes of maintenance matters , a divorced spouse taking care of minor children took precedence over the second wife .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a divorced spouse can claim maintenance from the other divorced spouse , as long as and to the extent that , taking care of the spouses\u2019 child , he or she can not be expected to take up gainful occupation . LAW provides that maintenance obligations of a divorced spouse may be reduced in case that the divorced spouse , given his or her earned income , assets and other financial obligations , would risk not to dispose of sufficient own financial means . In determining the maintenance entitlement of a divorced spouse under LAW , the divorced spouse takes , as a rule , precedence over a new spouse ( section DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( ORG ) .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had accepted part - time occupation of TIME per week , with a salary of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
