In a petition transmitted on DATE under LAW to the supervising public prosecutor responsible for FAC , CARDINAL HIV - positive persons detained in the Aghios Pavlos Hospital , including the applicants , complained of their conditions of detention on the second floor of that hospital . They drew attention to the overcrowded LOC , the uncontrolled admission of new patients , and the fact that they were held with other detainees suffering from cancer , asthma , hepatitis , venereal diseases , bronchitis , scabies , psoriasis and even tuberculosis , which diseases necessitated confinement to individual cells because several of them were transmissible . A small quantity of cream had been distributed to some of the HIV - positive detainees who were also affected with scabies . They had been advised to change their sheets and underwear DATE and to wash them at high temperatures , even though the washing machine was out of order . When they had gone to fetch their medication the nurses had told them not to touch the bars through which they handed over the medicines in order to prevent the risk of infection .

NORP The bathrooms fell short of minimum hygiene standards and cleaning in the LOC was left to the discretion of the few HIV - positive persons in receipt of an allowance enabling them to purchase cleaning products .", "CARDINAL . NORP The food was so poor in nutritional value that HIV - positive detainees risked developing AIDS owing to physical debilitation .", "CARDINAL . The LOC were under - heated , and detainees were exposed to low temperatures , particularly at TIME .", "CARDINAL . Nor had the problem of smoking been resolved . Several detainees smoked in the communal areas , the cells and the dormitories , and the non - smokers , especially those with respiratory problems , became passive smokers .", "CARDINAL . The hospital staff did not include any infectious disease specialists , which placed HIV - positive detainees at risk because they were diagnosed by non - specialists .", "CARDINAL . During the distribution of medicines the nurse , wearing gloves , left the boxes on the floor outside the cell bars , and the HIV - positive persons had to stretch through the bars to retrieve them , avoiding touching the others , as recommended by the nurse .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also complained about the fact that diagnoses were conducted automatically and that the doctors always prescribed the same medicines without individually examining each patient . Any requisite transfers to outside hospitals were always carried out after long delays . Distribution of medication prescribed for some of the applicants was often interrupted without explanation for periods of DATE . Other applicants had not yet begun their treatment , which delay the doctors explained by claiming that \u201c the limit [ regarding the presence of the virus in the blood ] necessitating the initiation of treatment has increased \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
