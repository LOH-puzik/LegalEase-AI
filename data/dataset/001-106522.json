He was represented before the ORG by Dr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Dr PERSON , Attorney General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of a property in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant applied for a permit for the purposes of developing his property . On DATE ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) issued a permit \u201c to erect shops , dwellings and garages for private cars , subject to [ the ] conditions on form TH and as per [ the ] plans submitted and amended \u201d . Thus , the applicant was authorised to build \u201c CARDINAL floors from [ the ] highest street level \u201d . The permit was valid for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant applied for another building permit in relation to the same property .", "On DATE , ORG and ORG requested the applicant to put a stop to the construction , since it was being carried out without the necessary permit .", "On DATE the LAW issued a permit under certain conditions , namely \u201c to carry out extension of garages , shops and apartments , as per [ the ] plans submitted with [ the ] original application and [ the ] fresh plans submitted , subject to [ the ] conditions on form DATE , in accordance with departmental alignment , corner site with splay . [ The ] height of the building should not exceed CARDINAL floors ( QUANTITY ) from [ the ] highest street level \u201d . This permit , valid for DATE , was issued on the basis of the plans and elevations submitted . However , along with the plans , the applicant submitted a \u201c section drawing \u201d which was not in conformity with the elevations . In consequence , the maximum height of CARDINAL floors approved in the permit ( in conformity with the elevations submitted with the permit ) was illustrated differently in the section drawing , namely in a way which included an additional floor .", "The applicant claims that he had started work on the proposed project .", "DATE , by a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , having noted the discrepancy , the authorities decided to withdraw the said permit . The latter was replaced by another permit which ordered that the maximum height of the structure could not exceed CARDINAL floors from the level of the adjacent roads . Since the adjacent roads had different levels , according to the applicant , this alteration of the permit had the effect of reducing the proposed construction by CARDINAL storey ( allowing CARDINAL instead of CARDINAL storeys ) , as well as making the building of another block impossible .", "According to the Government , the applicant constructed CARDINAL floors in excess of what was permitted .", "On DATE the applicant instituted ordinary civil proceedings , arguing that the replacement of the permit of CARDINAL DATE was abusive , unlawful and ultra vires . These proceedings are still pending .", "On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant for illegal construction carried out before DATE , following the issuance of the permit of DATE . These proceedings were suspended sine die for DATE pending the outcome of civil proceedings ( mentioned above ) but were eventually resumed . The proceedings are still pending .", "In DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings . He alleged a violation of LAW to LAW CARDINAL , in that , unlike in his case , permits for extensive construction and the addition of a fifth floor had been issued in respect of the buildings adjacent to his own property .", "On DATE ORG in its constitutional jurisdiction rejected the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of an alleged interference with his right of property on the grounds of the non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies . It held that the civil proceedings instituted by the applicant could result in the revocation of the decision to withdraw the original permit and therefore sufficed as a remedy . Moreover , the aim of constitutional proceedings was not to suspend criminal proceedings which were not related to human rights issues .", "On DATE ORG upheld this judgment . It further held that although the LAW issue was not open to examination in ordinary proceedings , a favourable outcome in such proceedings would remedy any such violation .", "Until DATE building development permits were regulated by Part I of the Code of Police Laws .
