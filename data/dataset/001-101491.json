ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants are all NORP citizens .", "CARDINAL . The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are all former employees of ORG , a bank , which was involved in a large restructuring process of ORG - owned companies in GPE , entailing collective dismissals .", "CARDINAL . The collective dismissal of employees of PERSON took place in different stages between DATE and DATE . It affected CARDINAL of persons across GPE working either in the central office or in the local branches of the bank as follows : CARDINAL persons dismissed in DATE , QUANTITY persons dismissed in DATE and CARDINAL persons dismissed in DATE . No precise numbers were available for the final stages of the dismissal process . From the case file , it appears that the applicants were dismissed during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants made several attempts to receive compensatory sums for collective dismissal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) before ORG and ORG ( \u201c the agency \u201d ) , a ORG agency entrusted with the disbursement of these payments , but did not have any success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , they brought an action against the agency , seeking to be granted the compensatory payments . They argued that according to the applicable law , their right had arisen on the date on which their contracts had been terminated . The fact that B. had failed to submit to the agency a list of the persons whose contracts had been terminated could not be imputed to the employees . Moreover , there was established case - law upholding applications submitted by other former employees in a similar situation from the same court of first instance in GPE and in final decisions of higher courts across the country .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the applicants ' claim . It established that B. had only submitted to the local agency a list of persons dismissed after DATE and had failed to send a list of persons dismissed before that date , even though they were part of the same collective dismissal process . The court considered that this failure gave rise to inequalities among the people dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Allowing an appeal by the agency , ORG , by a final decision of DATE ( drafted on DATE ) , reversed the first - instance decision and concluded that the applicants did not meet the requirements for receiving the compensatory payments . For the applicants dismissed DATE and DATE , the appellate court referred to another condition provided by the national legislation , namely that ORG ( FPS ) should have mandated its special representatives on the board of shareholders to proceed with the reorganisation , in particular with the collective dismissal . In the case at issue , the appellate court established that such a mandate did not exist on DATE when the applicants were dismissed and therefore they were not entitled to compensatory payments . For the applicants dismissed DATE , the county court established that they did not meet another condition , namely that they did not prove that they had taken part in the pre - dismissal procedures . It concluded that the applicants did not satisfy these specific conditions and dismissed their claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted requests to the Procurator General for leave to lodge an extraordinary appeal against the final decision , invoking , inter alia , the existence of conflicting final decisions concerning other former employees in the same situation as them , namely those dismissed before DATE . Their requests were rejected .", "CARDINAL . Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as modified by Emergency Ordinance no . GPE , provided that persons whose employment contracts were terminated due to collective dismissal procedures were entitled to compensatory payments ranging from CARDINAL to CARDINAL times the average net salary nationwide . On DATE the newly adopted Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL changed the method for determining the quantum of the compensatory payments , which since then has ranged from CARDINAL times the average net salary in the specific company .", "CARDINAL . DATE of Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL obliged the employer company to notify , in writing , the competent agencies of the collective dismissal process , as approved in the restructuring programme , and to provide lists of the staff to be dismissed . Based on those lists , the competent agencies were required to provide pre - dismissal services , including counselling and professional guidance . In order to be eligible for compensatory payments , the persons who were part of a collective dismissal had to take part in these pre - dismissal programmes .", "CARDINAL . NORP In similar cases , former employees of B. , dismissed before DATE , requested recognition of their right to compensatory payments . Following the agency 's refusal to pay compensation , they lodged complaints with the competent domestic courts . By different final decisions rendered by county courts DATE , their right to compensatory payments was recognised . The reasoning varied : some county courts considered that the condition regarding the special mandate of the ORG was satisfied , others did not even take this special condition into account .", "The condition regarding participation in the pre - dismissal procedures was indirectly taken into account into some of the decisions . In those decisions reference was made to the fact that the employer had failed to submit to the competent agencies lists of the staff dismissed before DATE .", "Some decisions underline the fact that the collective dismissal took place in different stages and that the persons dismissed before DATE had been deprived of the social protection provided by the compensatory payments , even though the dismissal conditions had been identical and there was no objective reason for such discrimination .", "CARDINAL . Another group of former employees , who were dismissed DATE and DATE and who lost their case by a final decision of ORG of DATE , submitted a request to the Procurator General for leave to lodge an extraordinary appeal ( recurs \u00een anulare ) in their favour . The latter accepted their request and made a request in this respect to ORG .", "By a final decision of DATE ORG allowed the extraordinary appeal and quashed the final decision delivered in that particular case . It concluded that the lack of the special mandate of the FPS ( issued in DATE ) did not affect the right of persons whose employment contracts had been terminated in the framework of a collective dismissal to receive compensatory payments . It further explained that in the event of a contrary interpretation , the effects would be unacceptable because it would create discrimination between persons placed in the same or similar positions . It also added that in the event that the former employees were not involved in the collective pre - dismissal procedures because of the negligence of the employer , they were still entitled to receive compensatory payments .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent final decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE followed the same approach and recognised the right to compensatory payments for former employees dismissed during the same period of time as the applicants .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in force at the time provided in its LAW that ORG , ex officio or upon request of the minister of justice , could lodge an extraordinary appeal ( \u201c recurs in anulare \u201d ) against final judicial decisions . This extraordinary appeal was repealed from domestic law by a Government ordinance published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG regulates another type of extraordinary appeal ( \u201c recurs in interesul legii \u201d ) . The provisions in force at the time provided that in order to ensure uniform interpretation and application of the law , the Prosecutor General , ex officio or at the request of the minister of justice , could request ORG to deliver a decision concerning a legal issue which had received different solutions in the lower courts . The decision thus delivered could not alter the outcome of cases already decided . Amendments were made in DATE and it was made possible to recognise the right of the managerial boards of the courts of appeal to lodge such a request with ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG further provides that a case may be reopened in front of the domestic courts if ORG has found that a specific domestic decision violated fundamental rights or liberties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
