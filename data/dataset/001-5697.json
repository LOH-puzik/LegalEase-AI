THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , a gypsy born in GPE , started travelling at DATE when she married a gypsy who travelled . After the marriage ended , the applicant married PERSON , a romany gypsy who had travelled with his parents widely . During their travelling together , they and their CARDINAL children were moved on by the police many times for parking their caravan on the road side . They were frequently moved on DATE after DATE and escorted by the police outside the county .", "In the DATE \u2019s , the applicant and her family found a pitch on an official site at GPE , GPE . Her children and their caravan were attacked by other gypsies , and there were quarrels between the applicant and other gypsy parents . She and her husband decided to move off the pitch . After DATE of travelling and making short term stays on gypsy sites , the applicant moved onto a private gypsy site in GPE , GPE , where they stayed for DATE . After this period , a new gypsy family moved onto the adjacent pitch , who were drunkards and kept the applicant and her family awake with brawls and quarrels . A neighbouring caravan was set on fire and another caravan vandalised . The applicant \u2019s husband grew very depressed and in DATE he developed a heart condition requiring quiet and rest .", "After DATE looking for a piece of land on which to settle , they found an affordable site at LOC , GPE , GPE . This was close to the applicant \u2019s family and in a quiet lane full of mobile homes and adjacent to an official gypsy site . They purchased the site in DATE . A planning application was put in on DATE for CARDINAL mobile homes and CARDINAL tourers .", "The application was refused by ORG ( \u2018 the Council\u2019 ) on DATE . An enforcement notice was issued on DATE . The applicant and her husband \u2019s appeal against the refusal of planning permission and the enforcement notice was heard by a planning inspector on CARDINAL and DATE .", "In his decision letter of DATE , the inspector held inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The site is located within the predominantly open countryside to the south of the settlement of ORG \u2026 It is irregular in shape and QUANTITY in extent . It adjoins a former chapel to the east , which is now used as a day care centre , and on its western side it adjoins a residential property , \u2026 and an open field . Opposite is a purpose built local authority gypsy site , ORG , and to the south east is the CARDINAL PERSON public house . It falls within LOC . \u2026", "CARDINAL . NORP The site is clearly visible from both LOC and FAC \u2026", "CARDINAL . You claim that the site is well - screened and does not intrude into the open countryside . To my mind , the number of caravans , structures , vehicles and trailers , etc . effectively urbanises the site and results in a material loss of openness . The use detracts from the visual amenity of the site . The land north of CARDINAL GPE is largely open . Development of the site intrudes into the open belt of land , south of ORG , and consolidates the sporadic development in GPE . It contributes to the coalescence of ORG and ORG . It involves an encroachment of residential use into the open countryside contrary to CARDINAL of the main purposes of LOC .", "CARDINAL . The site has a QUANTITY boundary with a private dwelling which is positioned close to the boundary . I consider that the occupants of the dwelling have experienced a material loss of amenity due to the loss of openness and increased noise and disturbance from the intensified activity on the site . ... There is evidence of on site business activities . The appeal site consolidates gypsy site provision in the locality and extends the use on both sides of LOC . The change of use results in an ad hoc extension to the consciously located official gypsy site opposite . It has resulted in loss of natural features and does not complement and harmonise with the local surroundings contrary to policy ORG . In my view the use diminishes the rural quality of the landscape in this area .", "CARDINAL . NORP \u2026 There are CARDINAL purpose built gypsy sites in the district and CARDINAL authorised sites . The ORG claims that statistical evidence does not demonstrate a continuing or compelling need for further provision in the district , either permanent , temporary or transit . I note that a Designation Order for the district was made by the Secretary of ORG in DATE as an area to which section CARDINAL of LAW DATE applied . On the basis of official counts taken twice a year , the level of need in the district in DATE has been very low \u2026", "CARDINAL . The ORG site opposite has recently been upgraded and accommodates CARDINAL families . The other ORG site , PERSON , accommodates CARDINAL families . There are CARDINAL other local authority sites within GPE . The current waiting list for ORG is CARDINAL but there are CARDINAL vacancies at the PERSON site . < The applicant \u2019s husband > voluntarily moved to the site from an official gypsy site at GPE , GPE . He has no local connections in ORG or ORG or particular links with GPE . \u2026", "CARDINAL . < The applicant \u2019s husband > has a heart condition and is on pills for life , he had gout and a back problem \u2026 I appreciate that he needs a more peaceful and settled existence . Nevertheless , the site is not within easy reach of medical and pharmacy services . < He > is able to undertake some light work , such as erecting fencing and is able to drive ; I am not persuaded that his medical condition amounts to such very special circumstances which would justify a breach of LOC policy .", "CARDINAL . < The applicant \u2019s husband > approached other travellers to find a site and made informal inquiries about vacancies on the ORG site . His preference to live with his son complicates availability . He did not consult with the ORG before he bought the site ... the evidence indicates that the ORG made every effort , both in writing and by personal visits , to inform < him > that planning permission was needed and that approval would be unlikely due to the site \u2019s LOC status . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The objections to the development in LOC are serious ones which can not be overcome by the imposition of planning conditions such as landscaping \u2026 The public interest can only be safeguarded by the cessation of the use ... \u201d", "The Inspector granted a compliance period of DATE in recognition that it might take some considerable time for a vacancy to be found on an appropriate site elsewhere .", "Counsel advised that there was no error of law on which the applicant and her husband could appeal to ORG . He did consider that the inspector had made an errors of fact , in particular , in setting out the local council criteria for gypsy sites . However , this did not assist the applicant as it was clear from the rest of the decision that the inspector would have found that the relevant criteria had not been met and would have reached the same result .", "In DATE , the Secretary of ORG for the Environment approved the local plan for GPE . This identified specific sites for CARDINAL dwellings , planned to identify a further CARDINAL dwelling sites and failed to identify a single site for gypsies . The local authority had zoned all rural land as LOC , excluding QUANTITY of quarries unsuitable for human habitation . Residential and agricultural land in the area was valued at QUANTITY .", "In or DATE , the applicant \u2019s husband was convicted of being in breach of an enforcement notice and fined CARDINAL GBP . He lodged a further application for planning permission which was dismissed after a public enquiry at a date unspecified .", "ORG as amended by ORG DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector \u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The purpose of ORG and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document FAC ( DATE ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government attaches great importance to GPE , which have been an essential element of planning policy for DATE . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The fundamental aim of LOC policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open ; the most important attribute of ORG is their openness . Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub - regional and regional scale , and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans . They help to protect the countryside , be it in agricultural , forestry or other use . They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL purposes in GPE :", "\u2013 to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built - up areas ;", "\u2013 to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another ;", "\u2013 to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment ;", "\u2013 to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns ; and", "\u2013 to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land . \u2026", "CARDINAL . NORP The essential characteristic of GPE is their permanence . Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is , in addition , a general presumption against inappropriate development within them . Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
