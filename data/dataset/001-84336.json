On DATE ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) declaring the proclamation of the establishment of the \u201c GPE \u201d legally invalid and calling upon all GPE not to recognise any ORG other than GPE .

The ORG found that the evidence submitted to it in the instant case confirmed its earlier findings that certain of the missing persons were last seen in NORP or NORP - Cypriot custody . In this connection , the Commission had regard to the following : a statement of Mr PERSON , \u201c President of the NORP \u201d , broadcast on DATE , in which he admitted that CARDINAL NORP - Cypriot prisoners were handed over to NORP - NORP fighters who killed them and that in order to prevent further such killings prisoners were subsequently transferred to GPE ; the broadcast statement of Mr PERSON , a former NORP officer who had served in the NORP army at the time and participated in the DATE military operation in GPE , in which he suggested that the NORP army had engaged in widespread killings of , inter alia , civilians in so - called cleaning - up operations ; ORG submitted to ORG in DATE indicating , inter alia , that NORP and NORP - Cypriot soldiers rounded up NORP - Cypriot civilians in the village of PERSON on DATE and took away males over DATE , most of whom were reportedly killed by NORP - NORP fighters ; the written statements of witnesses tending to corroborate the ORG \u2019s earlier findings that many persons now missing were taken into custody by NORP soldiers or NORP - Cypriot paramilitaries .", "CARDINAL .

If they were either killed or wounded in the area under NORP control , the respondent Government was under an obligation to explain what happened to them .", "CARDINAL . This first applicant was in charge of soldiers amongst those defending PERSON . After the NORP forces encircled ORG , the NORP - Cypriot forces were ordered to retreat . The applicant \u2019s group hid their weapons , put on civilian clothing and unsuccessfully tried to break out of the village . When the NORP forces entered the village TIME , the applicant \u2019s group dispersed to avoid capture . At TIME on DATE , the applicant was seen by PERSON . Tampas in a warehouse tending a soldier injured in the head ( PERSON , also still missing ) . Tampas was later captured and detained . His was the last reported sighting of the first applicant . It was most likely that the first applicant had remained with the injured man and was taken into detention by the NORP forces who were in control of the entire area . Only one man was known to have escaped from the village and he , unlike the first applicant , had local knowledge of the terrain .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under attack from the NORP army , the first applicant \u2019s unit was ordered to split into CARDINAL group \u2019s and withdraw westwards . The applicant \u2019s group reached the GPE - GPE road , QUANTITY metres from the Airkotissa restaurant where they had a short rest . The applicant and another man were sent to investigate shouting coming from the restaurant . After TIME when they did not return , the group left for Panagra . They were ambushed en route \u2013 six of them managed to escape and the rest were all missing . At the time that the applicant and the other soldier were sent to the restaurant , there were clearly NORP forces in the area . The most plausible explanation for the QUANTITY men not returning , in the absence of any sound of fighting or shooting , was that they had been detained , either to prevent them giving away the NORP positions , for information or as prisoners of war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was discovered to be missing from his unit at roll call after they had broken through an encircling man\u0153uvre by NORP forces . The area in which his unit had been stationed was captured by NORP forces . It was not known whether the applicant was injured and detained or injured and died of injuries or killed at once . Whatever happened to him however occurred in an area controlled by the NORP forces . The respondent Government had been under an obligation to notify ORG as to what had happened to him but had not done so .", "CARDINAL . This applicant was seen wounded in his right hand and the left side of the ribs after a clash between NORP - Cypriot forces and CARDINAL buses full of NORP soldiers coming from ORG village . His wounds were cleaned by a witness PERSON and he was told to make his way uphill with CARDINAL other men , CARDINAL of whom was also injured , to the monastery where the NORP forces were . The other QUANTITY men were later found by the same man who went to get help . The NORP forces could not however reach them due to the presence of NORP forces . The other QUANTITY men were discovered dead DATE when the NORP forces withdrew . It was clear that the applicant was found either dead by the NORP forces or else found and detained in an injured condition . The latter was more likely . However the respondent Government had not provided information about either the finding of a dead combatant or the detention of a wounded prisoner of war .", "CARDINAL . This applicant was amongst those attempting to prevent the invasion of GPE . Some individuals were identified as killed in the operation ; the applicant was not amongst them . The respondent Government had not provided information that the applicant was found dead or otherwise and the intervening Government had no evidence that this applicant was dead . It had to be assumed that the applicant had been detained alive .", "CARDINAL . This was further corroborated by the photograph published in the \" Special News Bulletin \" issued DATE by the NORP administration on DATE , of NORP prisoners - of - war having their lunch . CARDINAL prisoners in the photograph had been identified . The first applicant was identified by his father , the second applicant . This identification took place at the time , not with the benefit of hindsight and no other person has suggested that the photograph was of someone else .", "CARDINAL . By DATE NORP forces were in control of the northern and eastern GPE including the NORP peninsula where the first applicant worked as general cashier in ORG in GPE . On DATE NORP and NORP soldiers arrived in the village and a NORP officer ordered a census of ORG DATE . DATE , the lists were handed over and NORP soldiers carried out searches . They left , taking with them on a bus , QUANTITY individuals , including the first applicant . This was reported by fellow villagers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had been detained DATE , NORP civilians came to the village asking for CARDINAL named individuals , CARDINAL of whom worked at ORG . They took the CARDINAL men to the bank and searched it . They emptied CARDINAL safes and were told that the applicant had the keys to the third . After DATE ORG returned , looking for the CARDINAL bank employees . They had the CARDINAL keys for the remaining safe which the first applicant had always carried with him : the keys were in a leather case belonging to the applicant although his own personal keys had been removed . ORG took the contents of the safe . It was highly probable that the NORP Cypriots had obtained the keys from those holding the first applicant , showing that he was alive and in detention for DATE . There was some evidence that he was detained after DATE , at least until DATE , at the ORG garage .", "CARDINAL . This first applicant withdrew with his section from ORG towards GPE . They were ambushed by NORP military forces and dispersed on account of the fighting and confusion . There has been no news of the applicant since . The NORP forces were in sufficient control of the area to undertake a successful ambush . The intervening Government had no knowledge of the first applicant , which meant that he had not escaped . Nor was there any evidence that he was killed in the ambush . It was overwhelmingly likely that he had been detained by the NORP armed forces .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , in the context of the activity of ORG ( see below paragraphs CARDINAL ) human remains were exhumed from a mass grave near the NORP village of GPE in the NORP area . After anthropological and genetic analyses , the remains of applicant , PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see paragraphs DATE , DATE , DATE above ) were identified , along with the remains of the other CARDINAL missing persons from GPE and CARDINAL other missing NORP Cypriots . The bodies of the CARDINAL missing persons from Yialousa were lined up next to each other in the grave , with CARDINAL other bodies on top at a shallower depth . Several bullets from firearms were found in the grave .

The following paragraphs are taken from ORG in the interstate case ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "CARDINAL . The ORG was set up in DATE . According to its terms of reference , it \u201c shall only look into cases of persons reported missing in the intercommunal fighting as well as in the events of DATE and afterwards . \u201d Its tasks have been circumscribed as follows : \u201c to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities , specifying as appropriate whether they are alive or dead , and in the latter case approximate time of the deaths . \u201d It was further specified that \u201c the committee will not attempt to attribute responsibility for the deaths of any missing persons or make findings as to the cause of such deaths \u201d and that \u201c no disinterment will take place under the aegis of this committee . The committee may refer requests for disinterment to the ICRC for processing under its customary procedures . \u201d \u201c All parties concerned \u201d are required to co - operate with the committee to ensure access throughout the island for its investigative work . Nothing is provided as regards investigations in mainland GPE or concerning the NORP armed forces in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG consists of CARDINAL members , CARDINAL \u201c humanitarian person \u201d being appointed by the NORP - Cypriot side and one by the NORP - NORP side and the third member being an \u201c official selected by the ICRC ... with the agreement of both sides and appointed by the Secretary - General of the ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has no permanent chairman , the presidency rotating on a DATE basis between all CARDINAL members . Decisions are to be taken by consensus to the extent possible . According to the procedural rules agreed upon in DATE , the procedure is to be conducted as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . Individual or collective cases will be presented to the ORG with all possible information . The ORG will refer each case to the side on whose territory the missing person disappeared ; this side will undertake a complete research and present to the ORG a written report . It is the duty of the ORG members appointed by each side , or their assistants , to follow the enquiries undertaken on the territory of their side ; the third member and/or his assistants will be fully admitted to participate in the enquiries .", "CARDINAL . The ORG will make case decisions on the basis of the elements furnished by both sides and by ORG of the ICRC : presumed alive , dead , disappeared without visible or other traceable signs .", "CARDINAL . If the ORG is unable to reach a conclusion on the basis of the information presented , a supplementary investigation will be undertaken at the request of a ORG member . The third ORG member and/or his assistants will participate in each supplementary investigation , or , as the case may be , investigators recruited by the ORG with the agreement of both sides . \"", "CARDINAL . The DATE rules state as \u201c guiding principles \u201d that \u201c investigations will be conducted in the sole interest of the families concerned and must therefore convince them . Every possible means will be used to trace the fate of the missing persons . \u201d The families of missing persons may address communications to the committee which will be passed on to its appropriate member . That member will eventually provide the family with \" final information as to the fate of a particular missing person \" , but no interim information must be given by any member of the committee to the family of a missing person during the discussion of a particular case .", "CARDINAL . The committee \u2019s entire proceedings and findings are strictly confidential , but it can issue public statements or reports without prejudice to this rule . According to the DATE procedural rules , a press release will be issued at the close of a meeting or series of meetings and occasional progress reports will also be published . Individual members may make additional statements to the press or the media , provided they comply with the rule of confidentiality , avoid criticism or contradiction to the joint statement and any kind of propaganda .", "CARDINAL . Due to the strict confidentiality of the ORG \u2019s procedure , no detailed information about the progress and results of its work is available . However , from the relevant sections of the regular progress reports on ORG in GPE submitted by the ORG Secretary - General to ORG it appears that the committee \u2019s work started in DATE with a limited , equal number of cases on both sides ( Doc . S/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) ; that by DATE an advanced stage had been reached in the investigation of the initial CARDINAL individual cases , supplementary investigations being started in CARDINAL cases in which reports had been submitted ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/Add . CARDINAL , of DATE , para . CARDINAL ) ; and that , while no difficulties were encountered as regards the organisation of interviews or visits in the field , real difficulties then arose by the lapse of time and , even more importantly , lack of cooperation by the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . This prompted the committee to issue a lengthy press release on CARDINAL DATE ( ORG . S/CARDINAL/Annex ) . There the committee stated that it considered the co - operation of the witnesses as absolutely fundamental , but that the witnesses were often reluctant , unwilling or unable to give full information as to their knowledge about the disappearance of a missing person . However , the committee could not compel a witness to talk . The explanation of the witnesses\u2019 reluctance to testify was that they were afraid of incriminating themselves or others in disappearances , and this despite the witnesses being told by the committee that the information given would be kept strictly confidential and being reassured that they would \u201c not be subject to any form of police or judicial prosecution \u201d . The committee appealed to the parties concerned to encourage the witnesses to give the very fullest information in their knowledge . It further stated :", "\" In order to further allay the fears of the witnesses , the ORG , so as to give the strongest guarantees to the witnesses , is examining measures that could be taken to ensure that they would be immune from possible judicial and/or police proceedings solely in connection with the issue of missing persons and for any statement , written or oral , made for ORG in the pursuit of activities within its mandate . \"", "CARDINAL . In the same press release , the committee pointed out that it considered as legitimate the desire of the families to obtain identifiable remains of missing persons . However , despite systematic enquiries on burial places of missing persons , on both sides , it had not been successful in this respect . It recalled that according to its terms of reference it could not itself order disinterments . Moreover , while there was access to all evidence available , the committee had not reached the stage of finding a common denominator for the appreciation of the value of this evidence . Finally , the committee stated that it was considering the possibility of requesting that the CARDINAL sides furnish it with basic information concerning the files of all missing persons , so as to allow it to have a global view of the whole problem .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG Secretary - General wrote a letter to the leaders of both sides observing that so far the committee had been given details on PERCENT of the cases and urging them to submit all cases . He further emphasised the importance of reaching consensus on the criteria that both sides would be ready to apply in their respective investigations . Moreover , the committee should consider modalities for sharing with affected families any meaningful information available ( ORG . S/CARDINAL , of CARDINAL DATE , para . CARDINAL ) . On DATE , in a further letter to the leaders of both communities the ORG Secretary - General noted that no improvement had been made and that the international community would not understand that the committee , DATE after it had become operational , remained unable to function effectively . Only CARDINAL cases had been submitted by the NORP - Cypriot side and CARDINAL by the NORP - NORP side . He again urged both sides to submit all cases without further delay and the committee to reach a consensus on the criteria for concluding its investigations ( Doc . S/CARDINAL , of DATE , paras . PERCENT CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Secretary - General , on the basis of a report of the ORG \u2019s third member and proposals by both sides , put forward compromise proposals on criteria for concluding the investigations ( Doc . PERSON , of DATE , para . CARDINAL ) , which were subsequently accepted by both sides ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of DATE , para . CARDINAL ) . By DATE , the NORP side submitted all their case files ( CARDINAL ) . However , the committee \u2019s third member withdrew in DATE and the ORG Secretary - General made it a condition for appointing a new one that certain outstanding questions , including classification of cases , sequence of investigations , priorities and expeditious collection of information on cases without known witnesses , be settled beforehand ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of DATE , para . CARDINAL ) . After being repeatedly urged to resolve these issues ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of DATE , paras . CARDINAL -CARDINAL ) , both parties eventually came to an agreement on DATE on the exchange of information on the location of graves of missing persons and return of their remains . They also requested the appointment of a new third member of the CMP ( ORG . ORG , of DATE , paras . CARDINAL and DATE ) . However , by DATE , no progress had been made towards the implementation of this agreement . The ORG Secretary - General noted in this context that the NORP - Cypriot side had claimed that victims of the coup ORG against Archbishop PERSON in DATE were among the persons listed as missing and that this position deviated from the agreement ( Doc . S/CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of DATE , paras . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A new third member of the ORG had , by the time of the ORG \u2019s report , been appointed ( ibid . para . CARDINAL ) .
