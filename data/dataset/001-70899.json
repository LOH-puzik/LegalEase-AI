THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE an officer with ORG of ORG used , in the course of his duties , a computer at a police station in GPE to access a web page which he found on the internet . When he viewed that page he saw people covered in faeces , coprophilia , coprophagia and men involved in fellatio . The page was in the form of a preview for other material that could be viewed on payment of a subscription . Anyone wanting more of that type of material could click on to a link marked \u201c subscription to our best filthy sites . \u201d The officer did that and provided his name , address , and credit card details . He was then given access to a second web page which contained similar material to the first . On DATE the officer visited the web site again and viewed a third web page .", "The applicant was subsequently arrested and interviewed by police officers about his involvement in the publication of internet sites . He stated in his interviews with the police that the internet site viewed by the officer was operated and controlled by ORG , a company based in GPE that complied with all the local laws and of which the applicant was a majority shareholder .", "The applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of publishing an obscene article , contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The CARDINAL counts related to the CARDINAL respective web pages which the officer had viewed .", "The matter came for trial before ORG in DATE . At the start , the applicant entered an admission , through his counsel , that he was legally responsible for the publication of the web pages viewed by the police officer . The issue for the jury was whether those pages were obscene within the meaning of section QUANTITY of LAW . The trial judge directed them as to the definition of \u201c obscene \u201d provided by LAW ( see below ) .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted on the first count , which related to the preview page , and acquitted him on the CARDINAL other counts . On DATE he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG on the ground , inter alia , that his conviction violated LAW . He submitted that it was an interference with his right to freedom of expression which was neither prescribed by law , nor proportionate . His main point was that LAW was not sufficiently foreseeable because the major steps towards publication of the web pages had taken place outside the jurisdiction : he maintained that LANGUAGE courts should only be able to convict when the major steps towards publication took place within their jurisdiction . He further submitted that section QUANTITY of LAW was not sufficiently clear . As to proportionality , he pointed out that similar material was readily available on the internet and that there were better means of inhibiting access , such as industry self - regulation , blockage by service providers and steps taken at home .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal against conviction . It relied on PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . ORG decision of DATE ) in holding that section QUANTITY of LAW was sufficiently precise for the interference in question to be prescribed by law .", "In regard to proportionality , it reviewed the LAW case law and observed that there was a margin of appreciation in relation to judgments about morality . It held that the interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression was limited in that he was only convicted on the first count . It considered that , even if LAW only provided limited protection to vulnerable people , there is no reason why a responsible government should abandon that protection in favour of the limited remedies advocated by the applicant . Finally , it noted , on the jurisdictional point , that the applicant \u2019s suggestion , that conviction should only be possible where major steps had been taken towards publication in a place over which the court had jurisdiction , would undermine the aim that the law was intended to protect by encouraging publishers to take the steps towards publication in countries where they were unlikely to be prosecuted . It concluded that the interference in question was justified under LAW .", "His appeal against sentence was also dismissed , ORG finding as follows :", "\u201c It is pointed out that this was material that had to be sought out . That , of course , is true . As [ counsel for the applicant ] accepts , it was available to the young but they had to seek it . On the other hand , it is precisely the sort of material which some young would seek in the privacy of their own bedrooms and it is they who have to be protected , so far as is possible , by the law . There is , as [ counsel for the applicant ] submits , difficulty with the worldwide web , but it is through the worldwide web that people are able to make very substantial profits ....", "Finally , it is submitted that , if CARDINAL looks at the authorities , sentences passed in relation to other offences were not of this magnitude , at any rate where the offence was not , on the face of it , relating to child pornography . That is true so far as it goes , but again the danger in relation to this type of offence was its accessibility to the young and vulnerable . In those circumstances it seems to us that , bearing in mind the statutory maximum of DATE , the judge adopted the right approach in this case , and we see no reason to interfere with the sentence which he imposed . \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "The CARDINAL Act ( as amended by LAW , LAW DATE , LAW DATE , LAW DATE and ORG provides in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Test of obscenity", "( CARDINAL ) For the purposes of this LAW an article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or ( where the article comprises CARDINAL or more distinct items ) the effect of any CARDINAL of its items is , if taken as a whole , such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it .", "( CARDINAL ) In this LAW \u201c article \u201d means any description of article containing or embodying matter to be read or looked at or both , any sound record , and any film or other record of a picture or pictures .", "( CARDINAL ) For the purposes of this LAW a person publishes an article who \u2013", "( a ) distributes , circulates , sells , lets on hire , gives , or lends it , or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire ; or", "( b ) in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record , shows , plays or projects it , or , where the matter is data stored electronically , transmits that data ....", "CARDINAL .
