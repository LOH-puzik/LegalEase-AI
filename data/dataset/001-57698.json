He refused to pay a fine , maintaining that he had not seen any road sign indicating the category of the road or the prohibition in question .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON was summoned to appear before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG , charged with having contravened sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance .", "In a letter to ORG he stated that he expected the public prosecutor to call certain police officers , including police inspector PERSON , as witnesses , as he could not afford to call any himself . Moreover , the public prosecutor should , he said , produce the relevant official meteorological records ( see the extracts from ORG judgment in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In addition , he requested ORG to appoint an official defence counsel .", "On DATE this request was refused by ORG , which considered that the case was simple and that the applicant was able to defend himself . His appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and PERSON on DATE , with no possibility of further appeal .", "CARDINAL .

He had travelled with his father to ORG that morning and they had then , inter alia , travelled the same road but in the opposite direction . The mist had been very dense already in the morning and [ the applicant ] had observed nothing special as regards the road during the trip . He does not know what the concept \u2018 ORG means . When he arrived on the \u2018 ORG west of ORG it was so misty that he saw no road signs that attracted his attention . He was therefore unaware of the character of the road he was driving on and even if he had noticed a road sign indicating \u2018 ORG he would not have known what restrictions this would imply as regards driving certain vehicles .", "Police inspector B. has been heard as a witness but has not given any information other than that the weather was normal in the area of ORG without any signs of mist .", "[ The applicant ] - who was driving as alleged by the public prosecutor - drove a long distance by tractor and should therefore have paid particular attention to the rules applicable as regards the driving of such a vehicle . The fact that the weather was misty does not relieve him from his obligations as a driver . He shall therefore be convicted in accordance with the charge against him . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG of GPE and PERSON . He claimed that the proceedings before ORG had been \" unbalanced \" and that numerous \" interruptions \" by the judge had prevented him from following the arguments and from presenting his case in a satisfactory manner ; that the fine imposed was far too high ; and furthermore , that ORG had overlooked the fact that certain road signs had been missing .", "In his reply of DATE , the public prosecutor , referring to the evidence submitted before ORG , maintained that the applicant was guilty and expressed the opinion that it was not necessary to hold a new hearing .

In addition , he requested free legal assistance since he needed defence counsel and did not have sufficient means to pay for CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s requests and decided the case on the basis of the case - file . In its judgment of DATE , upholding the findings of ORG , it stated :", "\" From the photos which have been referred to , it appears that the fact that the road in question was a \u2018 ORG did appear from appropriate and visible road signs at ORG . For this reason and since [ the applicant ] nevertheless drove the tractor on [ the road ] from PERSON to GPE , he committed the offence with which he has been charged by the prosecution . \"", "CARDINAL . PERSON applied for leave to appeal to ORG ( h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , claiming that the appeal proceedings had been very \" unbalanced \" and had not complied with human - rights standards .

ORG has the power to review questions both of law and of fact . However , there are some limits to its jurisdiction . LAW , for instance , lays down that ORG may not normally change the lower court \u2019s assessment of the evidence to the disadvantage of the accused without the evidence in question being produced afresh before ORG ; LAW , LAW ( as amended by LAW and CARDINAL ) also contains a rule prohibiting the appellate court , in cases where the appeal is lodged by the accused or by the prosecutor for the benefit of the accused , from imposing a sentence which can be considered more severe than that imposed at first instance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
