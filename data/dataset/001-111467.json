They arrived in GPE on DATE carrying valid passports and visas valid until DATE . They had come to stay with the first applicant \u2019s son . On DATE they applied for asylum and submitted that they would be at risk of ill - treatment and harassment on return to GPE . Allegedly , the second applicant would be called up for military service on return . Both applicants also referred to a risk based on their state of health as the first applicant suffered from old age in combination with Alzheimer \u2019s disease and the second applicant was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythomathosis ( ORG ) , a chronic rheumatic disease . The second applicant submitted a medical certificate , issued on DATE by chief physician PERSON , which stated that she suffered from serious ORG and that she would have to undergo regular treatment and medication for long periods of time .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the applicants\u2019 request for asylum .

The court found that they had added new circumstances at a late stage of the proceedings and that there was no indication that they would be subjected to persecution due to their religious affiliation in GPE . Furthermore , it found no reason to believe that the applicants would be subjected to ill - treatment on the grounds that the second applicant had not done military service . The first applicant \u2019s medical condition was not considered to be of such a serious nature as to constitute grounds for asylum . With regard to the second applicant \u2019s medical condition , the court found that the submitted medical certificate did not substantiate that the illness was fatal .

According to the submitted correspondence , not all of the drugs that the second applicant had received in GPE were available in GPE and the management of complications such as thrombosis and , in the long run , renal complications was not possible there . There were allegedly difficulties in having haemodialysis since CARDINAL units were available for the whole country and there were regular breaks in service .", "On DATE ORG refused to review the case as it found no new circumstances which constituted impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion .

ORG found that the applicants had failed to substantiate any impediments to enforcing the expulsion to GPE .", "On DATE the applicants were deported to GPE , but no information has been submitted as to their situation following their return .", "The provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , religious or political beliefs , grounds of gender , sexual orientation and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country .

If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so .
