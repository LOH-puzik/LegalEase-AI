The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant and GPE have been involved in legal disputes against each other concerning the property rights in PERCENT of the bearer shares in both EMK stock company ( hereinafter \u201c EMK \u201d ) and EMK Engineering stock company ( \u201c EMK Engineering \u201d ) , companies resident and registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ordered by way of an interim measure that GPE \u2019s entry in the commercial register as a member of the EMK and the EMK Engineering companies\u2019 respective supervisory boards with power to represent those companies may not be cancelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE brought an action against the applicant in ORG . He requested that the court oblige the applicant to hand over a specified number of bearer shares in EMK and in EMK Engineering and establish that the applicant did not hold and had never held any shares in those GPE companies . The action was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE ORG , following a hearing on DATE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection to the GPE courts\u2019 jurisdiction ( file no . CARDINAL CG.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It found that it had jurisdiction on grounds of location of assets ( GPE ) to decide upon ORG action . The applicant had assets in GPE , specifically claims for salary and fees against EMK and EMK Engineering , which both had their seat in GPE . Furthermore , GPE \u2019s action for restitution of the bearer shares in these corporations was of a pecuniary nature .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE ORG , in interlocutory proceedings , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s application to have ORG interlocutory decision be given suspensory effect . It further ordered ORG not to hold any further hearings in the proceedings at issue until ORG had taken its decision on the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as ill - founded ( file no . PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the termination of the proceedings before ORG , ORG resumed the proceedings . It heard evidence from the parties , their counsel and CARDINAL witnesses in person in hearings on DATE , DATE and DATE . It further took note of the written submissions of the parties and of numerous documents as well as of the case files in several related proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to deliver its judgment , given that the oral proceedings had concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a judgment running to CARDINAL pages , upheld ORG \u2019s action ( file no . CARDINAL CG.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It ordered the applicant to hand over a specified number of bearer shares in EMK and in EMK Engineering to GPE and declared that the applicant did not hold and had never held shares in those companies .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the evidence before it , ORG considered that GPE \u2019s submissions regarding the question of who had been the owner of the shares in dispute had been more credible than that of the applicant . It found that the applicant \u2019s mother , PERSON , had never obtained ownership of the shares in question as there had not been a sales contract between her and GPE She had been in possession of the shares in order to make a minority shareholder think that GPE was no longer holding shares in the companies . The applicant had known this on conclusion of his contract with PERSON transferring the shares to him as a gift in DATE at the latest . PERSON had not , therefore , been the owner of or authorised to transfer ownership of the shares to the applicant ; the latter had not obtained ownership thereof for lack of good faith .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing , on CARDINAL DATE ORG , endorsing the findings of ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal dated DATE . It considered that ORG had taken all evidence necessary for its decision . It further rejected new documentary evidence submitted by the applicant to support his allegations as inadmissible for having been submitted out of time in an attempt to protract the proceedings . The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment and decision dated CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on DATE . It found that the lower courts had not made an error of law in the legal classification of the facts they had established , that they had not failed to take necessary evidence and that they had sufficiently reasoned their judgments . The judgment and decision were served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint ( running to CARDINAL pages plus annexes ) with ORG against ORG judgment and decision . Relying , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and on LAW . CARDINAL to the LAW , the applicant complained , in particular , about the length of the proceedings . He stressed that the outcome of the proceedings , to the duration of which he had not contributed , was of vital importance to him as it concerned his means of subsistence . He further submitted in that context that he had not had at his disposal an effective remedy , such as an application to speed up the proceedings , in order to enforce his Convention rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG granted the applicant \u2019s application to have his complaint given suspensory effect . The court reserved its decision on the costs arguing that the duty to bear the costs depended on the outcome of the main proceedings . The applicant would have only had to bear the decision fee if his constitutional complaint had been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE lodged a submission in reply to the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG , PERSON , informed the applicant that he , alongside Judges PERSON . , PERSON . , PERSON and PERSON , would decide on his constitutional complaint in a hearing in camera on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint alleging bias ( running to CARDINAL pages plus annexes ) against the CARDINAL judges of ORG called upon to decide on his complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued , in particular , that all of the CARDINAL challenged judges had taken arbitrary decisions to his disadvantage and in breach of his Convention rights in relation to the previous injunction and other proceedings brought by him , and that the court , which was influenced by the executive , discriminated against foreign nationals such as the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that , for different reasons , the CARDINAL judges of ORG individually had not been impartial . As regards the court \u2019s President , Judge PERSON , the applicant complained that he had delayed the appointment of the judges who were to decide on his complaint . Moreover , he was a close friend of H. , the court \u2019s Vice President and brother of GPE , the party opposing the applicant in the proceedings at issue .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s submission , Judge PERSON . was biased because he worked for the Government drawing up expert reports on constitutional questions and giving seminars organised by the Government . He further worked with Judge PERSON on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON . , for his part , was not impartial as he was also a professor at ORG and had himself argued in a publication that judges should be appointed for life or for a long single term of office .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stressed that Judge PERSON was a member of the supervisory board of a state - owned company and was therefore not independent and impartial .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Judge PERSON was a partner in a law firm with a lawyer against whom the applicant had brought proceedings concerning an inheritance . Another lawyer of that firm had already represented EMK and EMK ORG . Moreover , Judge PERSON had previously worked as a lawyer in Judge PERSON \u2019s law firm .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , with the CARDINAL judges whom the applicant had challenged for bias comprising the bench , dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaints of bias .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that , in accordance with the principle that , if possible , a complaint of bias should not be decided upon by the challenged judge , the challenged judges , respectively , had not participated in the deliberations and the decision on the respective complaint alleging bias against them , which had been decided upon by the CARDINAL remaining judges .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the fact alone that several of the challenged judges had already taken part in prior decisions finding against the applicant did not suffice to substantiate that there were objectively justified doubts as to their impartiality for the purposes of LAW . Moreover , the fact that the judges had been elected for DATE did not compromise their impartiality . The applicant further had not substantiated that the executive had influenced the judges of ORG in the present proceedings in any way . Nor did the fact that the judges concerned worked together with GPE \u2019s brother , the Vice President of ORG , on a regular basis and were friends of the latter objectively cast doubts on their impartiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG delivered its judgment ( file no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It granted the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint in part , finding that the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and under LAW to a decision within a reasonable time had been breached in the proceedings at issue . It ordered that GPE reimburse the applicant the fee for lodging the constitutional complaint ( MONEY ( CHF ) ) and bear the further court costs , that is to say , the judgment fee ( CHF CARDINAL ) . It further ordered GPE to reimburse GPE , who , unlike the applicant , had been represented by counsel in the proceedings before ORG , lawyers\u2019 fees of CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the total duration of the proceedings alone , which lasted DATE after the action of DATE had been brought , did not justify the finding of a breach of the right to a decision within a reasonable time . It had to be noted in that context that DATE had been necessary to deal with the interlocutory proceedings on the GPE courts\u2019 jurisdiction brought by the applicant himself . Moreover , the courts had generally duly furthered the proceedings . There had only been a delay of DATE and DATE between the last hearing before the court of first instance on DATE and the delivery of the judgment on DATE . Such a period of inactivity could no longer be considered as reasonable despite the complexity of the proceedings . Therefore , there had been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that GPE law did not contain any provisions stipulating which consequences should result from a breach of the right to proceedings within a reasonable time . However , it would be utterly unjust if a breach of this constitutional right did not have any consequences as a result of a lack of legislative provisions . There was therefore a gap in the law which had to be filled by way of judicial interpretation . In ORG view , it was therefore necessary to impose the costs of the proceedings ( court costs and ORG fees ) upon the ORG in order to compensate for and redress the breach of the fundamental right at issue . However , the judgment fee could not be imposed on the ORG as a measure of compensation as GPE had to bear that cost anyway .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It considered that the applicant \u2019s property rights had not been infringed in the proceedings at issue in which the opposing parties had both claimed to be the owner of the shares in question . Moreover , the GPE courts had been independent tribunals . In particular , GPE \u2019s brother , the Vice President of ORG , had not taken part in the decision - making process of any of the GPE courts . Moreover , the findings of facts , the assessment of the evidence and the legal reasoning of the lower courts did not disclose any arbitrariness .", "CARDINAL .
