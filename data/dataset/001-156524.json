On DATE , the applicant entered the GPE where he applied for asylum . On DATE , the applicant was interviewed about his identity , nationality and travel itinerary . He stated , inter alia , that he hailed from GPE and that he had travelled to the GPE via GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was interviewed about his reasons for seeking asylum ( nader gehoor ) . He stated that he had made a career in the NORP army from DATE , during which period the country had been ruled by ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) . He had joined the ORG \u2019s youth organisation at DATE and become a full member in DATE . Having studied car mechanics in GPE and graduated in DATE , the applicant had taken up a DATE internship at ORG in order to avoid military service . On this basis , he had been transferred , for a job , to ORG where he had been assessed with a view to possibly offering him a higher education in GPE . Having passed that selection , the applicant had been sent to CARDINAL of the NORP republics from DATE until DATE to study rocket science . Later , the applicant had also taken a DATE political course in the army , in the framework of continued education as an officer .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to around DATE and from DATE , the applicant had been deputy of ORG in CARDINAL of ORG ; during the first period in a maintenance company and during the second period in CARDINAL of the battalions . In the latter function he had been the superior of CARDINAL deputies of ORG as well as Deputy Commander of the battalion . DATE , the applicant had also held the position of president of the ( political ) ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been promoted several times and his last held rank had been that of major . The applicant indicated that his tasks as deputy of ORG had involved , inter alia , the creation and dissemination of propaganda and the teaching of politics to soldiers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the ORG had come to power , the applicant had left GPE for GPE because he had no longer felt safe . Many of his friends had been arrested by the Mujahedeen . On the way to GPE , the bus in which he had been travelling had been stopped at a checkpoint . The applicant had been arrested by the PERSON and kept in prison in GPE for DATE , during which period he had been interrogated about his role in the coup attempt and tortured . After that , the ORG had sent him to the war front to dig trenches and load grenade launchers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE or DATE , he had escaped from the prison in which he was kept by simply walking away when the prison guards had abandoned the prison in the wake of the capture of GPE by the ORG . He had then gone to his home village , where he had gone into hiding at his father \u2019s house and where he had remained until his departure from GPE on DATE . During that time , his father had been hassled by the ORG about the family \u2019s involvement with the PDPA ( the applicant \u2019s entire family had been PDPA members ) . The applicant submitted that he feared persecution from the side of the ORG and later , after DATE , the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife , born in DATE , and their CARDINAL children DATE who were born DATE as well as a number of members of the applicant \u2019s family - in - law have all , at different points in time , been granted residence rights in the GPE . His eldest son had fled from GPE via GPE to GPE in DATE together with the applicant \u2019s mother - in - law and a number of the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s brothers . This son , who was granted a residence permit in the GPE for compelling humanitarian reasons on the basis of the then general situation in GPE , has since obtained GPE nationality . The applicant \u2019s wife and CARDINAL of the children fled from GPE via GPE , GPE and GPE to the GPE , where on an unspecified date they were granted residence permits under the policy rules on extended family reunion ( verruimde gezinshereniging ) . The remaining CARDINAL children were also granted residence permits . On unspecified dates , the applicant \u2019s oldest CARDINAL children obtained NORP nationality , retaining their NORP nationality . The applicant \u2019s spouse currently holds a residence permit for continued residence stay ( voortgezet verblijf ) .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application on DATE . Having noted CARDINAL official country reports ( ambtsberichten ) on the general political and human rights situation in GPE drawn up by ORG ( GPE PERSON ) in DATE , DATE and DATE , the Deputy Minister found , in the relevant part , that the situation in GPE at that moment was not such as to qualify all asylum seekers from that country for asylum and that , therefore , the applicant had to demonstrate that he had a personal and well - founded fear of persecution in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister considered that the grounds adduced by the applicant \u2013 amounting in essence to him being searched for by the ORG and/or Mujahedeen due to his past function in the army \u2013 did not provide any basis for assuming that the applicant would have to fear persecution upon his return to GPE . The Deputy Minister held in this regard that the applicant had not established that the ORG were aware of his past activities , that he had ever been in contact with the ORG or that there would be any other reasons relating to his past activities that would attract the ORG \u2019s negative attention . According to the Deputy Minister , the applicant \u2019s claims were of a general and speculative nature .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant had not , either as an army officer during communist rule , or as a member of the ORG , held a political post at a level at which he would have exercised a decisive influence on policy . According to the aforementioned official country reports , the ORG were in general not interested in former communists who had been active at that level only . Moreover , rather than leave GPE immediately after his escape from detention , the applicant had chosen to remain for DATE in an area that was already under ORG control at that time . The Deputy Minister considered implausible that a person who allegedly feared persecution by the authorities would go into hiding with somebody who himself was experiencing regular problems with those same authorities . This also applied to the applicant \u2019s claim that he feared persecution by the ORG as a result of the problems he allegedly had with the Mujahedeen . As the power base of this latter movement had in the meantime significantly decreased , the Deputy Minister held that the applicant should be able simply to evade any problems he might expect to experience from that side . In respect of the applicant \u2019s reliance on LAW , the Deputy Minister found that his account provided insufficient indications to assume that he , if returned to his country of origin , would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of that provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision with the Deputy Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed that his case file had been transmitted to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) of ORG ( Immigratie- en ORG ; \u201c IND \u201d ) as his asylum account , in particular his professional activities as a career military , gave reasonable cause to suspect that LAW DATE LAW , as amended by LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) might apply to his case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s asylum application was re - examined in the light of an official report , drawn up on DATE by ORG on \u201c ORG in communist GPE ( DATE ) . AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ) and concerning in particular the question whether and , if so , which former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations . According to this official report , LAW could be held against virtually every NORP asylum seeker who , holding the rank of third lieutenant or higher , had worked during the communist regime for the military Khadimate Atal\u2019at - e Dowlati ( \u201c KhAD \u201d ) or , subsequently , the PERSON - e NORP - e Dowlati ( \u201c WAD \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an additional interview was held with the applicant on the applicability of LAW to his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ; the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection . She found , inter alia , that the applicant constituted a danger to public order ( openbare orde ) , as serious reasons had been found for believing that he had committed crimes referred to in LAW . Although the Minister attached credence to the applicant \u2019s statements in terms of his positions and career within the NORP army , the applicant \u2019s description of his tasks was deemed to be inaccurate . Further , on the basis of a person - specific official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) issued by ORG on DATE , the Minister found that , at the relevant time , ORG departments of the NORP army consisted solely of highly loyal and skilled professional soldiers , who wielded a large amount of influence within the organisation and who , as informants , worked closely together with the KhAD . They were thus inextricably connected to the frequent arrests , disappearances and/or executions of disloyal members of the army by the ORG . The Minister further emphasised the widely known cruel character of the ORG , the grave crimes committed by its officers and the \u201c climate of terror \u201d it had spread throughout the entire NORP society , including the army . In this regard the Minister relied on the general official report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having established , on the basis of elaborate argumentation and documentation , that those involved in the ORG and ORG of the NORP army were likely to fall within the scope of LAW of LAW , the Minister proceeded to an analysis of the applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under that LAW on the basis of the prescribed and so - called \u201c personal and knowing participation test \u201d and eventually rejected the applicant \u2019s objection by holding LAW against him . The Minister indicated that consequently , pursuant to the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the applicant was ineligible for a residence permit for asylum or any other ground .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant relied on LAW , the Minister held that it was for the applicant to show that there were concrete reasons , connected to personal facts and circumstances , justifying the conclusion that he would run a real risk of treatment contrary to that provision if returned to GPE . The Minister found that the applicant had failed to substantiate such grounds , since he had neither indicated that anyone would be actively looking for him in GPE nor furnished any reasons due to which he would draw the local authorities\u2019 particular attention .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , and as regards LAW as invoked by the applicant , the Minister held that , although there was family life between the applicant and his relatives residing in the GPE , the ORG \u2019s interest in expulsion of individuals who endanger public order prevailed over the personal interests of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was rejected by judgment of CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in GPE . Pursuant to section CARDINAL:CARDINAL of the General Administrative Law Act ( PERSON ) , this judgment was sent to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal proceedings before ORG , the applicant had disputed the accuracy of the official reports , drawn up by ORG , which the Minister had relied on in his case , and he argued that the information contained in those reports did not apply to him . At the request of the Minister of ORG and with the parties\u2019 consent , ORG was granted access to the materials underlying the person - specific official report of DATE without these materials being disclosed to the applicant . It found that the report provided information in an unbiased , objective and transparent manner , and accepted that the conclusions drawn in the official report were sufficiently supported by the underlying materials . The applicant \u2019s unsubstantiated claim that the information contained in the person - specific official report did not necessarily apply to each person who had worked at ORG department was insufficient for ORG to doubt the report \u2019s accuracy . ORG further found that it had not appeared that there were any concrete indications to doubt either the person - specific official report or the official report of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the Minister could reasonably have established the facts relating to the applicant \u2019s activities for ORG of ORG in the way that she had done . In addition , she could reasonably have dismissed as implausible the applicant \u2019s claim that he had not been aware of human rights abuses committed by ORG until he came to the GPE , given that the ORG / WAD \u2019s criminal character was generally known in GPE at the time , according to the official report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s reliance on LAW , ORG concurred with the Minister on all points that the applicant had failed to substantiate the existence of a real risk of treatment contrary to that provision . As to LAW , ORG held that this provision could not play a role in asylum proceedings , notwithstanding the fact that the Minister had examined the applicant \u2019s arguments in this context .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further appeal to ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) was declared inadmissible on DATE . The ORG found that it had no jurisdiction as , by virtue of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) , the ORG only had jurisdiction over decisions taken after the entry into force of that LAW whereas the initial decision by the Deputy Minister had been taken on DATE . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant applied for a residence permit for the purpose of exercise of family life within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Convention . This application was rejected on DATE by the Deputy Minister of ORG ; the successor to the Minister for ORG . The applicant \u2019s objection against this decision was rejected on DATE by the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON , ORG ; the successor to the Deputy Minister of Justice ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE was rejected on DATE by ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE . It noted that it appeared from the decision of DATE that the applicant was associated with extrajudicial arrests and extrajudicial detention of persons , the torture of persons , extrajudicial execution of persons , and the commission of assassinations , because he \u2013 on account of his work for ORG \u2013 had facilitated the activities of ORG . It further noted that this decision had become final .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW held :", "\u201c The court considers that , according to settled case law of ORG , regardless of whether there is a positive or negative obligation , a fair balance must be struck between , on the one hand , the interests of the alien and , on the other , GPE general interest . In this balancing exercise , the [ Minister ] enjoys a certain margin of appreciation . The court notes that , in his assessment , the [ Minister ] has taken into account the criteria formulated in the judgments of ORG August CARDINAL in the case of GPE and DATE in the case of GPE . The court accepts that it was reasonable for the [ Minister ] , in striking this balance in the framework of DATE , to find against the [ applicant ] . To this end , the court considers that it was not unjust that the [ Minister ] attached weight to the suspicion of the [ applicant \u2019s ] involvement in human rights violations . The court does not follow the [ applicant \u2019s ] argument that , in assessing whether he should be granted a residence permit on the basis of LAW , insufficient factual research has been made into his involvement in the commission of crimes referred to in LAW . ... The court sees no ground for holding that only crimes found proven according to criminal law standards may be held against [ the applicant ] . The [ Minister could also hold against the [ applicant ] that [ the latter ] has accepted a deal ( transactie ) proposed by a public prosecutor in order to avoid the lodging of formal criminal proceedings for shoplifting . This is not altered by the fact , as confirmed by the [ Minister ] at the hearing , that this has a lighter weight . It further has been taken into account in the balancing exercise that the [ applicant ] has resided in the GPE for DATE , but he has never had lawful residence based on a valid residence permit and his residence status has always been precarious . Although the [ applicant \u2019s ] spouse is living here and holds a valid residence permit , no objective obstacle has appeared to exercise the family life with her elsewhere . His spouse holds NORP nationality . The argument that his spouse can not return to GPE for asylum - related reasons but that these reasons have never been examined because she had already been granted a regular [ i.e. not asylum - based ] residence permit does not succeed . To the extent that reference has been made to the [ applicant \u2019s ] asylum account , it has been established in the proceedings on his asylum request that he has not demonstrated that he has to fear treatment in breach of LAW nor that for any reason or other he will have to expect the particular attention of the authorities upon his return . To the extent that the [ applicant \u2019s ] spouse claims to have independent , separate asylum - related problems , this has not been substantiated . The report of CARDINAL DATE by GPE , psychologist , concerning the spouse \u2019s mental health state is insufficient for finding that there is an objective obstacle . It is true that it appears that she suffers from depression , a dissociative and a post - traumatic stress disorder , but it does not appear that for this reason she would be unable to go to GPE with the [ applicant ] . ... Noting the fact that the [ applicant ] and his wife married in the period during which the [ applicant ] worked for ORG , the [ Minister ] has justly not found it plausible that his wife was unaware of the facts held against the [ applicant ] in the framework of LAW [ of LAW ] . \u201d", "As regards asylum - related arguments advanced by the applicant , ORG held :", "\u201c ... the ORG is of the opinion that the [ applicant \u2019s ] argument fails . Noting the strict separation between asylum - related and regular [ i.e. non - asylum - related applications for a residence permit ] that follows from the system of LAW , the Minister has justly referred to [ the possibility of ] filing an asylum application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further appeal on summary grounds , holding :", "\u201c What has been raised in the grievances ... does not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling . Having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , no further reasoning is called for , since the arguments submitted do not raise questions which require determination in the interest of legal uniformity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister for Security and ORG ( Staatssecretaris PERSON Justitie ; the successor to the Minister for ORG ) informed the applicant that \u2013 it having been noted that it had been erroneously assumed in the proceedings having ended on DATE that there was an obstacle for the applicant \u2019s expulsion in the form of an interim measure issued under LAW by ORG he intended to proceed with the applicant \u2019s removal from the GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter dated DATE and sent to the applicant \u2019s representative by a psychologist and a psychiatrist working for the mental health care organisation providing treatment to the applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON , the latter displayed psychotic features , possibly in the context of a developing schizophrenia or post - traumatic stress disorder . She was visited DATE in her home for treatment . The authors of this letter stated that they were unable to indicate whether her mental health problems were connected to or affected by the applicant \u2019s possible removal from the GPE , but considered it understandable that this removal would cause tensions within the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG , under LAW , to stay his expulsion to GPE . On DATE , the acting President of the Third Section , to which the case had been allocated ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) , decided to adjourn the examination of the request as no practical steps aimed at the applicant \u2019s effective removal had yet been taken by the GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG and ORG informed the applicant that his removal to GPE had been scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to determine his request to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG . On DATE , the ORG decided not to indicate the interim measure sought by the applicant and informed him accordingly .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions of DATE and DATE to the ORG , the applicant \u2019s lawyer informed the ORG that on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had moved from the GPE to GPE where he had applied for asylum . This request was still pending and the applicant had been granted a provisional residence permit ( GPE ) , valid until DATE with the possibility of further prolongation , pending the decision on his asylum request . His spouse had visited him in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . On DATE , LAW DATE was replaced by LAW . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW . LAW ( PERSON ) applies to proceedings under LAW , unless indicated otherwise in this LAW .", "CARDINAL . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of directly applicable international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential NORP interest , or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Respect for family life as guaranteed by LAW or risk of being subjected in the country of origin to treatment in breach of LAW constitute an obligation under an international agreement .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an alien is eligible for a residence permit for the purpose of asylum if , inter alia , he or she is a refugee within the meaning of LAW , or he or she has established that he or she has well - founded reasons to assume that he or she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the exclusion clause under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) is held against an asylum seeker , the alien concerned loses any protection which might have been available under that Convention and , consequently , becomes ineligible for a residence permit for asylum under LAW of LAW ( section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The admission policy for family reunification ( gezinshereniging ) purposes is laid down in LAW of LAW DATE . A partner or spouse of a person lawfully residing in the GPE is , in principle , eligible for admission , if certain further conditions relating to matters , such as , public policy and means of subsistence are met .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , judicial review by ORG and ORG in administrative law appeal proceedings only addresses whether the executive authority concerned has exercised its administrative powers in a reasonable manner and , in the light of the interests at stake , could reasonably have taken the impugned decision ( marginale toetsing ) . Both before ORG and ORG it is possible to apply for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling of DATE ( ORG [ National Jurisprudence Number ] BGCARDINAL ) , ORG held that , apart from judicial review by ORG and ORG in administrative law appeal proceedings , in principle no further remedy lay against a decision to reject an alien \u2019s request for admission to the GPE , as the lawfulness of the consequences of that decision had already been judicially determined in the administrative appeal proceedings . It nevertheless accepted that in certain exceptional circumstances , such as a relevant change of circumstances having occurred during the delay between the refusal of the admission request and an act aimed at effective removal ( daadwerkelijke uitzettingshandeling ) , an objection ( bezwaar ) and subsequent appeal ( beroep ) may be filed against an act aimed at effective removal . Under the terms of section QUANTITY of LAW , such an act can be equated with a formal decision within the meaning of LAW which can be challenged in separate administrative law appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the DATE Refugee Convention reads :", "\u201c The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that :", "( a ) he has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ;", "( b ) he has committed a serious non - political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee ;", "( c ) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

These guidelines state , inter alia , that where the main asylum applicant is excluded from refugee status , his / her dependants will need to establish their own grounds for refugee status . If the latter are recognised as refugees , the excluded individual is not able to rely on the right to family unity in order to secure protection or assistance as a refugee ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE authorities do not wish the GPE to be a refuge for war criminals or human rights offenders , and consider it undesirable that victims who have been granted protection in the GPE still feel unsafe by the presence in the same country of those who are actually responsible for the fact that they were forced to flee their country of origin ( for the policy statement sent on DATE by the Deputy Minister of ORG to ORG of ORG ; see , PERSON and J. v. the GPE ( dec . ) , nos .
