He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in FAC .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of uttering threats and battering his wife and sentenced him to four years\u2019 imprisonment , with execution of the sentence stayed for a probationary period of DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal .", "The applicant lodged with ORG a cassation appeal within the CARDINAL days\u2019 time - limit provided for by law , alleging various procedural shortcomings which , in his argument , negatively affected both his defence rights and the outcome of the case . ORG , having examined the appeal , found that it complied with the formal requirements specified by LAW and subsequently forwarded it to ORG .", "On DATE ORG , at a court session held in camera , dismissed his cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "Under LAW of DATE a party to criminal proceedings can lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judgment of the appellate court , which has terminated the proceedings . The cassation appeal has to be drafted and signed by a lawyer .", "A cassation appeal can be lodged only on the grounds referred to in LAW . These grounds include certain procedural shortcomings , which justify quashing of a first - instance decision , regardless of whether they are invoked by the party lodging any remedy against such decision ( for example , wrong composition of the court , lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory , violation of the rules governing jurisdiction of criminal courts , certain breaches of defence rights ) . A cassation appeal can also be lodged on the ground of another flagrant breach of law , if such a breach negatively affected the judicial decision under appeal .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that the court which gave the decision appealed against is competent to decide whether the formal requirements for a cassation appeal are satisfied , and to refuse to accept the appeal , if this is not the case . If the appeal is admissible , it is forwarded to ORG .", "Pursuant to LAW , as amended on DATE to take effect as of DATE , the ORG shall consider the cassation appeal against a judgment at a hearing . However , it is open to the ORG to dismiss such appeal at a session held in camera , if it considers that it is manifestly ill - founded . No written grounds shall be prepared for such a decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
