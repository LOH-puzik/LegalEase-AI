Their names , dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the Annex . They are represented before the Court by Ms Y. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the cases may be summarised as follows . They are relatives of NORP - Cypriot men who went missing in either DATE or DATE during incidents of mounting tension and violence in which NORP or NORP - NORP villages were targeted ( see PERSON for further details ) .", "CARDINAL . These men were listed as missing persons , the information being given to the NORP authorities , ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The remains of the missing men have been found during exhumations carried out by ORG for Missing Persons(\u201cCMP \u201d ) in DATE . Further details are set out in the LOC .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL cases , the applicants wrote to the NORP authorities requesting information about any investigation into the disappearance of their relative and/or the discovery of the remains : in PERSON and Others , no . ORG , by letter dated DATE to the Minister of the ORG , in PERSON and Others , no . CARDINAL , by letter dated DATE to the Minister of the Interior and in GPE and Others , no . CARDINAL , by letters dated DATE , to the Attorney - General and to the Minister of the ORG . No reply or information was received , save for an e - mail from the Attorney - General \u2019s office dated DATE in the FAC case , stating that all necessary action would be taken .", "CARDINAL . In this case , the claimants challenged the decision in DATE to remove their relative , a NORP - Cypriot combatant last seen in DATE , from the list of missing persons after examination of the list by the Attorney - General of GPE ; his file was communicated to the PERSON side instead on the basis that he had died of wounds during the fighting and not to ORG . In a decision dated DATE , ORG in its appellate jurisdiction rejected the case on the basis that the case did not concern an administrative decision but was an act of government outside the court \u2019s jurisdiction . Matters relating to missing persons were part of the GPE problem and fell within the power of the political authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP In these cases lodged in DATE , the relatives of CARDINAL NORP men who went missing on DATE after they had been taken from their homes by armed NORP Cypriots , lodged applications under LAW , claiming that GPE had known of the deaths of the missing persons but had not searched for the corpses or brought the guilty persons to justice and that the Republic had not taken the necessary actions to pursue an effective investigation to determine the whereabouts and fate of the missing persons . In their response , GPE stated that they had not been passive but had been unable to pursue their intentions to exhume and identify corpses due to the agreement between ORG , the NORP - NORP side and themselves that exhumations would be conducted by a common programme of ORG . They also pointed out that exhumations had begun in DATE and the programme indicated the likelihood of the exhumation of the graves in the relevant area would commence in DATE . They disputed that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the courts but fell rather under the supervision of ORG and the authority and initiative of the President of the Republic .", "CARDINAL . In its decision dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG in its appellate capacity held that the fate of missing persons fell under the authority of the President of the Republic as it had an international aspect ; the cases therefore concerned an act of government which did not fall within the jurisdiction to annul of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
