CARDINAL of DATE , by which she alone had the right to decide whether to undergo an abortion .", "In an order ( no . CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the constitutionality issue manifestly ill - founded on the ground that the PERSON complained of was based on a policy decision to grant the mother full responsibility for an abortion , and that that decision was not illogical , especially as the effects of pregnancy , both physical and mental , were felt primarily by the mother .", "Having regard to ORG decision , the magistrate \u2019s court dismissed the applicant \u2019s action in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG .
