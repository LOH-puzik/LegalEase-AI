THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-b;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in ORG Prison GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at ORG the applicant was convicted of the murder of PERSON and sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had been the applicant \u2019s business partner . He was shot and killed at their business LOC on DATE by PERSON , who left the scene of the crime in a car driven by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Runham and Gray were arrested in DATE and the applicant was arrested in DATE . He was charged with murder jointly with GPE , Gray and CARDINAL other men who had allegedly provided money to pay for the killing of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s case was that the applicant had paid Runham and Gray MONEY ( ORG ) to kill PERSON , because PERSON knew too much about the applicant \u2019s involvement in mortgage fraud .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s defence was that he had hired LOC and Gray to break CARDINAL of PERSON \u2019s limbs in order to put him out of action for DATE while the applicant effected his own transfer to another branch of the firm . He alleged that he had paid LOC and Gray GBP CARDINAL for the assault , but that after Gray had killed PERSON , Gray blackmailed the applicant into paying him more money . The applicant claimed that he would have had no motive for killing PERSON , since the latter was himself involved in the fraudulent activities being perpetrated through the business . The applicant submitted , however , that his representatives felt unable to pursue this line of argument satisfactorily because of lack of evidence of PERSON \u2019s dishonesty ; the jury were asked to accept the applicant \u2019s word alone on this issue .", "CARDINAL . Runham and Gray pleaded guilty to murder . Gray gave evidence for the prosecution against the applicant concerning the alleged murder conspiracy . The CARDINAL alleged co - conspirators , who according to the prosecution had , together with the applicant , paid for PERSON to be murdered , were acquitted .", "CARDINAL . Following his conviction , the applicant complained to ORG ( ORG ) about ORG refusal to disclose material evidence . After investigation , in a letter of DATE to the applicant , the ORG reported that it could not support any allegation of perversion of the course of justice but had found various instances of negligence .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in DATE he was informed that there were CARDINAL boxes of hitherto undisclosed material . The applicant contended that some of this evidence would have supported his defence that he had had no need to murder PERSON to ensure his silence since it showed that the latter was also deeply involved in the fraudulent activities perpetrated through the business . The applicant claimed that some of the material from the CARDINAL boxes was disclosed to him in DATE prior to his appeal hearing , while other material from the boxes remained undisclosed .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the evidence which was not disclosed at first instance , but which was disclosed prior to the applicant \u2019s appeal , fell into CARDINAL categories . The first type of evidence derived from the PERSON computer system used by the police officers conducting the murder inquiry to store and cross - reference all the information obtained in the course of the inquiry . The computer data included documents known as \u201c messages \u201d which recorded information when first received by an officer , and documents known as \u201c actions \u201d which recorded the steps to be taken by an officer in response to a message and the result of any such further inquiry . At the time of the trial , the prosecution took the view that the computer system was being used as a tool for the police investigation and that the data contained in it was not subject to disclosure under the Attorney - General \u2019s Guidelines ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , although any witness statements or exhibits obtained in response to a message or action should be , and were , disclosed as \u201c unused material \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that , following the applicant \u2019s conviction , and in the light of developments in the common - law duty of disclosure ( see below ) , the prosecution reviewed their position and decided that the data stored on the computer system did amount to disclosable material . Prior to the applicant \u2019s appeal , therefore , the prosecution disclosed the messages and actions held by the police . CARDINAL actions had been disclosed , CARDINAL of which was referred to by the applicant in support of his appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s submission , the second category of evidence undisclosed at first instance related to the parallel investigation into mortgage fraud by a number of people , including the applicant and PERSON . At an early stage , the prosecution decided to keep the murder and fraud investigations separate and that there was no duty under the Attorney - General \u2019s Guidelines to disclose the material gathered in the fraud inquiry to the defendant charged with murder . Following the applicant \u2019s conviction and the development of the common law , the prosecution reconsidered their decision and , prior to the applicant \u2019s appeal , made full disclosure of the material obtained in the fraud inquiry .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the hearing before ORG , the prosecution served on the applicant a schedule indicating what material was still being withheld following the review of the prosecution \u2019s duty of disclosure . In respect of some of the items in the schedule , the reason given for non - disclosure was \u201c legal and professional privilege \u201d ; in respect of other items it was \u201c public interest immunity \u201d ; and in respect of certain other items , for example document no . CARDINAL , no reason was given to explain the decision to include the document in the list of withheld evidence . Counsel for the defence was in contact with the prosecution concerning possible further disclosure . A letter dated DATE from the Branch ORG indicated that a number of documents , including document no . CARDINAL , were on the list of withheld material .", "CARDINAL . Document no . CARDINAL subsequently came into the applicant \u2019s possession . It is a letter , dated DATE , from a firm of solicitors acting for Gray addressed to Detective Chief Inspector PERSON of ORG , and reads as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Further to our several discussions concerning PERSON , you will of course be aware that I did visit him in FAC on DATE .", "He has requested a transfer either to ORG or FAC if this is at all possible and I should be grateful if you would let me know whether there is any possibility of PERSON receiving a transfer .", "Secondly I now understand that apparently PERSON understands that you would be willing to support him receiving a straight term of life imprisonment and an application for early parole .", "Obviously I have explained to Mr Gray the position concerning sentencing but perhaps you would set out your position so far as possible concerning these matters .", "Thirdly I understand that PERSON wife is to be produced at DATE intervals to FAC for visits and perhaps again you could clarify the position .", "I look forward to hearing from you ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The hearing of the applicant \u2019s appeal took place on CARDINAL and DATE . Non - disclosure of evidence at trial , particularly evidence discovered in the parallel mortgage fraud investigation , was CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal to ORG , but no mention was made of document no . CARDINAL or of the other documents which continued to be withheld by the prosecution . The applicant also relied on the fact that the trial judge had omitted to direct the jury that a person may lie for reasons unconnected with his guilt in relation to the offence with which he is charged ( a \u201c FAC direction ) , and that the fact that , during interviews with the police the applicant had denied all knowledge of any plot to harm PERSON , did not mean that he had been involved in his murder .", "CARDINAL . Dismissing his appeal on DATE , ORG remarked that in the course of his summing - up the judge had not suggested that the applicant \u2019s lies could amount to corroboration of the other evidence , and had reminded the jury of defence counsel \u2019s submissions in relation to the applicant \u2019s lies . Although the summing - up should have included a \u201c LOC direction , no miscarriage of justice had occurred . On the question of non - disclosure the court observed :", "\u201c ... As the trial was conducted , PERSON \u2019s dishonesty was made perfectly plain to the jury . The appellant himself had admitted being dishonest , and had said in the course of his evidence that PERSON was party to all the dishonest resorts to which he had lent himself in making false representations and forging documents . Accordingly it was fully before the jury that Mr PERSON was dishonest . ...", "We have been taken through various parts of the evidence ... and we are quite satisfied that ... PERSON involvement in the deep dishonesty of this business was fully canvassed before the jury . ... Accordingly , although ... the stricter regime of prosecution disclosure which now prevails might well have required further disclosure than was actually made , we do not consider that this ground is one which has any substance in regard to the outcome of the case . ... \u201d", "ORG concluded :", "\u201c There was overwhelming evidence that the appellant initiated a plot against the victim PERSON . There was likewise strong evidence that he had indicated what he wanted was to get rid of PERSON . The money actually paid , and indeed even the sum mentioned by the appellant was in our view out of proportion to a plot simply to \u2018 duff up\u2019 the victim . Moreover , on analysis such a plot made no sense . Each member of ORG is of the clear opinion , despite the blemishes in an otherwise impeccable summing - up , that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant believed that an inducement was promised to Gray by the prosecuting authorities in exchange for his testifying against him . In addition to the above letter , which the applicant claimed supported his hypothesis , he referred to the fact that his tariff of imprisonment ( that is , the period to be served before review by ORG ) under the life sentence had been set at DATE , but was subsequently reduced to DATE . LOC , who had provided the murder weapon and drove the get - away car , received a tariff of DATE . Gray , who had shot and killed PERSON , had his tariff set at DATE and was released in DATE . In DATE ORG wrote to ORG , refusing to reduce his tariff :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG holds PERSON to be as culpable as you are , even though he fired the murder weapon and you did not . When the tariff was set for PERSON , the then Secretary of ORG took into account that he had , like you , pleaded guilty to murder but had in addition been \u2018 ... a very important witness for the GPE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government denied that any inducement was offered to Gray . Under cover of a letter dated DATE , they sent to the ORG undated statements from CARDINAL senior officers in ORG who had been involved in the murder investigation .", "( a ) The statement of Chief PERSON reads :", "\u201c I have seen a copy of the letter dated DATE from ORG ... to my then colleague , Mr ORG . I can confirm that this letter is genuine and was recorded as Document D-CARDINAL during the course of the investigation into the murder of PERSON .", "I have no recollection of this letter after DATE and I can not remember ever discussing it with Mr GPE . At no time was I ever involved in any debate regarding the issue of Mr Gray receiving a \u2018 straight term of life imprisonment and an application for early ORG .", "I can confirm that I did not offer PERSON any form of inducement to give evidence against Mr LOC or other defendants . To the best of my recollection , Gray \u2019s motives were that he was simply attempting to \u2018 clear his ORG", "I would like to emphasise that I spent DATE with Mr Gray at FAC during the preparation of his statement and can categorically state that all CARDINAL pages of the document were written with PERSON consent and without any form of inducement . \u201d", "( b ) The statement of Detective Chief Inspector PERSON , now retired , reads :", "\u201c This murder happened in DATE and is not now fresh in my memory .", "However I do remember clearly that I gave no indications to interviewing officers or to Gray himself that in return for his support we would aid an application for a shorter sentence . Gray was a very dangerous murderer who I considered enjoyed carrying out his \u2018 murder\u2019 contract with Mr Dowsett . This matter was so grave that no such undertaking could honestly have been given .", "I do remember that Gray at one time was on hunger strike in prison and that we helped his wife to visit him in prison . How this help was given I do not remember - it may have been in the role of carrying messages to and from . \u201d", "( c ) Detective Chief Inspector PERSON , also now retired , said in his statement :", "\u201c Concerning the letter Document ORG I can categorically state that I did not personally offer Gray any inducement or arrangement relating to his sentence . Nor did I have any discussions with his legal representative with regard to his sentence . Equally , I did not instruct any of my subordinate officers including the interview team questioning Gray so to do .", "As far as I am aware Gray throughout his detention and taped questioning was dealt with in accord with LAW .", "I have been unaware of this letter until now but I am sure Chief Inspector PERSON ( now retired ) may be of some help to you .", "I would point out that Gray was arrested at FAC on DATE after which the murder management team was joined by Mr PERSON of ORG , GPE , who advised on all legal aspects of the case . He was later joined by PERSON ( now Sir and a ORG Judge ) PERSON and Mr PERSON of Counsel , who advised on what was to be a complex case not only involving murder , conspiracy to murder but also large scale mortgage fraud .", "I am not aware that any representations were made to the trial judge concerning any reduction in Gray \u2019s tariff . If this had been the case then the application would have had to be made through prosecuting counsel .", "For your information I include below some relevant dates and points that you may already be aware of in relation to the murder , but I think they are worth emphasising :", "DATE : PERSON found murdered at his business premises that he owned with his partner LOC .", "DATE : Gray gave himself up at FAC and admits the offence naming LOC , LOC and others as part of a murder conspiracy .", "DATE : PERSON arrested for the murder . He admits the offence naming GPE , Gray and others . ORG did the groundwork in planning PERSON \u2019s murder and propositioned Gray at a later stage to do the actual killing .", "CARDINAL DATE : Dowsett and others arrested for the murder .", "CARDINAL DATE : I was withdrawn from the DATE management of the inquiry and returned to ORG . ORG took over this role .", "DATE : Gray and Runham appear at ORG , plead guilty to the murder and are sentenced to life imprisonment .", "DATE : Gray agrees to become a witness for the prosecution and Detective Inspector Green ( now Chief Superintendent ) obtains a witness statement .", "DATE : Trial of Dowsett and others commences . ...", "Gray appeared as a prosecution witness . Runham did not . The jury unanimously found LOC guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment .", "Prosecution witness ORG gave evidence to the fact that LOC admitted the murder to him and stated that LOC had said that \u2018 if PERSON gets too close then he \u2019ll get the ORG ( or words to that effect ) .", "DATE Dowsett made a formal complaint against me , other officers and Mr PERSON [ ORG ] that we perverted the course of justice in relation to his trial . The matter was investigated by an outside ORG and was found by the ORG [ Director of Public Prosecutions ] and the ORG to be totally unsubstantiated .", "Dowsett latter appealed against his conviction to ORG but the ORG were unanimous in their judgment to disallow his application .", "The above is to the best of my recollection . I do not know what tariffs were set by the Judge in his sentencing of all CARDINAL defendants but I assume credit was given for Gray and LOC \u2019s guilty pleas . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial . The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Attorney - General issued guidelines , which did not have the force of law , concerning exceptions to the common - law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports DATE \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) . According to the Guidelines , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive \u201d material which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as follows :", "\u201c ... ( a ) it deals with matters of national security ; or it is by , or discloses the identity of , a member of ORG who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known ; ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ( c ) it is by , or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known ; ( d ) it contains details which , if they became known , might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect ; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime ; ( e ) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed , at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier \u2013 e.g. a bank official ; ( f ) it relates to other offences by , or serious allegations against , someone who is not an accused , or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him ; ( g ) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the applicant \u2019s trial in DATE but before the appeal proceedings in DATE , the Guidelines were superseded by the common law .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG dealt with the duty of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity . It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case :", "\u201c ... [ When ] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings . Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence . If , in a wholly exceptional case , the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court , the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned . \u201d", "ORG described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows :", "\u201c ... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against , on the other hand , the interests of justice . Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life , the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment in NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) set out the procedures to be followed if the prosecution wished to withhold unused material from disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity including , where appropriate , making an application to the court ex parte .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG emphasised that , since the ex parte procedure outlined in NORP v. ORG was \u201c contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials \u201d , it should be used only in exceptional cases . It would , however , be an abdication of the prosecution \u2019s duty if , out of an abundance of caution , it were simply \u201c to dump all its unused material in the court \u2019s lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential \u201d . Thus , the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold . The test of \u201c materiality \u201d was that an item should be considered as disclosable if", "\u201c [ it ] can be seen on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution :", "( i ) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case ;", "( ii ) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposes to use ; or", "( iii ) to hold out a real , as opposed to fanciful , prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to ( i ) or ( ii ) \u201d .", "If the prosecution was in any doubt as to the materiality of any such evidence it should ask the court to rule on the question .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a new statutory scheme covering disclosure by the prosecution came into force in GPE and GPE . Under ORG , the prosecution must make \u201c primary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed evidence which , in the prosecutor \u2019s view , might undermine the case for the prosecution . The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court , setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution . The prosecution must then make a \u201c secondary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed material \u201c which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused \u2019s defence as disclosed by the defence statement \u201d . Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
