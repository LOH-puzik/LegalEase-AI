GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Javier Borrego Borrego;Karel Jungwiert;Margarita Tsatsa-Nikolovska;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG , as already in the proceedings before the domestic courts , by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG opened the trial against the applicant on charges of insurance fraud . In the course of the second trial hearing on DATE , the applicant presented a medical certificate dated DATE issued by PERSON , a licensed doctor ( PERSON ) for psychiatry . According to that certificate , the applicant was suffering from a depression and was therefore presently unfit to plead ( verhandlungsunf\u00e4hig ) . After the applicant had declared that he had been able to follow the hearing until then , the latter was ended on his request . On DATE of the hearing , the applicant declared to be fit to plead .", "On DATE ORG , having held CARDINAL hearings , convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of insurance fraud and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . It found that the applicant , who ran a garage , had simulated accidents with the help of others in order to obtain the payment of insurance benefits . In fixing the applicant \u2019s sentence , the court took into account as an aggravating factor that the applicant had acted on a commercial basis . It considered in mitigation that it could not be excluded that the applicant , who had confessed to the offences , had needed a large amount of money in order to satisfy claims for protection money ( PERSON ) extorted from him by unknown third persons .", "The applicant appealed against ORG judgment . He contested in particular that he had committed the frauds on a commercial basis as he had used the money obtained thereby to pay the blackmailers . He further argued that the sentence was too severe as he had acted with diminished criminal responsibility . Following the constant threats uttered by the blackmailers he suffered from serious anxiety and depression which necessitated continuous neurological and psychiatric treatment .", "The hearing before ORG took place on CARDINAL DATE .", "In the applicant \u2019s submission , his counsel informed the court orally prior to the formal opening of the hearing in the presence of ORG and his co - defendants\u2019 defence counsels that the applicant was unfit to plead . His counsel submitted CARDINAL medical certificates dated DATE issued by doctor PERSON , the neurologist and psychiatrist in charge of the applicant \u2019s treatment for DATE . According to these certificates , the applicant , who was under constant psychiatric treatment , was unfit for work from DATE presumably until CARDINAL DATE and also unfit to plead . His lawyer further presented a medical certificate dated DATE issued by doctor PERSON in which the doctor stated that the applicant suffered from a serious anxiety and depression syndrome , might suffer from a personality disorder and was being treated with anti - depressants . The doctor recommended carrying out a psychiatric examination in the course of the appeal proceedings in order to assess the applicant \u2019s criminal responsibility . The applicant \u2019s lawyer further informed ORG that the applicant was presently under the influence of strong anti - depressants which he was obliged to take in order to treat his illness . The court inspected the certificates and handed them back to his counsel as it did not wish to take them to the files at that moment .", "The hearing was then opened and the applicant and his co - defendants made submissions on their personal situation . Excerpts of ORG judgment were read out . Having been advised of his right to remain silent , the applicant declared that he was ready to make submissions on the charges against him . In the applicant \u2019s submission , his counsel reminded the court at that moment that the question of the applicant \u2019s fitness to plead had to be addressed .", "ORG interrupted the hearing for TIME in order to award the defendants and their counsels the opportunity to consider limiting the appeals to the fixing of the sentence . When the hearing was resumed , the applicant , having consulted his counsel , declared that he restricted his appeal to the fixing of his sentence .", "The applicant then handed over to the court the CARDINAL medical certificates dated DATE ( see above ) issued by doctor PERSON according to which he was unfit to plead . According to the minutes of the hearing as rectified by the court , the applicant , having consulted his counsel , declared on the court \u2019s enquiry that he considered himself to be fit to plead and was ready to participate in the hearing .", "Thereupon , the presiding judge interrupted the hearing for TIME . According to TIME of the hearing , the applicant , following this break , declared again on the court \u2019s enquiry that he felt fit to make and to receive procedural statements . According to TIME of the hearing , the presiding judge subsequently informed the parties that she had phoned doctor PERSON during the break . The latter had confirmed that the applicant had been prescribed antidepressants . In view of the ( average ) dosage of the medication , the applicant was fit to make and to receive procedural statements also when he had taken the antidepressants . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the presiding judge informed him of the telephone conversation with his doctor prior to questioning him for the first time on his fitness to plead . The parties were given the opportunity to comment on this issue . ORG considered the applicant as being fit to stand trial and proceeded with the hearing .", "The applicant then made submissions on the charges . He stated , in particular , that he had become depressive due to his offences , as a result of which he had lost his means of subsistence .", "At the conclusion of the hearing , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . It found that in the applicant \u2019s submission , which had not been disproved , he had been blackmailed since DATE by unknown third persons who had damaged cars parked in his garage and had threatened him and his family . As the police had not agreed to afford him protection immediately , he had committed the insurance frauds on a commercial basis in order to be able to pay the protection money extorted by these persons . In fixing the sentence , the court further took into account that the applicant had shown in the hearing that he truly regretted his offences presumably committed because of the said blackmail . It also considered in mitigation that there was a link between his feeble health caused by a slight depression and the criminal proceedings against him . The court found the high damage caused ( some CARDINAL,CARDINAL PERSON ) , the number of frauds committed by the applicant and the fact that he had instigated several persons to participate in them to be aggravating circumstances .", "Right after the hearing the applicant went to see doctor PERSON Having examined him , the latter certified that the applicant was in a confused , very depressed and desperate state of mind and that his submission that he had not been able to follow the court hearing was credible . Doctor PERSON stated that the information he had given on the phone to ORG that morning , at a moment when he had been treating other patients , needed to be clarified . From a retrospective point of view it was very likely that the applicant had been unfit to plead for health reasons throughout the hearing before FAC on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He argued that the conduct of the hearing before ORG despite his unfitness to plead or without having his capacity to plead properly examined by a doctor entailed a serious violation of his right to be present , to be heard and effectively to defend himself as protected by LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law and ORG below ) .", "In his submissions in reply dated DATE ORG stated that , having regard to the course of the hearing before ORG as laid down in TIME of the hearing , that court had no reason to doubt the applicant \u2019s fitness to plead and was thus not obliged to consult a medical expert .", "On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG , without giving reasons , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as manifestly ill - founded .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He submitted that his right to be heard as guaranteed by LAW had been violated because ORG had held its hearing in the criminal proceedings against him although it had been or should have been aware that he had been unfit to plead .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "If an appeal ( Berufung ) is lodged against a ORG judgment , the defendant \u2019s case will be reheard by ORG on all questions of fact and law unless the appeal has been restricted by the appellant to certain points of complaint ( see section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "According to the settled case - law of ORG , the mere physical presence of the defendant is not sufficient for him to be considered to \u201c attend \u201d the hearing ; he also has to be fit to plead ( ORG , no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , Collection of the decisions of the criminal section of ORG ( BGHSt ) , PERSON . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL ) . A defendant is fit to plead if he is capable of protecting his interests reasonably in and outside the hearing , of conducting his defence in a proper and understandable manner and of making and receiving procedural statements . In particular , a defendant is not considered unfit to plead if , because of the advice and support of his counsel , he is sufficiently able to exercise his defence rights of his own will , either in person or represented by his counsel ( see , inter alia , ORG , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , ORG DATE , pp . DATE ) . If the court has doubts about the defendant \u2019s capacity to plead , as a rule no hearing may be conducted in the criminal proceedings against him ( ORG , no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG f\u00fcr ORG ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , no . CARDINAL StR DATE , decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The trial court is called to take evidence in order to verify the applicant \u2019s fitness to plead in accordance with its duty to investigate all facts relevant to its decision ( compare section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
