The Government claimed that the land did not belong to the persons who had sold it to the applicants but to the ORG . They relied in this connection on a judgment issued in DATE by ORG . The applicants contested this view . They stressed that the DATE judgment had been delivered after the exchange of their land in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely after they had transferred to the ORG all their possible claims against the former owners of their land , and that in any event they had purchased this land in good faith and at market value .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the land was requisitioned without compensation for the needs of ORG . After an application by the association , ORG ruled that the requisition was null and void because it was serving permanent and not temporary needs ( judgment no . CARDINAL ) . In DATE , as a result of this judgment , the ORG bought the unlawfully requisitioned land and exchanged it with QUANTITY . m of land owned by ORG in the nearby area of ORG . The area was public woodland outside the boundaries of the urban development plan . According to the applicants , the understanding was that the association would be allowed to develop it after the ORG had issued the appropriate changes to the local planning regulations . The first applicant paid CARDINAL drachma per sq . m to cover the difference in value between the old and the new land . The relevant decision approving the contract of sale and exchange was retroactively validated by virtue of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) . The Government asserted that the above price was symbolic and that at the relevant time the market value of the land was CARDINAL drachmas per sq . m. Therefore , they considered that the land in question had been donated to the applicants . The applicants contended that this assertion was false .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Royal Decree included the land in the revised urban development plan , following a proposal by ORG and an affirmative opinion by ORG sitting in an administrative capacity with the power to give a non - binding advisory opinion .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE ORG rejected the association \u2019s application for an altitude study . Further , the Minister of Agriculture requested that the Minister of Public Works revoke the DATE LAW whereby the planning zone had been extended to the land owned by the first applicant , for the reason that it had been issued without the assent of ORG even though the area \u201c was a forest \u201d . In DATE the Minister of Public Works replied that he would not revoke the decree because it had already been applied for DATE and had been relied upon by third parties ( decision no . \u0393CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .

GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Planning , Housing and the Environment gave a new decision which repeated in substance the annulled decision concerning the detailed zoning plan and the altitude study . ORG again applied to ORG , which quashed the new decision as well , considering that following its earlier ruling the administration had to revoke the zoning decree or give new reasons for not doing so ( judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A third - party appeal ( \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae ) by the first applicant was dismissed by ORG ( judgment no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Presidential Decree abolished the DATE LAW in so far as it extended the urban development plan to the association \u2019s land . Members of the association brought their case unsuccessfully before ORG which on DATE ruled that , even if LAW no .

The applicants referred to the history of the proceedings and inter alia argued that their property had been interfered with for DATE with no compensation whatsoever . Coming to the current situation , they stressed that Presidential Decree of DATE , and the interpretation of NORP CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Constitution as set out in the DATE judgment and in the jurisprudence of ORG , made clear that it was no longer possible to build on their land .

The applicants claimed that according to the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL they were entitled to compensation for the deprivation of their right to use their property for the purposes for which they had bought it .

CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , dismissed the application on the ground that the relevant provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL were unconstitutional . In particular , it held that , \u201c by providing for the possibility of expropriating or exchanging woodland which can not become a residential area , LAW presupposes that the urban development of woodland is in principle lawful , something which is contrary to LAW . However , one judge expressed the opinion that the expropriation or the exchange of land which was purchased before the entry into force of LAW was not contrary to it ( judgment no .
