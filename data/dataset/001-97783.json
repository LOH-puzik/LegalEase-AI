NORP In DATE the General Secretary of ORG PERSON presented his \u201c basic theses \u201d , which laid the political foundation for economic reform heralding the transition to a market economy . Several laws were enacted which opened up the ORG - dominated planned economy to private enterprise . However , the ORG preferred to keep control over consumer prices rather than leaving them to be determined by the free market .", "CARDINAL . By DATE Government spending increased sharply as a growing number of unprofitable enterprises required State support , whereas more resources were diverted to subsidise consumer prices . At the same time , the elimination of central control over production decisions , especially in the consumer - goods sector , led to a breakdown in traditional supply - demand relationships . This resulted in pervasive shortages of food and basic consumer goods . The Government reacted by introducing ration stamps for food and certain hygiene articles .", "CARDINAL . In addition to ration stamps , the Government of the NORP Socialist GPE ( RSFSR ) put into circulation several types of so - called \u201c commodity bonds \u201d ( \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0438 ) which gave their bearers the right to purchase consumer goods , such as refrigerators , washing machines , tape recorders and passenger cars . The Urozhay-CARDINAL ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) bonds were CARDINAL of many types of bonds ; they were distributed among agricultural workers and companies which had sold grain and other agricultural produce to the ORG in DATE and DATE . Those bonds were designed to encourage agricultural workers to sell produce to the ORG in exchange for the right to priority purchasing of goods in high demand ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG paid workers for the produce at fixed prices and also gave them bonds in amounts proportionate to the value of the produce sold .", "CARDINAL . The ORG bonds were not legal tender , but they had a certain nominal value indicated on their face . That value determined the maximum purchase price of consumer goods which could be sold on production of the bonds . The bonds were not intended for payment but merely for certification of the right to purchase specific goods ; the sale of goods was conditional on payment of the full purchase price by the bond - holder and production of the bonds for the same amount . The bonds were not registered in the person \u2019s name or otherwise personalised and ORG did not prevent them from being transferred among individuals and legal entities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to put an end to the regulation of retail prices . Shops began to fill up with merchandise but prices increased at a staggering speed ( the inflation rate in DATE was PERCENT ) . In DATE , the Government established that goods available under the bonds would be sold at the prices fixed before DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Government introduced the possibility of buying out the bonds with a coefficient of CARDINAL . In DATE , the coefficient was raised to CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It appears that a significant number of bonds were bought out by the ORG before the buyout operations were stopped in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the status of the commodity bonds was codified in LAW passed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Its text was very laconic , shorter than one page , but it purported to cover every type of commodities bonds issued in DATE . LAW recognised the commodity bonds as part of the internal debt of GPE ; section CARDINAL fixed at DATE the limitation period for the obligations arising out of commodity bonds ( the starting date was not specified ) ; section CARDINAL required the Government to adopt a programme for settlement of the internal debt .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government presented the programme for settlement of the internal debt ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It covered every type of commodity bond , save for the ORG bonds . DATE before LAW was amended so as to provide that the settlement of the debt under the ORG bonds would be regulated by a special federal law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the application of section CARDINAL of LAW was suspended in the part concerning the ORG bonds , in accordance with the laws on the federal budget for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant holds ORG bonds with a total nominal value of CARDINAL non - denominated NORP roubles ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG , seeking to recover MONEY ( RUB ) as compensation for the bonds . The amount was calculated as the nominal value of the bonds multiplied by the official inflation co - efficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of LOC issued a decision to dismiss the applicant \u2019s claim . It noted that the federal law establishing the procedure for redemption of ORG bonds had not yet been adopted and their maturity date had not been determined . ORG held that the plaintiff had not yet obtained the right to lodge this claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the LOC quashed the decision of DATE on procedural grounds and remitted the claim for a new examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the LOC gave judgment . It established that ORG , rather than ORG , should have been the proper defendant in the applicant \u2019s claim for damages because ORG had not committed any unlawful actions . As the applicant refused to substitute the original defendant or to join ORG as a co - defendant and as the court was not competent to do so of its own motion , it determined to disallow the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Amur Region upheld the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant , PERSON , submitted a cassation appeal . On DATE ORG of ORG fixed the hearing date for DATE . Mr PERSON had been notified of that decision on DATE by registered mail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard oral submissions by PERSON and adjourned the hearing until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON did not appear at court . In the absence of any valid reason for his absence , ORG proceeded with the hearing and upheld , in the final instance , the judgments of DATE and DATE .

This does not exclude , however , the possibility of imposing restrictions on the property rights of individuals \u2013 in an established form and within the constitutional limits \u2013 in the matter of ORG obligations , which is compatible with LAW .", "In particular , it follows from the case - law of ORG ... that implementation of the rights and lawful interests of individual citizens or groups of citizens should not excessively and adversely affect the budgetary resources allocated for satisfying the rights and interests of society as a whole . This principle becomes particularly relevant in a situation where budgetary resources are insufficient to resolve many social problems relating to the exercise of the rights to life and personal dignity . It follows that the balance between the rights and lawful interests of the individuals who act as creditors for the ORG in property relationships , on the one hand , and everyone else , on the other hand , may , in principle , be struck only in the form of an act of ORG .", "Hence , given that the legislature may restrict individual rights and freedoms ( including property rights ) for the purpose of the protection of the rights and lawful interests of others , a review of the federal law amending section CARDINAL of LAW by ORG would imply an assessment of the financial and economic justification for the legislative decision on the procedure for settlement of ORG commodity bonds , which ... falls outside the jurisdiction of ORG .", "When examining claims relating to settlement of the ORG commodity bonds , courts of general jurisdiction have the right and duty to interpret the legislative provisions in the light of the interests of the individual ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) and be guided , in particular , by LAW , which establishes that ORG commodity bonds are to be settled in an appropriate form and in accordance with LAW of GPE . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
