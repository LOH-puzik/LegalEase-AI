He is represented before the ORG by Mr L. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , Director of ORG of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a lawyer ( advokaat ) who practises law mainly in ORG where he has established the Andres Tamm Law Firm , a private limited company ( O\u00dc PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s law firm concluded a rental agreement with ORG , a private limited company , in respect of rooms at FAC in GPE . The rooms were to be used by the law firm .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ) for authorisation to act as a member of the management board of ORG , which had its registered office at FAC in GPE . He also informed ORG of his intention to open a branch of his law office at the same address in GPE on DATE .", "On DATE a criminal investigation was initiated in respect of tax offences related to a company , PERSON , a client of the applicant . The applicant and his law firm as well as ORG were among those involved in business transactions with ORG", "On DATE a police investigator interviewed the applicant as a witness . According to the applicant , he had had business transactions with ORG In the record of the interview the applicant is not mentioned as a legal counsel of ORG", "On DATE the police investigator drew up a seizure order in respect of CARDINAL documents concerning transactions between the applicant \u2019s law firm and ORG The documents were seized on DATE in ORG , at an unspecified location . According to the seizure report the applicant voluntarily handed over the documents , making no statements or complaints .", "On DATE the police investigator drew up a search warrant , approved by ORG , in respect of the LOC of ORG at FAC in GPE . According to the warrant , the evidence collected in the criminal case of PERSON referred to the possibility that documents and other items relevant for the criminal case might be found at ORG at FAC in GPE . The search was carried out on DATE . Several documents and letters and a laptop computer were seized . The applicant was present but did not state that the search and seizure concerned privileged lawyer - client information .", "On DATE the police investigator drew up a further seizure order in respect of CARDINAL specific accounting documents of the applicant \u2019s law firm from DATE and its accounting documentation for the whole of DATE . The documents were seized on DATE at the applicant \u2019s law firm in ORG in the applicant \u2019s presence ; the latter , according to the seizure report , gave the documents voluntarily to the investigator and made no statements or complaints .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG and the police investigator . He argued that the search in his law office \u2019s branch in GPE and the seizure of confidential legal documents and a computer as well as the seizures at his law office in ORG had been unlawful as the investigator had not presented a court order authorising these measures . Such a court order had been required , since inviolable data carriers ( puutumatud teabekandjad ) related to the provision of legal services by a lawyer had been concerned . He noted that his state of health at the time when the search and seizure orders were executed had been such that he could not complain about the investigator \u2019s activities .", "On DATE the police investigator made CARDINAL applications to ORG ( linnakohus ) in which he requested , under LAW ORG koodeks ) , judicial authorisation for the seizure from the applicant of the laptop computer and the DATE accounting documents of the applicant \u2019s law firm .", "In the request concerning the seizure of the computer , the investigator noted that on DATE the police had searched the LOC of ORG at FAC in GPE . Certain documents and a laptop computer had been seized , the latter having been securely sealed . The investigator had presumed that in the registered office of ORG there could not be inviolable data carriers related to the provision of legal services . However , considering the applicant \u2019s allegation that the seized data carriers could contain information related to the provision of legal services , the investigator requested the court to authorise the seizure .", "On DATE ORG authorised the seizure of the laptop computer . It held that , since the search had been performed in the LOC of another private limited company ( not a law firm ) , the investigator had had no reason to presume at the time of the search that the computer could contain inviolable information related to the provision of legal services by a lawyer . The computer had been packed and sealed and no unauthorised persons had examined its contents . In order for the investigator to find out whether the computer contained information required for the investigation of the criminal case , it was necessary for him to examine its contents . At the same time , it could not be ruled out that the computer might contain information protected by the lawyer \u2019s professional confidentiality , which the investigator had the right to become aware of only if authorised by a court . Accordingly , the judge authorised , apparently with immediate effect , the seizure of the laptop computer from the applicant , relying on Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The judicial decision bears the applicant \u2019s signature to the effect that he has familiarised himself with it on DATE . It was not specified in the decision whether an appeal lay against it .", "In the second request , made on DATE , concerning the seizure of the law firm \u2019s accounting documents , the investigator noted that the applicant had been requested voluntarily to hand over the documents specified in the seizure order , which he had done without objection . He had not disclosed during the seizure that the documents could include inviolable data carriers and since , according to LAW ( ORG ) , the lawyer had to store data carriers related to the provision of legal services separately from other data carriers ( section MONEY ) ) , the investigator had presumed that the seized accounting documents did not contain inviolable information .", "On DATE ORG granted this request as well , noting that since the seizure had concerned accounting documents of the law firm and it had not been immediately challenged by the applicant , the investigator had had no ground to presume , at the time of the search , that the seized accounting documents could contain inviolable information related to the provision of legal services by a lawyer . The seized documents had been packed and sealed and no unauthorised persons had examined their contents . In order for the investigator to find out whether the seized documentation contained information required for the investigation of the criminal case , it was necessary for him to examine its contents . At the same time , it could not be ruled out that the documents might contain information protected by the lawyer \u2019s professional confidentiality , which the investigator had the right to become aware of only if authorised by a court . Accordingly , the judge authorised , apparently with immediate effect , the seizure from the applicant of the applicant \u2019s law firm \u2019s accounting documents from DATE , referring to LAW . The judicial decision bears the applicant \u2019s signature to the effect that he has familiarised himself with it on DATE . It was not specified in the decision whether an appeal lay against it .", "On DATE the accounting documents and the computer \u2013 the packaging and seals not having been opened in the meantime \u2013 were returned to the applicant on police premises in GPE . The applicant requested that the documents seized at FAC on DATE also be returned , but the investigator refused . At the applicant \u2019s request , it was stated in the report that the investigator had not accessed the content of the returned items or copied or opened them . TIME on DATE , still on police premises , the computer and the accounting documents were seized again . The applicant objected , arguing that both the computer and the accounting documents contained information related to the provision of legal services by a lawyer and they were therefore inviolable under LAW . Only ORG could assess whether the computer also contained other information .", "On DATE the police investigator declared the applicant a tax evasion suspect .", "On DATE ORG replied to the applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE . It asserted that on DATE the computer and documents had been returned to him ; accordingly , his complaint was without substance . Nevertheless the applicant had voluntarily surrendered the accounting documents without arguing that they contained inviolable information and therefore the investigator had had no grounds not to seize the documents . At FAC , a search had been carried out in respect of ORG and not in respect of a law office . ORG noted that at the time it was replying to the applicant , ORG rulings served as grounds for the seizure of the documents and the computer . In so far as the documents seized at FAC were concerned , ORG was of the opinion that they did not relate to the provision of legal services by a lawyer but were items related to the business transactions of ORG Therefore , the guarantees provided for under LAW were not applicable and , accordingly , the search of the LOC of ORG and seizure of the documents had been lawful .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a new complaint with ORG . He argued that the search and seizure carried out on CARDINAL and DATE could not be legitimised retroactively by the judicial rulings of DATE . He also asserted that the seizure executed on DATE had been unlawful . LAW was flawed as it did not set out the grounds on which a judge had to grant the investigator \u2019s request and in which circumstances a request could be refused . He was of the opinion that lawyer \u2019s privilege had been insufficiently protected . The applicant referred to ORG ( NORP ) judgment of DATE , according to which search and seizure were measures in public law that restricted a person \u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms . ORG had held that judicial review of such measures fell within the jurisdiction of administrative courts under LAW ( ORG seadustik ) . The applicant concluded that he had the right to judicial protection up to the \u201c ORG \u201d .", "On DATE ORG replied that LAW explicitly provided for a possibility of search and seizure in a law office , on the condition of judicial authorisation . In the case at hand such an authorisation had been granted and , accordingly , there was no ground for declaring the investigator \u2019s activities unlawful . It was also emphasised that the seizure had not been aimed at obtaining information concerning the clients of the applicant \u2019s law firm or at taking any data carriers related to the provision of legal services . The seizure had related to a criminal case in which a possible tax offence committed by PERSON had been investigated . Therefore , it had been necessary to gather information on persons who had had business relations with this company . It had been necessary to verify the applicant \u2019s assertion that certain sums he had received from ORG had not been his personal income but had belonged to his law firm . On the basis of the above , ORG rejected the complaint .", "On DATE the seized computer was examined on police premises in the applicant \u2019s presence . The data on its hard disc were copied and the computer was returned to the applicant .", "On DATE the investigator interviewed the law firm \u2019s chief accountant as a witness . After a list of the seized accounting documents had been presented to her , she stated that the ledger and file no . CARDINAL had not been included in the list .", "On DATE the police investigator made CARDINAL applications to ORG in which he requested , under LAW , judicial authorisation for searches in the applicant \u2019s law firm and at his home in ORG in order to find the law firm \u2019s ledger for DATE and other important evidence in the criminal case .", "On DATE the ORG granted the requests , referring to Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . It noted that in the criminal case at hand the applicant was not acting as a lawyer , neither did he represent other legal ORG interests ( he was not a contractual representative ) but he was himself a tax evasion suspect . In ORG decision it was noted that an appeal could be lodged with ORG within DATE . The decision was presented to the applicant on DATE .", "On the same date a search was conducted at the applicant \u2019s home in ORG . CARDINAL documents related to the criminal investigation were seized .", "On DATE the applicant was charged with tax offences committed by him as the sole member of the management board and sole shareholder of the Andres Tamm Law Firm . According to the charges he had presented incorrect information to the tax authorities in his law firm \u2019s tax return for DATE and in other documents , evading payment of CARDINAL kroons ( EEK ; corresponding MONEY ( ORG ) ) in taxes .", "On DATE the criminal case concerning the applicant was separated from the case concerning ORG", "On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal investigation in respect of the applicant . It was noted that the applicant had paid most of the outstanding taxes on behalf of his law firm , his guilt was negligible and there was no public interest in pursuing the case . The applicant undertook to pay the remaining taxes plus a lump sum of EEK CARDINAL ( corresponding approximately to EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) into the public revenues . The seized documents were to be returned to the applicant after he had fulfilled the obligations imposed on him .", "On DATE the accounting documents of the applicant \u2019s law firm and the documents taken from FAC were returned to the applicant .", "LAW ( ORG p\u00f5hiseadus ) reads as follows :", "\u201c Everyone whose rights and freedoms are violated has the right of recourse to the courts .

CARDINAL ) , ORG , sitting in plenary session in order to ensure the uniform application of the law , dealt with complaints lodged with an administrative court by CARDINAL companies on whose premises search and seizure of documents had been carried out by police and tax officers with the approval of ORG . The first- and second - instance administrative courts had rejected the complaints , finding that they were not authorised to review the lawfulness of measures taken in the context of a criminal investigation . However , ORG found for the appellants , quashed the lower courts\u2019 decisions and referred the case to ORG for examination on the merits . It held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he ORG en banc finds it necessary to note , firstly , that Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW give rise to the right to an effective remedy . ORG has observed that according to LAW an effective remedy means a remedy which is as effective as possible ( see PERSON and others v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A , No CARDINAL , p CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The ORG has also said that if a person alleges that his or her Convention rights have been violated , he or she should have a remedy before a national authority in order both to have his or her claim decided and , if appropriate , to obtain redress ( see PERSON and others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ; and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) .

Postponement of a review of the legality of an investigative activity infringing fundamental rights and freedoms of persons until the judicial hearing of a criminal matter can not be regarded as an effective remedy , because the hearing may take place DATE after the investigative activity was conducted . The harm caused by the violation of fundamental rights and freedoms may essentially increase or redress may become impossible by that time . Furthermore , the court hearing a criminal case has no right to decide on compensating the damage caused by an investigative activity . The possibility can not be excluded that a criminal matter never reaches a court , or that an investigative activity infringes the fundamental rights and freedoms of a person who is not a party to a proceeding and therefore can not seek judicial protection from violation of his or her rights and freedoms .", "...", "CARDINAL . Search of a dwelling , possession or place of work and seizure of documents are acts of public law , which infringe fundamental rights and freedoms of persons . According to LAW adjudication of disputes in public law falls within the jurisdiction of administrative courts . According to the special clause of paragraph CARDINAL of the same Article adjudication of disputes in public law for which a different procedure is prescribed by law does not fall within the jurisdiction of administrative courts . As LAW prescribes that appeal against the referred measures may be filed only with a prosecutor , then judicial review of such measures falls within the jurisdiction of administrative courts , pursuant to the general clause of LAW of LAW ; that is why the administrative court should not have refused to hear the complaints on the substance . Any person whose fundamental rights and freedoms are violated by a procedural act is entitled to file a complaint with a prosecutor or an administrative court . ORG en banc considers it necessary to note that the duty of an administrative court is not to review the necessity and expediency of an investigative activity or look into the question whether the information obtained can be used as evidence in criminal proceedings . The task of an administrative court is to review whether a person \u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms were infringed by a procedural act . \u201d", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG sitting in plenary session ( case no .
