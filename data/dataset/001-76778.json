{"ITEMID": "001-76778", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "KARIM v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE . He is represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and , on DATE , he applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and a residence permit . On DATE an initial interview was held with the applicant and , on DATE , ORG conducted a second interview . During these interviews , the applicant stated that he had been active within ORG [ NORP ] in the district of ORG where he lived . He had commenced his political activities in DATE and , in DATE , he became the organisation \u2019s secretary within the district . He had been responsible for organising meetings and demonstrations and for recruiting new members to the party .", "On DATE he had been arrested during a demonstration and had been beaten by the police while being taken to the police station . During his detention , he had been tortured CARDINAL times per day . He had , inter alia , been beaten all over his body with sticks , suspended with his hands and feet tied from a pipe , burnt with cigarettes and had had water mixed with chilli thrown in his face . He had been told that the ill - treatment would continue until he stopped his political activities . After he had been detained for DATE , CARDINAL of the leaders of ORG [ NORP ] had managed to get him out .", "He had been arrested TIME time , on DATE , in connection with a meeting in CARDINAL of the party \u2019s offices . He had been detained for DATE before his father had managed to bribe the police , paying CARDINAL ORG ( around ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , to get him released . Also this time he had been badly tortured and had had to stay at a private hospital for DATE following his release to get treatment for his injuries . He had not reported the torture to the authorities since it was the police and supporters of the governing party who had carried it out . The police had also ordered him to present himself at the police station twice a month but he had only done so on CARDINAL occasion . However , he had continued his political activities and , on DATE , the police and some supporters of the governing party had come to his home , looking for him . As he had not been at home , they had destroyed his belongings and had harassed his father , saying that they would kill the applicant should they find him . Following this , the applicant had gone into hiding .", "On DATE a supporter of the governing party had been murdered in his neighbourhood and the applicant claimed that he had been accused of the murder as yet another means of persecuting him because of his political affiliation . Due to these incidents , he had travelled to some relatives in GPE who had arranged for him to leave the country with the help of smugglers , to whom the applicant \u2019s father had paid QUANTITY ( around ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant alleged before ORG that he would be arrested and tortured if he was returned to GPE and that the political persecution of him would continue . To support his claims , he submitted a medical certificate from GPE made by Dr. PERSON at ORG in DATE . It stated that the applicant had been cared for at the hospital CARDINAL DATE as he had scars and wounds after receiving blows to his body . He had been given antibiotics and painkillers , as well as medication to subdue his anxiety . The applicant also relied on a certificate from the GPE Secretary , PERSON , of ORG [ NORP ] in ORG which stated that he had been very active within the party and had been arrested and tortured on CARDINAL occasions .", "The applicant further invoked medical certificates from GPE from which it appeared that he had been admitted to psychiatric care DATE and DATE , and thereafter had been in regular contact with the psychiatric service for asylum seekers in GPE . He had been diagnosed as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and depression .", "In a submission of DATE , the applicant claimed that he had been raped and subjected to serious sexual abuse while in detention in GPE and that he had repeated flashbacks and nightmares from the abuses . He stated that he had been too ashamed and afraid to recount these events during the interviews with ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the general situation in GPE was not good but that it was not such that it could grant the applicant asylum solely on this basis . ORG did not question that the applicant had been involved in ORG [ NORP ] in LOC or that he had been the victim of abuse and torture , which it regarded as serious . However , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s political involvement had been on a local level and that he had not held a prominent position within the party . Moreover , the harassment and abuse of which he had been the victim seemed to be personal aggressions from supporters of the governing party and police officers who had acted on their own initiative . Thus , it found that the abuses were not sanctioned by the NORP authorities and that the applicant would not be of interest to the authorities because of his political involvement . Consequently , he would not face a real risk of torture or ill - treatment if returned to his home country . Furthermore , with regard to the applicant \u2019s claim that he had been accused of murder , ORG considered that he would have the opportunity to defend himself in a court of law and that the legal system in GPE worked relatively well . Even if he were to be convicted in the first instance , he could appeal to the higher courts in GPE which were considered to be independent and fair . In these circumstances , the applicant could not be granted asylum in GPE .", "As concerned the applicant \u2019s mental health , ORG noted that , in DATE , he had requested to be exempt from having a working permit in order to be able to work in GPE . ORG considered this as a sign of improvement of the applicant \u2019s health . Moreover , it observed that there was psychiatric care available in GPE where the applicant should be able to get adequate treatment . ORG further found that the applicant was not suffering from a serious mental disorder or any other disorder of such a serious nature that he could be granted leave to stay in GPE based on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , maintaining his claims and adding that , although torture was prohibited by NORP law , it was widespread . Moreover , the NORP authorities sanctioned persecution of political opponents and , if he was prosecuted for murder , he would risk being kept in detention for a very long time before the case was heard by the courts . The applicant further stated that he had continuous nightmares about the torture and the sexual abuse of which he had been a victim , and had serious thoughts of suicide . According to him , his friends had to keep an eye on him all the time . He relied on medical certificates which supported his statements concerning his poor mental health .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It shared ORG reasoning and conclusion that the applicant could not be granted asylum . With regard to his poor mental health , ORG noted that he was not undergoing regular treatment except that he met with a nurse for counselling . Thus , it found that the applicant was not in such poor health that he could be granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "In DATE the applicant lodged a new application for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds , invoking his continuously deteriorating mental health . He relied on medical certificates from the Crisis and ORG which confirmed that he had been subjected to grave and systematic torture , and that it had caused him to develop PTSD with a psychotic strain . He was considered to be in need of extensive treatment . Moreover , DATE , he had been admitted to psychiatric care on several occasions ( DATE , CARDINAL TIME DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) because he had been considered to be suicidal .", "On DATE ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the deportation of the applicant until further notice . It further requested an independent physician ( f\u00f6rtroendel\u00e4kare ) to examine the applicant and to submit her observations and conclusions to ORG .", "On DATE the physician , PERSON , a specialist in psychiatry , submitted her findings which were based on a personal examination of the applicant and access to all his medical journals and certificates . She observed that the applicant suffered from flashbacks from the torture and rape , and that he blamed himself for the abuses . Moreover , he was constantly anxious and depressed but the psychiatrist found no sign of psychotic symptoms or paranoia . However , his health had not improved and , although he had never injured himself , he had expressed suicidal thoughts and plans . Thus , she considered that a risk of suicide in the future could not be excluded and she concluded that there existed certain impediments against the enforcement of the deportation order .", "In response to the independent physician \u2019s conclusion , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s regular physicians , PERSON and PERSON , replied that they considered that there were clear and absolute impediments against the enforcement of the deportation order since the applicant suffered from grave PTSD and depression , and because there was a real risk that he would try to commit suicide .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application . It first noted that the applicant had only invoked humanitarian grounds based on his poor mental health and that it was only in exceptional cases that leave to stay could be granted on that basis . ORG found that the medical certificates and the independent physician \u2019s report did not show that the applicant had a serious mental disorder for which a residence permit should be granted on medical grounds . It considered that the applicant could receive proper treatment in his home country and noted that his relatives remained there . Thus it concluded that it would not violate the standards of humanity to deport him to GPE .", "The applicant then lodged another new application with ORG . He stated that , since the last rejection , he had been admitted to psychiatric care on CARDINAL occasions ( DATE , DATE and DATE ) due to a high risk of suicide . His treating physicians considered that he suffered from a serious and complicated psychiatric disorder due to his traumas in his home country and that there was an absolute impediment to the enforcement of his deportation order .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application on the grounds that the applicant had invoked no new circumstances of relevance .", "As the applicant refused to leave GPE voluntarily and went into hiding to avoid deportation , ORG , on DATE , transferred the responsibility for implementing the deportation order to the police authority .", "On DATE the applicant lodged yet another new application with ORG because he had , once again , been admitted to psychiatric care .", "On DATE ORG decided not to stay the enforcement of the deportation order .", "However , on DATE , following the ORG \u2019s indication under LAW , ORG decided to stay the deportation of the applicant until further notice . ORG decision is still in force .", "On DATE the ORG adjourned the case at the request of ORG following the enactment of an interim amendment to LAW , on the basis of which the applicant \u2019s case would be reviewed .", "On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that , on DATE , ORG had decided not to grant him a residence permit in GPE on the basis of the interim amendment to LAW . ORG had concluded that the applicant could not be granted leave to stay on medical grounds and that he could get adequate care in his home country .", "According to a medico - legal protocol , dated DATE , and a medico - legal certificate , dated DATE , both by Dr PERSON , a specialist in forensic medicine at the Crisis and Trauma Centre , the applicant had a large number of scars on his body , some of which were typical after burning and severe violence ( skarpt v\u00e5ld ) . It was considered very unlikely that the applicant could have caused these injuries himself or that they were the result of accidents . Instead , the findings confirmed that he had been tortured as he had claimed .", "With regard to the applicant \u2019s mental health , he has submitted several medical reports from the aforementioned psychiatrists ( ORG , PERSON and PERSON ) dating from DATE to DATE , as well a report dated DATE from PERSON , assistant physician , and PERSON , chief physician at ORG . According to these reports , the applicant was admitted for psychiatric care for the first time DATE and DATE , DATE after his arrival in GPE on DATE . Subsequently , he has been admitted to psychiatric care on repeated occasions but for shorter periods , the last time DATE and DATE , due to the risk of suicide . However , on no occasion has he been committed to compulsory psychiatric care ( tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd ) , i.e. taken into care against his will . He has had continuous contact with psychiatric services and has had a positive attitude to treatment all along .", "All the physicians agreed that the applicant suffered from serious PTSD and depression , and that his health had not improved despite the treatment . PERSON and PERSON also considered that he had a serious and complicated psychiatric disorder , with which diagnosis , however , PERSON disagreed as she had found no signs of psychotic symptoms when examining the applicant . Nevertheless , she considered that a risk of suicide could not be excluded , although the applicant had never injured himself . PERSON and PERSON maintained in their reports that there was a real risk of suicide as the applicant was constantly struggling with self - destructive thoughts , and had suicidal impulses and clear flashbacks from torture . Thus , in the view of PERSON , there were certain impediments against the enforcement of the deportation order because of the applicant \u2019s mental health condition , whereas PERSON and PERSON insisted that there was an absolute impediment against the deportation as the applicant was in such poor mental health that he could act in desperation if he were to be deported . These CARDINAL physicians also stated that the applicant \u2019s poor health had been caused by the traumas of which he had been the victim in GPE and by the prolonged insecurity in GPE . They estimated that he would need extensive treatment , both medical and psychiatric , for a long time and in a secure environment .", "In the last certificate , dated DATE , PERSON wrote that the applicant \u2019s condition had not improved but rather worsened because he was very frustrated over his uncertain situation in GPE . He had continuous contact with a psychologist at the clinic and got his medication in doses for DATE at a time to prevent a suicide by overdose . He was medicated with the anti - psychotic drug , GPE , the anti - depressive drug , Clomipramine , as well as with anxiety reducing medication and sleeping pills .", "The NORP government is the main provider of health services in the country , with the private sector playing an increasingly larger role . Moreover , non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) are involved in the provision of primary health care and in rehabilitation . The country has a national mental health programme and there are budget allocations for mental health . However , both the budget and the number of mental health professionals are largely inadequate . Medicines , including antidepressants , are available and commonly used in GPE for the treatment of mental illness . Different types of psychotherapy are also used in treatment .", "Formal care and treatment of mentally ill persons started in DATE when ORG was opened and , in DATE , the first outdoor clinic started functioning in ORG . Since DATE , more institutes were opened and , in DATE , ORG opened as a fully operational hospital and educational centre . Moreover , each military hospital has a mental health department and there are mental health sections in hospitals in several cities around the country . Several smaller , private clinics have also been established , in particularly in and around GPE , such as ORG .", "Furthermore , ORG , ORG and ORG have their seats in GPE and are affiliated to ORG , ORG and ORG at ORG , respectively . Also , in DATE , an NGO , ORG , was created with the mission to provide community - based mental health service to the people in GPE . It has its base at ORG in GPE .", "The basic provisions , applied in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE were laid down in the CARDINAL LAW ( utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . However , LAW was replaced , on DATE , by a new LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslag , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Both LAW and LAW define the conditions under which an alien can be expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of decisions under the Acts .", "LAW , LAW provided that an alien staying in GPE for DATE should have a residence permit . Such a permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , should be allowed to settle in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . For example , serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the granting of a residence permit if it was a life - threatening illness for which no treatment could be provided in the alien \u2019s home country .", "Further , according to LAW , an alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to residence in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether the persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( LAW , LAW ) . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d was meant , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "An alien who was to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force could be granted a residence permit if he or she filed a so - called new application based on circumstances which had not previously been examined , and if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , LAW , or it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce such a decision ( LAW , LAW b ) . Regard could also be had to serious illness under this provision . Such new applications were filed with and examined by ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) .", "When it came to enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , account had to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "In essence , there have not been any major changes to the provisions referred to above in LAW , with the exception of the following :", "Through the enactment of LAW , ORG has been replaced by ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW ) . Moreover , it is no longer possible to lodge so called new applications but , instead , ORG shall , on its own initiative , determine whether there is any impediment to the deportation or expulsion ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Furthermore , DATE and DATE , some interim amendments to the DATE Act were in force , according to which ORG , upon application by an alien or on its own initiative , could re - determine final decisions already taken by ORG . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
