The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were , at the material time , senior officers in ORG in which they served until retirement . They both served continuously with an interruption of DATE and DATE under the conditions set out below .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , criminal proceedings were initiated against them in relation to their alleged involvement in the ill - treatment and torture of suspects . The prosecuting authorities failed to prove a prima facie case against them and they were acquitted on DATE . The court considered that the testimony of the principal prosecution witnesses - the victim and CARDINAL of his relatives who had been arrested with him- \u201c had been so obviously unreliable that no reasonable court could rely on it and convict the accused \u201d . It also considered that the prosecution had committed a series of improprieties which had tainted the evidence to such an extent that the case against the applicants should be discontinued in the interests of the proper administration of justice .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG appointed an ORG ( ORG ) to examine this matter further . The ORG 's findings were delivered on DATE . It found that the applicants , together with CARDINAL other police officers , had engaged in torture practices against certain suspects in order to obtain confessions . On the basis of the ORG 's findings , on DATE , ORG terminated the applicants ' employment with ORG for the protection of public interest . CARDINAL other police officer was also dismissed by virtue of the same decision , while CARDINAL junior officers who were also found to have been involved in acts of torture and ill - treatment of prisoners were not dismissed . The applicants ' dismissal was widely reported in the national press .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the legality of the said decision before ORG , exercising its administrative judicial review jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment in a plenary session on DATE . It unanimously annulled the decision of ORG which was found to have violated the constitutional rights of the applicants . In particular , it found that their right not to be tried twice for the same offence had been breached and that their right to be presumed innocent , especially in the light of their acquittal , had been prejudiced . It further found that the applicants had effectively been dismissed without trial or disciplinary proceedings and , as such , they had been deprived of any opportunity to defend themselves . Moreover , the decision of ORG was found to be ultra vires .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants requested reinstatement to their former posts . On DATE they returned to duty .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicants brought an action under LAW before ORG of GPE requesting fair and equitable compensation .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was delivered on DATE by ORG , which refused the applicants ' request for exemplary damages . Concerning their request for payment of the difference in their DATE salaries , corresponding to the period in which their service had been interrupted , the court observed that the applicants had received a higher amount upon their dismissal than the requested difference in salaries . This amount had been held by the first applicant throughout the period following his return to duty and until his retirement and it was still held by the second applicant . As regards the first applicant , the amount he had received upon his dismissal had been deducted from the amount to which he was entitled by virtue of his retirement and the difference had been paid to him . The request was accordingly refused .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , CARDINAL Cypriot pounds ( ORG ) , plus MONEY interest as from DATE that the action was lodged , was awarded in compensation for moral damage . The court pointed out that , as observed by ORG in the case of PERSON v. The Republic ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL , an award of damages under LAW was not subject to the common - law rule for quantifying damages aimed at restitutio in integrum , but was governed by the principles of equity . It considered that the applicants had suffered injury to their psychological and moral integrity which was directly caused by the annulled decision . In particular , the following was noted :", "\u201c Within this framework of criteria ( established in the domestic case - law ) , I do not see any good reason why the court should rule , in a case similar to the present one , where , by the exclusive behaviour of the administration ( ORG ) the plaintiffs have been expelled from their positions with characterisations that have definitely affected them psychologically as they themselves have maintained , that they should not be entitled to certain compensation for that injury to their psychological integrity . I consider such injury as damage emanating directly from the annulled administrative decision \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , it was acknowledged that the decision had serious defamatory effects for them . As such , the relevant award was seen as required by equity to redress the unlawful act of the administration .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal with ORG and contended that the award of damages was manifestly insufficient . The Attorney - General lodged a cross - appeal requesting the annulment of the first - instance ORG judgment .", "\u201c Such moral damage did not constitute a direct consequence of the annulled administrative act and that , therefore , such an award was not covered by the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate finally on a recourse made to it on a complaint that a decision , an act or omission of any organ , authority or person , exercising any executive or administrative authority is contrary to any of the provisions of this LAW or of any law or is made in excess or in abuse of powers vested in such organ or authority or person .", "CARDINAL . Such a recourse may be made by a person whose any existing legitimate interest , which he has either as a person or by virtue of being a member of a ORG , is adversely and directly affected by such decision or act or omission .", "CARDINAL . Such a recourse shall be made within DATE of the date when the decision or act was published or , if not published and in the case of an omission , when it came to the knowledge of the person making the recourse .", "CARDINAL . Upon such a recourse the ORG may , by its decision-", "( a ) confirm , either in whole or in part , such decision or act or omission ; or", "( b ) declare , either in whole or in part , such decision or act to be null and void and of no effect whatsoever , or", "( c ) declare that such omission , either in whole or in part , ought not to have been made and that whatever has been omitted should have been performed .", "CARDINAL . Any decision given under paragraph CARDINAL of this Article shall be binding on all courts and all organs or authorities in the Republic and shall be given effect to and acted upon by the organ or authority or person concerned .", "CARDINAL . Any person aggrieved by any decision or act declared to be void under paragraph CARDINAL of this LAW or by any omission declared there under that it ought not to have been made shall be entitled , if his claim is not met to his satisfaction by the organ , authority or person concerned , to institute legal proceedings in a court for the recovery of damages or for being granted other remedy and to recover just and equitable damages to be assessed by the court or to be granted such other just and equitable remedy as such court is empowered to grant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. The Republic ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL , Mr Justice PERSON , as he then was , observed the following :", "\u201c The cause of action conferred by LAW , is a cause sui generis , in the sense that it bears no relationship to a common law action for damages , or , in fact , to any other cause of action known to the law ( PERSON v. The Attorney - General ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL ) . It is a right to be evaluated in the context of Article CARDINAL and the system of review of administrative action created thereby . It is ancillary to judicial review , as a measure necessary for its effectiveness . Primarily it entitles the injured party to recover damage not remediable by proper administrative action . If the proper administrative action is not taken , the remedy is to go to the administrative court again . If notwithstanding this step the injured party is left to shoulder damages , then he has a right to recover them from the Republic . The right to damages under Article CARDINAL is distinctly independent from any other cause of action , as ORG held in Attorney - General v. PERSON and another ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL . Not only its juridical basis but also the manner of quantifying damages is different from a common law action . ORG emphasised the equitable character of the relief as well as the damages recoverable , stressing that they are not strictly compensatory . Consequently , it is legitimate for the ORG to have regard , not only to the extent of the material damage suffered , but also to the conduct of the parties and the degree to which the successful party contributed to the production of the wrongful administrative act . In the case of ORG , supra , ORG derived guidance , inter alia , from NORP case law , establishing that the conduct of the parties and their blameworthiness , if any , is of crucial importance to the determination of the quantum of the damages . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
