The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under a contract of employment of DATE , the applicant was employed with the municipality of ORG and occupied the position of the head of CARDINAL of its departments .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the new mayor of the municipality cancelled the applicant \u2019s appointment as the head of department and informed him that , due to the lack of other appropriate posts for him , his employment with the municipality would be terminated . The notice of termination was served on the applicant at some point in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the cancellation of his appointment and the termination of his employment before ORG s\u00fad ) . He also claimed compensation in respect of lost wages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings observing that the applicant had not paid the court fee and finding that he was not eligible for an exemption from the obligation to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal ( odvolanie ) , ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the applicant \u2019s action fell within the ambit of the exemption under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( d ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that both the cancellation of the applicant \u2019s appointment and the termination of his employment were void . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s employment had not been established by a deed of appointment ( vymenovan\u00edm ) under LAW and CARDINAL of the Labour Code but by an ordinary employment contract ( pracovn\u00e1 zmluva ) under LAW of that LAW . The applicant \u2019s \u201c appointment \u201d thus could not be \u201c cancelled \u201d and the statutory condition for the valid termination of his employment contract had not been met .", "ORG further ruled that the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for lost wages would be dealt with in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the defendant \u2019s appeal , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for reexamination . ORG noted that , at the time of the applicant \u2019s dismissal , the post of his superior - the head of the municipal office - had been vacant . The applicant had thus been directly answerable to the mayor of the municipality . This being so , the applicant \u2019s employment fell within the category of employment by appointment . In the light of these findings , the case had to be reconsidered at first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action . It observed that the applicant had been directly answerable to the mayor and that , consequently , the rules for the cancellation of an appointment had applied to him and were complied with . As the municipality had had no possibility of continuing to employ the applicant and all other conditions for the termination of his employment contract had been met , the applicant \u2019s dismissal was lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG upheld the part of the judgment of DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s motion to declare the cancellation of his appointment void . ORG further overturned the part of ORG judgment concerning the termination of the applicant \u2019s contract of employment and ruled that it was void .", "It was observed that the applicant undoubtedly became the employee of the defendant . There was however no deed of appointment . Declaring the cancellation of the applicant \u2019s appointment void would therefore not reestablish his appointment . The applicant thus could not be considered as having a \u201c pressing legal interest \u201d , within the meaning of LAW ) of LAW , in obtaining the declaratory ruling sought in respect of the cancellation of his appointment .", "The termination of the applicant \u2019s employment with the defendant , as such , could not be justified by the restructuring of the defendant \u2019s office , on which the defendant had relied , as this restructuring had only taken place after the applicant \u2019s dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) , ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG for a new determination of the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE . In particular , ORG found a flaw in the procedure before ORG requiring the quashing of its judgment . It further found that ORG had failed to examine adequately the factual and legal grounds on which the applicant \u2019s contract of employment had been terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing of the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment of DATE , following which it upheld the latter \u2019s judgment . It endorsed the reasoning given by ORG and , in addition , it observed that , in view of the scope of his duties and his working relationship with the mayor , the applicant had clearly been in a \u201c leading position \u201d to which the rules on employment by appointment had applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE as unfounded .", "It was held that , as for its substance and irrespective of the formal designation of the applicant \u2019s contract , his relation with his former employer was one falling within the category of appointment within the meaning of LAW . The applicant \u2019s appointment thus could be , and in fact had been , cancelled . As the defendant had no other appropriate posts for the applicant , the termination of his employment was justified and lawful under LAW ( d ) of LAW . On DATE ORG corrected clerical errors in the decision . No appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . Following its decision of DATE to deal separately with the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation in respect of lost wages , at some unspecified time in DATE , ORG opened a new set of proceedings under a different file number for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . Referring to the judgments of DATE and DATE , ORG took it as established that the applicant \u2019s dismissal was lawful . It thus could not have resulted in the loss of any wages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE observing that ORG had deprived the applicant of an opportunity to assert his rights adequately in that it had determined the claim without having heard him . The matter was remitted to ORG for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for lost wages in substance for the same reason as on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE finding that ORG had failed to decide on the part of the applicant \u2019s claim concerning severance pay . The matter was again remitted to ORG where it is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s petition ( podnet ) under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) found that ORG had violated the applicant \u2019s right under LAW to a hearing without unjustified delay . It considered that the subject matter of the proceedings was not of particular complexity , that the applicant \u2019s conduct had been cooperative and that what was at stake for him called for special diligence . As to the conduct of ORG , ORG observed in particular that it had failed to open a new set of proceedings or take any procedural steps in respect of the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for lost wages , as it had announced it would do in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant seized the ORG anew by a complaint ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) under LAW , as in force since DATE , of continuing undue delays in his proceedings . The complaint was formally directed against ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It observed that , at the time when the constitutional complaint had been lodged , ORG had no longer been dealing with the case . By then the case had already been transmitted to ORG for a determination of the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . In these circumstances , an examination of the part of the proceedings before ORG could no longer serve to expedite them . Thus , in line with its established practice , ORG found that it was not called upon to examine the complaint .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , as in force until DATE , ORG could commence proceedings upon the petition presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights had been violated .", "CARDINAL . According to its case - law under the former LAW of LAW , the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of ORG rights under LAW . It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found . In ORG view , it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights had been violated ( for further details see , e.g. , ORG v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE the LAW has been amended in that , inter alia , natural and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to LAW . Under this provision , ORG has the power , in the event that it finds a violation of LAW , to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay . It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional rights have been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings ( for further details see , e.g. , ORG and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , PERSON , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , ORG CARDINAL-IX ) .", "CARDINAL . The implementation of the amended LAW is set out in more detail in sections CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) . The relevant amendment ( PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) was published in LAW and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section DATE ( a ) , which applies to all motions for any type of constitutional proceedings to be opened , a motion is inadmissible if it concerns a matter which ORG has already determined .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that a constitutional complaint can be filed within DATE from the date on which the decision in question has become final and binding or on which a measure has been notified or on which a notice of other interference has been given . As regards the measures and other interferences , the above period commences when the complainant could have become aware of them .", "CARDINAL . Under section DATE ( CARDINAL ) , which was introduced by the abovementioned amendment no . PERSON . , and which specifically concerns constitutional complaints by natural and legal persons , ORG is to declare inadmissible a complaint if it has already decided on substantially the same matter in proceedings on a complaint or in proceedings on a petition under the applicable legal rules .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings file nos . IV . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL and PERSON . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined the length of civil proceedings before first instance courts on individual complaints under LAW , as in force from DATE . In all CARDINAL cases ORG had already examined the length of those proceedings at their first instance stage on petitions under LAW of the LAW , as in force until DATE , and had found unjustified delays therein .", "In judgments ( n\u00e1lez ) of DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG found continued unjustified delays in the proceedings under review , in their phase after the previous examinations . ORG awarded the complainants just satisfaction . In determining the merits of the case and amounts of the just satisfaction , it took into consideration that delays in those proceedings had already been found before .", "CARDINAL . It has been ORG longstanding practice to entertain constitutional petitions or , as the case may be , complaints about excessive length of proceedings only where the proceedings complained of are pending before the authority liable for the alleged violation at the moment when such petitions or complaints are lodged ( see , for example , decisions file nos .

NORP In proceedings file number I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined an individual complaint under LAW of delays in enforcement proceedings concerning a minor \u2019s claim for maintenance . The enforcement commenced in DATE in GPE ORG and , from DATE , continued in GPE I ORG where it was still pending .", "In a judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before both ORG and awarded the minor complainant just satisfaction in respect of nonpecuniary damage to be paid by both courts .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings file number I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined a complaint by an individual under LAW of delays in proceedings in his civil action of DATE . The action was partially granted at first instance in DATE . That judgment was however quashed on appeal in DATE and the matter was remitted to the first instance court where it was still pending .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings before the first instance court and awarded the complainant nonpecuniary damages . ORG also examined the phase of the proceedings before the court of appeal but found no unjustified delays . A similar approach was adopted in proceedings FAC . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings file number III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined a complaint by an individual under LAW of delays in proceedings in a civil action against him . The action was lodged in DATE with ORG which , shortly after , transferred it to a ORG for reasons of jurisdiction . The action was then pending at ORG until DATE when ORG ruled that it should be determined at first instance by ORG . The action was eventually withdrawn and the proceedings were consequently discontinued by a final decision of DATE .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found that there had been unjustified delays in the proceedings both before ORG and ORG . The complainant was awarded nonpecuniary damages to be paid by both courts . A similar approach was adopted in proceedings no I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings file no . IV . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG examined a complaint by an individual under LAW , inter alia , delays in court proceedings concerning her maintenance . The action was originally filed with LAW in DATE . The question arose whether the first instance and the second instance court judges were impartial . On DATE ORG decided that the question of impartiality of the judges at the first instance would be determined by ORG . The latter decided on DATE that the action would be examined at first instance by ORG which determined it on DATE . On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment . In her complaint to ORG of DATE the plaintiff alleged that the ordinary courts had violated her right to a hearing without undue delay .", "On DATE ORG declared this complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . The decision stated that , in so far as the complaint related to the part of the proceedings leading to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , it had been filed out of time since , at the moment of the introduction of the constitutional complaint , the relevant part of the proceedings had no longer been pending . For similar reason ORG rejected the complaint in respect of the subsequent proceedings before ORG which had ended on DATE . As to the appellate proceedings before ORG , ORG noted that they had lasted DATE and found that this period was not excessive . Similar approach was adopted for example in proceedings nos .
