One of the topics discussed in \u201c The Karabakh Diary \u201d concerned the PERSON massacre of CARDINAL DATE .

Specifically , the article contained the following passages :", "\u201c Having seen PERSON , I could not hide my astonishment . This NORP town , which had been razed to the ground , has been completely reconstructed and converted into a town called GPE , named after an NORP general who had actively participated in the occupation of PERSON . The PERSON tragedy and the deep wounds inflicted on our soul by the NORP expansionism on this long - suffering NORP land permeated all my meetings in GPE [ a town in GPE - Karabakh close to PERSON ] . How so ? Can it be true that nothing human is left in these people ? However , for the sake of fairness I will admit that DATE I met some refugees from PERSON , temporarily settled in GPE , who openly confessed to me that , on the eve of the large - scale offensive of the NORP and NORP troops on PERSON , the town had been encircled [ by those troops ] . And even DATE prior to the attack , the NORP had been continuously warning the population about the planned operation through loudspeakers and suggesting that the civilians abandon the town and escape from the encirclement through a humanitarian corridor along the ORG . According to the PERSON refugees ' own words , they had used this corridor and , indeed , the NORP soldiers positioned behind the corridor had not opened fire on them . Some soldiers from the battalions of the ORG [ ORG , a political party ] , for some reason , had led part of the [ refugees ] in the direction of the village of GPE , which during that period had been under the control of the NORP ' LOC battalion . The other group of refugees were hit by artillery volleys [ while they were reaching ] GPE .", "When I was in GPE , I spoke to the deputy head of the administration of GPE , PERSON , and compared his recollection of the events with that of the PERSON inhabitants who came under fire from the NORP side .", "I asked PERSON to show me the corridor which the PERSON inhabitants had used [ to abandon the town ] . Having familiarised myself with the geographical area , I can say , fully convinced , that the conjectures that there had been no NORP corridor are groundless . The corridor did indeed exist , otherwise the PERSON inhabitants , fully surrounded [ by the enemy troops ] and isolated from the outside world , would not have been able to force their way out and escape the encirclement . However , having crossed the area behind the Kar - Kar River , the row of refugees was separated and , for some reason , a group of [ them ] headed in the direction of PERSON .

DATE after the publication of the above article , during the period from DATE to DATE , a person registered under the username \u201c PERSON \u201d , identifying himself as the applicant , made a number of postings on the publicly accessible Internet forum of a website called AzeriTriColor .

Ms Chaladze attributed the authorship of the Internet forum postings made from the forum account with the username \u201c ORG Fatullayev \u201d to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions to the court , the applicant argued that the forum postings at the AzeriTriColor website had not been written by him and denied making these statements . He also argued that , in \u201c The Karabakh Diary \u201d , he had merely reported the information given to him by persons whom he had interviewed .", "CARDINAL .

In view of the above findings , on DATE ORG upheld PERSON claim and ordered the applicant to publish , in GPE and on related websites , a retraction of his statements and an apology to the refugees from PERSON and the newspaper 's readers .

The court heard a linguistic expert who gave an opinion on the applicant 's statements .

He also noted that it was difficult to analyse separately the specific phrases taken out of the context of the article as a whole , and that it appeared from the context that the author had attempted to convey the positions of both sides to the conflict . The court also heard several witnesses who testified about the PERSON events and stated that there had been no escape corridor for the civilians and that the civilians had been shot at from the enemy 's positions . The court further found that the Internet forum of the AzeriTriColor website , in essence , had replaced the Internet forum of the Realny Azerbaijan website , which had become defunct in DATE , and that the statements posted on that forum under the username \u201c PERSON \u201d had indeed been made by the applicant himself . Lastly , the court found that , through his statements made in \u201c The Karabakh Diary \u201d and his Internet forum postings , the applicant had given a heavily distorted account of the historical events in PERSON and had deliberately disseminated false information which had damaged the reputation of the plaintiffs and had accused the soldiers of ORG ( specifically , the CARDINAL plaintiffs who had fought in PERSON ) of committing grave crimes which they had not committed .

This analytical article was devoted to the possible consequences of GPE 's support for a recent \u201c anti - NORP \u201d resolution of ORG ( ORG ) ORG , which had called for economic sanctions against that country . The article referred to the current NORP government as \u201c the PERSON clan \u201d and \u201c the governing Family \u201d and expressed the view that the government had sought GPE ( GPE ) support for President PERSON 's \u201c remaining in power \u201d in GPE in exchange for GPE 's support for the GPE \u201c aggression \u201d against GPE .", "CARDINAL . The article continued as follows :", "\u201c It is also known that , immediately after the ORG [ ORG ] had voted for this resolution , [ the authorities ] in GPE began to seriously prepare for the beginning of the ' anti - NORP operation ' .

After DATE GPE , having openly supported the anti - NORP operation , must prepare for a lengthy and dreadful war which will result in large - scale destruction and loss of human life . According to information from sources close to official GPE , ORG has already developed its military plans concerning GPE in the event that GPE takes part in the aggression against GPE .

Further , it was noted in the article that ORG should have maintained neutrality in its relations with both the GPE and GPE , and that its support of the GPE position could lead , in the event of a war between those GPE , to such grave consequences as loss of human life among NORP in both GPE and GPE . In this connection , the author noted that the GPE military forces were already operating CARDINAL airbases on the territory of GPE and had expressed an interest in operating FAC , which was then operated by GPE .", "CARDINAL . The article also discussed the issue of possible unrest , in the event of a conflict with GPE , in the southern regions of GPE populated by the PERSON ethnic minority , who are ethnically and linguistically close to the NORP . Among other things , the article appeared to imply that the current ruling elite , a large number of whom allegedly came from the region of GPE , was engaging in regional nepotism by appointing people from GPE to government posts in southern areas of the country , including the GPE region . In particular , the article stated :", "\u201c Thus , the PERSON have long been expressing their discontent with the fact that [ the central authorities ] always appoint to administrative positions in GPE persons hailing from GPE who are alien to the mentality and problems of the region . ...

A matter of urgency : the decriminalisation of defamation", "CARDINAL . At the time of the Commissioner 's visit , it was reported that there were CARDINAL journalists in prison , out of whom CARDINAL were for libel or defamation under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Both international monitoring bodies and local NGOs claimed that charging individuals for defamation was used as a means to avoid the dissemination of news that could be detrimental to high - ranking officials or to other influential people . According to the parliamentary assembly of ORG , the number of charges has grown in DATE . Out of fear of imprisonment journalists are compelled to resort to self - censorship . In DATE , the President , Mr PERSON had called for abandoning the use of criminal provisions in matters of defamation , but this was not respected . Some cases , which the Commissioner was informed about point to abusive or unfair imprisonment of journalists .", "CARDINAL . ... Indeed , many journalists remain incarcerated . Mr PERSON , who was held at the pre - trial detention centres on the LOC of ORG is still incarcerated . This journalist had criticised the authorities ' and armed forces ' conduct during the siege of PERSON . His critical analysis of the handling of the crisis cost him DATE sentence for libel . Furthermore , in a concerning stacking of incriminations , he was sentenced on DATE to CARDINAL and a half years , this time on charges of terrorism and incitement to racial hatred . When this journalist met the Commissioner , he said that the fact that he had been jailed was evidence of political pressure on him as a journalist . After the decision on this second sentence , he reiterated this comment . The Commissioner mentioned his imprisonment for libel to the authorities and called for his immediate release . The Commissioner once again urges the authorities to release Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The authorities ' response to questions regarding this issue is that actions against journalists are caused by their lack of professionalism , which leads them to writing in a non - responsible manner and ignoring their legal and ethical duties . There should indeed be proper training and education of journalists , who have a responsibility in the exercise of their profession and should follow a code of ethics in line with NORP standards . At the same time , officials should allow easy access to information and accept criticism inherent to their position of accountability in society .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the fundamental issue here is whether people , in particular but not only journalists , should be deprived of liberty and other criminal law consequences on account of views expressed . The supplementary issue , as already dealt with , is whether , where it still exists as an offence under criminal law , as it is the case in GPE , the prosecution of defamation does not in fact lead to instances of abusive prosecution and/or excessive sentences . There is clearly a general trend to move towards a decriminalisation of defamation in LOC DATE . International standards allow the penalisation of defamation through criminal law but only in cases of hate speech directly intended at inciting violence . To corroborate the requirement of intention , there has to be a direct link between the intention and the likeliness of the violence . ... In most countries , the criminal route is not used : there is a moratorium on such laws . The criminalisation of defamation has a chilling effect on freedom of expression . The legal framework in GPE provides for a wide range of possibilities for criminalisation , notably for ' damage to honour and reputation ' . Work on a draft law on defamation has been going on for DATE , involving a working group of parliamentarians and media experts , with the support of the LOC . Emphasis would be shifted from criminal law to civil law .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner was encouraged by talks he had on this issue with the Minister of ORG . He recommends the launching of an open public debate that would help define a rights - based approach that would remove defamation from the criminal books and offer alternative protection to other rights and interests . ORG experts could provide assistance in that respect . In order to support the holding of that debate , the President could reiterate his DATE declaration on a moratorium on the use of the criminal provision . The Commissioner recommends , as a first step , the release of all those , who have been criminally prosecuted under the relevant provisions of the criminal code . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
