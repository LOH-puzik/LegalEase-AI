On DATE Mr Beldjoudi added to his supplementary memorial .

Mr Beldjoudi appealed to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat on DATE , asking it to quash the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and set aside the order of CARDINAL DATE as being ultra vires .", "CARDINAL . The Government Commissioner ( commissaire du ORG ) , Mr PERSON , made the following submissions :", "\" The majority of the grounds of appeal should not keep you long . CARDINAL of them , however , should induce you to re - examine , and in our opinion to amend , your case - law on a point which is of considerable importance .", "...", "According to the appellant , the deportation order against him is in breach of LAW article CARDINAL) [ of the LAW ] , as it constitutes an excessive interference with his family life . PERSON has been married to a NORP since DATE . He had thus been so married for DATE at the time of the decision appealed against .", "In the current state of your case - law this ground of appeal would have to be dismissed as ineffective .", "Thus in a decision of DATE , GPE , [ PERSON , tables ] , p. CARDINAL , and ORG [ ORG p\u00e9riodique ] CARDINAL.II.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , note PERSON , your court held that an alien ` can not to any effect rely on ... the provisions of LAW article CARDINAL) of ORG ... in support of his submissions asking for the deportation order against him to be set PERSON . Making the same point , but expressed slightly differently , the ORG judgment of DATE found that LAW article CARDINAL) of ORG did not prevent exercise of the power conferred on the Minister of the ORG by LAW , and dismissed the ground of appeal without further consideration ( appeal no . DATE ) .", "Whatever the position may be on these uncertainties , we will suggest to you DATE that you definitely abandon the solution laid down in the GPE ben Abdeslem judgment and adopt an entirely new approach to the question before us .", "There are CARDINAL principal reasons why we suggest this new approach to you .", "The first reason is a negative one . It is that we do not really see what can justify the radically unfavourable answer given in DATE .", "You surely did not intend to deny LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW its character as a provision which is directly applicable in the domestic legal order . All your case - law is consistent as to the direct effect of LAW , nor does the actual wording of the ORG judgment in any way suggest such an ORG , as LAW article CARDINAL) was not rejected as such , but only with reference to the removal of aliens .", "Was it your intention rather to apply the technique of the \u2018 screen law\u2019 , considering that as the law gives a complete and exclusive definition of the legal conditions for deportation , the addition of supplementary conditions derived from international agreements would amount to disregarding the legislature \u2019s intention ? If that was the reason for your decision at the time , it would clearly no longer be applicable DATE , following your plenary court decision of DATE in the PERSON case , according to which treaties take precedence over laws , even if the laws postdate them . But we doubt whether this was the explanation of your decision in PERSON : the decision related to a DATE deportation order ; but at that time the relevant internal legislation was not subsequent but prior to GPE \u2019s ratification of the Convention , and the \u2018 screen law\u2019 theory explanation is thus not tenable .", "More simply , it seems probable to us that you considered that a deportation order was not in itself an interference with the alien \u2019s family life : if the alien has family ties on NORP territory , nothing prevents the other members of the family group leaving GPE with him . But this is a very theoretical way of looking at things . It is no doubt correct that in certain cases there is nothing to prevent the family leaving NORP territory ; but in other cases , especially if the alien has a spouse or children of NORP nationality , it may be difficult on practical or even legal grounds for the other members of the family to follow him , with the effect that the expulsion measure jeopardises the pursuit of an ordinary family life . In any event , it is in our opinion not possible to state that a deportation measure can never of itself be capable of interfering with the family life of the person concerned , and there is no reason to dismiss a priori as ineffective a ground of appeal based on DATE ( article CARDINAL) .", "There is a second reason which supports us in this view : your case - law is not at all in harmony with that developed by ORG in DATE .", "In the PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE ORG defined for the first time the possible impact of LAW article CARDINAL) on expulsion measures against aliens . The substance of its decision was that where the alien has real family ties in the territory of the ORG in which he is resident and the expulsion measure is such as to jeopardise the maintenance of those ties , the measure is justified with regard to LAW only if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued , in other words , if the interference with family life which follows from it is not excessive with respect to the public interest to be protected . This balance between the public and private interests induced the ORG to find in the PERSON case that there had been a violation of the Convention by the GPE , with respect to an alien who was the father of a child born of a ( dissolved ) marriage with a GPE woman and who had been refused renewal of his residence permit for purely economic reasons , reasons which were indeed legitimate , but which led in the particular case to consequences whose seriousness was not proportionate to the public interest pursued .", "Such an intellectual approach ought not to disconcert you , and we see nothing to prevent you henceforth adopting it as yours with reference to the deportation of aliens , provided of course that LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW is in fact pleaded .", "Reviewing proportionality is among your tried and tested techniques , and the concept of a balance to be struck between divergent public and private interests is certainly not unfamiliar to you , since you constantly make use of it in certain contexts . Admittedly , the field of deportation has until now been dominated rather by the concept of discretionary power and its corollary of a limited power of review restricted to manifest abuse of discretion . But even in this field you carry out a complete review where the statutory provisions require this - as in the case of the concepts of \u2018 absolute FAC and \u2018 compelling necessity for national NORP which exceptionally permit the expulsion of aliens belonging to categories who in principle are protected against such a measure , under the legislation in force after DATE - and in our opinion the same should apply in the case of the application of LAW article CARDINAL) of the Convention .", "Furthermore - and here we come to our final argument - maintaining your case - law as in GPE PERSON would have the awkward consequence of making appeals to the GPE institutions directly available to aliens who were the subject of a deportation order and complained of an interference with their family life , without their being obliged first to have recourse to the domestic courts .", "For it is a known fact that , according to the consistent case - law of ORG , the rule that domestic remedies must first be exhausted , which under LAW article CARDINAL ) of the LAW is a condition of admissibility of individual applications submitted to the ORG , must be understood as imposing on an applicant the obligation only to have prior recourse to domestic remedies which have a reasonable chance of success , having regard in particular to the case - law of the highest courts , with the effect that a definite line of case- law excluding a priori the taking into account of LAW article CARDINAL) of the ORG would entitle an alien to take his claims directly to the NORP institutions .", "The present case is a perfect illustration of this . Without waiting for you to give a decision and hence before having exhausted all possible domestic remedies , PERSON lodged with ORG an application complaining of a violation of LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW which he claimed to be the victim of . Despite the proceedings still pending before you , ORG declared the application admissible in a decision of DATE , referring in particular to your GPE ben GPE decision .", "Further , after adopting its report , ORG referred the application to ORG , and the same case is thus simultaneously pending before you and before ORG , which will no doubt give a decision DATE . This is an exceptional situation , which can not be regarded as satisfactory or normal with respect to the control machinery set up by ORG , which is based on the concept of the subsidiarity of control by the NORP institutions to control by the domestic courts .", "The only way to avoid such a situation occurring again , and indeed to avoid the domestic courts losing jurisdiction altogether in favour of ORG , consists in you yourselves reviewing compliance with LAW article CARDINAL) rather than leaving this task to the GPE institutions , whom incidentally you would not be doing a favour by allowing applicants immediate access to them .", "If you agree with us on this question of principle , you will then have to make a decision on CARDINAL points in the present case : firstly , does the deportation of PERSON constitute an \u2018 interference\u2019 with his \u2018 right to respect for his family life\u2019 , to use the language of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL) ? Secondly , is this \u2018 interference\u2019", "We suggest that you answer both questions in the affirmative .", "In our opinion , it can not be doubted that the deportation of the applicant jeopardises his family life to a certain extent .", "No doubt the possibility can not be excluded of his NORP spouse being able to follow him abroad , which in practice means to GPE . But it must be admitted that that would not be easy , and that legal and practical obstacles could make it difficult for the couple to restart life abroad .", "However , the serious nature of the offences committed by the applicant appears to us to justify the deportation order issued against him , and the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life is in the instant case not disproportionate to the threat to public order which the applicant \u2019s presence on NORP territory represented on DATE , the date for you to have reference to .", "We are indeed far removed from the circumstances which gave rise to the above - mentioned PERSON judgment .", "From DATE , when he was DATE , PERSON committed various offences for which he received various convictions : assault and battery , driving a vehicle without a licence , carrying a prohibited weapon .", "Above all , on DATE he gained entry at TIME , together with accomplices , to the residence of CARDINAL people who were subjected to violence by the criminals in order to steal their savings . For these acts the applicant was convicted on DATE and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated theft .", "In these circumstances , the decision taken with respect to him in DATE does not appear to us to have been disproportionate to the aim pursued , or to be excessive even having regard to the family consequences it has for the applicant .", "In CARDINAL pan of the scales one must place the public interest in the removal of an individual who is a serious threat to the safety of persons and property . In the other pan one must bear in mind the difficulties Mr Beldjoudi and his wife ( the couple have no children ) would have in resettling abroad without damaging their family life . It seems to us that the balance is tilted towards the public interest .", "We would not have any doubt in reaching this conclusion , had not ORG Rights - as it is now necessary to mention - adopted an opposite position , in the report it drew up on this case under LAW para . CARDINAL ( LAW and which it referred to ORG together with the application .", "The Commission was of the opinion , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that the deportation of PERSON constituted a violation of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL) .", "The greatest regard must of course be had to such an opinion , but it must , however , not be forgotten that it is only an opinion , albeit a highly authoritative one and deserving of respect , as the ORG in a sense fulfils for the ORG the same function as the ORG Commissioner before your court ; this is a sufficient indication of its importance , but the ORG is not obliged to follow it ; and in the past the ORG has on several occasions differed from the GPE \u2019s opinion .", "We for our part are unable to agree with the ORG \u2019s reasoning . It is clear from reading its report that it based itself not so much on PERSON matrimonial ties , as on the fact that the applicant was born in GPE , has always lived there , appears not to have personal ties with GPE , and does not know the LANGUAGE language and that , in the words of the Commission , \u2018 the nationality link , though a legal reality , in no way reflects the real situation in human PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "We appreciate the significance in human terms of these facts . Under the DATE legislation they might perhaps have protected Mr Beldjoudi against deportation , despite the seriousness of the offences committed by him . But they appear to us to have nothing to do with the concept of \u2018 family life\u2019 protected by LAW , or with that of \u2018 private life\u2019 , which CARDINAL members of the Commission , in a concurring but separate opinion annexed to the report , suggested as a better basis for a finding of a violation of DATE ( article CARDINAL) .", "In fact , what the Commission intended to protect was not the applicant \u2019s \u2018 family life\u2019 or \u2018 private life\u2019 but rather his personal life and social life . But that seems to us to be outside the scope of the LAW relied on .", "We add for the sake of completeness of information that the deportation of PERSON has not actually been enforced and that the authorities have , in a spirit of conciliation , assigned him to compulsory residence in LOC department , where he still is .", "For all these reasons , we submit that the appeal should be dismissed . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat ruled in accordance with the above submissions , and gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\" The technical correctness of the judgment appealed against", "Considering , firstly , that contrary to what the appellant maintains , the judgment appealed against did not omit to rule on the ground of appeal based on the application of LAW of the Order of DATE ;", "Considering , secondly , that it follows from a judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , given prior to the judgment appealed against , that the appellant is of NORP nationality ; that ORG was thus rightly able to regard the question of nationality , on which it had by an earlier judgment adjourned a decision , as having been settled and to give no decision on the ground of appeal based on Mr PERSON \u2019s NORP nationality , abandoned by him ;", "The lawfulness of the Minister of the ORG \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE", "Considering that PERSON , who did not raise any ground of appeal before ORG relating to the outward legality of the order for his deportation , is in any event not entitled to raise for the first time on appeal arguments based on the lack of reasons in the opinion of ORG , the order pronouncing deportation and the letter notifying it , which are based on legal grounds different from those on which his application at first instance was based ;", "Considering that according to section [ CARDINAL ] of the Order of DATE , in the wording in force at the time of the decision appealed against , prior to the PERSON of DATE , \u2018 deportation may be ordered by an order of the Minister of the ORG if the alien \u2019s presence on NORP territory constitutes a threat to public order or public finance\u2019 ; that it can be seen from the documents in the case - file that the aforesaid measure was taken by the Minister of the Interior after he had taken into consideration not only the criminal convictions pronounced against PERSON but also the totality of PERSON conduct ; that it is thus not tainted by error of law ;", "Considering that under LAW article CARDINAL) of ORG , \u2018 CARDINAL .
