The first and second applicants are spouses and the other applicants are their children . During the relevant period they all shared the same household .", "CARDINAL . In the period DATE and DATE the first applicant was the head of the NORP district police department .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an inspection commission from ORG ( \u201c the Commission \u201d ) , acting in accordance with an order of the Minister of the ORG ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) , inspected the police department and informed the first applicant that his office and home had been subjected to covert surveillance by his inferiors . DATE the covert surveillance was terminated and the surveillance equipment removed . CARDINAL officers of the same department , PERSON , chief of ORG , PERSON , chief of ORG , and PERSON , chief of ORG , were dismissed in connection with the incident .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE ORG established that on DATE PERSON had informed the Minister that he suspected the first applicant of links with criminal groups . On DATE Mr S.B. and Mr I.I. had requested a warrant for covert surveillance of the first applicant \u2019s home and office . The chairman of ORG had issued the warrant on DATE and authorised CARDINAL operations : surveillance of the applicants\u2019 home in the period DATE and DATE , and of the first applicant \u2019s office in the period DATE and DATE . The surveillance had started on DATE without the requisite written authorisation of the Minister . ORG did not draw any conclusion as to the lawfulness of the surveillance as such but limited the scope of its inspection to the conduct of the involved police officers . According to its report , PERSON and PERSON had committed serious breaches of the disciplinary rules in order to discredit the first applicant . It was further noted that some of the information gathered during the surveillance constituted a state secret which PERSON had not been authorised to know . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the case revealed insufficient control by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the ORG reported the case to the military prosecuting authorities , in whom the power to investigate criminal offences committed by police officers was vested at the relevant time . There is no information as to whether the latter took any action .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG quashed the dismissal of PERSON and PERSON in proceedings classified as confidential .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested ORG to open an investigation into the incident . On DATE criminal proceedings were opened . The military investigator questioned the suspects and a number of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In his explanations , PERSON claimed that the Minister had given his consent for covert surveillance of the first applicant during a meeting between them on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister stated that PERSON and PERSON had not informed him that they had requested surveillance measures against the first applicant . They had sent him several envelopes containing information but he had forwarded them to another officer without opening them . It was DATE that he had learned about the surveillance of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to witness statements , following the inspection members of ORG had put the material obtained from the surveillance in a cardboard box and taken it away . The head of ORG at ORG stated that the material had not been received in that department and that he was not aware of its whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr S.B. and PERSON were charged with an offence under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a civil claim for damages in the context of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from the GPE district military prosecutor \u2019s office terminated the proceedings and discontinued the first applicant \u2019s civil claim . He noted that the Minister had not approved the requests for secret surveillance in respect of the first applicant . However , during the inspection of CARDINAL DATE the surveillance had been discontinued and the intelligence thus obtained had been delivered to the Chief Secretary of ORG and had later been destroyed . The prosecutor therefore found that the first applicant had not suffered any damage , as the intelligence gathered had been destroyed . He further found that Mr S.B. and PERSON had acted in accordance with LAW , which only required the Minister to be informed about secret surveillance in urgent cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He indicated several allegedly unclear points , among which : the reason why the case had been considered urgent ; whether PERSON and PERSON I.I. were competent to request the application of secret surveillance and the reasons for considering that no surveillance had taken place between CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG quashed the appealed order for lack of sufficient reasoning and remitted the case for further investigation . It noted that the public prosecutor had not explained why he deemed that there had been a situation of urgency justifying the application of section CARDINAL of the ORG , nor why the CARDINAL accused had failed to inform the Minister immediately , as the ORG required . It went on to hold that the possible surveillance of the first applicant for DATE after the expiration of the permission had also not been investigated .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator questioned the CARDINAL accused . They stated that they had sent the requests to the Minister for approval on DATE , together with some of the material gathered .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor from the GPE district military prosecutor \u2019s office again terminated the proceedings . He found that the Minister had given oral permission for surveillance of the first applicant on DATE . The CARDINAL accused had sent him the first envelope containing intelligence on DATE . The requests for covert surveillance had been sent on DATE together with the second portion of intelligence . The last envelope had been sent on DATE . He found that while the Minister had not approved the secret surveillance in writing , he had in any event given oral permission and the CARDINAL accused had acted pursuant to section CARDINAL of the ORG . The prosecutor noted that the Minister denied having given any oral permission for secret surveillance . However , he assumed that the Minister must have known about it , as the first results from it had been sent to him in DATE . The prosecutor further found that in the period DATE secret surveillance was indeed still deployed , as time had been necessary for their dismantling , but no intelligence had been gathered during this period . He also held that although the Minister had not been informed immediately , this was a trivial breach of the procedure which did not amount to a criminal offence as no damage had been inflicted on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed further , reiterating his arguments and emphasising the Commission \u2019s finding that on DATE his office was still under secret surveillance .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and terminated the proceedings . It relied on the prosecutor \u2019s findings , and held that the accused officers had acted in accordance with the law and that the first applicant had not suffered any damage from their actions . PERSON and Mr. PERSON had been dismissed on disciplinary grounds , but ORG had quashed the dismissal and ordered their reinstatement , thus finding that their actions had been lawful . The court also held that the case had been urgent as it had concerned the head of LOC and that no secret surveillance had taken place outside the permitted time - limit .", "CARDINAL . According to the information made available to the ORG , no investigation was ever opened against the first applicant in connection with any criminal activity or unlawful conduct .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant initiated private criminal proceedings against PERSON and PERSON for insult and libel , and joined a civil claim for damages , in relation to allegedly insulting statements made by them on a local radio station and in a newspaper in DATE relating to his personality and his work as head of LOC .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG acquitted the defendants of the charges of insult and found them guilty of libel , sentencing them to a fine . It also awarded damages to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed this judgment for breaches of procedure and remitted the case for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . In a court hearing on DATE the ORG terminated the proceedings , as the statutory limitation period for the offences had expired . The court did not rule on the civil claim , as it found that after the remittal the first applicant should have been designated a civil claimant again . This had not been possible however as no hearing on the merits had taken place after the remittal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant brought a civil action against PERSON and PERSON for insult and libel . In a judgment of DATE ORG partly allowed the action . On appeal on CARDINAL DATE the ORG quashed that judgment , holding that the first applicant had not proved that he had sustained any non - pecuniary damage in connection with the GPE statements . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG , with similar reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW of DATE are :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Under LAW of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , as in force at the relevant time , only several exhaustively listed bodies , including the regional directorates of ORG , could request the use of special means of surveillance and draw on the intelligence obtained thereby ( section CARDINAL of the SSMA ) . Section CARDINAL of the ORG specified that it was the head of the respective service who could start the procedure for deploying such measures by lodging a written application with the relevant court .", "CARDINAL . After a judicial warrant had been issued , the Minister of the ORG or a deputy minister designated in writing by the Minister was to make a written order for the deployment of special means of surveillance ( section CARDINAL ) . In urgent cases the deployment could start immediately upon the issue of the judicial warrant ( section CARDINAL ) . However , in that case the Minister or the deputy minister was to be informed immediately ( ibid . ) .

GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG and PERSON ( cited above ) , on DATE the Government laid before ORG a bill for the amendment of the ORG . The explanatory notes to the bill referred to the above - mentioned judgment and to the need to bring the LAW in line with the requirements of the LAW . The bill was enacted on DATE and came into force on DATE . Along with a host of other changes , the amendment created ORG , an independent body whose task was to oversee the services authorised to use such means . On DATE ORG adopted further amendments to the LAW , abolishing the ORG and replacing it with a special parliamentary commission vested with similar competence . Its powers included inspecting the LOC where the information or documents connected with covert surveillance were kept or disposed of , requesting information from the bodies using surveillance measures , reporting to the ORG , and making recommendations on the work of the competent bodies . It could also inform individuals , under certain conditions , that unlawful surveillance measures had been applied in respect of them .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the manufacture , use , sale and retention of special technical means for secret gathering of information without authorisation received in accordance with the law is an offence . The offence is aggravated if it is committed by an official in connection with his or her duties .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides that the abuse and excess of power and failure to carry out duties associated with an office held , resulting in damage being inflicted , is an offence .", "CARDINAL .
