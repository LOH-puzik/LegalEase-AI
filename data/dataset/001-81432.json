{"ITEMID": "001-81432", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ISL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF SARA LIND EGGERTSD\u00d3TTIR v. ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was born at ORG ( hereinafter referred to as the ORG ) in PERSON , which was a ORG hospital . Soon after her birth it became clear that she was severely handicapped both physically and mentally . Her disability is assessed at PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant 's parents complained to ORG , who in DATE concluded that the child had not been given improper treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's parents , who were represented by a lawyer , then brought proceedings on her behalf against ORG in LOC . Their arguments can be described as twofold . Firstly , a mistake had been committed in the delivery room in that the doctors had reacted too late to hypoxia despite its having been diagnosed directly on the mother 's arrival there . Secondly , paediatricians had made a mistake when attending to the child immediately after birth . The parents alleged that a catheter inserted into the child 's umbilical artery had been abnormally bent to a U - shape and left that way for TIME . This had been capable of causing the damage that had occurred to the child 's health . Instead the doctors should have partially withdrawn the catheter until it straightened out or , if that was not possible , inserted it into a limb .", "CARDINAL . The respondent requested ORG to dismiss the applicant 's claim , maintaining that the damage she had suffered to her health was a result of hypoxia during pregnancy , before the mother 's arrival at the labour ward of the ORG , and that no additional damage could be linked to any possible mistakes on the part of hospital staff . The applicant was already in a serious condition when delivery was performed by caesarean section , by which time hypoxia had already caused arterial thrombosis . The position of the catheter had therefore not caused the damage to the applicant 's health .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting with one professional judge and CARDINAL lay judges , CARDINAL of whom was a paediatrician and the other a gynaecologist and obstetrician , heard extensive evidence from all the hospital personnel involved and from experts .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the first claim described above but upheld the second claim and found the ORG liable to pay compensation to the applicant . It awarded her CARDINAL NORP Crowns ( ORG ) in compensation ( ORG CARDINAL for pecuniary damage and ISK CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage ) , plus interest , as well as certain sums for legal costs , to be held by her parents on her behalf . Its reasoning on the merits included the following passages :", "\u201c By reference to the foregoing the court concludes that proof has not been adduced to show that the plaintiff 's disability was solely due to her illness following thrombosis of the aorta and the renal arteries . On the other hand , there is a significant probability that her illness following the said thrombosis at least contributed to the serious brain damage she suffered , which caused her disability and non - financial loss . Whether the plaintiff had already suffered brain damage , and the extent to which her illness may have added to that damage , is impossible to ascertain .", "In view of the plaintiff 's difficult situation as regards proof and of the rules of evidence that must be regarded as having been formed in this field of the law of compensation , the onus must be on the defendant to prove that the brain damage from which the plaintiff now suffers would have occurred even if the defendant 's employees had not made the mistake of letting the catheter remain in a U - shape in her aorta for TIME . As the defendant must , in the light of the foregoing , be considered not to have succeeded in adducing such proof , the court accepts the plaintiff 's view that the conditions that would render the defendant liable to pay compensation on account of her disability and non - financial loss are fulfilled .", "It is not possible on the basis of the available evidence and the above rule of evidence to endorse the defendant 's view that only a small part of the disability can be traced to her illness caused by thrombosis of the aorta and the renal arteries . As it has not been demonstrated whether or to what extent the damage to the plaintiff 's health was due to other causes , the defendant is deemed liable for her entire loss . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Solicitor General appealed against the above judgment to ORG . In support thereof , he filed CARDINAL statements by certain named doctors of ORG commenting on ORG judgment and criticising its conclusion . The statements had been addressed to the ORG 's Chief Medical Executive , who apparently had endorsed them and forwarded them to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG initially scheduled the oral hearing for DATE , but on DATE informed the applicant 's lawyer and ORG that it had adjourned the hearing pending an opinion it intended to request from ORG ( SMLB ) . On this occasion ORG gave the parties an opportunity to indicate the questions they would like to be put to the SMLB .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , by a letter of DATE , the applicant 's lawyer protested , in particular , against ORG decision to seek the SMLB 's opinion without having first offered the parties an opportunity to express their views on the measure . It was noted that , pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG , many doctors associated with the ORG , where the disputed medical services had been provided , had a seat on ORG . Moreover , ORG had already expressed his views on the matter and was therefore disqualified from any further involvement . The lawyer also protested against any consideration of the matter by the hospital 's employees , and demanded their withdrawal .", "In the event that ORG were to decide , despite the applicant 's protest , to proceed to ask the SMLB for an opinion , the applicant 's lawyer specified CARDINAL items for questions that he wished to be put to the SMLB .", "CARDINAL . ORG replied on DATE that it found no reason not to ask for the SMLB 's opinion but that it would consider the applicant 's proposal regarding the questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Solicitor General indicated CARDINAL questions which he thought should be put to the SMLB , but did not comment on the appropriateness of asking the SMLB for an opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG formally decided to obtain an opinion from the SMLB on CARDINAL questions relating to the matter in dispute , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c It was difficult to ascertain from the evidence and testimonies submitted what the cause of the [ applicant 's ] injury was , added to which some points were not as clear as would have been desirable . It was therefore deemed proper , before the case were tried by ORG , to obtain the opinion of ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and to seek answers on certain points since , according to LAW , it is the SMLB 's role to provide the courts with opinions on medical matters . \u201d", "In connection with the above ORG drew particular attention to the applicant 's request of DATE for the withdrawal of certain members .", "CARDINAL . The SMLB was composed of ORG ( GPE ) of GPE , as chair , and CARDINAL other members .", "CARDINAL . The SMLB delivered its opinion on DATE . It found that at the maternity ward an abnormal foetal monitor printout had been reacted to belatedly . On the other hand , there was no reason to criticise the child 's treatment at the paediatric clinic following birth . ORG considered that the positioning of the catheter had not caused blood coagulation and that no mistake had been made concerning the manner in which it was placed . Thus , ORG differed from ORG on points that were material for establishing liability to pay compensation .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the ORG 's own procedure , the matter had first been referred direct to its ORG composed of ORG members , all of whom were employees at ORG and decided that they were not disqualified . ORG had sought CARDINAL opinions on the applicant 's birth , DATE by a consultant surgeon and member of ORG on the child 's case history after birth , and the other by an external obstetrician on the mother 's pregnancy and the child 's birth .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting held on DATE , the SMLB had discussed and unanimously approved the CARDINAL doctors ' opinions and adopted its final opinion that was transmitted to ORG . The session had been presided over by one of ORG CARDINAL members , who had replaced the SMLB 's Chair who had withdrawn on account of his previous involvement with the case as the Medical Director of GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the oral hearing on DATE before ORG , the applicant 's lawyer complained of the procedure before the SMLB , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL March CARDINAL ORG overturned ORG finding that the ORG was liable to pay compensation to the applicant for negligence by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before turning to the merits , ORG dealt with the issue of disqualification :", "\u201c As regards the conclusion of the SMLB and its ORG , the respondent [ the applicant ] observes that doctors employed at ORG took part in handling the matter and bringing it to a conclusion ; that they , as employees of the appellant , were disqualified from doing so , and that consequently the SMLB 's opinion was to be entirely disregarded .", "As noted above , it is the role of the SMLB to provide the courts with opinions on medical matters . The situation in GPE is such that most experts in the field of medical science are employed at ORG . Of the SMLB 's CARDINAL members CARDINAL are employed at the hospital , but none of the members taking part in this matter is employed at the department of obstetrics and gynaecology , nor at the ORG paediatric hospital , and none was involved with the treatment of the respondent 's illness , or of her mother . Furthermore , none of them is a member of the hospital 's highest management , which has taken a stand with respect to this matter in conformity with the opinion of the doctors of the departments of obstetrics and neonatology . It has not been demonstrated that the ORG 's handling of the case was contrary to LAW no . CARDINAL on the Procedure of the SMLB , or that the ORG 's resolution was influenced by any extraneous considerations . The ORG 's opinion and all other opinions provided in this case will have to be assessed in the light of the positions occupied by those who provide them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , ORG concluded :", "\u201c It is generally acknowledged that the use of arterial catheters may entail a danger of thrombosis . The respondent was dangerously ill and had been placed in a respirator , which demanded a monitoring of blood oxygen and acid / base levels and blood pressure , and the administration of fluids and drugs . The situation in which the doctors found themselves when they decided to leave the catheter alone must be kept in mind ; as noted above , this provided the only arterial access , as matters had developed . It has not been established that a catheter lying in a loop entails an increased risk of thrombosis .", "As explained above , the experts consider that the respondent 's brain damage was first and foremost due to hypoxia . The damage revealed by examinations of her brain is consistent with hypoxia , and it must be regarded as highly likely that this was the cause of her loss . Brain damage that might have followed thrombosis in DATE after the respondent 's birth would on the other hand have appeared as haemorrhage due to hypertension , but such brain damage is not extensive . It is not , therefore , possible to say that there is a causal relationship between the positioning of the catheter and the respondent 's brain damage . It has not been demonstrated that the respondent 's loss is traceable to a fault on the part of the appellant 's employees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government drew particular attention to the following provisions of LAW , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The judge shall in each case determine , by an assessment of the evidence adduced , whether an assertion relating to the facts at issue shall be regarded as proven , subject to any binding rules in this respect which may be expressly laid down by statute . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The parties shall collect evidence in so far as they are able to determine the subject matter of the action .
