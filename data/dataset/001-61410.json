{"ITEMID": "001-61410", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF STEUR v. NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He is a practising lawyer ( advocaat en procureur ) . He was not represented before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social security investigating officer ( sociaal rechercheur ) Mr PERSON took and recorded a statement from CARDINAL PERSON , a person of PERSON origin who was suspected of having unjustly received social security benefits and , in this context , of having committed forgery . PERSON was alone with Mr PERSON at the time and did not have the assistance of either a lawyer or an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , PERSON was prosecuted for social security fraud . In addition , civil proceedings were instituted against him by the social security authorities for the recovery of the excess benefits paid to him . The applicant acted as PERSON counsel in both sets of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the civil proceedings , the applicant declared , inter alia :", "\u201c The statement recorded in writing by Mr W. can not have been obtained in any other way than by the application of pressure in an unacceptable manner in order to procure incriminating statements , the significance of which was not or not sufficiently understood by PERSON given the absence of an interpreter . \u201d", "This passage appears in pleading notes submitted to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) at a hearing held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having learned of this statement in DATE , Mr PERSON filed a disciplinary complaint within the meaning of section CARDINALc of LAW ( GPE ) against the applicant to the PERSON ( deken ) of the local ORG ( PERSON ) . He complained that the applicant 's unfounded insinuations had tarnished his professional honour and good reputation , that the applicant had transgressed the limits of decency , and that the applicant had accused him obliquely of having committed perjury in drawing up the record in question .", "CARDINAL . Following an exchange of correspondence , the PERSON forwarded Mr PERSON 's complaint to ORG ( ORG ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG rejected as unfounded the complaint that the applicant had , in veiled terms , accused Mr PERSON of perjury . It did , however , consider that the applicant , by contending that Mr PERSON had exerted unacceptable pressure on PERSON , had made an assertion that was not supported by any facts . It concluded that the applicant had thus transgressed the limits of acceptable behaviour and failed to observe the standards expected from a lawyer ( \u201c ... PERSON het toelaatbare overschreden en heeft hij in strijd gehandeld met hetgeen een behoorlijk advocaat betaamt \u201d ) . Noting the nature and the limited degree of seriousness of the applicant 's conduct , ORG considered it sufficient to declare the complaint of Mr PERSON partially well - founded without imposing any sanction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ) . He submitted that PERSON had not had the assistance of a lawyer before he signed his written statement , despite having asked for a lawyer to be present , that no interpreter had been present at the interrogation , that PERSON was a drug addict and that he had told him that pressure had been brought to bear . The applicant also referred to a statement taken by the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) from PERSON on DATE , which reads as follows :", "\u201c In reply to the question why I stated to the police that I had lived together with my ex - wife during the relevant period ... I say that I was pressured during that interrogation .", "This pressure consisted of kicking against the table and kicking motions in my direction . I was also verbally abused .", "When it came to signing the statement , I asked for the chief , but he was said to have already gone home . I then asked for a lawyer because I wanted an interpreter to come and read my statement to me . The police said , however , that no lawyer could come . So in the end I just signed the statement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that in defending his client he should have been free to conclude , as he had , that his client 's confession could only have resulted from unacceptable pressure being brought to bear by the investigating officer . It would then have been for the court to which this conclusion was presented to decide whether or not it hat been established that such unacceptable pressure was in fact exerted . But it was not for a disciplinary tribunal to find that a statement made at a trial in defence of his client was unacceptable because it had not been sufficiently verified .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and upheld the decision of DATE in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . It noted that , in the civil proceedings involving PERSON , the allegation in issue had been made in the applicant 's submissions during the first - instance proceedings as well as in the proceedings on appeal before ORG ( in the latter proceedings in the course of a hearing held on DATE ) . It did not find it established that , at the material time , the applicant had in fact been informed by PERSON that he considered that unacceptable pressure had been exerted on him when PERSON took his statement . It further noted that the applicant 's contention had remained wholly unsubstantiated at the material time .", "CARDINAL . The Disciplinary Appeals Tribunal agreed with ORG that a lawyer was not entitled to express reproaches of the kind in issue without any factual support , which implied that a lawyer , prior to raising such allegations , should seek information from his client as to the circumstances constituting the unacceptable pressure allegedly exerted .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c Advocates shall be subject to disciplinary proceedings regarding any act or omission which is in breach of the due care they ought to exercise as advocates vis\u00e0vis those whose interests they look after , or ought to look after , any breach of the Regulations of the National Bar , and any act or omission not befitting a respectable advocate . This disciplinary justice is dispensed in the first instance by ORG , and , on appeal , by ORG , which is also the highest instance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A complaint against an advocate is submitted to the PERSON of the local ORG ( section CARDINALc(CARDINAL ) ) , who shall investigate it ( section CARDINALc(CARDINAL ) ) . He may forward it to ORG ( PERSON ) for further action ( section CARDINALc(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . If a friendly settlement can not be reached , the matter is referred to ORG by the ORG ( or ORG as the case may be ) , either at the request of the complainant or ex officio ( section CARDINALc(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINALd ) .", "CARDINAL . The sanctions available to ORG and ORG are : mere admonition ; reprimand ; suspension from practising for a period not exceeding DATE ; and disbarment ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Guidance on the nature of an \u201c act or omission not befitting a respectable advocate \u201d is found in LAW advocaten ) , the most recent version of which dates from DATE . Rule CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c Advocates should behave in such a way that confidence in the profession or in their own exercise of the profession is not harmed . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
