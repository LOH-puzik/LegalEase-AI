Under LAW , the judge can offset the legal costs between the parties when neither is entirely successful or when there are other equitable grounds therefor ( \u201c altri giusti motivi \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the code of civil procedure , a lawyer whose client is of poor means can declare to have advanced the costs and expenses of the proceedings on behalf of his client and not to have been paid his fees ( onorari ) , and can accordingly request that , if his client is successful and is thus entitled under LAW to be awarded legal costs , the court discharge the latter directly to the lawyer ( distrazione delle spese ) ( see , for example , PERSON , judgment No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL thus grants a special protection to the lawyer , who enters into a direct relationship with the opposite party and obtains an autonomous title . He can subsequently autonomously act against the losing party in order to recover his fees , costs and expenses .
