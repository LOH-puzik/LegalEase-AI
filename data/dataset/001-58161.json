From what illness should he be cured ?", "His social and affective environment will play a far greater role in his rehabilitation than any medical or psychiatric treatment , which he refuses .", "All things considered , his chances of rehabilitation appear to be considerably compromised by both his criminal record and his personality . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The conduct of the operation shows ( see the case file )", "( a ) that it was very well planned :", "- customers unaware that staff were being threatened ( raiders not masked ) , - \u2018 remarkable calm\u2019 of the raiders , who wore gloves and were armed , - booby - trapped bundles not stolen , - cash dispenser loaded for DATE , - raiders checked that security camera was a dummy .", "( b ) that it was the work of an experienced team :", "- numerous bank robberies committed according to the same pattern by the same men , - Mr PERSON is practically a weapons expert and has the advantage of the commando training he received when he did his national service in the marines .", "All Mr PERSON \u2019s major offences ( both past and present ) fall into the category of organised crime , sharing the following features :", "- formation of a criminal organisation , - aggravated robberies committed by armed criminals , - targets chosen to bring immediate , large gains .", "Mr PERSON is not a casual offender , but a real professional . In addition to hold - ups , it seems that his criminal activities have spread into new fields ( see the other charges ) . The back - up provided by his accomplices ( the gang ) is essential , as they provide both material support , in the form of vehicles , safe houses , alibis etc . , and moral support , since the recklessness of each member makes the group bolder and incites the others to repeat their crimes while controlling the risks better .", "Mr PERSON \u2019s responsibility is aggravated by many factors , for example :", "- he is a habitual reoffender , - he employs violence , threatening people with weapons , - he acts in association with accomplices \u2026", "At no time did LAW apply to him .", "Mr PERSON is always highly dangerous because of his sang - froid and his criminal determination . He showed his astuteness throughout the investigation \u2013 as he did when committing the offences DATE and during our interview , constantly denying that he took part in them . He can not be intimidated by the judiciary . His dangerousness even seems to be directed towards the judges investigating his cases .

A number of sentences have not been sufficient to attenuate his delinquent behaviour . On the contrary , he adopts an omnipotent and defiant attitude which is reinforced still further by his imprisonment . His sthenia ( aggressive attitude ) is unbounded . He feels invincible .", "Treatment by means of a criminal penalty is only a social - protection measure aimed at preventing the certain repetition of serious offences .", "Mr PERSON can never be rehabilitated . His allegiance to the world of organised crime seems irreversible . No sentence can be heavy enough to break his spirit ; he will always try to escape from prison or strengthen his links with other criminals there . He is certain to reoffend , as is proved by his criminal record . \u201d", "This report was served on the applicant on DATE .
