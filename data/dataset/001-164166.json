On DATE she was interviewed by the immigration authorities about her identity , nationality and travel route . On DATE she submitted corrections and additions ( correcties en aanvullingen ) to the report drawn up of the first interview ( eerste gehoor ) . On DATE , the applicant was interviewed about her reason for seeking asylum . On DATE she submitted corrections and additions to the report drawn up of the second interview ( nader gehoor ) . In the interviews she gave the following account .", "CARDINAL . She was of GPE ( ethnic NORP ) origin and came from PERSON , the capital of the GPE province in the east of the ORG . In DATE her father was killed in a fight with members of an angry crowd who had entered her family home in PERSON , screaming that the GPE should leave the country . The applicant \u2019s mother fled into the woods , together with the applicant and one of her sisters . Her older sister PERSON and CARDINAL of her brothers also fled , but after the incident she did not see them again . After the death of her father , the applicant and her remaining family were given a house and financial aid by PERSON , a friend of her father \u2019s . In DATE QUANTITY or CARDINAL men entered the applicant \u2019s home , initially looking for Banyamulenge men and boys . They did not find any .

On DATE the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON Minister \u201d ) notified the applicant of his intention ( voornemen ) to reject her asylum application .

The certificate , which concerned the applicant \u2019s loss of her voting card ( carte d\u2019\u00e9lecteur ) , was also found to be unauthentic in that it had not been drawn up by the competent authority . As the applicant gave incorrect statements about the document and continued to claim that it was authentic , the Minister found that serious doubts had arisen as to the applicant \u2019s claimed identity and nationality . The absence of any other travel or identity documents and her inability to give a consistent , detailed and verifiable account of her journey to the GPE further detracted from the credibility of her account . The Minister also considered it odd that for someone who had lived virtually her entire life in PERSON and who had gone to university , the applicant had hardly any basic knowledge about her hometown . For instance , she did not know the former colonial name of the town , who the mayor was , and that a \u201c khadafi \u201d is a petrol seller . She had to think about the name of the cathedral and anthem of the ORG , and she did not know the colour of car licence plates . The Minister therefore found it unlikely that the applicant actually came from PERSON . As she had failed to establish her identity , her asylum claim , which was based on her having lived in PERSON , was found to lack credibility .", "CARDINAL . NORP In written comments ( zienswijze ) made on DATE , the applicant maintained her account and gave explanations for her inability to answer certain questions about PERSON . She further requested to have a language analysis conducted to prove her origin .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of the same date the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application , confirming the finding that as she had failed to demonstrate her identity and nationality , her asylum claim lacked credibility .

On DATE , the Deputy Minister for Security and ORG ( Staatssecretaris PERSON ) adopted a moratorium on decisions on asylum applications and expulsions ( besluit- en vertrekmoratorium ) for asylum seekers of NORP origin hailing from the east of the ORG , including the provinces of GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The moratorium was lifted by the Deputy Minister on DATE . That policy decision , published in ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , was based on the contents of an official country assessment report ( ambtsbericht ) on the ORG released by the Minister of ORG on DATE . It was found in this report that there was no systemic , structural and organised discrimination of NORP in the ORG , that there was no structural violence in the ORG against the NORP population or other NORP with a NORP background and that NORP groups could obtain protection from the ORG authorities . Although the general situation in the provinces of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE in the eastern part of the ORG continued to be considered to fall within the scope of LAW DATE on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ; see , for further details , NORP and ORG v.

In DATE the Minister of ORG issued a new official country assessment report on the ORG , according to which the general situation in the provinces of GPE and GPE remained unsettled and unpredictable and that the situation of the NORP in the rest of the ORG , including GPE , remained unchanged in comparison with the last reporting period . As regards the situation of women , the report reads :", "\u201c Women in the ORG occupy a subordinate position . Discrimination against women is widespread and they often have no access to decision - making , adequate healthcare , clean water , basic sanitation and legal remedies . The general position of women remained consistently bad during the reporting period . Several NGOs are active in the ORG in the area of women \u2019s rights and the improvement of the position of women . A draft bill for equal treatment between men and women , which has been taken up for examination in parliament , has not yet been adopted during the reporting period .", "The LAW stipulates that the government is to see to it that sexual violence against women is eliminated , in particular when it is used as a weapon aiming at destabilising or disrupting the family . Such forms of sexual violence are classified in the constitution as a crime against humanity .", "Sexual violence against women and girls is widespread throughout the entire country . Cases of sexual violence are most numerous in areas of war where rape is often used as a weapon in the conflict .

ORG announced [ at the ] end of DATE a national fight against sexual violence committed by NORP soldiers . The police have trained special units in GPE and GPE to combat sexual violence . ...", "For most women in the ORG is it difficult to call in protection against sexual violence . In theory it is indeed possible to report rape but in practice women decline to do so , due to social stigma and lack of confidence in the judicial system . When a victim decides to turn to the authorities , it remains questionable whether her case will be taken up . Police officers nearly always ask victims for a financial contribution for carrying out the investigation .", "... the NORP NGO LIZADEEL [ Ligue de la Zone Afrique pour la ORG , ORG ] has small centres in various towns in the ORG where victims of sexual violence are accommodated and accompanied to medical care facilities . There is a special telephone number for reporting sexual violence ...", "In GPE , a single woman with a job and able to fend for herself has sufficient freedom ... Single women from other parts of the country can join their own ethnic community ( communaut\u00e9 ) in GPE . A single woman from out of town \u2013 who has no family in town \u2013 can temporarily find shelter with someone from their own community . Single women also seek support from ORG or CARDINAL of the many awakening [ evangelical ] churches in GPE . In GPE legal training is given with a view to prosecuting perpetrators of sexual violence . The ORG runs a shelter for traumatised women in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the Deputy Minister informed ORG of ORG that on the basis of the official country assessment report on the ORG of DATE the provinces of GPE and GPE continued to be considered to fall within the scope of Article PERSON ) of the Qualification Directive , but that this qualification no longer applied to the provinces of GPE and GPE and therefore the \u201c CARDINAL(c ) policy \u201d in respect of these regions was discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The summary of the report on the \u201c Conditions for NORP in GPE \u201d , published on DATE by ORG , reads :", "\u201c The PERSON share of the population of GPE is fairly small , but they have played a political role in the country that is much more significant than their number would lead one to expect . The NORP population of GPE has always been rather small . When the second Congo war broke out in DATE , NORP were victims of large pogroms in GPE after they were collectively blamed for GPE \u2019s interference in NORP politics by the country \u2019s president and authorities . During and after the pogroms , the NORP who survived were either evacuated or managed to leave GPE by themselves . Since DATE , there have been no reports of human rights violations against NORP in GPE . This can be explained partly by there being few NORP living there , and partly by political circumstances that differ from those present at the outbreak of the second Congo war in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The main findings of the report \u201c Situation des femmes seules \u00e0 GPE \u201d , released on DATE by ORG ) states :", "\u201c In a country which ranks among the lowest according to the Human development index , women are [ also ] subject to obvious discrimination . Already vulnerable as a woman , a single woman deprived of a family or a social network is even more vulnerable without a means of existence . However , some single women can organise [ themselves ] in GPE and find support to improve their living conditions and attempt to secure their financial independence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
