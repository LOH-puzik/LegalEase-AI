Gradually , the changes in the first applicant \u2019s behaviour became more apparent especially after she had visited her father . In particular , the first applicant sought to kiss her mother on the mouth using her tongue . Every time the mother tried to discourage the child from doing so , the first applicant responded by telling her mother that the reason for doing this was to show her love and affection towards her . For example she would say : \u201c Mum you should not be shy because I love you \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter dated DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyers complained to the Attorney - General about the procedure that had been followed in the case . They informed the Attorney - General that the second applicant , after having consulted with the child psychiatrist who was seeing the first applicant since DATE , had decided not to give her consent to such statement and examination for a number of reasons , including the following :", "- video recorded statements were recommended in cases involving older persons who had the ability to develop a dialogue through the interrogation procedure ;", "- because of the nature of the offence the procedure should have been carried out immediately , not after DATE had passed , and only by an expert child psychologist or child psychiatrist ;", "-the examination of the child by the child psychiatrist at the material time was done by means of play , as was done in this type of cases , with the help of anatomical dolls . It was through this process that the psychiatrist concluded that the offence in question was committed by the father . The specialist , after DATE , had helped the child to forget and also to accept the absence of her father in her life . The child no longer reacted negatively and had stopped referring to her father . Reverting to the subject at this stage would traumatise her and lead to regression and was thus not recommended by experts ;", "-the investigation authorities had had the opportunity to take a statement from the suspect from the very beginning but had unjustifiably omitted to do so . This gave rise to reasonable suspicion that a deliberate effort had been made to cover up the whole matter ;", "-the report of the child psychiatrist had been communicated to the office of the Attorney - General , ORG and ORG . As mentioned by the child psychiatrist , her meetings with the child at the material time , had been carried out in the presence of a witness , a practice followed in such cases by reason of their nature and the very young age of the victims . This fact was mentioned in the child psychiatrist \u2019s statement to the police ;", "- the police authorities had not yet taken a statement from the clinical psychologist PERSON nor had they sought a restraining order against the father pursuant to the relevant domestic law ;", "- the second applicant had agreed to take the child to be examined by a doctor following the authorities\u2019 suggestion . However , following the unjustified delay on the part of the authorities to fix an appointment for the examination , the second applicant appointed a private specialist after having obtained the father \u2019s consent . The father had not , at that point in time , made any attempt to have the child examined by a private or government doctor .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the letter the applicants\u2019 lawyers requested a meeting with the Attorney - General as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the Attorney - General informed the applicants\u2019 lawyers that he considered that a meeting would serve no purpose . He also agreed that there had possibly been remissness on the part of the investigating authorities in the investigation of the case and that a note of criticism had been sent to them . If the case , however , was to be taken to court it was necessary to obtain the required evidence by a video recorded statement of the child with the mother \u2019s consent , to have the child examined by a specialist doctor and that the further actions the police asked of them should be taken .", "CARDINAL . In their reply dated DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyers disagreed with the Attorney - General and stressed that the case should have been taken to the domestic courts DATE . The authorities should have taken a video recorded statement from the child at the time as well as a statement from the suspect in respect of the offences . The lawyers repeated the position taken in their previous letter and noted that the well - being and the interest of the first applicant were incompatible with the requests now made by the authorities . In their view the taking of a video recorded statement was not a prerequisite for the criminal prosecution of the suspect . There was ample evidence before the Attorney - General and any more delay in the prosecution of GPE was against both the interests of the child and the interests of justice . They asked once more for a meeting in the presence of ORG , as she was the only specialist who had examined the first applicant , since neither the investigating authorities nor the suspect sought to have the minor examined by a third person .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyers submitted a detailed complaint to the Commissioner for Children \u2019s Rights ( \u201c the Commissioner \u201d ) of a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights as a result of the undue delay and the negligence on the part of the authorities to carry out a proper investigation of the case in breach of relevant domestic laws . They requested the Commissioner to take the necessary measures for the protection of the first applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the Commissioner replied that she had requested ORG to inform her of the actions taken by ORG following the complaint made about the sexual molestation of the child , with specific questions concerning the investigation of the complaint , the cooperation / coordination with other services involved , the taking of a statement by the police , the direct referral of the child for an evaluation and for psychotherapeutic help to ORG . She had also requested the views of ORG concerning the Attorney - General \u2019s request for a video recorded statement from the first applicant in relation to the sexual molestation after DATE had elapsed and a briefing of how ORG were intending to proceed .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner informed the applicants\u2019 lawyers that upon receiving the replies from the relevant authorities she would examine the case and decide whether the appropriate measures had been taken in the case in order to secure the child \u2019s rights and whether the procedures and practices followed in this kind of case complied with the provisions of ORG . In the event she discerned any violations , she would proceed to make the necessary recommendations with the aim of ending the violations and to ensuring that practices were adopted that fully secured the child \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyers re - contacted the Attorney - General , because they had not received a reply concerning their request for a meeting in the presence of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the Commissioner informed the ORG lawyers that she had received a reply from the Minister of ORG and had written to the Chief of Police with a number of questions relating to the handling of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interim order granting custody of the first applicant to the second applicant pending the proceedings . The order was to be reviewed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the office of the Attorney - General informed the applicants\u2019 lawyers that following an examination of the case , there was no adequate evidence in the case - file to substantiate their claims before a court .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Commissioner informed the applicants\u2019 lawyers that the Chief of Police had informed her that a video recorded statement had not been taken due to the second applicant \u2019s negative stance and that the Attorney - General had given instructions not to institute criminal proceedings because of lack of evidence . She had written in reply to the Chief of Police noting the ORG \u2019s obligations to secure the child \u2019s rights and that in this case the competent authorities had not done so . She had requested specific information about the procedures and practices in the present case as well as in other similar cases . This included questions concerning the decision of the Attorney - General .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicants appointed new lawyers to represent them before the domestic authorities .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the applicants\u2019 new lawyers , referring to the decision not to prosecute GPE due to insufficient evidence , sent to the Attorney - General a written affirmation by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that she had attended as a witness the examination of the first applicant by ORG and the Commissioner \u2019s letter of DATE . In the letter , they also emphasised that , according to the case - law , children against whom this kind of offences were committed , did not constitute \u201c exhibits \u201d to be given for examination or inspection by the defence . This was particularly so when the examination or the taking of a video recorded statement had not been promptly made but , as in the present case , was sought to be taken DATE ; a delay that would cause the child a new traumatic experience without , however , any significant result . They stated that they were certain that criminal proceedings against GPE could be instituted on the basis of the evidence of PERSON , the corroborative evidence of PERSON and that of the second applicant as well as other circumstantial evidence .", "CARDINAL . It appears that another letter was sent by the Commissioner to the Chief of Police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyers wrote to the Commissioner noting that they had not received any news as to whether the Chief of Police had replied to her above - mentioned letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They observed that the ORG had failed to protect the rights of children although it had committed itself to doing so through the office of Commissioner . They reminded the Commissioner of the fact that the police officers who were responsible for investigating the complaint had not carried out their duties properly and that their mistakes and omissions had determined the course and fate of the case . The Attorney - General had refused to prosecute the suspect because of \u201c insufficient evidence \u201d in the file of the case . The insufficiency of the evidence was due to the wrong way the police force had dealt with the case . The lawyers reminded the Commissioner that the file of the case had been sent to the police authorities DATE , with instructions to take statements from certain persons including GPE At about the same time ORG had asked for the second applicant \u2019s consent for the taking of a video recorded statement from DATE child . After consulting ORG , the second applicant had not consented to the above giving a number of reasons , including the damaging effect a statement would have on the first applicant \u2019s psychological state . The last letter sent by the lawyers to the Attorney - General containing their request for re - examination of the case had remained unanswered . Unfortunately the Attorney - General \u2019s decision not to prosecute GPE , had been interpreted by the welfare officers as meaning that the complaint was unfounded . As a result , in the proceedings before ORG , they had sought to restore the communication of the minor with the father despite the scientific findings of ORG to the contrary . They pointed out in this respect that ORG had instructed ORG to appoint , with the consent of both parents , a child psychiatrist . The Director of ORG of ORG was appointed . For this purpose , he was then called by ORG to help the court by evaluating the current state of the minor without examining the child in relation to the alleged sexual molesting because of the long time that had passed . It was agreed in court that she should only examine the present psychological state of the first applicant , her development , including her emotional development , in general , bearing in mind her age . ORG , however , in a letter addressed to the above child psychiatrist had told her to examine the current state of the minor with the purpose of reinstating communication with the father and suggested that she ignore , in making her assessment , the allegations of sexual molestation as no criminal proceedings had been instituted against the father . They ended the letter by again requesting the Commissioner to intervene and to investigate the matter through the police , the Attorney - General \u2019s office and ORG before more damage was done .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner replied to the above letter on DATE . In this she set out the steps she had taken in the case and the information that had come to her through correspondence with the authorities such as the Minister of ORG and the Chief of Police . She concluded with the following :", "( a ) ORG had immediately taken all necessary steps for investigating the case and had continuously co - operated with all the other authorities involved .", "( b ) The procedures followed by the authorities had as a criterion the child \u2019s interests ; in the present case it appeared that the young age of the child and the refusal of the second expert PERSON to give a statement to the police or submit a report had played a decisive role in the case . PERSON had informed the police authorities that she was unable to give an opinion and requested not to be contacted again about this issue . The absence of corroborative evidence from her resulted in the lack of adequate and reliable evidence which led to the non - prosecution of the father . The young age of the child , both at the initial and subsequent stages of the investigation , did not allow for the taking of a video recorded statement . International bibliography indicated that information taken during interviews from children aged DATE is confusing and thus it is difficult for experts to reach safe conclusions . Even though it was not possible to determine with certainty whether the child had been sexually molested by her father , so that the case did not lead to criminal proceedings , the Commissioner considered that priority must be given to the protection of the child through cooperation between the child and the other members of her family with the appropriate services . The Commissioner pointed out that the psychosocial and emotional development of children in respect of whom there was an allegation that they had been subjected to sexual and/or psychological abuse by CARDINAL of their parents , was usually negatively affected . For this reason , it was necessary to give priority to proper professional intervention with the appropriate psychotherapeutic methods which would help the child to become emotionally and psychologically stronger and to enhance its self - image . Moreover , priority must be given to the restoration and strengthening of the relations of the child with both parents . In conclusion the Commissioner expressed the wish that the difficulties of the child would be overcome soon so that balance in the family would be restored .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the ORG representative informed the ORG that the second applicant had filed an application before ORG for a final restraining order against GPE in order to prevent him from exercising his contact and other rights with the child . He also informed the ORG that at the same time she was granted an interim order and that on DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s application for supervised contact rights with the first applicant pending the final adjudication of the second applicant \u2019s application which was fixed for hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . No more information has been given by the applicants concerning the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under the LAW the Attorney - General is an independent officer of GPE ) .
