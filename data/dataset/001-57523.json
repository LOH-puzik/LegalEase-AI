AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , an NORP journalist born in DATE , resides in GPE and is editor of the magazine ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after the NORP general elections , in the course of a television interview , Mr. PERSON , President of the NORP ORG , accused Mr. PERSON , the President of ORG ( ORG ) of having served in the first ORG infantry brigade during the Second World War . This unit had on several occasions massacred civilians behind the NORP lines in GPE . Mr. PERSON did not deny that he was a member of the unit , but stated that he was never involved in the atrocities it committed . Mr. PERSON then said that he had not alleged anything of the sort .", "CARDINAL . The following day , Mr. PERSON , the retiring Chancellor and President of ORG ( ORG ) , was questioned on television about these accusations .", "Immediately before the television interview , he had met Mr. PERSON at ORG . Their meeting was one of the normal consultations between heads of parties with a view to forming a new government ; it had aroused great public interest because before the elections on DATE the possibility of a FAC - Peter coalition government had been canvassed .", "At the interview , Mr. PERSON excluded the possibility of such a coalition because his party had won an absolute majority . However , he vigorously supported Mr. PERSON and referred to Mr. PERSON \u2019s organisation and activities as a \" political mafia \" and \" mafia methods \" . Similar remarks were reported DATE in a GPE DATE newspaper to which he had given an interview .", "CARDINAL . At this juncture , the applicant published CARDINAL articles in the GPE magazine ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first was published on DATE under the heading \" The Peter Case \" ( \" Der Fall Peter \" ) . It related the above events and in particular the activities of the first ORG infantry brigade ; it also drew attention to Mr. PERSON \u2019s role in criminal proceedings instituted in GPE ( and later abandoned ) against persons who had fought in that brigade . It drew the conclusion that although Mr. PERSON was admittedly entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence , his past nevertheless rendered him unacceptable as a politician in GPE . The applicant went on to criticise the attitude of Mr. PERSON whom he accused of protecting Mr. PERSON and other former members of the ORG for political reasons . With regard to Mr. PERSON \u2019s criticisms of Mr. PERSON , he wrote \" had they been made by someone else this would probably have been described as the basest opportunism \" ( \" GPE anderen w\u00fcrde man es wahrscheinlich \u00fcbelsten ORG nennen \" ) , but added that in the circumstances the position was more complex because Mr. PERSON believed what he was saying .", "CARDINAL . The second article , published on DATE , was entitled \" Reconciliation with the NORP , but how ? \" ( \" FAC den NORP - aber wie ? \" ) . It covered several pages and was divided into an introduction and CARDINAL sections : \" \u2018 Still\u2019 or \u2018 Already\u2019 \" , \" We are all innocent \" , \" Was it necessary to shoot defenceless people ? \" , \" Why is it still a question for discussion ? \" , \" PERSON and PERSON \" and \" Politically ignorant \" .", "CARDINAL . In the introduction Mr. PERSON recalled the facts and stressed the influence of Mr. PERSON \u2019s remarks on public opinion . He criticised him not only for supporting Mr. PERSON , but also for his accommodating attitude towards former NORP who had recently taken part in NORP politics .", "CARDINAL . Under the heading \" \u2018 Still\u2019 or \u2018 Already\u2019 \" the applicant conceded that one could not object to such attitudes on grounds of \" Realpolitik \" . According to him \" the time has passed when for electoral reasons one had to take account not only of NORP but also of their victims ... the former have outlived the latter ... \" . Nevertheless GPE , which had produced PERSON and PERSON and so many other war criminals , had not succeeded in coming to terms with its past ; it had simply ignored it . This policy risked delivering the country into the hands of a future fascist movement .", "With regard to the then Chancellor , he added : \" In truth Mr. PERSON \u2019s behaviour can not be criticised on rational grounds but only on irrational grounds : it is immoral , undignified \" ( \" In Wahrheit kann man das , was FAC tut , auf rationale PERSON nicht widerlegen . Nur irrational : es ist unmoralisch . PERSON \" ) . It was , moreover , unnecessary because NORP could reconcile themselves with the past without seeking the favours of the former NORP , minimising the problem of concentration camps or maligning Mr. PERSON by exploiting anti - Semitism .", "What was surprising was not that one \" still \" spoke about these things DATE but , on the contrary , that so many people were \" already \" able to close their eyes to the existence of this mountain of corpses .", "Finally , Mr. PERSON criticised the lack of tact with which Mr. PERSON treated the victims of the NORP .", "CARDINAL . The second section commented on the attitude of NORP society in general with regard to NORP crimes and former NORP . In the author \u2019s opinion , by sheltering behind the philosophic alternative between collective guilt and collective innocence the NORP had avoided facing up to a real , discernible and assessable guilt .", "After a long disquisition on various types of responsibility , he stressed that at the time it had in fact been possible to choose between good and evil and gave examples of persons who had refused to collaborate . He concluded that \" if PERSON had used his personal reputation , in the way he used it to protect Mr. PERSON , to reveal this other and better GPE , he would have given this country - DATE afterwards - what it most needed to come to terms with its past : a greater confidence in itself \" .", "CARDINAL . The third and fourth sections ( which together amounted to CARDINAL of the article ) also dealt with the need to overcome the consciousness of collective guilt and envisage the determination of real guilt .", "Under the title \" Was it necessary to shoot defenceless people ? \" , Mr. PERSON drew a distinction between the special units and the regular forces in the armies of ORG ; he pointed out that no one was forcibly enlisted in the former : CARDINAL had to volunteer .", "In the following section he stressed the difference between individuals guilty of criminal offences and persons who , morally speaking , had to be regarded as accomplices ; he maintained that if GPE had tried its NORP earlier , more quickly and more thoroughly , it would have been able to view its past more calmly without complexes and with more confidence . He then set out the reasons why that had not been possible and defended Mr. PERSON from the charge of belonging to a \" mafia \" . Finally , he considered the possibility of showing clemency after so DATE and concluded : \" It belongs to every society to show mercy but not to maintain an unhealthy relationship with the law by acquitting obvious murderers and concealing , dissembling or denying manifest guilt . \"", "CARDINAL . The fifth section of Mr. PERSON article compared the PERSON case with another affair of a more economic nature relating to Mr. PERSON , CARDINAL of the leaders of ORG ( \u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei ) , and compared Mr. PERSON \u2019s different reaction in each case . The author argued that the circumstances of the first case made Mr. PERSON unfit to be a member of parliament , a politician and a member of the government , and added : \" This is a minimum requirement of political ethics \" ( \" ein Mindesterfordernis des politischen Anstandes \" ) . The \" monstrosity \" ( \" GPE \" ) was not , in his opinion , the fact that Mr. PERSON had raised the matter , but that Mr. PERSON wished to hush it up .", "CARDINAL . The article ended with a section criticising the political parties in general owing to the presence of former NORP among their leaders . The applicant considered that Mr. PERSON ought to resign , not to admit his guilt but to prove that he possessed a quality unknown to Mr. PERSON , namely tact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the then Chancellor brought CARDINAL private prosecutions against Mr. PERSON . He considered that certain passages in the articles summarised above were defamatory and relied on LAW , which reads :", "\" CARDINAL . Anyone who in such a way that it may be perceived by a third person accuses another of possessing a contemptible character or attitude or of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document , by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine .", "CARDINAL . The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true . As regards the offence defined in paragraph CARDINAL , he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true . \"", "Under LAW , \" evidence of the truth and of good faith shall not be admissible unless the person making the statement pleads the correctness of the statement or his good faith ... \" .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG found Mr. PERSON guilty of defamation ( \u00fcble Nachrede - Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) for having used the expressions \" the basest opportunism \" , \" immoral \" and \" undignified \" . However , it held that certain other expressions were not defamatory in their context ( \" minimum requirement of political ethics \" , \" monstrosity \" ) . It fined him MONEY , considering as mitigating circumstances the fact that the accused intended to voice political criticism of politicians on political questions and that the latter were expected to show greater tolerance of defamation than other individuals . In view of the defendant \u2019s good faith it awarded Mr. PERSON no damages but , on his application , ordered the confiscation of the articles complained of and the publication of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , which contained a lengthy statement of reasons , ORG first examined the objectively defamatory character of each of the passages complained of . It held that the expressions \" basest opportunism \" , \" immoral \" and \" undignified \" were defamatory and were directly or indirectly aimed at Mr. PERSON personally , whereas the words \" minimum requirement of political ethics \" and \" monstrosity \" did not go beyond the accepted limits of political criticism .", "According to Mr. PERSON , the first CARDINAL expressions were value - judgments and therefore as such not contrary to LAW . However , ORG considered that the unfavourable conclusions drawn with regard to the then Chancellor \u2019s behaviour fell within the scope of that provision . Nor could the defendant rely on his right to freedom of expression , since the relevant provisions of LAW and LAW ) of the ORG authorised limitations of this right : a balance had to be struck between this right and the right to respect for private life and reputation . In the instant case the applicant had gone beyond the permissible limits .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr. PERSON \u2019s use of a private prosecution , ORG pointed out that he had been criticised not in his capacity as Federal Chancellor but as a leading member of his party and a politician . Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Criminal Code therefore did not apply in the instant case : it made defamation of an office - holder punishable , but solely by means of a public prosecution commenced with the consent of the person concerned , who could not bring a private prosecution unless the prosecuting authorities refused to act .", "CARDINAL . ORG then considered the question of proving truth ( preuve de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that as the applicant had not provided evidence to justify the expression \" basest opportunism \" , that was sufficient to lead to his conviction .", "With regard to the words \" immoral \" and \" undignified \" , the accused had used them in relation to Mr. PERSON \u2019s attitude consisting in minimising NORP atrocities , referring to Mr. PERSON \u2019s activities as being of a mafia - type and insinuating that the latter had collaborated with the Gestapo . On this last point ORG admitted evidence produced by Mr. PERSON in the form of a court decision finding a journalist guilty of defamation for having made a similar allegation .", "In so far as Mr. PERSON had spoken of \" mafia methods \" and \" mafia \" , ORG pointed out that these expressions normally referred to an organised form of criminal behaviour but were sometimes used in a different sense . Even if one did not accept the argument put forward by the private prosecutor , his conception of the \" mafia \" was a possible one and deserved to be examined . It was not for the prosecutor to prove the truth of his allegations but for Mr. PERSON to prove the truth of his . Mr. PERSON himself had conceded that in order to attain his various aims he relied on an organisation with numerous ramifications . Moreover , the then Chancellor \u2019s statements ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) must be seen in the context of a political struggle between political opponents , each of them using such weapons as were at his disposal . Seen from this angle they did not reflect an absence of morality or dignity but constituted a possible defence and were in no way unusual in the bitter tussles of politics .", "In truth , Mr. PERSON \u2019s attitude towards NORP victims and NORP collaborators was far from clear and unambiguous ; it appeared in a form which allowed different conclusions . It was therefore logically impossible for the defendant to establish that the only possible interpretation of this attitude was the one he put on it .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON both appealed against the judgment to ORG . On DATE , ORG set the judgment aside without examining the merits , on the ground that ORG had failed to go sufficiently into the question whether the then Chancellor was entitled to bring a private prosecution in spite of the provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , to which ORG had returned the case , gave judgment on DATE .", "After examining the circumstances surrounding the statements by the then Chancellor , it came to the conclusion that he had been criticised not in his official capacity but as head of a party and as a private individual who felt himself under an obligation to protect a third person . It followed therefore that he was entitled to bring a private prosecution .", "As regards the legal definition of the acts imputed to Mr. PERSON , ORG confirmed its judgment of DATE .", "With regard to the defence of justification , it again noted that the accused had not produced any evidence to prove the truth of the expression \" the basest opportunism \" . As regards the expressions \" immoral \" and \" undignified \" , the evidence he had produced related solely to the allegations of collaboration with the NORP made against Mr. PERSON . These , however , were not relevant because Mr. PERSON had made them after the publication of the articles in question .", "In so far as these expressions were directed at other behaviour and attitudes of the Chancellor , ORG maintained its previous findings unchanged . It considered that Mr. PERSON criticisms went far beyond the question of Mr. PERSON \u2019s attacks on Mr. PERSON . The fact that the former had been able to prosecute the applicant but could not himself be prosecuted for defamation by Mr. PERSON was due to the existing legislation on parliamentary immunity . The obligation to prove the truth of his statements was also based on the law and it was not for the courts but for the legislature to make this proof less difficult . Nor was ORG responsible for the lack of tolerance and the litigious tendencies of certain politicians .", "It therefore passed the same sentence as in the original judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Both sides again appealed to ORG , which gave judgment on DATE ; it reduced the fine imposed on the applicant to QUANTITY but confirmed ORG judgment in all other respects .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON disputed the statement that different criteria applied to private life and to political life . He argued that politicians and private individuals should receive the same treatment as regards the protection of their reputation .", "ORG , however , pointed out that LAW applied solely to the esteem enjoyed by a person in his social setting . In the case of politicians , this was public opinion . Yet experience showed that frequent use of insults in political discussion ( often under cover of parliamentary immunity ) had given the impression that statements in this field could not be judged by the same criteria as those relating to private life . Politicians should therefore show greater tolerance . As a general rule , criticisms uttered in political controversy did not affect a person \u2019s reputation unless they touched on his private life . That did not apply in the instant case to the expressions \" minimum requirement of political ethics \" and \" monstrosity \" . Mr. PERSON \u2019s appeal was therefore dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG then turned to Mr. PERSON grounds of appeal and first of all examined the evidence taken at first instance , in order to decide in what capacity Mr. PERSON had been subjected to his criticism . It too found that he was criticised in his capacity both as a party leader and as a private individual .", "The expression \" the basest opportunism \" meant that the person referred to was acting for a specific purpose with complete disregard of moral considerations and this in itself constituted an attack on Mr. PERSON \u2019s reputation . The use of the words \" had they been made by someone else \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not be understood as a withdrawal of the criticism . As the defendant had not succeeded in proving the truth of it , the court of first instance had been right to find him guilty of an offence .", "According to the applicant , the expressions \" immoral \" and \" undignified \" were his personal judgment of conduct which was not disputed , a judgment made in exercise of his freedom of expression , guaranteed by LAW . ORG did not accept this argument ; it pointed out that NORP law did not confer upon the individual an unlimited right to formulate value - judgments and that LAW ) authorised limitations laid down by law for the protection , inter alia , of the reputation of others . Furthermore , the task of the press was to impart information , the interpretation of which had to be left primarily to the reader . If a journalist himself expressed an opinion , it should remain within the limits set by the criminal law to ensure the protection of reputations . This , however , was not the position in the instant case . The burden was on Mr. PERSON to establish the truth of his statements ; he could not separate his unfavourable value - judgment from the facts on which it was based . Since Mr. PERSON was personally convinced that Mr. PERSON used \" mafia methods \" , he could not be accused of having acted immorally or in an undignified manner .", "CARDINAL . The appeal judgment was published in ORG on CARDINAL DATE , as required by the accessory penalty imposed on Mr. PERSON and his publisher ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
