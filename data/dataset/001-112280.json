The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the time of the events in issue in DATE he was living in GPE , GPE - Palatinate , where he was studying mechanical engineering .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother , his brother and his sister ( \u201c the witnesses \u201d ) informed the police about an incident that had occurred during TIME DATE at the applicant \u2019s GPE house in GPE , GPE . The witnesses testified that the applicant , who can not remember the incident , had strangled his sister and had attacked his brother with an axe before being overpowered by his parents . The applicant \u2019s father did not press criminal charges and did not testify against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG opened a criminal investigation against the applicant for attempted murder . On DATE the witnesses repeated their statements before the investigating judge ( Ermittlungsrichter ) of ORG in the presence of a police officer . The applicant was not informed of the hearing before the investigating judge . No counsel was appointed for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a warrant for the applicant \u2019s arrest . The applicant was arrested on DATE and remanded in custody . By a decision of ORG of DATE the applicant was transferred to a psychiatric hospital pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "ORG found it established that on TIME DATE the applicant travelled from PERSON to his GPE house in GPE . He entered the house with his own key without notifying his parents or his brother and sister of his arrival . During TIME he went to his sister \u2019s bedroom , strangled her and then attacked his brother with an axe causing him injuries on his head , hands , arms and legs . Once the applicant had been overpowered by his parents , the entire family gathered in the kitchen . The sister then drove the applicant \u2019s heavily bleeding brother to hospital where CARDINAL of his wounds were sutured . The applicant stayed with his family in his parent \u2019s house until DATE . During his stay he was provided with medical care by a local doctor who diagnosed him with having suffered an epileptic seizure . The applicant then returned to ORG but made another unannounced visit to his parent \u2019s house on CARDINAL DATE . Following this visit the applicant \u2019s mother , brother and sister who feared a further attack by the applicant decided to inform the police about the incident in TIME DATE and pressed criminal charges against the applicant on DATE ( see above \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG qualified the acts as CARDINAL counts of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm ( gef\u00e4hrliche GPE ) . It further held on the basis of expert opinions that the applicant had acted either in a state of diminished awareness of his actions due to epilepsy ( epileptischer D\u00e4mmerzustand ) or during a bout of paranoid schizophrenia and could therefore not be held responsible for the acts , pursuant to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the finding of facts , ORG noted that the applicant did not have any recollection of the events in TIME DATE and that the only available direct witnesses , namely the applicant \u2019s mother , brother and sister , had availed themselves of their right not to testify against the applicant in court pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The applicant \u2019s father had refrained from pressing criminal charges and had not participated in the proceedings ( see above LAW ) . The facts could nevertheless be established on the basis of the testimony of the investigating judge , who had heard the witnesses on DATE and had given an account of their pre - trial statements in court . ORG held that it was not prevented from hearing the investigating judge as a witness and taking his testimony about the ORG pre - trial statements into account .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG had failed to request the appointment of counsel for the applicant prior to the hearing of the witnesses by the investigating judge in accordance with CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL read in conjunction with LAW as construed by ORG in the light of the requirements of LAW ( d ) of LAW . Furthermore , the unrepresented applicant had not been informed about the hearing before the investigating judge pursuant to section ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and there would have been no grounds to exclude a potential counsel from the hearing ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated that under ORG case - law the failure to appoint counsel did not compel the exclusion of the investigating judge \u2019s testimony . However , ORG was bound to proceed to a particularly critical assessment of the investigating judge \u2019s testimony in view of the fact that neither the accused nor counsel had been able to directly examine the witnesses . The finding of facts could only be based on the investigating judge \u2019s testimony if the latter was corroborated by other significant considerations .", "CARDINAL . ORG took several items of evidence as corroborating the investigating judge \u2019s testimony into account . Firstly , it emphasised that for its establishment of facts it not only disposed of the testimony by the investigating judge but also of CARDINAL consistent witness statements that gave a coherent account of the events in issue . According to the testimony given by the investigating judge , there was nothing to establish that the witnesses had not told the truth or wanted to incriminate the applicant ; the witnesses had testified because they had been concerned about the applicant \u2019s health and had feared another attack by him . Furthermore , the police superintendent who had registered the ORG criminal charge on CARDINAL DATE had testified that on this occasion he had been spontaneously told by the witnesses - prior to their subsequent questioning - that the applicant had attacked members of his family with an axe . ORG pointed out that as opposed to the ORG subsequent testimonies to the police , these spontaneous statements did not have to be excluded from the trial pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure but constituted admissible evidence . In addition , another policeman had testified that the applicant \u2019s mother had called him spontaneously on DATE and had asked what further action would be taken as a result of the criminal complaint with a view to preventing a renewed unannounced visit and attack by the applicant . In ORG view these spontaneous statements supported the ORG description of the events in TIME DATE .", "Moreover , the doctor who had treated the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s cuts in hospital on DATE had testified that he had been suspicious of the latter \u2019s explanation for his injuries at that time , namely that he had fallen through a glass pane . ORG further noted that the applicant \u2019s brother had later handed over an axe to the police on his own initiative , and that the police officer who had received the implement had testified that the brother had confirmed that the axe was the corpus delicti . Finally , the applicant himself had testified that he could remember seeing his brother covered in blood on TIME DATE when the family had gathered in the kitchen and that his family members had told him that he had attacked his brother and sister during the night . According to the applicant , he himself had proposed that same morning to contact the police but his family had refused to do so . He further remembered that his sister had taken his brother to hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which he complained that the investigating judge \u2019s testimony ought to have been excluded from the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged an appeal on points of law in which he argued that the attack on the witnesses should have been classified as CARDINAL counts of attempted manslaughter as well as assault occasioning grievous bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG moved that the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law be dismissed on the grounds that ORG had , in line with the reasoning in the related ORG leading judgment , established that the investigating judge \u2019s testimony had been corroborated by other important considerations and that ORG holding was free of error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . On DATE ORG ordered the ORG to pay the costs of ORG Appeal on points of law which had been withdrawn . These decisions were served on the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his first application with ORG ( no . PERSON ) which was declared inadmissible for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies by a Committee of CARDINAL judges on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for the reinstatement of the proceedings in regard to his compliance with the DATE period to lodge a constitutional complaint and submitted his constitutional complaint to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination and noted that there was no need to decide the applicant \u2019s application for the reinstatement of the proceedings ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG may order an accused to be placed in a psychiatric hospital if he has committed an unlawful act in a state that excludes a finding of guilt , and if his act reveals that as a result of his condition , future serious unlawful acts can be expected of him and that he therefore presents a danger to the general public ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . An accused acts without guilt if he is incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation due to a pathological emotional disorder , profound consciousness disorder , mental defect or any other serious emotional abnormality ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the prosecutor , the accused and defence counsel shall be permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness or expert prior to the opening of the main proceedings . The judge may exclude an accused from being present at the hearing if his presence would endanger the purpose of the investigation , in particular if it is to be feared that a witness will not tell the truth in the presence of the accused ( section ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The persons entitled to be present shall be given prior notice of the dates set down for the hearings . The notification shall be dispensed with if it would endanger the success of the investigation ( section ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Defence counsel may be appointed during preliminary proceedings ; the public prosecution office shall request such an appointment if in its opinion the assistance of defence counsel in the main proceedings will be mandatory ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The assistance of defence counsel is mandatory if , inter alia , the main hearing is held at first instance before ORG , the accused is charged with a serious criminal offence , or the proceedings are conducted with a view to placement in a psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . Counsel is to be appointed when an indicted accused without defence counsel has been requested to reply to the bill of indictment ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In a leading judgment of DATE ( published in the official reports , BGHSt , volume CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) ORG held that LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW required , in view of LAW ( d ) of the LAW , the appointment of counsel for an unrepresented accused if the key witness for the prosecution was to testify before an investigating judge and the accused was excluded from this hearing . The failure to appoint counsel prior to the hearing before the investigating judge did not exclude the latter \u2019s testimony about the ORG statements as long as the proceedings , seen as a whole , remained fair . To this end the investigating judge \u2019s testimony had to be carefully assessed . A conviction could only be based on the investigating judge \u2019s testimony if this testimony was corroborated by other important considerations .", "CARDINAL . Parents , brothers and sisters need not testify against their accused son or daughter , brother or sister ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL of LAW ) ; if such a witness makes use of his or her right not to testify at the main hearing , prior witness statements shall not be read out ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . According to ORG case - law , section CARDINAL of LAW is an exclusionary rule that applies to all statements made prior to a main hearing by witnesses who avail themselves of their right not to testify at the main hearing , with the exceptions of spontaneous statements made by the witness before or outside his or her formal testimony as well as testimonies before a judge after the witness has been advised of his or her right not to testify ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
