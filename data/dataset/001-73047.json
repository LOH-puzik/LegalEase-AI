He is represented before the ORG by Mr H. Davies GPE and Mr A. Jones , barristers practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , following an assault upon his girlfriend and a man he believed she was involved with , the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent , and was sentenced to concurrent terms of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "It is likely that by the time the applicant was released , in DATE , he was suffering from schizophrenia . He experienced the delusion that he was a special person who had been born DATE and had been sent to save sinners . He felt that people behaved strangely towards him and were constantly testing him . He was paranoid and began carrying a knife .", "On DATE the applicant , who had been using cannabis and Valium , went into a public house in GPE . He attracted attention because of his dishevelled appearance and his attempts to sell a watch to customers . The landlord told him to leave after CARDINAL drink , but meanwhile CARDINAL of the other customers , \u201c M \u201d , who was completely unknown to the applicant , noticed the knife in his pocket and attempted to take it from him . The applicant took the knife back and left the pub , followed by PERSON , the applicant struck at M with the knife , cutting M \u2019s hands . M and his companions retaliated , and the applicant was found by the police lying motionless on the ground . He was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment . When he was finally interviewed he told the police that for some time he had been harassed by gangsters , and that he had bought the knife to protect himself against them . He believed that M was a \u201c sidekick \u201d of the gang leader , and that M had tried to rob him and had stolen his girlfriend .", "The applicant was charged with an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm , a \u201c serious offence \u201d for purposes of LAW and LAW CARDINAL of ORG ) Act DATE ( see below ) . He was initially remanded in custody in prison , but on DATE he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital for examination , under the care of PERSON . He remained there until DATE .", "At the hospital the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia . He was prescribed antidepressants and increasing doses of an antipsychotic drug , Quetiapane . However , he proved resistant to this treatment , and to a second antipsychotic drug . In DATE he was prescribed Clozapine , an a - typical antipsychotic licensed especially for use in cases of treatment - resistant schizophrenia . Clozapine may be prescribed only by an approved psychiatrist and must be dispensed by an approved pharmacy . The applicant \u2019s condition began to improve ; he was complying with the treatment programme and was keen to receive further treatment .", "The applicant did not claim to be unfit to plead and did not advance a defence of insanity . Instead , he pleaded guilty in ORG at GPE on DATE . He appeared before ORG for sentencing on DATE . PERSON and another approved consultant psychiatrist gave evidence that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia and would be a serious danger to the public if released . They recommended that a hospital order be made under LAW of LAW with a restriction on his release , unlimited in time , under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "The ORG explained that since the applicant had already been convicted , in DATE , of offences classed as \u201c serious \u201d under section CARDINAL ) of the Powers of ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d : see below ) , he had no choice but to sentence him to a term of life imprisonment . He fixed the minimum term to be served at DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and remarked :", "\u201c I have to say I regret having to pass this sentence . Had I had power to do so I would have passed a sentence under LAW , making you the subject of a hospital order with a restriction without limitation of time . That , for the reasons I have explained , is impossible . ... \u201d", "The applicant was taken immediately to ORG , where he was admitted at TIME and placed on the hospital wing . According to the prison medical records , he was examined by a doctor who noted that the applicant \u201c presented as appropriate \u201d , but was bemused at his sentence as he had been expecting to be sent to mental hospital .", "No - one at the prison was authorised to prescribe or dispense Clozapine . The prison authorities contacted ORG , which advised that if the dose was interupted for TIME or longer the patient would have to return to the start of his medication programme . TIME the applicant had difficulty in getting to sleep and was prescribed LOC , after which the prison log recorded that he appeared to sleep well .", "The following day , DATE , the prison medical officer attempted to obtain a supply of Clozapine , but this was not possible , so PERSON was prescribed instead . At TIME the applicant complained of feeling unwell . He was given CARDINAL mg of Olanzapine and , according to the prison record , his mood improved . He appeared to sleep well that night . The following day ( DATE ) he was again seen by a doctor who prescribed medication to help him sleep . The doctor described the applicant as appearing relaxed and talking appropriately . No particular problems were recorded in the prison medical log on CARDINAL or DATE .", "On DATE PERSON examined the applicant with a view to seeking his transfer to hospital . PERSON report indicated that the applicant was refusing the treatment offered by the prison authorities . An application for his transfer to hospital was made to the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a second doctor , as required by section CARDINAL of LAW . The second doctor \u2019s report indicated that the applicant was becoming increasingly depressed and concluded that he should be transferred , because he had responded well to Clozapine in the past and that treatment was available only in a mental hospital .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG , having considered the medical reports , authorised the applicant \u2019s transfer to hospital .", "PERSON noted in his report dated CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] was in FAC for DATE and there was a clear deterioration in his mental state during that time . A number of phone calls were received by [ the hospital ] about his deteriorating mental state by medical staff at the prison . He was becoming more paranoid and more withdrawn and there was concern that he would pose a risk to himself or possibly to others if he started to misinterpret the environment . As a result both myself and one of ORG prepared a medical recommendation which was sent to ORG of ORG for [ the applicant ] to be transferred under LAW DATE , which was achieved ...", "[ The applicant ] was returned to Clozapine on his return to [ hospital ] on DATE . The Clozapine was gradually increased . In the early stages of starting his medication he had clear ideas of reference in regard to other patients on the ward and showed increasing preoccupation . ...", "Unfortunately when PERSON is stopped there can result in a rebound psychosis whereby the symptoms come back with a vengeance and become more difficult to treat . There is evidence on the medical file that [ the applicant \u2019s ] mental state was starting to deteriorate once the Clozapine stopped and it certainly took DATE to actually get full control of his symptoms following his return to [ hospital ] . \u201d", "Following his transfer , the applicant has remained in hospital . If and when the hospital authorities decide he no longer requires treatment in hospital , he will be returned to prison . Once the tariff period set by the judge has expired , it will be for ORG to decide whether it is safe to release the applicant back into the community .", "The applicant appealed against sentence , arguing that his mental illness had been the primary cause of his committing the offence , and that it was \u201c inhuman and degrading \u201d , in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , to label him , by sentencing him to life imprisonment , as a deliberate wrongdoer deserving punishment . ORG rejected those submissions ( NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG R ( S ) CARDINAL ; [ DATE ] Crim LR CARDINAL ) , as follows :", "\u201c In the context of this case we can not say that the sentence of life imprisonment which the ORG was obliged to pass was incompatible with the rights of the [ applicant ] under either LAW . We accept that a sentence of imprisonment does carry a certain stigma . It is ... a public statement that the offender is a deliberate wrongdoer who deserves punishment , but we do not accept that the stigma should not be applied to those convicted of serious crimes but who suffer from mental illness , given that in every case they would only have been convicted at all because they were fit to plead and have been demonstrated at trial to have had at the material time the necessary mens rea . Although ... this ORG has consistently encouraged the use of both hospital and restriction orders , it has always been open to ORG to say , as it did in DATE , that in certain defined cases there is an assumption that the offender presents such a serious and continuing danger to the safety of the public that a hospital order with a restriction order will afford inadequate protection , and there must therefore be a sentence of life imprisonment . Given that a sentence of life imprisonment does afford greater protection to the public , and that the assumption is rebuttable , and that there is no evidence to show that an offender sentenced to life imprisonment will not receive appropriate medical treatment , we find it impossible to see how the introduction of the statutory assumption can be said to have infringed the [ applicant \u2019s ] Convention rights . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that it was wrong in principle to impose a punitive sentence of imprisonment on someone who was mentally ill and not fully criminally culpable , and that the imposition on him of the automatic life sentence was therefore contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of GPE , giving the judgment of ORG , observed that the applicant \u2019s mental illness could properly be relied on as mitigating the criminality of his conduct , but not as absolving him of all responsibility for it . There would be strong grounds for challenging the compatibility of the automatic life sentence with LAW if its effect were to deny a mentally disordered defendant the medical treatment which his condition required , but this was not a necessary result , since section QUANTITY of the DATE Act gave the Home Secretary power to transfer a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment to a hospital , and since the ORG Secretary was obliged to act compatibly with the LAW and was subject to judicial review . In the present case , the ORG Secretary acted very promptly . Although the interruption of the applicant \u2019s medication during DATE following his sentence caused him ill effects , these were not of sufficient severity to engage LAW .", "In DATE the ORG issued a White Paper entitled Protecting the Public : The Government \u2019s Strategy on Crime in England and GPE , ( Cm CARDINAL ) . Chapter CARDINAL was headed \u201c Automatic Life Sentences for Serious Violent and Sex Offenders \u201d and explained their reasons for requiring indeterminate sentences for dangerous criminals :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A wide range of serious violent and sex offences carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , including manslaughter , rape and the most serious woundings . In these cases the court has the discretion to impose a life sentence either because the offence is so serious that it merits the maximum available penalty , or because the trial judge feels unable to determine when it will be safe to release the offender . In either case , the trial judge will specify the tariff which must be served , and at DATE ORG will determine whether the offender can safely be released .", "CARDINAL . The great advantage of the life sentence is its flexibility . It recognises that there are CARDINAL separate considerations : the length of time the offender should serve as punishment for the offence he or she has committed ( the tariff ) , and the question whether he or she can safely be released at DATE . However courts make very little use of the discretionary life sentence . In DATE , for example , CARDINAL offenders were convicted of rape or attempted rape , but CARDINAL were sentenced to life imprisonment . In DATE , CARDINAL offenders were convicted of a second serious violent or sexual offence , but CARDINAL received a discretionary life sentence .", "CARDINAL . This does not necessarily mean that the sentences imposed on violent and sex offenders are too lenient : long sentences are frequently imposed on offenders convicted of violent and sex offences . . . . But if a determinate sentence is imposed the offender must be released once that sentence has been served , even if there is every reason to believe that he or she will commit further serious offences . That has led to a number of tragic cases where offenders convicted of violent or sex offences have been released only to repeat their offences almost immediately .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It is essential that the public receives proper protection from serious , dangerous and persistent offenders . Long sentences are not sufficient , of themselves , to provide that protection : before potentially dangerous offenders are released an assessment must be made to see whether they still pose a risk . If an offender can not safely be released he or she must continue to be detained \u2013 if necessary indefinitely .", "CARDINAL . This proposal is not designed to increase the time such offenders spend in prison as punishment for the offences they have committed . That will continue to be the responsibility of the trial judge , who will be expected to set a tariff appropriate to the seriousness of the offence , just as the judge would if he or she were imposing a determinate sentence . This will enable the risk presented by the offender to be assessed towards the end of the tariff , when it will be known in the case of a sex offender , for example , whether that offender had undertaken the sex offender treatment programme , and how he or she had responded to it . The proposal will ensure that when the tariff ordered by the court expires , offenders who represent a real risk to the public are not released unless and until ORG is satisfied that it is safe to do so . Once released , they will remain on licence and subject to recall in the same way as other life sentence prisoners . \u201d", "It was said to be one of the key elements of the Government \u2019s proposal ( paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c the court will also have discretion not to pass the automatic life sentence in genuinely exceptional cases . This is intended to allow for occasional quite unforeseeable circumstances where it would plainly be unjust and unnecessary to impose the life sentence . But it should be emphasised that this provision will be designed to cover only genuinely exceptional cases . The court will be required to explain what were the exceptional circumstances which justified some other sentence in place of a life sentence . . . . \u201d", "The chapter concluded , in paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Too often in the past , those who have shown a propensity to commit serious violent or sex offences have served their sentences and been released only to offend again . In many such cases , the danger of releasing the offender has been plain for all to see \u2013 but nothing could be done , because once the offender has completed the sentence imposed , he or she has to be released . Too often , victims have paid the price when the offender has repeated the same offences . The Government is determined that the public should receive proper protection from persistent violent or sex offenders . That means requiring the courts to impose an automatic indeterminate sentence , and releasing the offender if and only if it is safe to do so . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)-(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which gave effect to the above recommendations , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where\u2015", "( a ) a person is convicted of a serious offence committed after DATE ; and", "( b ) at the time when that offence was committed , he was DATE or over and had been convicted in any part of GPE of another serious offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall impose a life sentence , that is to say\u2015", "( a ) where the offender is DATE or over when convicted of the offence mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL)(a ) above , a sentence of imprisonment for life ,", "( b ) where he is DATE at that time , a sentence of custody for life under LAW above ,", "unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which justify its not doing so .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the court does not impose a life sentence , it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are .", "( CARDINAL ) An offence the sentence for which is imposed under subsection ( CARDINAL ) above shall not be regarded as an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law . \u201d", "There follows in subsection ( CARDINAL ) a list of criminal offences all of which are serious offences for purposes of the section if committed in GPE and GPE . The list includes offences related to murder ( although not murder itself , for which a mandatory life sentence is prescribed elsewhere ) , manslaughter , offences under LAW of LAW , rape and attempted rape , unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged DATE , certain of the most serious firearms offences and robbery involving the possession of a firearm or imitation firearm . All are offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life . In subsections ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) the section contains broadly comparable lists of serious offences committed in GPE and GPE .", "Section CARDINAL reproduces ( in its application to GPE and GPE ) section CARDINAL of ORG .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act empowers a court to order a person , on being convicted of a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment , to be admitted to and detained in a specified hospital ( \u201c a hospital order \u201d ) . The court can make a hospital order only if it is satisfied on the written or oral evidence of CARDINAL registered medical practitioners that the offender is suffering from mental disorder and that :", "\u201c the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment , and in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment , that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration in his condition \u201d ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) ( i ) ) ,", "\u201c the court is of the opinion , having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedents of the offender , and to the other available methods of dealing with him , that the most suitable method of disposing of the case is by means of a [ hospital order ] \u201d ( section DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) ( ii ) ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act empowers a court to make a restriction order ( with or without limit of time ) at the same time as it makes a hospital order . The restriction order gives the Secretary of ORG , inter alia , increased powers over the movement of a patient and may be made if it appears to the court having regard to the nature of the offence , the antecedents of the offender and the risk of his committing further offences if still at large , that it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to make the order . A restriction order also confers a power to recall or conditionally discharge a patient at any time and restricts the powers of ORG to order release more narrowly than in the case of an ordinary mental patient .", "The Home Secretary may by warrant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) direct the transfer of a defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment but whose mental condition requires treatment in hospital to a named hospital . Such a transfer direction has the same effect as a hospital order ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) and may under section DATE be coupled with a restriction order . These are the powers exercised by the Home Secretary in the applicant \u2019s case .", "The situation which arises where neither a sentence of imprisonment nor a hospital order , on its own , appears appropriate in the case of a particular offender was dealt with in the ORG \u2019s ORG ( \u201c Protecting the Public \u201d ) mentioned above ( LAW , \u201c Sex Offenders and Mentally Disordered Offenders \u201d ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government proposes changes in the arrangements for the remand , sentencing and subsequent management of mentally disordered offenders to provide greater protection for the public and to improve access to effective medical treatment for those offenders who need it . The central change , if adopted , would be the provision of a \u2018 hybrid ORG for certain mentally disordered offenders for whom the present form of hospital order is unsatisfactory , particularly those who are considered to bear a significant degree of responsibility for their offences . The order would enable the courts , in effect , to pass a prison sentence on an offender and at the same time order his immediate admission to hospital for medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . The hybrid order , together with other proposals amending the detail of LAW DATE , would substantially increase the flexibility of arrangements for dealing with mentally disordered offenders at all stages from remand through to rehabilitation . In particular , it would enable the courts to deal with some of the most difficult cases in a way which took proper account of the offender \u2019s need for treatment ; the demands of justice ; and the right of other people to be protected from harm .", "CARDINAL . Existing sentencing arrangements for offenders who are mentally disordered require the court to decide either to order the offender \u2019s detention in hospital for treatment , or to sentence him to imprisonment , or to make some other disposal . In some cases , an offender needs treatment in hospital but the circumstances of the offence also require a fixed period to be served in detention . This may be because the offender is found to bear some significant responsibility for the offence notwithstanding his disorder , or because the link between the offending behaviour and the mental disorder is not clear at the time of sentencing . The hybrid disposal would be a way of enabling the requirements of sentencing in such cases to be met . Under the order , an offender would remain in hospital for as long as his mental condition required , but if he recovered or was found to be untreatable during the fixed period set by the court , he would be remitted to prison . The hybrid order was recommended for use in sentencing offenders suffering from psychopathic disorder by ORG on Psychopathic Disorder . The Government is considering whether it might be made available in respect of offenders suffering from all types of mental disorder currently covered by mental health legislation . \u201d", "Legislative effect was given to this proposal by section CARDINALA of LAW , inserted by LAW .
