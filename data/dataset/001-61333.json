Section CARDINAL merely gives their case its proper perspective . The awards of DATE to be served by each of the appellants did not have the effect of adding to their sentence . It was not a fresh sentence of imprisonment . Their effect was to postpone the appellant 's release on licence . The awards clearly had a practical effect so far as the appellants were concerned and that practical effect was to postpone their release . But there was no question of their sentence being increased as a matter of law .

They are not adversarial and the nature of the decision is an administrative public law decision rather than CARDINAL which resolves a dispute between CARDINAL parties .

The imposition of DATE is generally the heaviest of the range of punishments available to adjudicators and should be used accordingly , in targeted fashion .

Introduced following the delivery of the ORG 's judgment in the present case , this statutory instrument came into force on DATE to amend LAW DATE . Its explanatory note reads as follows :", "\u201c These Rules amend LAW DATE by providing for an adjudicator , approved by the Secretary of ORG , to inquire into charges of serious offences against discipline set out in those Rules . Where the governor determines that a charge is sufficiently serious , he must refer it to the adjudicator , who is to inquire into the offence no later than CARDINAL days after it has been referred . At an inquiry into a charge that has been referred to the adjudicator , the prisoner who has been charged is given the opportunity to be legally represented . If the adjudicator finds a prisoner guilty , he has the power to impose upon him any punishment which the governor can impose , and can also impose an award of DATE to be served in prison . These Rules also remove from the governor the power to impose DATE as a punishment on a prisoner found guilty by him , and add to his powers in certain other respects . \u201d", "In practice , adjudicators are district judges who visit prisons on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . This statutory instrument also increased the maximum cellular confinement which could be awarded by governors to a period not exceeding DATE and added \u201c removal from his wing or living unit for DATE \u201d as a further punishment available to them .", "CARDINAL . The instruction referred to advice received by ORG to the effect that when DATE were imposed the proceedings arguably amounted to the determination of a criminal charge so that they should be held before an independent person rather than a ORG employee . ORG had been recently advised that the risk of a successful challenge under the Convention to the use of DATE was greater than previously thought .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , governors and others acting as adjudicators in disciplinary proceedings against prisoners in NORP prisons were required to , inter alia , suspend awarding DATE as from DATE . The relevant ministers had taken into account legal advice and advice from ORG , the latter based on consultation with governors , to the effect that ceasing to impose DATE detention should not have significant operational or management implications for establishments . It was noted , in this respect , that the awards of DATE detention had declined significantly in DATE . The judgment of ORG in the present case would be examined when delivered and it would be of relevance to the ministers and ORG in deciding whether the suspension should be permanent .", "CARDINAL . The instruction attached a series of questions and answers . In response to the question whether the changes would increase indiscipline , the document noted :", "\u201c Figures show that the use of ADAs [ DATE awards ] has been falling steadily in DATE , Also , ADAs and LOR [ loss of remission ] have never been available for life prisoners , yet this does not seem to have caused any disciplinary problems . There is a wide range of other punishments and of management measures available to deal with indiscipline . In the most serious cases , that is where potentially criminal activity is involved , there also remains the option of referring the matter to the police for possible criminal charges . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The courts have interpreted Rule CARDINAL ) as conferring a power on the governor to grant , or to refuse , a prisoner legal representation at an adjudication hearing . In NORP v. the Home Secretary , ex parte GPE and Others ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Queen 's Bench CARDINAL ) , ORG pointed out that there is no right to legal representation for prison adjudications and that its grant in a particular case should be determined by reference to certain factors . Those factors were stated to include the seriousness of the charge and of the potential penalty ; whether any points of law are likely to arise ; the capacity of the particular prisoner to present his own case ; procedural difficulties ; the need of the prison authorities for reasonable speed in making their adjudications ; and the need for fairness as between prisoners and as between prisoners and prison officers .", "CARDINAL .

Lord PERSON considered that :", "\u201c ... it is easy to envisage circumstances in which the rules of natural justice do not call for representation , even though the disciplinary charge relates to a matter which constitutes in law a crime , as may well happen in the case of a simple assault where no question of law arises , and where the prisoner charged is capable of presenting his own case . To hold otherwise would result in wholly unnecessary delays in many cases , to the detriment of all concerned including the prisoner charged , and to a wholly unnecessary waste of time and money , contrary to public interest . Indeed to hold otherwise would not only cause injustice to prisoners : it would also lead to an adventitious distinction being drawn between disciplinary offences which happen also to be crimes and those which happen not to be so , for the punishments liable to be imposed do not depend on any such distinction . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
