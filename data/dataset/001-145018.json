He stated that the smuggler who had organised his journey had taken his passport and he provided a mobile telephone number for a contact person , N.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Migrationsverket ) held a first interview with the applicant during which he stated that he was from GPE . His mother and siblings remained there and he was in contact with them and would ask them to send him his passport and other identification documents . He further claimed that he had no relatives in GPE but he provided the mobile telephone numbers of CARDINAL contact persons in GPE , ORG and H.", "CARDINAL . An in - depth interview was held with the applicant on DATE , where his public counsel and an interpreter were present . ORG official informed the applicant of the importance of giving all his reasons for asylum as this might be his only chance to present them . She further assured him that all information provided was treated confidentially . The applicant handed in his identity card and claimed that the authorities had confiscated his passport and other identity documents . He then stated essentially the following .", "CARDINAL . He had left GPE in DATE and had travelled to GPE , where he had remained until his uncle had helped him to reach GPE in DATE , with the assistance of smugglers and a fake NORP passport . In GPE he had been a soldier , working as a guard at a military base in GPE where he had met some persons who had paid him to transport illegal weapons for powerful clans from southern GPE , with connections to the authorities . He had been working for them for DATE when , in DATE , he had been stopped at a road check and interrogated . He had then been taken to an unknown location where he had been kept for DATE and subjected to interrogation and torture . He had been charged with possession of illegal weapons and car theft and had then been moved to a military prison where his uncle had visited him and arranged for a lawyer for him . During the torture , his arm had been seriously injured and become infected and , DATE after his transfer to the military prison , he had been taken to a civil hospital by CARDINAL guards for treatment . After the doctor had treated him , CARDINAL of his guards had gone to fetch coffee for him and the other had taken him outside for a cigarette . He had then managed to escape . If he were returned to GPE , he would risk at least CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the criminal offences . He would further risk being killed by the clans since he had revealed their names under torture . He showed some scars on his arm , back and head .", "CARDINAL . ORG officer asked whether the applicant had other grounds for requesting asylum , to which the applicant replied no . He had lived well in GPE until he was arrested and had even planned to marry a woman in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant \u2019s public counsel submitted certain clarifications to ORG but essentially maintained what had been stated during the interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant visited ORG together with PERSON stated that he wished to add to his grounds for asylum that he was homosexual and had a relationship with ORG , whom he had known since DATE in GPE . Their relationship had developed over time and he had moved in with ORG in DATE . N. was transsexual and had a permanent residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In view of this new information , ORG held a supplementary interview with the applicant on DATE . During this interview , the applicant stated that he had been \u201c normal \u201d before and that it was ORG he had become interested in . Their relationship had developed from friendship but it had been difficult because of the very negative attitudes from other NORP in the city where they lived in GPE . No one in GPE knew about his sexual orientation and he had never had a homosexual relationship in GPE . ORG was in the process of changing gender from man to woman . They had spoken with his mother and sister over internet with a camera but ORG had presented himself as a woman . They had married in DATE . If he had to return to GPE to apply for family reunion from there , it would become known that he was married to a man and he would risk persecution and ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . As concerned his original grounds for asylum , and in view of the changes in GPE during DATE , the applicant noted that the situation in GPE was very insecure . He thought that the clans would no longer be particularly interested in him since they had other interests now and were less powerful than before . If he was careful , there would no longer be much of a threat against him in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had failed to submit his passport despite having claimed on several occasions that he had a passport and would submit it . However , although he had not proved his identity , the ORG accepted that he was probably from GPE . As concerned the situation in GPE following the overthrow of PERSON , the ORG noted that it was serious but did not reach the level of internal armed conflict . Thus , an individual assessment had to be made in the applicant \u2019s case . In this respect , the ORG found that the applicant had given contradictory statements and that his story lacked credibility . To begin with , he had given diverging information about his passport at the interviews , first claiming that the smuggler had taken it , then that he could obtain it from his family , later that the NORP authorities had confiscated it and , most recently , that he would submit the passport . It further observed that the name on the certificate relating to impediments to marriage , which the applicant had submitted in support of his marriage , was different from the name that he had given to ORG . Since no passport had been submitted , it was not clear that the certificate concerned the applicant . In the same connection , the ORG noted that the applicant had given contradictory statements about when he had met ORG and their relationship . At the first interview , on DATE , he had given ORG \u2019s telephone number as a contact number , while in DATE , he had stated that he had become acquainted with ORG during DATE in GPE and , at the interview in DATE , he had claimed that he had met PERSON about DATE after his arrival in GPE . Moreover , at the in - depth interview , he had stated that he had no other grounds for his asylum application than those related to the weapon transport and that he had planned to marry in GPE . Against this background , the ORG also questioned the nature of the applicant \u2019s and ORG \u2019s relationship , as relied on before ORG only on DATE . Thus , ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s story , both in relation to events in GPE and his relationship with ORG , lacked credibility and was not sufficient to justify granting him a residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG noted that substantive changes had occurred in GPE after the applicant had left the country and considered that he had failed to substantiate that , on the basis of the criminal accusations against him , he would risk persecution by the authorities upon return or that the authorities would not be able to protect him against harassment by the clans . As concerned the applicant \u2019s relationship to ORG , ORG referred to the main rule in LAW that an alien , who seeks a residence permit in GPE on account of family ties or a serious relationship , must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country . Whilst noting that an exemption from this rule can be made if the alien has strong ties to a person who is resident in GPE and it can not reasonably be required that he or she travel to another country to submit an application there , ORG considered that it would not be unreasonable to require the applicant to file such an application from GPE in accordance with the main rule . As there were no other grounds on which to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE , his application was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding that the spelling of his name differed in the various documents because the transcriptions from LANGUAGE had been made by different persons . He had his passport but had been afraid to hand it over to ORG for fear of being returned to GPE . His relationship with ORG was serious ; they were married and lived together . It would also become known in GPE that he was homosexual if he were to apply for a residence permit from there , which would expose him to a real risk of persecution and ill - treatment . Moreover , he would not be able to apply for a residence permit from GPE since GPE had a consulate only in GPE . He submitted a copy of his passport , from which it appeared that he had been granted a GPE visa by ORG in GPE in DATE and that he had entered GPE on DATE . He also submitted a copy of a military card , copies of photographs of scars and CARDINAL warrants for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . During the oral hearing before ORG , the applicant claimed that there was a threat against him from the NORP authorities since he had worked for the military during the PERSON regime . Moreover , he added that it was not known in GPE that he was married to a man but he was certain that other NORP in GPE would spread that information to GPE , if he were to be sent there . In his view , it would also become known that he was homosexual if he had to apply for family reunion and be interviewed at FAC in GPE . He also presented his passport in original .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It first found that the general situation in GPE was not severe enough to grant the applicant asylum without there being individual reasons for asylum . Turning to the applicant \u2019s individual reasons , the court noted that , since he had now submitted his passport , certain other documents provided could be linked to him . However , on examining these documents , the court found that the military card was for training and did not show that the applicant had later been employed by the military . The CARDINAL warrants for arrest were of a simple character and easy to fabricate . Moreover , CARDINAL of them did not contain any date and the applicant had not given any acceptable explanation of how he had obtained them . Turning to the photographs of the scars , the court considered that the fact that the applicant had had wounds which had left scars did not make probable that he would be ill - treated in the future . Thus , the court concluded that the documents did not show that the applicant was in need of international protection . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant was not credible , stressing that he had submitted his passport only at the oral hearing before the court and that he had deliberately given false statements before ORG concerning his passport , how he had travelled to GPE and the date of his arrival . He had also given contradictory statements concerning his knowledge of the possibilities of applying for asylum in GPE and the alleged threats against him in GPE . Thus , the court did not believe the applicant \u2019s asylum story .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court did not question that the applicant was homosexual but considered that he had failed to substantiate that there was a threat against him in GPE on account of this . In this connection , the court noted that , according to the applicant \u2019s own statements , it was not known in GPE that he was homosexual . Moreover , it took the view that it was unlikely that NORP in GPE who knew about the applicant \u2019s sexual orientation would be more willing to spread this information simply because the applicant was to return to GPE . The court also noted that the applicant had kept his passport in order to be able to return to GPE . In sum , it concluded that the applicant had failed to show that he would risk persecution or ill - treatment upon return to GPE . In so far as concerned his relationship with ORG , the court observed that all embassy personnel had an obligation to respect confidentiality and that there were no impediments for the applicant to apply for a residence permit from abroad . The fact that FAC was located in GPE did not alter this conclusion .", "CARDINAL . One lay judge gave a dissenting opinion and considered that it could not be ruled out that information about the applicant \u2019s sexual orientation might leak from an embassy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a further appeal to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then requested ORG to reconsider his case , submitting that a NORP in GPE , who knew about his marriage , had travelled to GPE and , by chance , had met his brother and told him that he was married to another man . His uncle had later called him and threatened to kill him if he returned to GPE since he had shamed the family . He further claimed that friends of his in GPE had told him that CARDINAL homosexuals had been killed in GPE recently and that others had fled the country since they were being persecuted by unknown groups in GPE . He was convinced that he would face a real risk of being ill - treated or killed if returned and that it would not be possible for him to apply for family reunion from there without his sexual orientation becoming known .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for reconsideration . It found that there was no reason to depart from the main rule that an application for family reunion had to be lodged from abroad . The applicant \u2019s claim that his relatives had threatened him was not considered sufficient to constitute a permanent impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion order and thus there was no ground to reconsider the applicant \u2019s case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
