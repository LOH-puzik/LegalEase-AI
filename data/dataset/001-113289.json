The applicants were each targeted in undercover operations conducted by the police in the form of a test purchase of drugs under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Operational - Search Activities Act of CARDINAL DATE ( no . TIME ) . These operations led to their criminal conviction for drug dealing .", "CARDINAL . The facts of each individual criminal case , as submitted by the parties , are summarised below . The applicants disagreed with the Government on the underlying causes and the circumstances leading to the test purchases , and where this is so both versions are given . As regards the factual details of the covert operations , they are not in dispute . In particular , it is common ground that the applicants knowingly procured drugs in the course of the test purchases .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the time of his arrest he was a DATE student at a management college . He is currently serving a prison sentence in a correctional colony .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , on CARDINAL DATE a PERSON voluntarily went to the police and reported that QUANTITY persons , \u201c PERSON \u201d ( the applicant ) and \u201c FAC , were selling hashish at MONEY ( RUB ) per QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , X was a drug addict , with a previous criminal conviction for illegal possession of drugs , and he was a police informant who had previously taken part in test purchases of drugs . To support these allegations the applicant provided a copy of the judgment against ORG and copies of CARDINAL judgments in unrelated criminal proceedings against CARDINAL different persons where X featured as the buyer in test purchases of cannabis , heroin and hashish from the accused .", "CARDINAL . It is common ground , supported by the official records , that the police ordered a test purchase and proceeded with it immediately after having received the information from X. The order indicated the applicant \u2019s name and stated that he was suspected of selling hashish at RUB QUANTITY . X phoned \u201c FAC and told him that he wished to buy hashish . The police officers were present when PERSON was speaking to \u201c FAC , but the conversations were not recorded . X was given RUB CARDINAL that had been photocopied . He met \u201c PERSON later on TIME and together they met the applicant who took RUB CARDINAL from them and went away to purchase the drugs . The applicant was later arrested and was found in possession of banknotes that matched the photocopied ones . Throughout the test purchase X had his mobile phone turned on with the police officer \u2019s number dialled , which enabled the police to overhear their conversations . These communications were not recorded . Neither \u201c Ruslan \u201d nor the applicant \u2019s dealer were arrested or prosecuted , allegedly on the grounds that their identities could not be established .", "CARDINAL . X testified at trial that he had met the applicant and \u201c Ruslan \u201d at a local supermarket DATE before the test purchase . In the course of their conversation the applicant had told him that he could get some hashish for him . \u201c Ruslan \u201d had given him his phone number . X had then volunteered that information to the police and agreed to take part in the test purchase . He testified that he had not previously bought drugs from the applicant . When the defence counsel cross - examined X the court disallowed questions about his criminal record and whether he was a drug user . It also dismissed the motion to have the judgments proving that X had previously acted as a buyer in test purchases of drugs accepted as evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The policemen who had initiated and carried out the test purchase testified at the trial that prior to X \u2019s information they had not known the applicant as drug dealer . They reiterated the details of the test purchase .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the applicant pleaded guilty of assisting \u201c Ruslan \u201d in buying drugs , but claimed that it had been the result of police incitement . He claimed that he and \u201c FAC were occasional smokers of hashish but that he was not selling or otherwise supplying it to anyone . The test purchase was the first time he had agreed to help \u201c FAC , or anyone , in obtaining drugs , and he had only done so because of his insistent prompting .", "CARDINAL . NORP The person named \u201c FAC was not called to be cross - examined at the trial , allegedly because the investigating authorities had failed to establish his identity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG of GPE found the applicant guilty of attempted illegal sale of narcotic drugs and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court did not make an express assessment of the applicant \u2019s plea of entrapment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He reiterated his plea of provocation , claiming , inter alia , that X had been a police informant and challenging the refusal of the firstinstance court to admit the relevant documents as evidence . He also pointed out that the police had no other information suggesting that he had previously sold drugs . He also complained that the authorities had not made any attempts to find and question \u201c PERSON , who had played a key role in the test purchase and could have cast light on the extent of the provocation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment . It reiterated the finding that the applicant had attempted to sell the narcotic drug during the test purchase and implicitly dismissed the plea of entrapment without answering the applicant \u2019s arguments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is currently serving a prison sentence in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE Ms Y voluntarily went to the police and reported that she was a heroin addict and that she wished to inform on her drug dealer . She said that she had been buying heroin from the applicant for a long time , but did not specify for how long . The police asked her to participate in a test purchase of drugs from the applicant , and she agreed to do so .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he knew Y from primary school and through his girlfriend . He knew that she was a drug user ; she would occasionally offer to sell him second - hand mobile phones of unclear provenance . DATE before the test purchase she had sold him a DVD player which had later been seized by the police as a stolen item . Because of that , Y owed the applicant RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL which she was unable to repay . On DATE she contacted him with an offer to redeem the debt , but told him that she would only do so if he got her some heroin , of which she was badly in need . The applicant contacted an acquaintance , a drug dealer , and arranged for the quantity Y had requested . He claimed that it was the first time he had agreed to purchase drugs for Y or for anyone .", "CARDINAL . It is common ground between the parties that prior to ORG submissions the police had not been in possession of any information suggesting the applicant \u2019s possible involvement in drug dealing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police ordered a test purchase . The order indicated the applicant \u2019s name and address and stated that he was suspected of selling heroin at RUB CARDINAL per gram . Y was given RUB CARDINAL in banknotes that had been photocopied . She phoned the applicant and arranged to purchase QUANTITY of heroin . The content of the phone call , which was made from police LOC and in the presence of police officers , was not recorded . The applicant met Y at the agreed place in town and she passed him the money . The police arrested the applicant on the spot . He was in possession of RUB CARDINAL in banknotes that matched the ones the police had photocopied . Y handed in a packet of heroin allegedly purchased from the applicant . The applicant claimed that he had not supplied the drugs handed in by Y because he was supposed to give them to her later .", "CARDINAL . After the arrest the applicant offered to inform the police on the dealer from whom he had obtained the heroin for Y and to conduct a test purchase from him , but the offer was not followed up .", "CARDINAL . The case was examined at first instance by LOC of PERSON . At the trial the applicant pleaded partly guilty but claimed that the crime he had committed was the result of police entrapment . He pointed out , in particular , that there was no evidence of his prior involvement in drug dealing . He maintained that ORG had previously asked him to buy heroin for her , knowing that he had an acquaintance who was a dealer , but he had always refused . CARDINAL DATE was the first time he had agreed to help her , and this was only because she had promised to pay back her debt if he did . He claimed that her participation in the test purchase was not \u201c voluntary \u201d , but prompted by the police , who had manipulated her by playing on her drug addiction .", "CARDINAL . Y testified at the trial that on DATE she had voluntarily gone to the police to inform them about the applicant \u2019s involvement in drug trafficking . She also stated that she had previously bought heroin from the applicant CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . The police officer who carried out the test purchase testified at the trial that on DATE Y had voluntarily gone to the police station and reported that she was a heroin addict and that she wished to inform them that the applicant was her drug dealer . He also stated that she had collaborated with him for DATE prior to the test purchase , and that she had taken part in unrelated test purchases of drugs from other persons . He further stated that prior to CARDINAL DATE the police had had no information on the applicant and that the test purchase was ordered as soon as Y had reported him . She had been asked to make a phone call to the applicant immediately from the police station ; when she did so she had only asked the applicant to sell her heroin , without entering into any other subjects .", "CARDINAL . The court also cross - examined another policeman who had taken part in the test purchase , and read out statements given by the attesting witnesses in the investigation , in which they set out the details of the test purchase . On DATE it found the applicant guilty of attempted illegal sale of narcotic drugs in particularly large quantities . It did not expressly refer to the applicant \u2019s plea of entrapment , having found the fact of the sale sufficiently established and having noted the compliance of the test purchase with the procedural requirements . It considered that the applicant \u2019s version of events , whereby he met Y because of the debt , had been refuted by other evidence . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in a high - security correctional colony .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , pleading police incitement of the offence he was convicted of and alleging that the firstinstance court had incorrectly assessed the evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . It did not address the plea of entrapment , but limited itself to finding the applicant \u2019s conviction lawful and well - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Trained in the past as a policeman , in DATE he was convicted of a murder and , after his release , worked as a welder . He is currently serving a prison sentence in a correctional colony in GPE following his conviction of the drug offence described below .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE Ms Z voluntarily presented herself at the local office of ORG , the police ) and reported that she was a heroin addict and that she wished to inform the authorities that the applicant was a drug dealer . The police asked her to participate in a test purchase of drugs from the applicant , and she agreed to do so .", "CARDINAL . It is common ground between the parties that prior to ORG \u2019s submissions the police had not been in possession of any information suggesting the applicant \u2019s possible involvement in drug dealing . However , the Government also claimed that this information was corroborated by a report of an officer of ORG drawn on DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he had known Z for DATE through his personal contacts ; he was also acquainted with a certain ORG , also through personal contacts . From his police training with ORG he knew that the QUANTITY women were drug addicts , with criminal records related to drug dealing , and that they were police informants . On DATE Z called him and asked for the phone number of P because she wanted to buy drugs from her ; she said that she was suffering severe withdrawal symptoms and was on the verge of committing suicide . Later the same day she called him again and asked him to accompany her to the meeting with P because she feared that P would not sell to her if she was on her own . Out of compassion he agreed to go along . When the CARDINAL of them met , P sold Z QUANTITY grams of methamphetamine , a home - made narcotic drug produced with ephedrine and referred to throughout the proceedings by its slang name \u201c speed \u201d ( \u00ab \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0442 PERSON ) . The applicant was arrested on the spot . He alleged that he did not have either money or drugs on him during the arrest , claiming that the money was planted on him during the search . He acknowledged , however , that he assisted Z in buying the \u201c speed \u201d but maintained that it was the first time he had done so for Z or for anyone , having succumbed to her persistent begging .", "CARDINAL . The official records presented the following account of the test purchase . Having received the information from Z , the police ordered a test purchase and proceeded with it immediately . The order indicated the applicant \u2019s name and stated that he was suspected of selling \u201c speed \u201d for RUB CARDINAL per gram . Z was given RUB CARDINAL in banknotes that had been photocopied . She phoned the applicant from police premises and asked him to get the drugs for her . He called her back later and they arranged to purchase QUANTITY of \u201c speed \u201d . The police officers were listening when Z spoke to the applicant on the phone , but the conversations were not recorded . The applicant met DATE on the same night and together they met another person , P. When Z gave a signal to the police they arrested the applicant and took him to the police station . At the station the police examined a wallet allegedly found on him which contained RUB MONEY in banknotes that matched the photocopied ones . Z handed in a syringe with \u201c speed \u201d in it , allegedly purchased from the applicant . P was also arrested , but she was released shortly afterwards and was not prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the applicant pleaded guilty of helping Z to buy drugs , but claimed that he had been induced by the police to do so and requested that the evidence relating to the test purchase be excluded .", "CARDINAL . Z testified that she had volunteered information about the applicant to the police because she thought it would make it easier for her to overcome her addiction . She stated that before the test purchase she had never bought drugs from the applicant ; however , since they used to buy and consume them together she told the police that she would be able to convince him to obtain the drugs for her . She further stated that she did not know if the applicant had previously sold drugs to anyone else , and she was almost certain he did not produce them himself . She also admitted that she used to buy drugs from another source . Finally , concerning the circumstances of the test purchase , she testified that she gave the money to the applicant and took the syringe from him and that she did not see P handle either the money or the syringe .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested that P be called and cross - examined , but the court noted that she had been summoned and had absconded , and that her whereabouts were unknown . The court considered this to constitute exceptional circumstances allowing it to take her written depositions into account . Despite the applicant \u2019s objections , it read out her pre - trial statement saying that she had delivered the drugs to the agreed place at the applicant \u2019s request , but that the sale had been arranged by him .", "CARDINAL . QUANTITY police officers were cross - examined about the covert operation . They reiterated the details of the test purchase . CARDINAL of them testified , when asked , that Z was not remunerated for her collaboration with the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE found the applicant guilty of attempted illegal sale of narcotic drugs and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The sentence was increased to DATE for breach of parole relating to his previous conviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , pleading police incitement of the offence he was convicted of and complaining that the first - instance court had incorrectly assessed the evidence .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG examined the appeal . It dismissed the plea of entrapment , stating that the test purchase was based on the information given by Z to the police , notably that she \u201c had previously bought drugs from the applicant on multiple occasions \u201d , and concluded that the test purchase was therefore lawful . It upheld the first - instance judgment as well - founded .", "CARDINAL .

The comparative study showed that in all of these countries it is possible for the police to carry out undercover operations , in particular in drug - trafficking cases , according to the procedure set out in the relevant laws and regulations . Only in GPE is there no formal legislative or regulatory basis for the use of undercover police . A number of countries provide also for the involvement of private individuals and authorise resort to undercover agents only when the collection of evidence by other means is too complicated or impossible .", "CARDINAL . Research reveals that in most of the countries covered there is exclusive or shared responsibility of the judicial bodies in the authorisation procedure , although in some the decision lies with the public prosecutor , the administrative authorities or high - level police officials .", "CARDINAL . A judicial authorisation is required in GPE ( court ) , GPE ( investigating judge ) , GPE ( investigating judge ) , GPE ( indictments chamber ) , GPE , GPE ( regional court with prior agreement of ORG ) , GPE ( investigating judge ) , and GPE ( judge ) .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE , \u201c fictitious transfers \u201d , which include test purchases , require authorisation by the public prosecutor , whereas the use of an undercover agent ( in connection with particularly serious offences ) can be authorised only by a High Court judge . Under NORP law , the use of undercover agents must be authorised by the public prosecutor , and additionally by a court if the operation targets a particular person or involves entry into private LOC . In GPE also the authorisation is given by the public prosecutor , but video and audio recording during the operation requires prior authorisation by a judge .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the authorisation is delivered by the public prosecutor at the preliminary inquiry stage , and by the investigating judge ( juge d\u2019instruction ) during the pre - trial investigation . NORP law , in a similar vein , requires the authorisation of a pre - trial judge during a pre - trial investigation , while at an earlier stage the authorisation of the prosecutor suffices .

NORP law also provides for notification of the investigating judge when authorisation for an undercover operation has been given by the public prosecutor . Such authorisation can also be issued directly by the judge .", "CARDINAL . In GPE there is no requirement for formal authorisation from the prosecutor or a court , but the appropriate authority must give prior notification of the start of the operation to the competent prosecutor .

In the GPE undercover operations are subject to administrative rather than judicial authorisation . In the ORG of Lords decision in R v. Loosely [ DATE ] Lord PERSON underlined that although the technique in GPE for authorising and supervising such practice was very different from the judicial supervision in continental countries , the purpose was the same , namely to remove the risk of extortion , corruption or abuse of power by policemen operating without proper supervision .", "The public authorities entitled to authorise the use or conduct of a Covert Human Intelligence Source ( ORG ) are laid out in law .

However , it is recognised that this is not always possible , especially in the case of small organisations , or where it is necessary to act urgently or for security reasons . Where an authorising officer authorises his own activity the central record of authorisations should highlight this and the attention of a Commissioner or Inspector should be drawn to it during his next inspection .", "CARDINAL .
