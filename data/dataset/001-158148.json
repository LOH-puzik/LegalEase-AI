According to the applicant , he is a NORP national , ORG , born in DATE . According to the Government , the applicant is a NORP national , GPE , born in DATE . He lives in Elista .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE on suspicion of murdering a NORP policeman in DATE . He was in possession of a NORP national passport in the name of ORG , born in DATE in the Primorskiy region of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , pending receipt of an official extradition request from the NORP authorities . ORG noted that the applicant had been identified by means of photographic comparisons as GPE , a NORP national born in GPE in DATE . His name was on ORG \u2019s list of wanted persons . The NORP authorities had issued an arrest warrant in his name dated DATE from which it was apparent that he was suspected of a criminal offence under LAW . That offence was punishable by the death penalty , life imprisonment or CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , and the limitation period was DATE . The limitation period in respect of a comparable criminal offence in GPE was DATE , but this was suspended if the suspect had fled from justice . The court further noted that a NORP national passport in the name of ORG had apparently been unlawfully obtained by the applicant after he submitted false information to the competent NORP authorities . It was clear that he was not a NORP national but a NORP national and could be therefore extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities failed to submit an official extradition request within the DATE time - limit established by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release . At the same time he noted that it was necessary to start administrative removal proceedings against the applicant on the grounds that his residence in GPE was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Despite the release order , the applicant remained in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE transport police drafted a report on the commission by the applicant of an offence under LAW ( unlawful residence in GPE of a foreign national , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of an administrative offence under LAW and ordered his administrative removal to GPE . The court took note of a letter dated DATE by ORG which showed that it was impossible to establish whether or not the applicant was a NORP national . He had received a NORP national passport in the name of ORG in DATE after declaring that he had lost his previous passport , which had been issued in DATE . However , according to ORG , the allegedly lost passport never existed . The court further relied on the extradition casefile , from which it was apparent that the applicant was in fact a NORP national , GPE , rather than a NORP national PERSON Being a NORP national , he was residing in GPE unlawfully without a valid visa or residence permit . The court noted that the applicant was sought by the NORP authorities on suspicion of murder . He was therefore dangerous and it was necessary to sentence him to administrative removal from GPE . Lastly , the court observed that , although the applicant had a NORP wife , he did not have any children who were minors living in GPE . In such circumstances , and taking into account his dangerousness , the public interest outweighed his personal interest in maintaining his family life in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that his passport as a NORP national had never been cancelled and was therefore still valid . He further argued that his administrative removal was extradition in disguise . The DATE limitation period established by NORP criminal law had expired and he could no longer be lawfully extradited to GPE . If he was administratively removed to GPE he would be immediately arrested and very probably subjected to the death penalty . His removal to GPE would therefore be in breach of ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant was not a NORP national . He had obtained the NORP national passport in the name of ORG unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE quashed the judgment of DATE , finding that the administrative offence report of DATE had been procedurally defective , and remitted the case to ORG for a new examination . These proceedings were later discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC police drafted a new report on the commission by the applicant of an offence under Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE discontinued the administrative offence proceedings against the applicant , finding that the administrative offence report of CARDINAL DATE had been procedurally defective .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL the applicant was released . His passport , seized upon arrest , was not returned to him . He was served with a decision by GPE and ORG , dated CARDINAL DATE , declaring the undesirability of his presence in GPE ( the \u201c exclusion order \u201d ) which read in its entirety as follows :", "\u201c On DATE ORG of GPE decided that your presence ( residence ) in GPE was undesirable in accordance with section QUANTITY of [ the Entry and Exit Procedures Act ] . You must therefore leave GPE before DATE .", "If you do not leave before the stated deadline , you will be deported .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL of [ the Entry and Exit Procedures Act ] , if a decision declaring the undesirability of an individual \u2019s presence ( residence ) in GPE has been issued , that individual may no longer enter GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the exclusion order before ORG . He also complained that his passport had been unlawfully seized . He submitted that he could not cross the NORP border without a passport and could not therefore comply with the exclusion order by leaving GPE for another country . In these circumstances , the exclusion order would automatically entail his deportation to GPE . If he was deported to GPE he would be immediately arrested and very probably subjected to the death penalty . His deportation would therefore be in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the exclusion order had been lawful . It had been issued by a competent authority in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and had been based on sufficient reasons . Given that the applicant was sought by the NORP authorities on suspicion of murder , had been fined several times in GPE for driving offences and had lived in GPE unlawfully with an unlawfully issued passport , there were sufficient reasons to find that he represented a real threat to public order and security . The court further noted that the applicant did not dispute the above facts . The thrust of his complaint was that his deportation to GPE would expose him to a risk of being subjected to the death penalty that amounted to inhuman treatment . Those arguments could not , however , serve as grounds for annulling the lawfully adopted exclusion order . The court also held that the applicant \u2019s argument that the exclusion order would automatically entail his deportation to GPE was unconvincing . Firstly , deportation was not automatic and required a separate administrative decision that could be challenged before a court . Secondly , the applicant had the possibility of avoiding deportation to GPE by leaving GPE for another country .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the seizure of the applicant \u2019s passport in the name of ORG had been lawful . By the decision of DATE ORG had found that that passport had been issued unlawfully and that the applicant was not a NORP national . Those were lawful grounds for seizing a passport . The procedure prescribed by law had been respected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that the domestic law did not require a separate administrative decision on deportation . The exclusion order alone constituted a sufficient legal basis for deportation and his failure to leave GPE before the stated deadline could therefore entail automatic deportation to GPE . He did not have any remedies with suspensive effect in such a situation . He further reiterated his argument that he could not leave GPE for another country because his passport had been seized by the authorities and he did not have any other identity documents . Lastly , he argued that his deportation to GPE would amount to a breach of not only ORG and CARDINAL of the ORG , but also of LAW , because he was married to a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified . It added that a genetic test had established that the applicant \u2019s genetic profile matched the genetic profiles of GPE \u2019s parents . There was therefore no doubt that the applicant \u2019s real name was PERSON It further agreed with ORG that the applicant could avoid deportation to GPE by leaving GPE for another country using his NORP passport .", "CARDINAL .
