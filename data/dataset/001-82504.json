At the time of the events complained of he was staying in the holding centre for asylum seekers and illegal immigrants ( grenshospitum ) at GPE ( GPE ) Airport . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON P.A. Blaas , a lawyer practising in ' s - Hertogenbosch . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived at GPE ( GPE ) FAC on DATE . An officer of ORG ( ORG ) initially refused him admission to the country on the ground that he did not hold a valid passport , and that he had insufficient means either to provide for his own subsistence in the GPE or to cover the cost of his journey to a destination outside the GPE . When the applicant then asked for asylum , the same officer ordered that he be detained in the asylum application centre ( aanmeldcentrum ) at GPE for the purposes of prevention of unauthorised entry into the GPE , in accordance with LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) .", "In an asylum application centre , and following an initial intake interview with the asylum seeker , the GPE immigration authorities make the first selection between prima facie unfounded and possibly founded asylum requests . Petitioners falling within the latter category are transferred to a reception and investigation centre for asylum seekers ( opvang- en onderzoekscentrum ) , whereas petitioners falling within the former category remain in detention in the asylum application centre pending the determination of their asylum request , which may be dealt with in an accelerated procedure if they do not require a time - consuming investigation ; the accelereated procedure means that the asylum request can be processed with all due care within TIME .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant was interviewed by an immigration official in relation to his asylum request . On DATE , on the basis of these interviews , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) rejected the applicant 's asylum application . Apart from the fact that he had not submitted any documents capable of demonstrating his identity , nationality or travel itinerary , the applicant was deemed to have insufficiently cooperated in the establishment of his travel itinerary , since he had provided virtually no tangible or verifiable statements about his journey ( departure and arrival times of the airplane(s ) , the name and/or logo of the airline company , and whether or not the airplane had made a stop - over ) . Given the applicant 's inability to answer a large number of elementary and basic questions about GPE and his alleged area of origin , the Minister also had doubts as to whether the applicant was a NORP national or of PERSON origin . The Minister further maintained the aliens ' detention order . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE against his placement in aliens ' detention .", "ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant 's counsel \u2013 referring to ORG judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ) DATE argued that a measure whereby a non - judicial authority issues a detention order can only justify detention for DATE and that , consequently , his detention after CARDINAL DATE had to be regarded as unlawful . The Minister submitted , inter alia , that an application for a laissez - passer had already been filed but that no date had yet been fixed to present the applicant to the GPE authorities .", "ORG gave its decision on DATE . Referring to a precedent set by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) in a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ( see below under \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d ) , it dismissed the appeal .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with ORG . He raised CARDINAL complaint , namely that ORG had unjustly failed to acknowledge that , where a detention order has been issued by an administrative authority , the alien concerned must DATE pursuant to the ORG 's considerations in its ORG judgment DATE be brought before a judge within DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the further appeal , confining its reasoning to a reference to its earlier ruling of CARDINAL DATE . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "Until DATE the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( PERSON ; \u201c the Aliens Act DATE \u201d ) . Further rules were set out in LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . LAW ( PERSON ) applied to proceedings under LAW DATE , unless indicated otherwise in this Act .", "On DATE the Aliens Act DATE and the associated regulations were replaced by LAW , the CARDINAL LAW , the DATE Regulation on Aliens and LAW . Unless indicated otherwise in LAW , LAW continued to apply to proceedings on requests by aliens for admission and residence .", "LAW , in so far as relevant to the case , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

As soon as ORG has received the notification , the alien shall be deemed to have lodged an appeal against the decision to prolong the decision imposing deprivation of liberty . \u201d", "Pursuant to LAW , as in force until DATE , the delay within which the Minister was to notify ORG of the placement of an individual in aliens ' detention was DATE and ORG was to hold a hearing DATE after receipt of the appeal . On DATE an amendment to LAW entered into force , prolonging these time - limits to CARDINAL and DATE respectively . In practice , this meant a revival of the legal situation that existed until DATE in respect of these CARDINAL time - limits under the former Aliens Act DATE and associated regulations ( for further details , see PERSON GPE ( dec . ) , nos . FAC and CARDINAL , DATE , under \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d ) .", "LAW CARDINAL of LAW stipulates that there is no time - limit for filing an appeal within the meaning of LAW and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW and that an appeal referred to in Article CARDINAL must be filed within DATE . Accordingly , an individual placed in aliens ' detention may in principle file as many appeals against this placement as he or she sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision to place an individual in aliens ' detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention . Pursuant to LAW , no appeal to ORG lies against a decision by ORG on such a subsequent appeal ( ORG , DATE , case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The hearing and determination of any such subsequent appeal are subject to the same mandatory time - limits as those for a first appeal ( ORG of GPE sitting in GPE , DATE , case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "According to a ruling given by ORG on DATE ( ORG ( Immigration Law Reports \u2013 \u201c JV \u201d ) CARDINAL ) , the time - limit set out in LAW is of a strict mandatory nature . If this time - limit has not been respected , the placement in aliens ' detention becomes unlawful on DATE following DATE on which this time - limit expired .", "In a ruling handed down on CARDINAL DATE ( JV CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG held , in so far as relevant for the present case :", "\u201c The judgment of ORG [ in the case of PERSON v. GPE ] of DATE , relied on by the [ appellant ] , concerns the continued detention of aliens against whom an expulsion or extradition procedure was no longer pending , for which continued detention there was no legal basis . Consequently , the detention had lost its lawful character and thus did not fall within the scope of CARDINAL of the permissible grounds of deprivation of liberty as listed in an exhaustive manner in LAW . In this light , ORG understands the judgment and in particular the reasoning set out in paragraph CARDINAL to mean that the Court \u2013 in assessing such detention \u2013 incorporates the rationale of Article CARDINAL taken as a whole and , in that context , also considers relevant the guarantees for legal protection and legal certainty as incorporated in the third paragraph of [ LAW ] . Noting this as well as the [ decisions on admissibility taken by ] ORG in the case PERSON GPE [ no . MONEY , DATE ] and ORG and Others v. GPE [ CARDINAL , DATE ] , ORG is of the opinion that the ORG did not have the intention to consider LAW applicable by analogy to the detention of aliens in accordance with [ LAW ( f ) of the LAW ] , which would also be at variance with the wording of [ LAW ] . In this connection ORG also finds of relevance that the ORG , in its [ decision on admissibility ] in the case of GPE v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) found that there was no reason for holding that there was a violation of LAW , as the alien concerned who had been placed in aliens ' detention under LAW [ as in force until DATE ] could at any point challenge the lawfulness of [ that ] detention before [ a ] judge , who should determine [ this issue ] speedily . ORG did not conduct an additional examination of the matter under [ LAW ] . In accordance with LAW and LAW and DATE ) of LAW DATE an alien may also at present file an appeal at any point against a decision imposing deprivation of liberty . \u201d", "As there is no statutory fixed maximum duration of a placement in aliens ' detention for the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry into the country or expulsion , an alien refused admission or whose expulsion has been ordered may , in principle , remain in aliens ' detention for an unlimited period of time , provided there are reasonable prospects for departure or expulsion within the foreseeable future . However , it has been established in domestic case - law that the interest of an alien to be released from aliens ' detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in aliens ' detention exceeds a period of DATE , the alien 's interest in being released may \u2013 but not necessarily \u2013 be accepted as having become greater than the interest in keeping him in detention for the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this turning point may be attained DATE when , for instance , the alien concerned insufficiently cooperates in the determination of his / her identity and nationality and in making documents available . However , once an alien has spent DATE in aliens ' detention for the purpose of preventing unauthorised entry , the judge is to verify more thoroughly whether the authorities have complied with their obligation to do whatever they can do to facilitate the alien 's departure to a destination outside of the GPE ( see , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE , DATE , GPE ( National Case - law ( database ) number ) \u2013 \u201c LJN \u201d ) AUCARDINAL with further references ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
