Those statements were addressed to the NORP authorities , to ORG , and to the applicant \u2019s lawyers . In DATE the defence lawyers submitted the above written testimonies and statements to ORG ; they were added to the case file .", "CARDINAL . All of the above witnesses withdrew their previous testimony to the police , which had incriminated the applicant . In particular , Ms ORG explained in her statement of CARDINAL DATE that , although she did not speak LANGUAGE , she had signed written depositions drafted in NORP by the prosecution authorities . She explained that the \u201c policemen \u201d who had abducted PERSON and PERSON from her flat had been led by Mr Berkadze , one of those who had kidnapped the applicant \u2019s father . Ms ORG testified that the man who had called and threatened her in TIME CARDINAL DATE was not the applicant but PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In his written submissions of CARDINAL DATE PERSON indicated that the person who had questioned and beaten him in the applicant \u2019s office had introduced himself as \u201c a son of the kidnapped businessman \u201d , but that it had not been the applicant , and that he had not seen the applicant at all on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The defence lawyers also questioned the applicant \u2019s brother , who lives in GPE and who confirmed the applicant \u2019s account of events . The transcript of that interview was also produced to the court .", "CARDINAL . The defence commissioned an expert analysis of the recording of the telephone conversations at Ms Margvelashvili \u2019s flat . The phonological analysis of the audiotapes submitted by the defence concluded that the recording of the telephone conversations on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE did not contain the applicant \u2019s voice . This report was admitted by the court as evidence .", "CARDINAL . The court examined CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL audiotapes made by the police in the flats of PERSON and PERSON ( audiotapes nos . DATE and DATE ) , and examined the verbatim records of the remaining DATE audiotapes made by the police . The defence requested access to all thirteen audiotapes in order to be able to compare them with the verbatim record , but the court rejected that request .", "CARDINAL . The defence also requested the court to obtain from the prosecution the recordings made TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE . The defence stressed that during that period the applicant had had a telephone conversation with PERSON . In its submission , the disclosure of the content of that conversation could have proved his innocence .", "CARDINAL . The defence lawyers asked the court to disclose the materials authorising the telephone tapping of PERSON flat and , in particular , the court decision authorising that surveillance . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON , after having examined briefly a file produced by the ORG prosecutor , dismissed the request \u201c on the grounds of secrecy \u201d . He explained that he was satisfied with the explanation provided by the prosecution as to the lawfulness of the telephone tapping . It appears that the lay judges did not see the materials submitted by the prosecutor to the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence repeated their request for the disclosure of the materials authorising the wiretapping . In particular , they sought the disclosure of the request for the wiretapping by the police and the court \u2019s order of DATE authorising the wiretapping ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In an interim decision of the same date the court , composed of Judge PERSON and the CARDINAL lay judges , dismissed that request on the ground that the materials at issue , relating to the operational and search activities of the police , contained ORG secrets , and therefore could not be shown to the defence . The court referred to subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the DATE Operational and Search Activities Act ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , which did not provide for the disclosure of the information on such activities of the police to the lawyers .", "CARDINAL . The court questioned a number of policemen involved in the wiretapping of telephone conversations at Ms ORG \u2019s flat . They submitted that the police had been keeping an eye on PERSON and persons around him , including Ms ORG , since DATE . Ms ORG \u2019s flat had been under surveillance since DATE , and when the applicant \u2019s father was kidnapped the police had known that Ms ORG \u2019s friends or relatives might be involved in some way . The witness explained that all telephone conversations within that period had been recorded . However , the recording covering the period TIME on DATE and CARDINAL p.m. on DATE had been lost \u201c for technical reasons \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . On DATE the court started the examination of the expert report of DATE by PERSON and Mr GPE . The applicant insisted that the conclusions of the above - mentioned CARDINAL experts were wrong , and that the man \u2019s voice on the audiotapes did not belong to him . Further , he claimed that the translation from NORP was inaccurate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court questioned the experts who had prepared the report , PERSON and Mr PERSON . They testified that at the request of the investigator they had analysed CARDINAL audiotapes . They had not detected any traces of editing on those audiotapes . In their view , the voice on CARDINAL recordings belonged to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge asked PERSON whether he had worked with the NORP language before . PERSON replied that , for the purposes of a phonological analysis , knowledge of a particular language was not necessary . He also confirmed that , although the conversation recorded on the audiotapes was in NORP , he and his colleague only had samples of the voice of the applicant speaking NORP . However , in his opinion that did not make much difference .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the court to order an new expert examination of the voices on the audiotapes . The defence submitted that the voice on the audiotape was not the applicant \u2019s but that of another person , allegedly PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In order to rebut the findings of the expert report relied on by the prosecution , the defence lawyer asked the court to call CARDINAL phonologists , Ms GPE and Ms LOC . They were summoned to court and on CARDINAL DATE they testified that the methods of phonological analysis employed by PERSON and Mr GPE were questionable and that their conclusions were unreliable . In their submission , Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON had not used State - approved methods of voice recognition but had relied on their own method , which was unreliable . They produced to the court a report criticising the findings of PERSON and Mr PERSON ; that report was added by the court to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in view of the contradictory nature of the conclusions reached by PERSON , Mr GPE and PERSON , the court ordered an additional analysis of the audiotapes . The defence lawyers asked the court to include PERSON in the expert team , but the court rejected that request on the ground that she had already given her opinion on the subject in the capacity of a \u201c specialist \u201d ( \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 ) . The court assigned CARDINAL experts , including Mr PERSON , the same expert who had drafted the first report , proposed by the prosecution , and Mr Serdyukov , proposed by the defence . CARDINAL experts were appointed on the court \u2019s initiative : Mr GPE and PERSON ( the latter had also taken part in the first analysis ) .", "CARDINAL . The defence contested the appointment of PERSON and PERSON PERSON . The defence cast doubt on the impartiality of these experts , in that Mr PERSON \u2019s wife had previously worked for the applicant and had been fired by him , and PERSON was a member of the NORP security service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard evidence from the experts Mr PERSON , PERSON Serdyukov and Ms T. S. Kikalishvili . The court also heard CARDINAL witnesses , namely PERSON PERSON and PERSON . Mr PERSON confirmed that he had known Mr PERSON and his wife since DATE . She had worked at the reception desk at a casino owned by the applicant . In DATE she had been fired on the direct orders of the applicant . Mr PERSON had then called Mr PERSON and explained that her dismissal had not been his decision , but that of the applicant . Mr PERSON confirmed the statement by PERSON PERSON about Mr PERSON \u2019s wife and her dismissal from the casino .", "DATE . The court refused to discharge PERSON and PERSON . As a result of the new analysis , PERSON and PERSON found that the voice on the audiotape belonged to the applicant . The CARDINAL other experts came to the opposite conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , the court ordered a third expert analysis of the audiotapes , with a view to eliminating discrepancies in the earlier findings . The analysis was entrusted to Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON and PERSON , who had participated in the previous examination , and CARDINAL new experts : Mr NORP , a NORP - speaking expert , proposed by the defence , and an anonymous expert , proposed by the prosecution , whose name was given only as \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d . The defence asked the court to disclose the identity of \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d or to dismiss her from the expert team , because in such circumstances it was unable to challenge her credentials .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . The court and the parties questioned several witnesses , namely the experts Mr NORP , PERSON PERSON and \u201c PERSON \u201d . The latter was questioned through a system of audio teleconferencing . The applicant was present at that hearing and was able to put questions to the witnesses . The defence challenged Mr PERSON , alleging that he was biased , but the court refused to grant their request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court decided to discontinue the phonological examination of the audiotapes . The court noted that since Mr NORP was a NORP national he could not be held legally responsible for false testimony and could not therefore act as an expert in the proceedings . The court also observed that the defence lawyers could not ascertain the personal credentials and professional competence of \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court declared that the examination of evidence was over and asked the parties how much time they needed to prepare their final submissions . The defence requested DATE ; the prosecution requested DATE . The court decided to start hearing the final submissions on TIME DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the prosecutor submitted an additional phonological analysis of the audiotapes prepared by the same anonymous expert , \u201c A. PERSON \u201d . Despite the objections raised by the defence , the court admitted the report in evidence and included it in the case file . However , the court refused to reopen the examination of evidence . The report of \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d was added to the case file without examination by the parties . The court rejected a request by the applicant \u2019s lawyers to disclose the contents of the report . At TIME the court discontinued the examination of evidence and proceeded to hear the parties\u2019 final submissions .", "CARDINAL . The court also heard the audio recording of a conversation between Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , made by the latter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court had ordered an expert examination of the recording in order to identify the voices on the audiotapes , but it later cancelled the examination .", "CARDINAL . Several witnesses for the prosecution , including Ms ORG , PERSON PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , did not appear at the hearing . At the beginning of the trial the court asked the parties whether the proceedings should continue in the absence of the above witnesses . The prosecutor supported the idea of continuing the proceedings in the absence of those witnesses . The applicant \u2019s counsel , PERSON ORG , did not oppose the commencement of the proceedings , but asked the court that the witnesses be summoned through the channels of international judicial cooperation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter rogatory to the NORP authorities asking them to assist in summoning several witnesses , namely PERSON , Ms ORG , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice of GPE informed the President of ORG that PERSON , Ms ORG and PERSON were not able to go to GPE to appear before the court . The Deputy Minister also explained that they had all retracted the statements they had previously given to the NORP prosecution authorities .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the prosecutor requested leave to read out written depositions by PERSON , PERSON , PERSON PERSON and PERSON , made to the investigator at the pre - trial stage ( see paragraphs DATE CARDINAL above ) . The defence objected , referring , inter alia , to LAW . They submitted that the applicant had been deprived of his right to cross - examine witnesses against him . The defence stressed that they had asked the investigator to carry out face - to - face questioning of these witnesses but that the investigator had refused . In those circumstances , the written depositions by those witnesses should have been declared inadmissible . Despite that objection , on DATE the court decided to admit the written depositions and to read them out at the trial .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial the court questioned several other witnesses , in particular Mr PERSON , PERSON and Mr PERSON . Their testimony can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON handed over to Mr PERSON documents belonging to Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON , explaining that he had received them in the applicant \u2019s office on CARDINAL DATE . These documents were later seized by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON met PERSON again and suggested that he file a complaint with the police about the events of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . PERSON refused , allegedly for fear of reprisals by the applicant and his family . Knowing that PERSON might refuse to tell the police the true story of his abduction , Mr PERSON recorded their conversation on CARDINAL audiotapes using a dictaphone . In DATE Mr PERSON gave those tapes to the police ( see paragraph DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . Ms ORG testified that on DATE her friend Ms ORG had called her , explained the situation and asked her to find Mr PERSON . PERSON met PERSON and relayed the information . During their conversation PERSON confirmed that he had masterminded the abduction of the applicant \u2019s father . He then called the applicant and they agreed to exchange the applicant \u2019s father for the hostages taken by the applicant , namely PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and her son .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s driver , who had been present at the time of the latter \u2019s abduction by PERSON and PERSON men testified that the applicant \u2019s father had been kidnapped from his car on TIME CARDINAL August CARDINAL . In TIME the driver was invited to the applicant \u2019s office , where he was shown \u201c CARDINAL NORP men \u201d and asked whether he recognised any of the men who had abducted the applicant \u2019s father . He replied that he did not .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a former girl - friend of PERSON , and her mother , testified that they had heard from other relatives that PERSON and PERSON PERSON had been abducted on the applicant \u2019s orders . A statement in similar terms was given by PERSON , a relative of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON senior , the father of the applicant , testified before the court . He described the circumstances of his kidnapping by PERSON PERSON . He also confirmed that PERSON had spoken to his son , the applicant , by telephone .", "CARDINAL . The court heard evidence from a number of policemen who had visited the applicant \u2019s office on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . The court was told that during TIME CARDINAL August CARDINAL the applicant had spoken on the telephone with the deputy chief investigator of the Vyborgskiy District of GPE . On TIME that police officer , together with a colleague , had arrived at the applicant \u2019s office . However , the policemen denied that they had been involved in the abduction of PERSON and others .", "CARDINAL . The court questioned CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s employees , who , according to the prosecution , had assisted him in the abduction and murder and had found the men who had abducted PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON . The applicant \u2019s employees testified that on DATE the police had provided them with certain information about the progress of the official investigation . The applicant \u2019s employees also submitted that they had been in permanent contact with the police officers in charge of the investigation throughout CARDINAL and DATE . However , they all denied that they had been involved in the abduction , beating and murder of the victims . They submitted that they had never instructed anyone to abduct PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , or to detain PERSON and her son , and had never received any such instructions from the applicant . They also denied that they had seen the victims in the applicant \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . The court questioned several other indirect witnesses . However , their statements were not used against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG gave judgment in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The court started by describing the applicant \u2019s own account of the events at issue . However , in the court \u2019s opinion , that account was rebutted by other evidence . In support of that conclusion it referred , firstly , to the statements by Ms ORG , PERSON PERSON , PERSON PERSON and Ms GPE obtained by the investigator and read out at the trial ( see paragraphs DATE CARDINAL above ) . In the court \u2019s opinion , those statements confirmed the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . As to the written statements by Ms ORG , PERSON PERSON and PERSON PERSON , submitted by the defence ( see paragraphs DATE above ) , the court declared that evidence inadmissible as having been obtained in breach of the domestic legislation . The court noted that those persons had already been questioned by the investigator as witnesses . In the court \u2019s view , their subsequent examination by the defence lawyers could not therefore be recognised as \u201c lawful collection of evidence \u201d within the meaning of the domestic legislation . Consequently , the court declared those statements inadmissible . The court further noted that the statement by the applicant \u2019s brother had been obtained by his defence lawyers in accordance with the law . However , the court noted that the veracity of the statement could not be confirmed in accordance with LAW , namely at an oral hearing before the court . On that basis the court declared this evidence inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the judgment referred to the testimonies of Ms PERSON and Mr PERSON , the relatives of PERSON Kakushadze . They testified about what PERSON had told them about the events of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . Thirdly , the court referred to the recordings of the conversation between PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON , made by the latter in DATE . Fourthly , the judgment referred to the testimony of Ms GPE , the former girl - friend of PERSON . She testified before the court about what Mr PERSON had told her about the events . Fifthly , the court analysed the testimony of PERSON , who had heard the telephone conversation between the applicant and PERSON , and who had spoken to Ms ORG and PERSON about the applicant \u2019s involvement in the abduction of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court referred to the phone calls recorded at Ms ORG \u2019s flat on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , The court accepted the conclusions of the experts for the prosecution ( PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr GPE ) , who identified the voice on the audiotape as belonging to the applicant , and rejected the findings of the other experts . In particular , the court discounted the arguments of PERSON , PERSON , Ms PERSON and Mr Serdyukov as unreliable . The judgment contained no reference to the findings of the anonymous expert \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The judgment also contained references to various other items of hearsay and circumstantial evidence , such as the testimonies of the police officers and reports of the examination of the personal belongings of CARDINAL of the victims .", "CARDINAL . As a result , ORG found the applicant guilty of unlawful entry into a house and the abduction and illegal detention of Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The applicant was acquitted on other counts , including the charges of murder . The court fully acquitted the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , including PERSON and PERSON . Mr PERSON was found guilty of illegal possession of firearms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers lodged an appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE and DATE they filed additional written observations with the appeal court . Their grounds of appeal may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The defence lawyers indicated that the court had misinterpreted or even distorted the testimony of many witnesses , as well as the content of the telephone conversations recorded by the police . Nothing in Mr PERSON \u2019s and PERSON testimony indicated that the applicant had organised the abduction of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON . On the contrary , PERSON and PERSON had on many occasions in their testimony referred to \u201c coppers \u201d and \u201c the nick \u201d , which suggested that the police had been involved in the case . Both Ms PERSON and PERSON mentioned that the \u201c cops \u201d had arrived at PERSON flat in the company of PERSON , and that it was PERSON who had called and threatened PERSON with death . The defence also pointed to certain logical discrepancies in the testimony of various witnesses and challenged their credibility .", "CARDINAL . The defence complained that the court had failed to summon Mr PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and Ms PERSON . At the same time the court declared inadmissible written statements by those witnesses , obtained by the defence , in which they had retracted their previous statements to the investigative authorities . The defence also indicated that the court had refused to obtain from the prosecutor \u2019s office the results of the questioning of PERSON , which had been carried out by the NORP authorities at the request of the NORP prosecution authorities on DATE . That information had been added to the case file by the prosecution during the trial , without the defence having been informed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the evidence obtained as a result of wiretapping , the defence complained that they had had no opportunity to challenge its admissibility , because the court had refused to give them access to the materials authorising the wiretapping . The defence further indicated that the prosecution had produced only a selective record of the relevant telephone conversations . Firstly , the defence had had access to CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL audiotapes made by the police , whereas the prosecution had submitted the verbatim record of all QUANTITY tapes . Secondly , a period of TIME of wiretapping ( TIME DATE and CARDINAL p.m. on DATE ) was missing , whereas the police had recorded all the conversations which had taken place within that period . In its decision the court had not mentioned the testimony of the police officers involved in the wiretapping operation , which was of crucial importance for the case .", "CARDINAL . The defence also contested the court \u2019s findings as to the identity of the man who had threatened PERSON and her son with death in the telephone conversation of CARDINAL DATE . The court concluded that the voice on the tape belonged to the applicant . That conclusion was based on the findings by the NORP experts PERSON , Mr GPE and Mr GPE . The defence pointed out that those experts did not speak NORP and had had at their disposal only samples of the applicant \u2019s voice when speaking in NORP ; moreover , the impartiality of those experts was open to doubt for the reasons adduced by the defence before the court . The defence further complained that the court had disregarded the opinion of those experts proposed by the defence , had refused to entrust the analysis of the audiotapes to Ms LOC and had discharged Mr NORP . In their opinion , the court \u2019s assessment of the contradicting expert opinions was significantly affected by a report by an anonymous expert , \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d , to which the defence had had no access during the trial .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the audiotapes recorded by Mr PERSON in DATE , the defence lawyers indicated that the court had failed to establish whether the recorded voice actually belonged to PERSON . No analysis had ever been carried out to that effect . Moreover , PERSON PERSON could not explain to the court why he had handed over to the investigative authorities only copies of the audiotapes , and not the original records . In those circumstances the court ought to have disregarded the contents of those tapes .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the grounds of appeal submitted by the applicant \u2019s lawyers , PERSON , as a victim , lodged a separate appeal against the judgment . PERSON submitted that he had never seen the applicant or spoken to him . According to PERSON , he had spent some time in the applicant \u2019s office on DATE , but he had not seen Mr PERSON or PERSON PERSON there . The man who had hit him in the applicant \u2019s office was not the applicant . He submitted that the story he had told Mr PERSON , as recorded on the audiotape , was untrue and that he had recounted it under serious pressure from Mr PERSON , a cousin of the deceased PERSON PERSON , and his relatives . He had been instructed what to say by PERSON PERSON and by the investigators .", "CARDINAL . Ms Margvelashvili , as a victim , lodged a similar appeal . She indicated that her initial statements , referred to by the trial court as evidence incriminating the applicant , had been given under duress . She explained that PERSON and PERSON had been arrested at her flat by police officers who were led by PERSON . TIME a police officer in uniform had come to her flat and taken documents belonging to PERSON and PERSON PERSON . On TIME she had spoken to Mr Berkadze by telephone , not the applicant . No one had ever mentioned the applicant \u2019s name in connection with the abduction of PERSON and PERSON Kakushadze . She had given testimony against the applicant because she had been persuaded by the investigators that the applicant had ordered the killing of Mr PERSON and PERSON , but she now understood that the applicant was innocent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the conviction in the main , excluding several aspects on formal grounds ( in particular , the episode concerning the abduction of PERSON PERSON , and the illegal entry into PERSON house ) . As a result , the sentence was reduced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Ms Margvelashvili appeared before the appeal court as a victim of the crimes of which the applicant was accused . She repeated the arguments stated in her grounds of appeal . However , the appeal court upheld the findings of the first - instance court , referring again to the written depositions given by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON at the pre - trial stage , the recording of the telephone conversation of DATE between PERSON and the applicant , the recording of the conversation between Mr PERSON and PERSON , written and oral submissions by PERSON and Mr PERSON and certain pieces of circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution . The court of appeal noted that the wiretapping of the telephone line of Ms ORG \u2019s flat had been lawfully authorised by the President of GPE for the period DATE . As regards the depositions submitted by the defence , which were declared inadmissible by the trial court , the appeal court noted that \u201c the trial court [ had made ] the correct legal assessment \u201d and declared them inadmissible . Further , the appeal court dismissed the complaint regarding the trial court \u2019s failure to summon PERSON and its discharge of Mr NORP . The appeal court further noted that the first - instance court had not referred to the report prepared by the anonymous expert \u201c A. P. Ivanova \u201d and had not breached any procedural rules by accepting her report . It also noted that the report had been admitted to the case file before the end of the trial . As to the grounds of appeal by PERSON and PERSON , the court of appeal held that \u201c their arguments ... were untenable , since their testimony had been thoroughly examined by the [ first instance ] court , it analysed them in its judgment , the findings of the [ first instance ] court are duly reasoned \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Operational and Search Activities Act of DATE sets down the rules for \u201c operational and search activities \u201d ( \u201c OSAs \u201d \u2013 such as collecting information , infiltrating the criminal milieu , conducting undercover surveillance and intercepting correspondence ) by the law - enforcement bodies , in particular the police .

Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure of CARDINAL ( \u201c the new CCrP \u201d ) provides that evidence obtained in breach of the provisions of the Code is inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . The old CCrP provided that the duty to obtain evidence fell to the investigative bodies ; however , the defence had the right to produce evidence to the investigative authorities and the courts ( Article CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL of the new CCrP formulated the rules on collecting evidence as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the course of the criminal proceedings evidence shall be collected by ... the investigator , the prosecutor and the court by means of investigative measures .", "CARDINAL .
