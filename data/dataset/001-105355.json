The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr D. , a businessman from GPE informed the police that since DATE he and his CARDINAL business partners had been paying a DATE fee to a local gang for \u201c protection \u201d . Mr NORP gave the police audio records of his telephone conversations with the gangsters , which he had secretly made when the \u201c fee \u201d had become too burdensome for him . The police set up an undercover operation . Police agents secretly observed the meetings between the CARDINAL businessmen and the gangsters and recorded their conversations . At the last meeting , which took place on DATE , the businessmen handed to the emissaries of the gang the money they had earlier received from the police . After the receipt of the money the CARDINAL emissaries of the gang were arrested and the money ( which had been previously marked by the police ) was seized from them . CARDINAL of the alleged gangsters was PERSON , the applicant \u2019s brother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with large - scale extortion as part of an organised criminal group ( LAW ( a ) and ( b ) of LAW of GPE ) . However , because his whereabouts were unknown , on DATE the case against the applicant was separated from the case of other members of the group . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was put on a wanted list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a detention warrant in respect of the applicant . It referred to the gravity of the charges and the risk of his absconding , as well as to the fact that the applicant was on the wanted list . The detention warrant did not specify the period of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested at his house in LOC . On the same date he was detained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The detention warrant referred to the gravity of the charges and the risk of the applicant absconding , re - offending or interfering with the investigation . There is no information on whether the applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE considered the detention request lodged by the prosecution . The defence argued that there were no grounds for continued detention since the applicant had no criminal record , permanently resided in GPE , and had not tried to flee from the investigation \u2013 at the time when he had been on the wanted list he had been living in his DATE house in LOC with his minor children and had not been aware of the proceedings against him . The defence also contended that the charges against the applicant were unfounded and noted long periods of inactivity on the part of the investigation authorities during previous detention periods .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court rejected those arguments and extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court held that the applicant had been accused of grave crimes and that he had to take part in several investigative activities . The court also found that the applicant would flee from justice given that he had previously been on the wanted list , and had been arrested in GPE . There is no information on whether the applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE holding that there were no grounds to amend or revoke the preventive measure , given the gravity of the charges and the risk of his absconding . There is no information on whether the applicant appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was completed and the case file was sent to ORG ( hereinafter DATE ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled a preparatory hearing . In its decision to hold a preparatory hearing it also ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention should remain unchanged . The court neither specified the time - limit for his detention nor gave the reasons for such decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the preparatory hearing was held . The defence filed a request for release stating that the decision ordering the applicant \u2019s detention pending investigation had expired and that he was therefore being unlawfully detained . They also noted that the decision of DATE did not contain any reasoning . ORG rejected the request referring to the gravity of the charges and to the fact that the court had not yet assessed the evidence . As to the subject matter of the accusations against the applicant , ORG remitted the case to the prosecution because the bill of indictment had been issued improperly and was not ready for examination at the trial . The prosecution was given DATE to modify the bill of indictment . The ruling of ORG referred to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( CCrP ) ( \u201c Types of decision which can be taken at the preparatory hearing \u201d ) , LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( \u201c Returning the case to the prosecutor \u201d ) , and LAW ( \u201c Deciding on the measure of restraint [ during the trial proceedings ] \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution appealed against the part of this decision concerning the remittal . The defence appealed against the refusal to release the applicant . The appeals were lodged on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant \u2019s statement of appeal against the detention order of DATE was received by ORG on DATE . On DATE the applicant was handed a copy of the appeal by the prosecution . The case was received by ORG on DATE . The appeal hearing was scheduled for DATE . However , since the applicant \u2019s lawyers failed to produce powers of attorney , the appeal hearing was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the prosecution \u2019s appeal and referred the applicant \u2019s case back to ORG for a preparatory hearing . The appeal of the defence was dismissed for the same reasons as given by ORG in its decision of DATE . ORG decision also referred to the provision in the ORG establishing a default DATE detention period after the referral of a case to the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second preparatory hearing was held . The defence filed a new application for release . In addition to the arguments mentioned earlier they referred to the unreasonable period of detention and the lack of special diligence during the proceedings . ORG once again ordered the case to be remitted to the prosecutor and rejected the request for release , relying on the same arguments as in the previous decision , namely the gravity of the charges and the need to carry out additional investigative activities . The ruling contained references to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the CCrP. Both prosecution and defence appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the case to ORG for another preparatory hearing . It also upheld the decision of ORG regarding the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled a preliminary hearing , and held that the applicant should stay in custody . It does not appear that the court indicated in its ruling any time - limit for the applicant \u2019s further detention .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the defence appealed against the ruling of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a preliminary hearing and scheduled a hearing on the merits . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for release and confirmed that the applicant should remain detained pending trial , without , however , indicating any time - limit for the detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . They claimed that the DATE time - limit for detention pending trial had expired on DATE and that the applicant was therefore being detained unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial was extended for DATE because judgment on the merits had not yet been delivered . ORG referred to the gravity of the charges and to the fact that the court had not yet assessed the evidence . The defence appealed . The statement of appeal against the decision of DATE was dated DATE , although it is unclear whether it was introduced on that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed appeals against the decisions of CARDINAL , DATE and DATE holding that the findings of ORG had been correct .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE his detention was extended for DATE , with the same reasoning as before . In support of his assertion the applicant submitted a copy of the ruling of ORG of GPE of that date , signed by Judge PERSON The defence appealed against that ruling ; the applicant submitted a copy of the statement of appeal with ORG stamp on it confirming the date of introduction ( DATE ) and the incoming mail number ( no . DATE ) . The applicant claimed that the appeal court had never considered the complaint . The Government claimed that on DATE the applicant \u2019s detention had not been extended , and that the applicant \u2019s detention was still covered by the detention order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted the judgment in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was initiated jointly with the cases of other members of the organised criminal group , including the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON They were all accused of large - scale extortion . Owing to the failure to find the applicant , his case was separated from the case of the other members of the group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG convicted Mr M. of large - scale extortion as part of an organised criminal group ( LAW ( a ) and ( b ) of LAW of GPE ) . ORG was sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges comprising a professional judge ( PERSON , the president ) , and CARDINAL lay judges .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of DATE started with the finding that Mr PERSON had committed extortion in concert with \u201c unidentified persons \u201d . In relating the facts of the case the court once mentioned the applicant \u2019s name . Specifically , on page CARDINAL of the judgment the court held that an unidentified member of the gang had mentioned in a telephone conversation with CARDINAL of the victims that \u201c [ the applicant ] was unhappy that the victims had not transferred the money to [ Mr M. ] at his first request \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s name was also mentioned in the part of the judgment summarising the witness statements . In particular , on page CARDINAL of the judgment in connection with the testimony of PERSON , who denied his or his brother \u2019s involvement in the criminal group . ORG , however , found that Mr M. \u2019s testimony was refuted by the incriminating evidence , namely witness statements . Some of the witnesses , as well as confirming the role of PERSON in the gang , mentioned that the applicant had been an important person in the gang and participated in negotiations as a person of authority ( page CARDINAL ) . They further mentioned that the applicant had told the victims that \u201c they had to pay him in order not to pay other persons he had talked to \u201d ( page CARDINAL ) , that the money was collected from the businessmen for the applicant ( page CARDINAL) , that \u201c [ the applicant ] had been introduced [ to them ] as a leader of the criminal group \u201d ( page CARDINAL) , and that the victims \u201c had paid mobile telephone bills for [ the applicant ] \u201d ( page CARDINAL) . ORG also examined information on the telephone communications of PERSON and the applicant and referred to them in its judgments ( without , however , indicating their importance for the conviction ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was heard by Judge PERSON of ORG ( the same judge who had earlier presided over the trial in the case of PERSON ) . The first hearing on the merits took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty . He did not deny that he knew the victims and that he had had some dealings with them . Namely , he confirmed that he had met with them several times DATE . However , he denied that his involvement in their business had been of a criminal character . He also denied having received from the victims or from PERSON any criminal payments . He further denied the participation of PERSON , his brother , in any criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . At the following hearings the court heard testimony of CARDINAL witnesses for the defence , NORP and PERSON , who both denied any involvement of the applicant or PERSON M. in the crimes . They testified that the money had been paid by the victims to Mr M. as a rental fee for storage space on LOC owned by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The victims ( Mr NORP and his CARDINAL partners ) , on the contrary , testified that in DATE they had met with the applicant who had offered them criminal \u201c protection \u201d from other gangs and fixed a DATE fee for it . At one of the meetings with the applicant another gangster had threatened the victims with beatings . In DATE the victims had been paying the money to the gang , generally not to the applicant directly but to other gangsters , in particular to Mr M. However , the victims had understood that the money had been destined for the applicant . The victims had had several other meetings with the applicant in different places where the amount of the DATE fee had been discussed . Other members of the gang had always referred to the applicant as a person of authority . Throughout that period the applicant had been personally involved in the negotiations with other gangs .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined audio records secretly made by CARDINAL of the victims and later by the police during the surveillance operation . Although the applicant was not identified as CARDINAL of the speakers on those audio records , other gangsters had often referred to somebody named PERSON ( which is the applicant \u2019s first name ) who had supposedly been a person of authority within the gang . The applicant claimed that they had probably meant another person also named GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also examined other evidence . Witness PERSON confirmed that several meetings between the applicant and the victims had taken place . Witness Ya . , an accountant for the victims , confirmed that CARDINAL of the alleged members of the applicant \u2019s gang had been formally employed by the victims and had been receiving a salary , without , however , doing any actual work . She did not know about any official business transactions or rental agreements between the applicant and the victims . The prosecution also produced the applicant \u2019s and other members of the gang \u2019s telephone bills which had been paid by the victims , and some other circumstantial evidence .", "CARDINAL . During the court proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case the defence requested that Mr PERSON be summoned . He explained to the courts that Mr M. \u2019s testimony was important . The applicant claimed that according to the victims the money obtained from them had been passed to him by PERSON and that the examination of the latter \u201c could shed light on these events \u201d . The defence also alleged that without proving the fact that the money had been passed to the applicant he could not be found guilty and that PERSON had to be summoned as all the witnesses referred to him in their testimony . The trial court rejected the request holding that the court had not yet assessed all the evidence .", "CARDINAL . Some time later the defence requested the admission in evidence of PERSON written statement obtained by CARDINAL of the defence lawyers who had visited Mr M. in prison and had interviewed him . In those statements Mr PERSON had denied his and his brother \u2019s ( the applicant ) involvement in the gang . The court refused on the ground that the written statement of PERSON had not been \u201c duly certified \u201d and it was unclear whether that statement had indeed been taken from PERSON", "CARDINAL . The defence also requested leave to examine the victims of the impugned extortion for a second time , owing to inconsistencies in their earlier submissions . The request was not granted .", "CARDINAL . At some point in the proceedings the defence challenged the judge claiming that she was not impartial . They contended that the same judge had earlier found the applicant \u2019s brother guilty in a case closely connected with the applicant \u2019s case . Moreover , the defence noted that the trial judge was the same judge who had earlier remitted the case to the prosecutor and might therefore have been prejudiced in this case . However , the judge refused to withdraw . On DATE occasions the defence objected to questions put by the judge to the applicant , claiming that those questions were favourable to the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . It took the trial court CARDINAL hearings to examine the evidence produced by the parties . The hearings took place on CARDINAL and DATE , and on CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE . The last hearing on the merits was held on DATE . On DATE the court heard the last witness , examined certain written materials in the case file and examined the requests of the defence . The judge , having decided that the examination of evidence was over , invited the parties to proceed with their final submissions . The defence objected to ending the examination of the evidence without summoning Mr M. The objection was rejected . The defence then requested an adjournment for DATE to prepare their final submissions . The judge ordered a TIME break and then proceeded to the final submissions . These were made after a TIME break . All CARDINAL lawyers for the applicant were able to make oral submissions , in addition to their written submissions which they had handed to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of extortion and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and confiscation of criminally obtained assets . In the opening paragraphs of the judgment ORG found that the applicant and his brother , PERSON , who had earlier been convicted by the same court on DATE , as well as several other unidentified people , were members of an organised criminal group created to extort large sums of money from local businessmen . DATE the applicant had met with those businessmen on several occasions . He had offered them protection from other gangs in exchange for a DATE fee . The money had usually been passed from the victims to the applicant through other members of the group , including the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON In addition , the victims had been required to pay an unidentified member of the gang \u2019s telephone bills and later those of the applicant himself . The judgment contained a detailed account of all payments which had passed through PERSON to the applicant and of the amounts of the telephone bills paid by the victims . It also described several episodes when unidentified members of the gang had claimed additional payments on the applicant \u2019s behalf .", "CARDINAL . The court further analysed the testimony of witnesses NORP and PERSON examined at the request of the defence . The judge noted that although both NORP and PERSON had referred to the existence of a rental agreement between the victims and the applicant , it had allegedly been concluded in the name of a firm which had ceased to exist by that time and had never been signed by the applicant . Furthermore , the court did not have a copy of that agreement and other evidence in the case file contradicted the submissions of NORP and PERSON , in a telephone conversation between CARDINAL of the victims and a member of the gang , the latter had instructed the former to tell the police that the payments had been made within a rental agreement . As a result , the judge dismissed the testimony of NORP and PERSON as unreliable .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed . In particular , they drew the court \u2019s attention to the fact that at the trial the victims had acknowledged that they had been giving the money not to the applicant but to other persons . The applicant \u2019s lawyers insisted that the trial court \u2019s failure to summon and question PERSON made the trial unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal by the defence . It amended the judgment of ORG because of changes in GPE . The confiscation order in respect of criminally obtained assets was thus quashed . However , the remainder of the judgment of DATE was upheld .", "CARDINAL . After arrest the suspect can be placed in custody \u201c pending investigation \u201d . LAW CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the new CCrP ( of DATE , in force since DATE ) requires a judicial decision by a district court on a reasoned request for detention by a prosecutor , supported by appropriate evidence , before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended . Detention \u201c pending investigation \u201d should not exceed DATE ( LAW DATE ) . The period of detention \u201c pending investigation \u201d is calculated up to DATE when the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . From the time the prosecutor sends the case to the trial court , the defendant \u2019s detention is \u201c pending trial \u201d . Upon receipt of the case file the judge must determine , in particular , whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The period of detention \u201c pending trial \u201d is calculated up to the date on which the judgment is given . It may not normally exceed DATE , but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences , the trial court may approve CARDINAL or more extensions of no longer than DATE each ( LAW and CARDINAL of the CCrP ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge can return the case to the prosecutor to remedy the defects impeding the trial ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the CCrP ) , for instance if the judge has identified serious deficiencies in the bill of indictment ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) or a copy of it was not served on the accused . The judge must require that the prosecutor comply within DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and must also decide on a preventive measure in respect of the accused ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By Federal Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , Article CARDINAL was amended to the effect that , if appropriate , the judge could extend the term of detention with due regard to the time - limits set forth in LAW", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the court of appeal has to set the date , time and place of an appeal hearing and inform the parties accordingly . The parties should be informed DATE in advance of the date of the appeal hearing . The court has to decide whether or not the detainee should be brought to the court of appeal in person . That Article also regulates the arrangements governing a detainee \u2019s appearance in appeal proceedings in person and his or her appearance via video - link .", "CARDINAL . For further details concerning NORP legislation on pre - trial detention , detention pending trial and remittal of the case to the prosecution for correcting defects of the bill of indictment , see the cases of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL DATE ) and PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides that \u201c factual circumstances established in a court judgment ... which have acquired legal force , should be accepted by a court ... without additional verification . However , such a court judgment can not predetermine the question of guilt of those persons who had not participated in [ those ] proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE of the CCrP describe situations in which a judge can not sit on the bench in a particular case . The judge must withdraw if he is an injured party in that criminal case , if he has already participated in that criminal case in a different capacity ( for example , as a representative of a party , as a witness , etc . ) , if he is a relative of any participant in the criminal proceedings , or \u201c if there are other circumstances which give reason to believe that [ the judge ] is personally , directly or indirectly , interested in the outcome of the criminal case \u201d . The judge whose impartiality is in doubt must withdraw of his own motion ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; alternatively , a party to the proceedings may challenge a judge on those grounds ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides that the same judge can not sit on the bench in the trial court and later in the court of appeal or in the supervisory review court in the same case . The same judge who sat on the bench during the first trial can not remain in the composition if the case is remitted for re - trial . However , there are no rules governing the participation of the same judge in different , yet related , criminal cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b"]}
