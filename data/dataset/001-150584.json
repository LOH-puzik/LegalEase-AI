NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE , habitually resides in ORG , and is currently detained in the PERSON prison . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL others were charged with aggravated robbery on the basis of the suspicion that , on DATE , as an organised group , they had forcibly entered private forest grounds , inflicted injuries to a guard to which he later succumbed , appropriated CARDINAL tractors and attempted to appropriate a third , and fled the crime scene once it had proved impossible to load the first CARDINAL tractors onto a lorry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the others were indicted to stand trial on the above charges in ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) . At the same time , a warrant was issued for the applicant \u2019s arrest , which was followed by another similar warrant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time , ORG was sent a letter dated DATE which was purportedly written and signed by the applicant , in which the author described what may be surmised to be the applicant \u2019s version of events . The charges against the applicant were denied \u2012 their factual basis , in particular , being disputed \u2012 and it was alleged that the applicant had gone into hiding out of fear for his life . In his submission to the ORG , the applicant has denied the authenticity of this document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision was taken that the applicant , who was still missing , should be tried in his absence ( konanie proti u\u0161l\u00e9mu ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings at which it took and assessed complex written , oral and expert evidence , including a pre - trial deposition by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s coaccused ( A. ) incriminating the applicant . The applicant \u2019s court - appointed lawyer inspected the case file on her own initiative and attended all but the first of these hearings .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearing of DATE , on DATE ORG found the applicant and his coaccused guilty .", "The pre - trial deposition of A. was instrumental in establishing the guilt of the applicant and he was sentenced for DATE and a half years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . All parties appealed ( odvolanie ) to ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) .", "In the applicant \u2019s case , his lawyer appealed on his behalf , arguing inter alia that the first - instance court had failed to take any notice of the applicant \u2019s letter of DATE , that A. was not a credible witness , that CARDINAL of the remaining co - accused had merely presumed that the applicant had been present at the crime scene , and that the other CARDINAL had not seen him there .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer also filed observations in reply to the appeal by the prosecution , in which she addressed the evidentiary situation and submitted that they had misconstrued it to the applicant \u2019s disadvantage .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the appeals on DATE , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer . Following the hearing , on DATE , it corrected certain technical errors in the first - instance judgment and reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL and DATE on the grounds that , combined with a previous sentence , the penalty imposed by ORG was in excess of that permitted by statute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a warrant against the applicant for the enforcement of his sentence and ordered that he be taken to prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE and on DATE was remanded by ORG ( PERSON ) pending extradition to GPE in connection with the above proceedings and conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Justice of GPE allowed the applicant \u2019s extradition but at the same time suspended its implementation pending the outcome of unrelated criminal proceedings against him in GPE and , potentially , the service of his sentence imposed in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE the NORP courts found the applicant guilty and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , following which a new decision was taken to suspend his extradition to GPE pending service of this sentence .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , DATE and DATE \u2012 while still detained in GPE \u2012 he had asked the NORP prison authorities CARDINAL times to provide him with NORP criminal legislation , but to no avail . In support of this allegation , he submitted CARDINAL original handwritten requests . These indicate neither any addressee nor anything to show that they were actually submitted and duly received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that he be served with a copy of the firstinstance judgment . So he was , on DATE , albeit with no instructions ( pou\u010denie ) regarding any possible remedies available to him in the specific circumstances of his case .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant made a submission to ORG formulated as an appeal , only to have it dismissed by ORG on DATE as out of time .", "In that respect , ORG observed that the applicant had been convicted in his absence , that the conviction had become final and binding and that , under LAW applicable at that time ( PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended - \u201c the DATE ORG \u201d ) , persons convicted in their absence by a final and binding judgment had no right of appeal .", "At the same time , ORG noted that the applicant was at liberty to assert his rights by way of an application for a complaint in the interest of the law ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 pre poru\u0161enie z\u00e1kona ) to be lodged on his behalf by ORG or the Minister of ORG and by a request for reopening of proceedings ( obnova konania ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , a written version of ORG decision of DATE was not served on him until DATE .", "However , according to a postal delivery confirmation slip submitted by the Government , which bears the applicant \u2019s signature , that decision was served on and received by him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a request for reopening of proceedings under LAW applicable at that time ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended \u2012 \u201c DATE ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which he and his lawyer amended on DATE and DATE , respectively . They submitted that the applicant had only learned about the events underlying the charges from television reports ; that he had not been present at the crime scene ; that at the request of CARDINAL of his associates he had only acted as a lookout nearby ; that at the time of the impugned events he had not known the remaining CARDINAL co - accused ; that they had implicated him to serve their own interests ; and that he had left GPE in fear for his life after he had learned that CARDINAL of his co - accused had been planning to \u201c take out \u201d a witness .", "In addition , the applicant submitted that at no stage of the proceedings had he been heard , and that although legal representation was mandatory , he had had none at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , which was in violation of his right to a fair trial under LAW .", "Moreover , he argued that the sentence had been disproportionate to his actual involvement , and that the submissions of A. made at pre - trial stage should be reexamined before a court .", "In terms of new evidence , the applicant identified a fresh witness and asked that he undergo polygraph testing , and he requested a face - to - face confrontation ( konfront\u00e1cia ) with the other co - accused .", "CARDINAL . The request was dismissed by ORG in a public session ( verejn\u00e9 zasadnutie ) held on DATE and , following the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) , by ORG on DATE .", "Both courts noted that the applicant was serving a DATE sentence in GPE , which was why he could not be present in person . Under the applicable statutory rules , a reopening of proceedings would be warranted only if there was new evidence that could bring about a different outcome . Although the applicant \u2019s testimony would constitute evidence which was new , in view of the evidential situation as a whole , no other outcome could be expected .", "The courts also concluded that , since the witness identified by the applicant had refused to give evidence at the original trial , his testimony did not constitute new evidence , nor would there be any new evidence as a result of the face - to - face confrontation . Moreover , results of polygraph testing were not recognised as evidence under DATE ORG .", "Lastly , it was not new to the court that the applicant had lacked legal representation at the pre - trial stage . However , any objection in this respect should have \u2012 but had not \u2012 been raised by his ORG - appointed lawyer at the trial stage and on appeal .", "There were therefore no grounds for reopening the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentencing by the NORP courts had been recognised in GPE with a view to having the applicant serve the remainder of his sentence there .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s extradition was implemented and he was actually transferred to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP courts then commuted the DATE sentence imposed on the applicant in GPE to two years and DATE because , in combination with the DATE sentence previously imposed in GPE , the overall penalty was in excess of that permitted by statute .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is now serving the reduced sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint under LAW of LAW ( Constitutional Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . At the same time , he requested that a legal - aid lawyer be appointed to represent him .", "As for the substance , the applicant relied on LAW and challenged the dismissal of his request for reopening of proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) arguing that he had never been heard , that he had not had legal representation at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings \u2012 despite such representation being mandatory \u2012 and that the principle of equality of arms had been disregarded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible , essentially relying on its doctrine that the application of a statute in judicial proceedings in a manner consistent with the applicable procedural rules can not amount to a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms . The complaint was thus manifestly ill - founded and there was no purpose in examining the applicant \u2019s legal - aid request .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant also requested protection of his rights by means of an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) to be lodged on his behalf by the Minister of ORG .", "In a letter of DATE the Ministry informed him that his case was not amenable to the temporal application of the rules of the DATE ORG on appeals on points of law and that , therefore , no such appeal was available .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also requested leave to appeal against the judgment of DATE outside the time - limit . His request was dismissed by ORG as unfounded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG shall decide on complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court .", "CARDINAL . If ORG finds a complaint to be justified , it shall deliver a decision stating that the person \u2019s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph CARDINAL have been violated by a final decision , specific measure or other act and shall quash that decision , measure or act . If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which has violated the [ person \u2019s ] rights or freedoms to take the necessary action . At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order that authority to refrain from violating the [ person \u2019s ] fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL . In its decision on a complaint , ORG may grant appropriate financial compensation to a person whose rights under paragraph CARDINAL have been violated .", "CARDINAL . The liability for damage or other loss of a person who has violated the rights or freedoms as referred to in paragraph CARDINAL shall not be affected by ORG decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The implementation of the above provision of LAW is set out in more detail in sections CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) . Pursuant to its section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c A constitutional complaint shall be lodged within DATE from the date on which the decision in question has become final and binding or on which a measure has been notified or on which a notice of other interference has been given . As regards the measures and other interferences , the above period shall commence when the complainant could have become aware of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of DATE ORG are summarised in PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG entered into force on DATE and wholly replaced the DATE ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW submissions are always to be interpreted according to their content even if they have been given a misleading or erroneous heading . A similar provision existed under DATE ORG ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The rules concerning proceedings against absent defendants are contained in Section ( Oddiel ) CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) in Part CARDINAL ( \u010cas\u0165 ) .", "Under these rules , convicted fugitives have the right to request , within a period of DATE from the date on which they learned of their prosecution or conviction , but in any event within the applicable period of limitation , that their case be re - examined ( op\u00e4tovn\u00e9 prejednanie ) by a court in their presence ( LAW ) .", "If these conditions are met , the previous decision must be quashed and the case re - examined on the basis of the original bill of indictment ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Requests for reopening of proceedings are governed by the provisions of LAW CARDINAL in Part CARDINAL .", "In particular , an order to reopen proceedings concluded with the force of final and binding judgment may be issued if there emerge facts or evidence not known to the court in the original trial which \u2012 either in themselves or in conjunction with facts and evidence known to the court at the original trial \u2012 may result in a different decision as to the accused \u2019s guilt or render the punishment imposed manifestly disproportionate to the gravity of the offence or the circumstances of the offender ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE in appeal no . PERSON , ORG held that if a criminal trial against an absent defendant ended with a final and binding judgment , the guilty party had no right to have the judgment served on him or her and that , if he or she challenged that judgment by way of an appeal , the appeal was to be rejected as out of time .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE in case no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG found that a criminal court had breached LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of the LAW in that it had tried and convicted the complainant in absentia without having properly established whether or not he could be considered a fugitive .", "ORG quashed the conviction , remitted the case to the criminal court for re - examination , ordered the complainant \u2019s immediate release , and awarded him compensation .", "As regards the statutory DATE period for introducing a complaint , ORG held specifically that this period may only commence once the contested decision has been properly served on the complainant and that , as long as this is not the case , the period may not commence ( see decision of DATE published in ORG of ORG under no . PERSON and also the admissibility decisions of DATE and DATE in unrelated cases nos . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL and III . \u00daS DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the context of complaints about judicial proceedings , ORG has \u2012 when determining compliance with the twomonth time - limit under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW \u2012 consistently considered irrelevant the dismissal of ORG requests for an extraordinary appeal to be filed on their behalf . It has instead held the date of the final effect of the contested judicial decisions to be relevant in that context ( see , for example , decision of CARDINAL DATE in the case no . GPE . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , with further references ) . A similar approach is taken with respect to terminated proceedings in relation to which a request for reopening which has been dismissed ( see decision of DATE in the case no .
