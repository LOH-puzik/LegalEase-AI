The applicant indicated that she subsequently took correspondence courses in order to continue her school studies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's parents , acting on their own behalf and as their minor daughter 's legal guardians , applied to ORG to have the decision of ORG set aside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected their application . It considered that , by attending physical education and sports classes in dress that would not enable her to take part in the classes in question , the applicant had failed to comply with the duty to attend classes regularly . It also found that the applicant 's attitude had created an atmosphere of tension within the school and that on the basis of all the factors involved her expulsion from the school had been justified , regardless of the proposal she had made at DATE to wear a hat instead of her headscarf .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's parents appealed against that judgment . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal , on the same grounds as the lower court , finding that the applicant , by behaving as she had done , had overstepped the limits of the right to express and manifest her religious beliefs on the school premises .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's parents lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG d'Etat , relying , inter alia , on their daughter 's right to freedom of conscience and expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d'Etat declared the appeal inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the exercise of religious freedom in public society , and more particularly the issue of wearing religious signs at school , is directly linked to the principle of secularism on which GPE was founded .", "CARDINAL . Arising out of a long NORP tradition , the concept of secularism has its origins in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of DATE , LAW which provides that \u201c No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions , including his religious views , provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law . \u201d It also appears in the key Education Acts of DATE and DATE , which introduced state primary education on a compulsory and secular basis . The real keystone of NORP secularism , however , is LAW of DATE , known as the PERSON on the Separation between Church and ORG , which marked the end of a long conflict between the NORP , born of the French Revolution , and ORG . LAW provides : \u201c The Republic shall ensure the freedom of conscience . It shall guarantee free participation in religious worship , subject only to the restrictions laid down hereinafter in the interest of public order . \u201d The principle of separation is affirmed in LAW : \u201c the Republic may not recognise , pay stipends to or subsidise any religious denomination . \u201d A number of consequences flow from this \u201c secular pact \u201d both for public services and users . It implies an acknowledgement of religious pluralism and ORG neutrality towards religions . In return for protection of his or her freedom of religion , the citizen must respect the public arena that is shared by all . The principle was then enshrined in the LAW to LAW of DATE , which has had constitutional status since a decision of ORG DATE , which states : \u201c The ORG guarantees equal access for children and adults to instruction , vocational training and culture . The provision of free , public and secular education at all levels is a duty of the ORG . \u201d Lastly , the principle acquired actual constitutional status in LAW DATE , which provides : \u201c GPE shall be an indivisible , secular , democratic and social Republic . It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law , without distinction of origin , race or religion . It shall respect all beliefs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . From DATE the NORP secular model was confronted with the integration of NORP into society , particularly in schools .", "CARDINAL . DATE saw the first of the \u201c NORP headscarf \u201d cases . At the beginning of the school year a number of incidents occurred in secondary schools and in particular in ORG , in the d\u00e9partement of the PERSON , when CARDINAL pupils were suspended for refusing to remove their headscarf despite being requested to do so by the teaching staff and the principal of the school . The case quickly became a highly topical issue . As there was no clear legal answer , and in accordance with a request from the Minister for Education , the PERSON d'Etat , in an advisory opinion of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , stated the position that should be adopted when pupils manifested their religion .", "CARDINAL . DATE more and more issues relating to the headscarf had arisen and the advisory opinion does not appear to have provided a lasting solution to the difficulties . According to a report prepared for the Minister for Education in DATE , \u201c the matter appears to have taken on considerable proportions because having started with CARDINAL headscarves in GPE in DATE , the Minister referred to CARDINAL such cases when addressing the ORG in DATE . \u201d In GPE , the troubles have given rise to various forms of collective mobilisation regarding the question of the place of NORP in NORP society . It is in this context that , on DATE , the President of the Republic instructed a commission to study the application of the principle of secularism in the Republic . That commission , known as the \u201c ORG commission \u201d , after the name of its chairman , produced a report for the President of GPE DATE . The picture it presented of the threat to secularism bordered on the alarming . It said", "\u201c instances of behaviour and conduct that run counter to the principle of secularism are on in the increase , particularly in public society . ... The reasons for the deterioration in the situation ... [ are the ] difficulties in integrating experienced by those who have arrived in GPE during DATE , the living conditions in many suburbs of our towns , unemployment , the feeling experienced by many people living in GPE that they are the subject of discrimination , or are even being driven out of the national community ; these people explain that they thus lend an ear to those who incite them to fight what we call the values of the Republic . .... In this context it is natural that many of our fellow citizens demand the restoration of NORP authority and especially in schools . It is with these threats in mind and in the light of the values of our Republic that we have formulated the proposals set out in this report . ... [ Regarding the headscarf , the report states that ] for the school community ... the visibility of a religious sign is perceived by many as contrary to the role of school , which should remain a neutral forum and a place where the development of critical faculties is encouraged . It also infringes the principles and values that schools are there to teach , in particular , equality between men and women \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It is on the basis of these proposals that LAW was enacted ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE provides :", "\u201c Pupils must comply with the duties inherent in their studies . These include assiduity at school and compliance with the rules and community life of the school .", "In keeping with the principle of respect for pluralism and the principle that ORG education must be neutral , in lower and upper secondary schools pupils shall have freedom of information and freedom of expression . The exercise of these freedoms shall not interfere with teaching activities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Decree of CARDINAL DATE concerning local state educational establishments provides :", "\u201c The duty of assiduity referred to in LAW requires pupils to adhere to the teaching periods determined in the school timetable . This applies to compulsory classes and to any optional classes in which pupils have enrolled . Pupils shall perform the written and oral work requested of them by their teachers , respect the content of the curriculum and sit any tests that are set them . Pupils can not refuse to undergo health tests or check - ups organised for them . The school 's internal rules shall specify the manner in which LAW is implemented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The internal rules of ORG in force at the material time provided :", "\u201c ...", "I c ) Attendance . ... Any pupil who misses a lesson or study period without prior authorisation or leaves the school grounds without permission shall be punished for serious misconduct ; ...", "II b ) ORG dress . ... All pupils are required to dress discreetly and decently and in accordance with the rules of health and safety . ... Discreet signs manifesting the pupil 's personal beliefs , such as their religious convictions , shall be accepted in the establishment , but conspicuous signs which are in themselves of proselytising or discriminatory effect shall be prohibited ; ...", "IV d ) All pupils must attend GPE classes in sports clothes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the Minister for Education , the ORG d'Etat , sitting in plenary , gave a ruling on the compatibility with the principle of secularism of wearing signs at school indicating affiliation to a religious community . It gave the following opinion :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ...", "The principle of secularism in state education , which is CARDINAL aspect of the secular nature of the ORG and the principle that all public services must be neutral , requires teachers and the school curriculum to respect both this neutrality and pupils ' freedom of conscience . In accordance with the principles laid down in these same laws and with GPE 's international commitments , it prohibits any discrimination in access to education on grounds of a pupil 's religious convictions or beliefs .", "The freedom thus conferred on pupils includes the right to express and manifest their religious beliefs on the school LOC , in compliance with the requirement of respect for pluralism and the freedom of others , without interfering with teaching activities , the content of the curriculum or the requirement of assiduity .", "The exercise of that freedom can be restricted if it hinders the public education service in the role devolved onto it by the legislation . In addition to providing the means whereby children can acquire a culture and preparing them for professional life and their responsibilities as men and citizens , that role consists of contributing to the development of the pupil 's personality , inculcating respect for the individual , his or her origins and differences , and securing and promoting equality between men and women .", "It follows from what has just been said that pupils wearing signs in schools by which they manifest their affiliation to a particular religion is not in itself incompatible with the principle of secularism in so far as it constitutes the exercise of the freedom of expression and manifestation of religious beliefs , but that this freedom should not allow pupils to display signs of religious affiliation , which , inherently , in the circumstances in which they are worn , individually or collectively , or conspicuously or as a means of protest , might constitute a form of pressure , provocation , proselytism or propaganda , undermine the dignity or freedom of the pupil or other members of the educational community , compromise their health or safety , disrupt the conduct of teaching activities and the educational role of the teachers , or , lastly , interfere with order in the school or the normal functioning of the public service .", "CARDINAL . NORP The wearing of signs of religious affiliation in schools may , if necessary , be subject to rules designed to implement the principles set out above ...", "In secondary schools these rules fall within the province of the board of governors of the school which , ... , adopts , subject to scrutiny of the lawfulness thereof , the school 's internal rules ...", "CARDINAL . The disciplinary authorities shall decide , subject to the scrutiny of the administrative courts , whether the wearing by a pupil , on the LOC of a state school or other educational establishment , of a sign of religious affiliation in breach of CARDINAL of the conditions posited in point CARDINAL of this opinion or the school 's internal rules constitutes a breach justifying the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the application , after compliance with the safeguards instituted by such proceedings and the rights of the defence , of CARDINAL of the penalties provided for in the applicable provisions , CARDINAL of which may be suspension from the school .", "Suspension from a primary or secondary school is an option , despite the fact that education is compulsory , provided that the child can be educated , ... , either in a state school or a freely accessible school or in the family by the parents , or CARDINAL of them , or any other person of their choice , and , in particular , that the pupil can be enrolled in a state centre for correspondence courses ....", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a circular by the Minister for Education , entitled \u201c Secularism , wearing of religious signs by pupils and compulsory education \u201d , was sent to the directors of education , school inspectors and school principals . The relevant parts read as follows :", "\u201c Secularism , a constitutional principle of the Republic , is one of the cornerstones of state education . At school , like anywhere else , an individual 's religious beliefs are a matter of individual conscience and therefore free choice . At school , however , where young people mix without any discrimination , the exercise of the freedom of conscience , in keeping with the requirement of respect for pluralism and the principle that the public service shall be neutral , requires that the entire educational community be shielded from any ideological or religious pressure .", "Having regard to a number of recent events , it is my intention , in compliance with the requirement that each and everyone 's rights must be respected , to prevent infringements of the principle of secularism . ...", "The controversies caused by certain young girls of the NORP faith wearing the headscarf have prompted me , in view of the difficulties of interpretation of the relevant law , to refer the matter to the ORG d'Etat . ...", "Where a conflict arises regarding the wearing of religious signs , I would ask you and your teaching staff to adopt the following approach . A dialogue must immediately be sought with the pupil and his or her parents so that , in the interests of the pupil and out of concern for the proper functioning of the school , the pupil agrees to stop wearing the sign(s ) in question . ...", "Accordingly , pupils must refrain from displaying any conspicuous sign , whether in their dress or otherwise , that promotes a religious belief . Any proselytising behaviour that goes beyond mere religious beliefs shall be proscribed ...", "A pupil 's dress must not in any circumstances prevent him or her from engaging in the normal way in the exercises inherent in physical education and sports classes or tutorials or workshops organised in certain subjects . Likewise , any dress that is liable to hinder the running of a class or the proper conduct of a lesson shall be banned .", "Furthermore , the health and safety requirements shall be unequivocally binding on all pupils . Pupils must dress in such a way that they pose no danger to themselves or others in schools . ...", "There shall be no interference with any teaching activities , the content of the curriculum or the pupils ' duty to attend classes regularly . The freedom of expression conferred on pupils shall not contravene these obligations . ...", "Pupils must follow all lessons corresponding to their school level . ... Accordingly , a pupil can not in any circumstances refuse to study certain parts of the school curriculum or exempt him or herself from certain lessons . ...", "Anyone who fails to comply with these obligations shall be liable to penalties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further circular by the Minister for Education specified a number of points regarding the wearing of religious signs . The relevant parts were worded as follows :", "\u201c For DATE now many incidents have been occurring in schools on the occasion of ostentatious demonstrations of affiliation to a particular religion or community .", "School principals and teachers have repeatedly expressed their desire for clear instructions ....", "... there is an unacceptable presence , in ever growing numbers , of signs so ostentatious that their signification serves precisely to distance certain pupils from the school 's common rules of conduct . Such signs are inherently of proselytising effect , especially if certain lessons or disciplines are challenged as a result , pupils ' safety is jeopardised or the principle of coexistence at school is undermined .", "I therefore ask you to propose to the boards of governors that , when drafting the internal rules , they impose a ban on such conspicuous signs , while remaining mindful that the presence of more discreet signs that merely denote an attachment to a personal belief can not be subject to the same restrictions , as has been observed by the ORG d'Etat and in the case - law of the administrative courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Since its opinion of DATE the ORG d'Etat has had an opportunity to rule in its judicial capacity and specify the scope of that opinion . It has , for example , annulled the internal rules of schools that have imposed a strict ban on the wearing of any distinctive religious sign in classes or on the school LOC on the grounds that the terms used were too general ( DATE , no . DATE , GPE , and DATE , no . DATE , PERSON ) . Likewise , penalties for merely wearing a headscarf in a school can not be upheld if it is not established that the behaviour of the pupil in question amounted to an act of pressure or proselytism or interfered with public order in the school ( DATE , no . DATE , Mlle ORG , and DATE , no . DATE , \u00e9poux PERSON ) . The administrative courts have , however , upheld expulsions from school based on failure to comply with the duty of assiduity , such as a pupil 's refusal to remove her veil during physical education and sports classes ( DATE , no .
