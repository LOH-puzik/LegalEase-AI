{"ITEMID": "001-69285", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "GREEN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "On DATE police officers were carrying out a surveillance operation in relation to a property in FAC , GPE . As part of the operation , Detective Sergeant ( \u201c DS \u201d ) PERSON was driving an unmarked police car which collided with the applicant 's bicycle . The applicant was knocked off but got up and ran off . The car then collided with the applicant and ran over his legs . The applicant suffered injuries , including a fractured femur .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged a complaint against the police alleging that he had been deliberately knocked down by the police car . The Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police requested an officer from another police force to investigate the complaint and referred the complaint to ORG ( \u201c PCA \u201d ) which was to supervise the investigation . The ORG approved the choice of the investigating officer from ORG .", "On DATE the applicant made a statement .", "On DATE the applicant and his solicitor viewed a video recording made from a police helicopter . Subsequently the applicant made a further statement which concluded with his view that it looked as though the police officers had been trying to kill him .", "The investigating officer made an interim report , bearing in mind DATE time - limit on road traffic prosecutions , and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decided to bring proceedings against ORG for failing to drive with due care and attention .", "On DATE , the investigating officer submitted his final report to the ORG and sent a copy to the Chief Constable . It included CARDINAL statements and CARDINAL other documents and exhibits , including video evidence and copies of tape - recorded interviews with the officers concerned .", "On DATE , the ORG submitted a statement to the Chief Constable that the matter had been investigated to its satisfaction . The applicant was informed of the statement and that , at the conclusion of any criminal matters , the Chief Constable would inform the ORG whether it was proposed to bring any disciplinary charges . If the decision was not to do so , the ORG could recommend , or if necessary , direct that a disciplinary charge be brought .", "On DATE , ORG pleaded guilty in ORG to driving without due care and attention . He was fined ORG , plus costs and CARDINAL penalty points were imposed on his licence .", "The Chief Constable informed the ORG that it was not proposed to bring any disciplinary charges .", "On DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that it did not intend to recommend any disciplinary proceedings , stating inter alia that in the absence of any \u201c irrefutable \u201d evidence of recklessness or intent on the part of ORG it was not believed that a disciplinary hearing would find any more fault in the officer 's conduct than did the criminal trial .", "On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors wrote to the ORG alleging that it had misdirected itself in requiring \u201c irrefutable \u201d evidence for bringing proceedings .", "On DATE , the ORG confirmed its decision in the light of the absence \u201c of any evidence of recklessness or intent \u201d .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for judicial review of the ORG 's decisions as set out in its letters .", "On DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that a fresh review of the case would be carried out by another member of the ORG , Ms PERSON , and inviting him to submit any further evidence within DATE . The applicant 's solicitors replied that they wanted to know what evidence the ORG had in order to consider what further evidence to submit .", "On DATE , PERSON provided the applicant with a schedule listing the statements and documents which would be taken into account .", "On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors requested disclosure of the materials in the schedule .", "On DATE , PERSON declined to disclose the documents .", "On DATE , the applicant withdrew the judicial review proceedings on the basis that the ORG would conduct a full review and make a fresh decision .", "On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors made representations that they were unable to make effective submissions without access to the statements and documents , referring to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "By letter dated DATE , PERSON replied that pursuant to LAW the ORG was prevented from disclosing information received in connection with its functions save in specified circumstances , including where it was necessary for the proper discharge of those functions . The ORG did not consider that disclosure was so necessary as the applicant had already made a statement himself , knew the identities of the persons whose statements had been received and had seen a copy of the video . It was satisfied that the material available to it did not contain anything on which it required the applicant 's representations in order for it to carry out its statutory functions .", "The applicant issued judicial review proceedings challenging this refusal of disclosure .", "On DATE , after an oral hearing , ORG ruled that the ORG should disclose certain material . The judge gave the parties the opportunity to agree what documents should be disclosed . On DATE , following agreement of the parties , ORG ordered disclosure of CARDINAL witness statements , some of them redacted , on the basis of an undertaking by counsel that he would not disclose or permit to be disclosed any of the material save to the applicant and his legal advisers .", "On DATE , after an oral hearing , ORG allowed the ORG 's appeal .", "On DATE , ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal .", "Meanwhile , however , the applicant and the ORG agreed that the fresh review should be carried out .", "On DATE , the ORG member issued a provisional decision , of CARDINAL pages , on the applicant 's complaints which included a summary and analysis of the evidence . Referring to various witness statements and the video , she noted that ORG had intended to stop and search the applicant due to his presence outside a drug dealing house and that when the applicant tried to get away on his bike , the car had clipped the rear of the bike , knocking him to the ground . When the applicant had run off , ORG had followed in the car ; he had driven onto the wrong side of the road and fearing collision with an oncoming vehicle , swerved and in so doing hit the applicant who had run into the road across his path . The independent report analysed the various speeds of the vehicles and bike and assessed that there were a number of deficiencies in the officer 's driving plan and manoeuvring . She concluded that , although there was a reasonable prospect of a disciplinary tribunal being satisfied that ORG driving fell below the required standard , there would be no recommendation of proceedings due to the passage of time since the incident , the fact that ORG had been told of the original decision not to bring disciplinary proceedings and the availability of lesser and proportionate means of dealing with his standard of driving . The applicant was invited to comment on the decision .", "On DATE , following receipt of the applicant 's submissions , the ORG confirmed its decision . It further stated in relation to concerns raised by his solicitors about the way in which allegations of racist conduct had been dealt with that the matter had been investigated ( e.g. it had been put to the police officer in interview that it was a deliberate racist act ) but that there was ample evidence to provide a full explanation of ORG conduct which did not involve any element of racism . While the original investigation had not been carried out in line with the ORG 's DATE Guidelines which had only come into existence subsequently and which required statistical data to be taken into account , it appeared that difficulties in correlation of figures available for DATE would not have enabled it to be shown if black persons were subjected to a disproportionate number of searches .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It held that section CARDINAL contained a general ban on disclosure of information received by the ORG except in certain circumstances and that the aim of the ORG in carrying out its functions was to satisfy the legitimate interests of both complainants and the wider public that the investigation of complaints against police officers should be , and should be seen to be , independent and thorough . It considered that the purposes of the legislation would not be served by the disclosure of as much information as possible to the parties while an investigation was being undertaken . It noted , inter alia , that as the applicant was a potential witness in disciplinary proceedings there would be a risk of contamination of evidence if he was allowed sight of other witness statements . It concluded that the procedures adopted by the ORG in cases which concerned breaches of ORG and CARDINAL were such as to involve the applicant adequately in the procedure and to satisfy the requirements of an effective investigation and that accordingly the ORG had been entitled to take the view that the disclosure of the witness statements and other materials was not necessary for the proper discharge of its functions .", "Meanwhile , the applicant had brought a claim for damages against the police . On DATE , these proceedings terminated when the police agreed to pay the applicant GBP CARDINAL , plus costs ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
