NORP The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , together with her husband , acquired a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in GPE . After her husband \u2019s death in DATE the applicant became the sole holder of the specially protected tenancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG came into force . It regulated the sale of publicly owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to visit her daughter who lived in GPE . She intended to stay with her daughter for DATE . The applicant locked the flat in GPE and left all her furniture and personal belongings in it . She asked a neighbour to pay the bills in her absence and to take care of the flat .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , by DATE armed conflict had escalated in GPE , resulting in severe travel difficulties in that area , including the town of GPE . From DATE , the town of GPE was exposed to constant shelling and the supply of electricity and water was disrupted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that in DATE the NORP authorities had stopped paying her war widow \u2019s pension and that the payments had resumed in DATE . The ORG submitted that the applicant \u2019s pension had been paid by ORG in GPE rather than ORG and that it was the GPE authorities which had stopped paying the pension in DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she also lost the right to medical insurance . The ORG maintained that her medical insurance had never been stopped or interrupted .", "CARDINAL . Given these circumstances , the applicant decided to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a certain PERSON , with his wife and CARDINAL children , broke into and occupied the applicant \u2019s flat in GPE . The applicant claimed that PERSON had been assisted by an official of the municipality who had provided him with a list of empty flats in GPE , including hers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ) brought a civil action against the applicant before ORG ( PERSON ) for termination of her specially protected tenancy on the ground that she had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason , contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions to the domestic court , the applicant explained that she had been forced to stay with her daughter in GPE from DATE until DATE . She had not been able to return to ORG since she had no means of subsistence and no medical insurance and was in poor health . Furthermore , during her stay in GPE she had learned from her neighbour that PERSON had broken into her flat with his family . When she had enquired about her flat and her possessions in it , PERSON had threatened her over the telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s specially protected tenancy . The court found that the applicant had left GPE on DATE and had not returned until DATE . It stated that during the relevant period the citizens of ORG had not been ordered to evacuate the town on account of the escalation of the armed conflict and that each citizen had had the choice to leave the town or to stay . On that basis the court found that the war in GPE could not justify the applicant \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court did not accept the applicant \u2019s explanation that she had fallen ill during her stay in GPE and had been unable to travel . It was established that she had suffered from spinal arthrosis and diffuse osteoporosis for a long time . However , this had not affected her ability to travel . Even though her left shoulder had been dislocated on DATE , she had been able to travel following the immobilisation of the injured joint . Furthermore , by DATE she had already been absent from the flat for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further explanation that she had stopped receiving her pension in DATE and thus had been left without any means of subsistence was not accepted by the court as a justified reason for not returning to ORG . It took the view that the applicant \u2019s daughter could have sent her money . Therefore , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s reasons for not having lived in the flat were not justified .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicant , the judgment was quashed by ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) on DATE .", "ORG found that the court of first instance had not given due consideration to the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , namely her age and poor health and the fact that she had lost her pension and lived alone in GPE . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s decision to prolong her stay in GPE should have been carefully assessed against the background of the circumstances at the material time , namely that ORG had been exposed to DATE shelling and had not had a regular supply of water or electricity , and that third parties had occupied the applicant \u2019s flat .", "The case was remitted to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG again ruled in favour of the municipality and terminated the applicant \u2019s specially protected tenancy . It observed that she had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason and repeated in substance the findings of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the municipality \u2019s claim . It found that the escalation of the war and the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances justified her absence from the flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE lodged an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal , reversed ORG judgment and upheld the judgment of ORG . It found that the reasons submitted by the applicant for her absence from the flat were not justified . The relevant part of ORG judgment read as follows :", "\u201c During the aggression against GPE , living conditions were the same for all citizens of GPE and , as rightly submitted by the plaintiff , it is neither possible nor legitimate to separate the defendant \u2019s case from the context of that aggression . To hold the contrary would mean assessing her case in isolation from all of the circumstances which characterised that time and determined the conduct of each individual .", "Contrary to the appellate court , this ORG , assessing in that context the defendant \u2019s decision not to return to ORG during the aggression but to stay in GPE , considers the non - use of the flat unjustified . The factual findings made in the case reveal that , in view of her state of health and the available travel connections , the defendant was able to come to GPE ; her health would not have deteriorated because of her stay in GPE ; and she could have taken care of herself . The assumption that she would have had to make a considerable mental and physical effort in order to provide for her basic living needs ( all the citizens of GPE who remained in the town , from the youngest to the oldest , were exposed to the same living conditions ) does not justify her failure to return to GPE and , accordingly , does not constitute a justified reason for the non - use of the flat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) . She claimed that her rights to respect for her home and property had been violated and that she had been deprived of her right to a fair hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Convention came into force in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .

The Permanent Court of International Justice ( ORG ) has dealt with the issue of its jurisdiction ratione temporis in several cases . In the case of Phosphates in GPE ( Preliminary Objections ) between GPE and GPE , ORG maintained , inter alia , that the dispossession of certain NORP nationals resulting from the decision of ORG of DATE , and the denial of justice that had followed , were inconsistent with international obligations incumbent on GPE . The ratification of the declaration by which GPE accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the ORG was filed on DATE . In its judgment of DATE ( ORG , Series A / B , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , when examining GPE \u2019s preliminary objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis , the ORG held :", "\u201c The NORP Government bases its objection on the following passage in its declaration : \u2018 ... in any disputes which may arise after the ratification of the present declaration with regard to situations or facts subsequent to this ratification.\u2019 [ p. CARDINAL ]", "...", "[ The ORG \u2019s compulsory jurisdiction ] only exists within the limits within which it has been accepted . In this case , the terms on which the objection ratione temporis submitted by ORG is founded , are perfectly clear : the only situations or facts falling under the compulsory jurisdiction are those which are subsequent to the ratification and with regard to which the dispute arose , that is to say , those which must be considered as being the source of the dispute . [ p. CARDINAL ]", "...", "... The situations and the facts which form the subject of the limitation ratione temporis have to be considered from the point of view both of their date in relation to the date of ratification and of their connection with the birth of the dispute . Situations or facts subsequent to the ratification could serve to found the ORG \u2019s compulsory jurisdiction only if it was with regard to them that the dispute arose . [ p. CARDINAL ]", "...", "[ The ] decision of ORG , owing to its date , falls outside the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction . ORG has sought to avert this consequence by arguing ... that the decision of DATE constituted only an uncompleted violation of international law ; that this violation only became definitive as a result of certain acts subsequent to the crucial date and of the final refusal to remedy in any way the situation created in DATE , and that these acts gave rise to the dispute between the CARDINAL Governments . [ p. CARDINAL ]", "...", "The ORG can not regard the denial of justice alleged by ORG as a factor giving rise to the present dispute . In its ORG , ORG has represented the decision of ORG as an unlawful international act ... That being so , it is in this decision that we should look for the violation of international law \u2013 a definitive act which would , by itself , directly involve international responsibility . This act being attributable to the ORG and described as contrary to the treaty right of another ORG , international responsibility would be established immediately as between GPE . In these circumstances the alleged denial of justice ... merely results in allowing the unlawful act to subsist . It exercises no influence either on the accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it . [ p. CARDINAL ]", "...", "... [ T]he complaint of a denial of justice can not be separated from the criticism which ORG directs against the decision of ORG of DATE , for ORG could not regard the denial of justice as established unless it had first satisfied itself as to the existence of the rights of the private citizens alleged to have been refused judicial protection . But the ORG could not reach such a conclusion without calling in question the decision of ORG of DATE . It follows that an examination of the justice of this complaint could not be undertaken without extending the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction to a fact which , by reason of its date , is not subject thereto .", "...", "In conclusion , the ORG finds that the dispute submitted to it by ORG ... did not arise with regard to situations or facts subsequent to the ratification of the acceptance by GPE of the compulsory jurisdiction , and that in consequence it has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on this dispute . [ pp . CARDINAL ] \u201d", "CARDINAL . The issue of temporal jurisdiction arose also in a number of cases before ORG ( ICJ ) . In Certain Property ( GPE v. GPE ) , Preliminary Objections , GPE maintained that certain decisions by NORP courts delivered in the period DATE declaring inadmissible the action of PERSON of GPE for restitution of a painting , which had been confiscated by GPE on DATE under \u201c the Bene\u0161 Decrees \u201d , were in breach of international law . In these inadmissibility decisions the NORP courts relied on the Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising out of the War and the Occupation , signed in DATE , as amended in DATE , which had come into force on CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the Settlement Convention \u201d ) . In order to found the jurisdiction of the ICJ , GPE relied in its LAW DATE , which came into force between GPE and GPE on DATE . In its judgment of DATE , when examining GPE \u2019s preliminary objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis , the ICJ held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG will now consider whether the present dispute has its source or real cause in the facts or situations which occurred in DATE in GPE and , particularly , in the decisions by the NORP courts in the PERSON Painting case , or whether its source or real cause is the PERSON Decrees under which the painting was confiscated and ORG which the NORP courts invoked as ground for declaring themselves without jurisdiction to hear that case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that it is not contested that the present dispute was triggered by the decisions of the NORP courts in the aforementioned case . This conclusion does not , however , dispose of the question the ORG is called upon to decide , for under LAW , the critical issue is not the date when the dispute arose , but the date of the facts or situations in relation to which the dispute arose .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... The Court ... finds that the decisions of the NORP courts in the PERSON van Laer Painting case can not be separated from ORG and the Bene\u0161 Decrees , and that these decisions can not consequently be considered as the source or real cause of the dispute between GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concludes that , although these proceedings were instituted by GPE as a result of decisions by NORP courts regarding a painting by PERSON van Laer , these events have their source in specific measures taken by GPE in DATE , which led to the confiscation of property owned by some GPE nationals , including Prince PERSON of GPE , as well as in the special regime created by ORG . The decisions of the NORP courts in DATE dismissing the claim filed by Prince PERSON of GPE for the return of the painting to him were taken on the basis of LAW , of ORG . While these decisions triggered the dispute between GPE and GPE , the source or real cause of the dispute is to be found in ORG and the ORG Decrees .
