The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her husband , X , arrived in GPE and on DATE they applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and residence permits . The applicant was interviewed on DATE and DATE . She had no identity papers and could not prove her identity . She stated that she was born and grew up in GPE , where her parents , CARDINAL of her CARDINAL brothers , an aunt and an uncle resided . Her other brother had left GPE a long time ago . She also had an uncle in GPE . The applicant had attended school for DATE in GPE and had studied at the university .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her spouse also submitted that they had been persecuted since DATE because ORG had been a politically active member of ORG , leading to his arrest on QUANTITY occasions . Following his second release they had moved to GPE , but they alleged that some fundamentalists had come looking for X there as well with the intention of killing him . The applicant submitted that she also had shown her political stance by acting as a teacher for women , which was not accepted by parts of the leading elite in GPE . Therefore , they had fled the country . When they had left their home , they had stayed with her uncle in GPE and the latter had helped them finance their journey to GPE by paying a smuggler MONEY . Lastly , X invoked his poor mental health , stating that he was suffering from anxiety , sleeplessness and aggressive behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the couple 's application . It first noted that the security situation in GPE varied between different parts of the country but that it was better in GPE than in other parts of the country . ORG then considered that X had given vague information about his activities and had failed to demonstrate that he had held a prominent or leading position within ORG . Hence , it questioned the claim that his life would be endangered because of his membership of that party . ORG therefore found that neither X nor the applicant had shown that they had been persecuted in GPE or that they would risk persecution upon return . Thus , even having regard to X 's poor mental health , the ORG found that there were no grounds on which to grant them leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her husband appealed against the decision to the then ORG , which subsequently transmitted the case to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) . The applicant maintained her claims and added that the threats against her and X stemmed from PERSON 's previous political activities and from her activities in educating women and that the authorities had not been able to protect them , not even in GPE . The applicant further submitted that she had separated from X in DATE , lived alone and intended to obtain a divorce although X opposed it . Due to this , she had been criticised by some of X 's friends , been called a \u201c bad woman \u201d and some other NORP had spread untrue rumours about her . By separating from X , she had broken with NORP traditions which meant that she risked serious persecution if forced to return to her home country . In this respect , she pointed out that she would not be able to obtain a divorce in GPE and that by trying to obtain a divorce in GPE she had dishonoured both her own and PERSON 's family . Consequently , her own family had disowned her and she would risk reprisals from QUANTITY 's family . It would also be impossible for her to find work and , since she and X had no children , she would be a social outcast . She further mentioned that the punishment for adultery in GPE was stoning . Lastly , she stated that she suffered from psychological problems and was in need of treatment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeal and submitted , inter alia , that X had stated that his father had held a higher position than him in the party but that he had not been threatened . It further claimed that , having regard to X 's poor mental health , it should be possible for the applicant to obtain a divorce . Moreover , it appeared that X would agree to a divorce . Lastly , it did not question that the applicant 's family was dissatisfied with her decision to separate from her husband but it had not been shown that they had disowned her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after holding an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . It first considered that it had not been shown that X , on account of his previous political activities , would be of interest to any resistance groups in GPE . It then observed that quite some time had passed since the applicant had taught women in her home country . Moreover , the court noted that the previous ORG ban on education for women had been replaced by affirmative action for women and that the constitution stated that the ORG should actively support women 's education . Therefore , the court found that the applicant had not demonstrated that she had a well - founded fear of persecution because of her previous work as a women 's teacher . As concerned the applicant 's personal life , the court observed that she had not formally divorced PERSON although they had separated . In its view , nothing had appeared in the case which showed that the applicant faced a concrete and individual risk of persecution for having broken with NORP traditions . It further noted that the applicant had stated that she had not had an extramarital affair , for which reason there was no risk that she would be convicted of adultery and sentenced to death . In this respect , the court considered that the applicant had not shown that the alleged rumours about her had come to the knowledge of the NORP authorities . Turning to her claim that she would lack a social network in GPE , the court found that the applicant had not demonstrated that her family in GPE had rejected her and , hence , she had a social network there . It further took into account that she was well - educated and thus concluded that she had failed to show that she would face a real risk of being persecuted or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Therefore , and since the court did not find that any of the other reasons submitted by the applicant were sufficient to grant her exceptional leave to remain , the appeal was rejected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority of the court wanted to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE on the ground that , since she did not have any children and had separated from her husband , she had shown that she would risk degrading treatment upon return to her home country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal . This decision was final and the applicant 's deportation order thus became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE invoking new circumstances , the applicant lodged an application for a residence permit under LAW , LAW , of LAW , which was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new application for a residence permit under LAW , LAW , of LAW , which was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant petitioned ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE for a divorce from X. The latter informed ORG on DATE that he opposed a divorce . The applicant submitted that she had separated from her husband in DATE and only seen him once since then . Moreover , she intended to invoke the divorce as CARDINAL of the grounds to stop her deportation .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the court dismissed her petition on the ground that it was not competent to dissolve her marriage since she did not have a legal right to reside in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant requested ORG to re - evaluate her case and stop her deportation . As grounds for her request , she claimed that the situation in GPE had worsened considerably since ORG previous decision . She further alleged that she now had a well - founded fear of persecution upon return to GPE since she had started a relationship with a NORP man . Thus , she had committed adultery and risked the death penalty in GPE . She had not been in touch with her family since DATE .", "CARDINAL . She also submitted a letter from ORG for ORG , dated DATE , which stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ORG 's views on the protection needs of NORP female asylum - seekers are fully set forth in the ORG 's ORG needs of NORP Asylumseekers . ... In the context of GPE , ORG would like to draw to your attention to the fact that an assessment of a refugee claim of an NORP female asylum - seeker , should take into account the specifically vulnerable situation in which NORP women are found , including pressure from within families , communities , and by the public to conform [ to ] behaviour in accordance with particular codes of behaviour . In this regard , a separation and/or divorce effected in the country of asylum , may indicate adoption of a Westernised way of life and be perceived as , or actually transgressing , prevailing social mores and thereby indicates a heightened risk of sur place persecution linked to the grounds of religion and/or political opinion under the scope of LAW ) of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention . ... ORG notes that NORP female asylum - seekers ' reliance for relative social , cultural and economic freedom is exclusively dependent on the existence of male protection ( husband , father , brother or extended family member ) and that lack of such networks may seriously undermine a returnee 's personal physical , economic and emotional security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to reconsider the applicant 's case as she had failed to invoke any new circumstances of importance . It considered that the applicant had only developed and clarified those grounds which had already been examined by it and the migration courts . ORG also found that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , maintaining the grounds invoked before ORG and insisting that these were new circumstances of importance . On DATE the court rejected the appeal , upholding the ORG 's decision and reasoning in full .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to Appeal and , on DATE , the case was transferred to ORG to enforce the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . Finally , on DATE the applicant lodged a third application for a residence permit under LAW , LAW , of LAW , which was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged the case with the ORG and on CARDINAL DATE the President of the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until further notice", "CARDINAL . In her observations of CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted that already before leaving GPE , she had told her mother about her problems with her husband . In DATE the applicant had called home and told her mother that she and her husband had separated . The mother had become very upset and said that it was totally wrong and that the applicant should go back to her husband . She had then talked to her father who became furious and shouted that she brought dishonour to the family . The conversation had ended because the applicant ran out of money on her telephone card . The father had called her back the following day to try to persuade her to change her mind and talked about honour , shame and her disgracing the family . In the end he had shouted that she was go back to her husband or the family would not have anything more to do with her . She was no longer his daughter . After the conversation , the applicant had called her uncles in GPE and GPE to have their support but they had both repeated the words of her father . That had been the last conversation between the applicant and her relatives .", "CARDINAL . With the applicant 's observations of CARDINAL DATE she also enclosed a letter of DATE \u201c to whom it may concern \u201d by a named NORP man who confirmed having a relationship with the applicant . He stated , inter alia , that they had met for the first time in DATE , that their relationship had started in DATE and that they had been living together in his apartment since DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply the Government observed on DATE that the facts now presented by the applicant in her observations were never submitted to the NORP authorities in spite of the fact that these could be considered relevant to her claim for asylum . Notably , regarding the claim that the applicant and the said NORP man have been living together since DATE , the ORG noted that the applicant has still not changed her registered mail address in PERSON although her new residence is apparently far away .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . In so far as relevant , ORG of NORP Asylum - Seekers of DATE , which replaced the previous Guidelines from DATE , set out the following :", "In view of the serious and widespread human rights violations and ongoing armed conflict in many parts of the country , ORG considers that a significant number of NORP asylum seekers are in need of international protection . Applications by NORP asylum - seekers should be determined on an individual basis , according to fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures , including the right of appeal . Favourable consideration should be given to the specific groups identified in these LAW , including , but not limited to ( i ) persons perceived as contravening LAW law and members of minority religious groups ; ( ii ) ethnic minority groups ; ( iii ) persons associated with or perceived as supporting the Government , including civil society members ; ( iv ) actual or perceived supporters of armed anti - Government groups ; ( v ) journalists ; ( vi ) persons associated with ORG of GPE or other left - aligned political parties ; ( vii ) women ; ( viii ) children ; and ( ix ) persons at risk of becoming victims of blood feuds .", "ORG further considers that an internal flight or relocation alternative ( ORG ) is not available within certain parts of GPE due to a number of factors . If , however , the availability of an ORG must be assessed as a requirement in a national eligibility procedure , it should be examined carefully and on a case - by - case basis , in light of the requisite relevance and reasonableness analyses , taking into account the individual circumstance of the case , and bearing in mind the cautions in these Guidelines . Even in those exceptional cases where relocation to an accessible area might be considered as viable to eliminate the existing threat , such area can only be a reasonable alternative in cases where the claimant has strong family , social or tribal links in the area of displacement , permitting relocation without undue economic and social hardship . ...", "( g ) Women", "Women are at particular risk of ill - treatment if perceived as not conforming to the gender roles ascribed to them by society , tradition and even the legal system . Ill - treatment occurs in a variety of forms and may be inflicted by several actors , including family members . Such treatment includes domestic violence , excessive custodial sentences and degrading and inhuman treatment . While there is a limited number of women holding public office , women 's rights continue to be curtailed , restricted and systematically violated . In DATE , for instance , a NORP Personal Status Law was passed by ORG and signed by President PERSON . The law requires , inter alia , women to comply with their husbands ' sexual requests , and to obtain permission to leave the home , except in emergencies . The code has yet to be implemented and is currently under review as a result of international pressure .", "Cases of physical violence perpetrated against women and girls in GPE have increased by PERCENT in DATE . Existing figures indicate that currently PERCENT of NORP women are affected by domestic violence . Human rights organizations report an overall increase of cases of self - immolation and other forms of suicide . The phenomenon of female self - immolation is commonly linked to the pervasive societal discrimination against women . Survivors of sexual violence generally lack basic support mechanisms such as trauma counselling and medical treatment , as well as judicial capacity for forensics analysis . The social stigma attached to the reporting of gender - based violence in GPE often prevents victims from seeking physical or psychological treatment .", "NORP women , who have adopted a less culturally conservative lifestyle , such as those returning from exile in GPE or LOC , continue to be perceived as transgressing entrenched social and religious norms and may , as a result , be subjected to domestic violence and other forms of punishment ranging from isolation and stigmatization to honour crimes for those accused of bringing shame to their families , communities or tribes . Actual or perceived transgressions of the social behavioural code include not only social behaviour in the context of a family or a community , but also sexual orientation , the pursuit of a professional career , and mere disagreements as to the way family life is conducted .", "Unaccompanied women or women lacking a male \u201c tutor \u201d ( mahram ) continued to face limitations on conducting a normal social life . They include divorced women , unmarried women who are not virgins , and women whose engagements to be married have been broken . Unless they marry , which is very difficult given the social stigma associated with these women , social rejection and discrimination continue to be the norm . Many NORP women are prevented from leaving the family compound without a burqa and a male companion , who has to be a husband or a close relative . Women without male support and protection generally lack the means of survival , given the social restrictions on women living alone , including the limitations on their freedom of movement . This is reflected in the absence of solutions available to the few women able to access domestic violence shelters . Unable to live independently , they face years of quasi - detention , prompting many to return to abusive family situations . The results of such \u201c reconciliation \u201d are generally not monitored and abuse or honour crimes committed upon return are often done with impunity .", "Forced and child marriages continue to be widely practiced in GPE , and can occur in a variety of forms . Statistics show that PERCENT of girls in GPE are married before they reach DATE . Most marriages continued to be arranged by families . However , more coerced forms include ' sale ' marriage , that is , girls sold for a fixed quantity of goods , cash or simply to settle a family debt ; bad dadan , a tribal form of dispute - settling in which the offending family offers one girl for marriage into the wronged family , for instance to settle a blood debt ; and badal , when CARDINAL families exchange their daughters in an attempt to minimize marriage costs .", "Furthermore , women 's rights activists face threats and intimidation , particularly if outspoken about women 's rights , the role of ORG or the behaviour of commanders . In areas under the control of armed anti - Government groups , there are growing indications that women face systematic societal discrimination . For example , a significant number of female medical graduates is systematically refusing to work in rural areas , due to the fear of being targeted by insurgents . These developments affect women 's access to health in a disproportionate way .", "Access to education for girls is also severely curtailed . According to ORG and aid agencies CARDINAL school - age children ( CARDINAL of them girls ) have been deprived of education as a consequence of conservative customs , poverty , lack of education facilities and a culture of gender discrimination .", "The deterioration of the security situation has also had a detrimental effect on education . Armed anti - Government groups have continued their systematic attacks on schools , teachers , pupils ( particularly schoolgirls ) and parents . According to ORG ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL primary , secondary and high schools closed due to such attacks . PERCENT of schools are closed in the CARDINAL southern provinces of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , with GPE having CARDINAL schools , primarily for boys , functioning , compared to CARDINAL schools open in DATE . Consequently , CARDINAL students have been deprived of an education in CARDINAL provinces , according to ORG officials . Girls ' schools are increasingly a target of attacks . PERCENT of security incidents at schools across the country were specifically directed against girls ' schools despite the fact that they represent PERCENT of the total number of primary , secondary and high schools in the country . Furthermore , female teachers are specifically targeted and higher bounties are offered for killing them . In DATE , in a widely reported attack in GPE , CARDINAL students and CARDINAL teachers , all female , were sprayed with acid and suffered severe injuries .", "Given the pervasive societal discrimination and the widespread sexual and gender based violence , NORP women and girls , particularly those living in areas affected by the armed conflict or under the de facto control of armed anti - Government groups , may be at risk of persecution depending on their individual profile and circumstances . Failure to conform to conventional roles or transgression of social and religious norms may expose women and girls to violence , harassment or discrimination in GPE . As such , women with particular profiles , including , but not limited to victims of domestic violence or other serious forms of violence , unaccompanied women or single heads of household , women with visible social or professional roles , such as journalists , human rights activists and community workers , may be at risk of persecution on the ground of membership of a particular social group . Where non - conformity with traditional roles is perceived as opposing traditional power structures , the risk of persecution may be linked to the ground of religion and/or political opinion . Furthermore , measures which restrict one 's ability to earn a living so that survival is threatened , or severe limitations to accessing education or health services , may also amount to persecution .", "CARDINAL . The US State Department Human Rights Report on GPE for DATE , published on DATE stated , inter alia :", "Women", "The law criminalizes rape , which is punishable by death , but under Shari'a , which the country 's laws draw from and can not conflict , the criminalization did not extend to spousal rape . Under Shari'a , a rape case requires a woman to produce multiple witnesses to the incident , while the man need simply claim it was consensual sex , often leading to an adultery conviction of the victim . Adultery is defined in LAW and designated a crime ; premarital sex is not designated a crime , but local officials often considered it a \" moral \" offense . While the ORG reported CARDINAL cases of rape during DATE ; however , the actual number of cases generally was believed to be much higher . Of the reported cases , CARDINAL were charges of rape against females and CARDINAL were of rape against males . The ORG reported CARDINAL arrests in connection with rape cases . Statistics on convictions were unavailable . Rapes were difficult to document due to social stigma . Female victims faced stringent societal reprisal from being deemed unfit for marriage to being imprisoned . According to NGOs jail authorities frequently raped women imprisoned TIME in jail .", "The NORP penal code criminalizes assault , and courts entered judgments against domestic abusers under this provision . According to NGO reports , CARDINAL of women continued to suffer abuse at the hands of their husbands , fathers , brothers , armed individuals , parallel legal systems , and institutions of state such as the police and justice system . Many elements of society tolerated and practiced violence against women . A GPE women 's shelter reported receiving CARDINAL new cases of domestic violence victims DATE from ORG referrals . According to the shelter 's report the weak economy and poor security contributed to the incidence of domestic violence . Authorities rarely prosecuted abusers and only occasionally investigated complaints of violent attacks , rape , or killings , or suicides of women . If cases came to court , the accused were often exonerated or punished lightly . The director of a women 's shelter in GPE noted domestic violence occurred in most homes but went largely unreported due to societal acceptance of the practice . Domestic violence usually consisted of beating women and children and , less often , burning women . During DATE , the GPE initiated additional efforts to collect statistics on violence against women .", "There were CARDINAL women 's shelters across the country . The CARDINAL shelters in GPE were home to CARDINAL women and girls . ORG ( ORG ) and other agencies referred women to the centers , which were designed to give protection , accommodation , food , training , and healthcare to women escaping violence in the home or seeking legal support due to family feuds . According to the LOC , CARDINAL women and girls were referred to the ORG 's legal department DATE ; however , space at the specialized shelters was limited . Women in need of shelter who could not find a place in the GPE shelters often ended up in prison .", "The concept of women 's shelters was not widely accepted in society , as many persons treated them with distrust and did not understand their utility . The director of CARDINAL shelter stated she always referred to the location as a mediation centre , as \" shelter \" was considered a negative word . Policewomen trained to help victims of domestic violence complained they were instructed not to do outreach to victims but simply to wait for victims to show up at police stations . This significantly hindered their work , as reporting domestic violence was not socially accepted . ORG reported police leadership often did not provide female officers with equipment or vehicles necessary to do outside investigations . A NORP - based NGO , however , reported recently graduated women police officers there were active in crime investigation including investigating cases of domestic violence . During DATE , a local NGO conducted CARDINAL domestic violence trainings for CARDINAL ORG officers in GPE , including those working in ORG .

They offer mediation and resources to prevent future instances of domestic violence .", "Women continued to face pervasive human rights violations and remained largely uninformed about their rights under the law . ORG was more acute in rural areas and small villages . Women in urban areas continued to make strides toward greater access to public life , education , health care , and employment ; however , the denial of educational opportunities during the continuing insurgency , as well as limited employment possibilities and the threat of violence , continued to impede the ability of many women to improve their situation .", "Societal discrimination against women persisted , including domestic abuse , rape , forced marriages , exchange of girls to settle disputes , kidnappings , and honour killings .

Women also faced bigamy charges from husbands who had deserted them and then reappeared after the woman had remarried . Local officials imprisoned women in place of a family member who had committed a crime but could not be located .

DATE before the presidential election he issued by decree an amended version of the law which still includes articles that impose drastic restrictions upon NORP women , including the requirement that wives seek their husbands ' permission before leaving home except for unspecified \u201c reasonable legal reasons . \u201d The law also gives child custody rights to fathers and grandfathers , not mothers or grandmothers , and allows a husband to cease maintenance to his wife if she does not meet her marital duties , including sexual duties . The furor over the NORP law highlighted the fragility of the gains made by NORP women , human rights activists , and reform - minded politicians . The dominant political factions of GPE remain ideologically hostile to many of the rights that many women have started to enjoy since the fall of the ORG , such as freedom of movement , freedom to work , and the right to education . Many of the women interviewed for this report observed that the space for them to work as activists for change has diminished over DATE , as the government has come to increasingly rely on conservative factions to maintain political control .", "Violence against Women : Violence against women in GPE is endemic . A nationwide survey of CARDINAL women , published in DATE , found that PERCENT had experienced CARDINAL form of physical , sexual , or psychological violence or forced marriage in their lifetimes . The forms of violence include rape , physical violence , forced marriage , and \u201c honour killings . \u201d Too often the attitudes of those in government and the police reflect the misogynous views , rooted in cultural traditions - but increasingly rejected by younger generations of NORP \u2013 that underlie some of the violence against women . As Dr. PERSON , ORG Commissioner of ORG ( GPE ) , told us , \u201c Police and judges see violence against women as legitimate , so they do not prosecute cases . \u201d In the vast majority of cases women will not seek help because of their fears of police abuse or corruption , or their fears of retaliation by perpetrators of violence . Low social status and social stigmas deter women from going against their families to pursue justice , particularly in cases of domestic abuse . For a woman even to approach the police or courts requires her to overcome the public opprobrium that often still attaches to women who leave their houses without a male guardian , let alone women who seek protection from public authorities . In DATE study by ORG ( ORG ) , PERCENT thought that a woman disabled by violence should seek police help . For those who do seek help , many encounter lack of concern , if not outright hostility or abuse . Rape is not a crime in LAW . Under the code , rapists can only be charged with \u201c forced \u201d zina , or adultery , which sometimes results in women also being prosecuted for zina . In a major achievement for civil society groups and women 's rights activists , the president issued LAW law , which makes rape a crime . At the time of writing the law is being considered by parliament ...", "Access to ORG : An underlying problem is women 's access to justice . Police training involves little or no training in gender based violence or women 's rights , particularly as training has been increasingly focused on counter - insurgency and security skills rather than crime prevention , crime solving and community policing . Deeply entrenched cultural prejudices prevent many women accessing the police or the courts because of the fear of being stigmatized a \u201c bad woman . \u201d Women face discrimination and prejudice in police stations and the courts from officials who often do not know the law but penalize women according to customary law , which places great emphasis on notions of female \u201c honour \u201d and chastity . The majority of women in jail are charged with extramarital sex ( zina ) or with \u201c running away\u201d- something that is not a crime in NORP law or LAW but often reflects a conservative cultural view that sees women as property of fathers or husbands . CARDINAL widely welcomed policy response to this was the creation of female - staffed \u201c Family Response Units \u201d ( FRUs ) in police stations . But , as detailed in this report , there are serious problems with the implementation of FRUs , including insufficient numbers of women police officers and inadequate training , mentoring , and facilities ..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
