The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she applied to take part in the entrance competition for ORG attached to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for the DATE academic year .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE she took the practical selection tests performing on the ba\u011flama .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the music section of the ORG administration published a list of successful candidates in the entrance examination , which included the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant immediately applied to a medical board at ORG for a medical report certifying her fitness to study at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that medical board drew up a report stating that the applicant had been diagnosed with hypermetropia with nystagmus and severe bilateral amblyopia . ORG concluded that the applicant should be referred to a higher medical authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical board at ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) prepared a medical report finding that the applicant could receive education and instruction in the sections of ORG where eyesight was unecessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG sent a letter to the applicant stating the following :", "\u201c As we have explained on several occasions to your mother , your father and yourself , since you have failed to provide a report from a fully equipped public hospital ( tam te\u015fekk\u00fcll\u00fc PERSON hastanesi ) confirming that you can study at ORG ... we have been unable to enrol you ... We look forward to receiving your report from a public hospital mentioning your admission to ORG as a student as soon as possible ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father wrote to the Director of ORG to inform him that the medical report had been forwarded to ORG that DATE , as requested .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the Director of ORG wrote to the Chief Medical Officer of ORG . Referring to the report issued by that hospital \u2019s ORG on DATE , he informed the Chief Medical Officer that none of the CARDINAL sections of ORG could be deemed not to require eyesight . The letter stated that in order to be able to be educated in any section of the ORG , a student had to submit a medical report stating that he or she was fit for the task . The Director of ORG asked the Chief Medical Officer to prepare a fresh medical report taking account of the fact that no section of ORG could be considered as not necessitating eyesight , and accordingly to specify whether or not the applicant was capable of being educated in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for enrolment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s parents , acting in her name and on her behalf , lodged with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) an action against the administration of ORG to set aside ORG decision not to enrol their daughter . That action was accompanied by a request for a stay of execution of the impugned decision . In his pleadings , counsel for the applicant argued that his client had passed the entrance examination to ORG on DATE , appearing before a panel of CARDINAL teachers , and that on DATE she had passed the final entrance competition with full marks , appearing before a panel of CARDINAL teachers . Quoting the criteria for admission to ORG , that is to say being under DATE , holding a certificate of primary education , having the requisite physical abilities for playing the chosen instrument in respect of which enrolment has been requested , not having a physical disability such as to prevent her from receiving an education in the chosen section , and passing the talent and technical standard competition . Counsel for the applicant submitted that she had satisfied all those criteria . Her enrolment in ORG had been refused on the sole ground that she was blind , which was contrary to law and the equality principle . In support of her application , counsel for the applicant relied on LAW , Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of Basic Law No . DATE on national education ( \u201c Act No . CARDINAL \u201d ) and LAW . CARDINAL on specialised education . He also cited the names of former blind students who had graduated from the same ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a statement of defence of CARDINAL DATE the administration of ORG submitted that when filing her application for enrolment the applicant \u2019s father had provided no document referring to her blindness . It contended that he had concealed that fact , had behaved as if his child were disability - free and had therefore attempted to deceive the enrolment office . It stated that LAW admissions and enrolment in ORG set out the \u201c no disability \u201d criterion . Furthermore , the applicant had failed to provide a medical report certifying that she could study at ORG , which requirement applied to all applicants for admission . The statement therefore affirmed that the refusal to enrol the applicant had not been due to her blindness but stemmed from her failure to submit all the requisite documents for her enrolment , within the stipulated time - limit . It added that even though the medical report submitted by the applicant had stated that she could study in the sections of the ORG where eyesight was unnecessary , there were in fact no such sections . Finally , it pointed out that in the absence of appropriate facilities and teaching staff with the requisite expertise , ORG was not in a position to provide education for blind students , or indeed for persons with any kind of disability . In that connection it explained that in DATE , when it had opened , ORG had hoped to introduce facilities for teaching blind students , but the lack of teachers with a command of braille had forced it to abandon those efforts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request for a stay of execution of the decision on the grounds that the conditions set out in DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of Act No . CARDINAL on Administrative Procedure ( \u201c Act No . CARDINAL \u201d ) as amended by Act No . CARDINAL had not been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting in her name and on her behalf , the applicant \u2019s parents appealed against that decision to ORG . They argued that pursuant to section CARDINAL LAW Act No . CARDINAL , there had been CARDINAL preconditions for obtaining a stay of execution : the existence of damage which was irreparable or difficult to repair , and the apparent unlawfulness of the administrative Act in question . The parents stated that under the circumstances of the present case it was obvious that the refusal to enrol their daughter in ORG would cause her damage which would be difficult to repair . They also submitted that such refusal was unlawful . Their memorial pointed out that the applicant held a primary school certificate and , apart from her blindness , had all the requisite physical capacities for playing the ba\u011flama . Furthermore , she had passed the entrance examination for ORG , and a medical report had established that she had no disability such as to prevent her from receiving education in the music department . They submitted that the merits of that medical report could not be contested , that other students had provided medical reports from institutions similar to that which had drawn up the applicant \u2019s report , and that ORG had accepted those reports . In their view , the fact that the report had not specifically mentioned that the applicant could study at the ORG could not invalidate it . Moreover , they argued that the respondent administration \u2019s argument that the medical report had not been submitted in time was fallacious , as that report had been submitted to ORG on DATE , that is to say on DATE after receipt of the letter from the ORG requesting the report . The parents further affirmed that the applicant had met all the conditions for enrolment and submitted the requested documents within the stipulated time - limits . The only reason for the refusal of enrolment had been her blindness . In reply to the respondent administration \u2019s plea that ORG had no sections where eyesight was not required , the applicant \u2019s parents provided the names of CARDINAL blind graduates of ORG . Those former students had asserted that blindness was no obstacle to playing a musical instrument , that there were many blind musicians and that ORG argument that none of the teachers knew braille was invalid in the light of advanced technology and computer systems capable of converting braille . Finally , the applicant \u2019s parents submitted that the impugned measure was contrary to the constitutional principle of equality and all the relevant international legal instruments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that appeal on the grounds that the conditions for a stay of execution set out in section CARDINAL LAW No . CARDINAL had not been fulfilled since the execution of the impugned decision was not such as to cause damage which was irreparable or difficult to repair and was not unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Medical Officer of ORG wrote to the administration of ORG to inform it that the medical report du DATE had been revised . The original sentence \u201c can receive education and instruction in the sections of ORG where eyesight is unnecessary \u201d had been replaced by : \u201c can not receive education or instruction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting in the applicant \u2019s name and on her behalf , her parents submitted a complaint to ORG against ORG , its Chief Medical Officer and the other doctors who had amended the medical report of DATE , accusing them of abuse of office . They argued that the doctors had amended the medical report arbitrarily , without examining their daughter . They affirmed that the purpose of the amendments had been to ensure that the proceedings against the administration of ORG concluded in the latter \u2019s favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they applied to ORG for an inquiry into the events in question .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG attached to ORG adopted a decision refusing to authorise the prosecution of the Chief Medical Officer in question . That decision mentioned that the findings of the report had been amended at the request of the administration of ORG and that there had been no wrongdoing or abuse of office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s parents , acting in her name and on her behalf , appealed to ORG to set aside that decision and authorise proceedings against the Chief Medical Officer in question . That appeal was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they lodged an appeal with ORG requesting the setting aside of the decision not to enrol the applicant . They relied on LAW Act No . CARDINAL of DATE on persons with disabilities ( \u201c Act No . CARDINAL \u201d ) , which had , in their view , put an end to all forms of discrimination in the educational sphere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The relevant sections of the court \u2019s reasoning read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "The principles governing entrance competitions and enrolments at ORG attached to ORG were adopted by ORG ... at the request of the section assembly , after having been debated in ORG assembly and deemed lawful by ORG . ... Those principles include the condition that applicants who have passed the competition for enrolment in ORG should not suffer from any physical disability impeding education in the section [ to which they have been admitted ] . Furthermore , that condition is mentioned on the form distributed to applicants listing the documents required for final enrolment . The submission of a report drawn up by a fully equipped hospital and stating \u2018 is capable of studying at the Music Academy\u2019 is mandatory .", "It transpired from the assessment of the application that [ the applicant ] passed the entrance examination and secured the right to be enrolled . However , whereas the report prepared by ORG had concluded that a report should be requested from a higher medical board , she requested a report from an equivalent medical board , namely ORG . It transpires from the defence of the respondent administration that in DATE , when ORG was set up , it had enrolled a number of blind students on a trial basis , but , in the absence of teaching staff conversant with the braille alphabet and having regard to the various difficulties encountered , that experiment was discontinued . No further blind students were admitted . It has been established that the administration wrote to the Chief Medical Officer of ORG requesting information on the interpretation of the medical report which it had issued and that the conclusions of that report had subsequently been amended . The respondent administration \u2019s decision to refuse to enrol the applicant was not unlawful as she had been unable to provide a report drawn up by a fully equipped public hospital and stating that she was capable of studying at ORG . The applicant \u2019s allegations to the contrary are ill - founded ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG adopted that decision on a majority vote , contrary to the recommendation of the President of the court , who adopted a dissenting opinion stating , with reference to LAW No . DATE , that no one could be deprived of his or her right to education and instruction . In his view , it was beyond doubt that it was incumbent on government departments to put in place an environment conducive to education and instruction and meeting the needs of blind persons . Referring to the defence put forward by the respondent administration , which had attempted to incorporate blind students in DATE , he noted that it had been possible at the time to provide blind persons with musical education . He emphasised that there were many famous blind musicians . To deprive individuals of their right to education was incompatible with a social and democratic ORG governed by the rule of law . He consequently held that the impugned administrative measure had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to the applicant \u2019s father in reply to his request of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The relevant parts of the letter read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The CARDINAL reports covered by the inquiry are similar in content .", "CARDINAL . However , the hospital administration \u2019s failure to defend the initial report and its decision to make the requested amendments , on the instructions of the administration of ORG ... can not be considered as an appropriate attitude .", "CARDINAL . The letter of CARDINAL ( no . CARDINAL ) sent by the administration of ORG ... to the Chief Medical Officer of the hospital ... states that \u2018 inasmuch , moreover , as the teaching administered in those sections is intended for sighted students , we have no suitable educational environment for blind students ( in terms of resources , equipment , technical facilities or teachers ) . For those reasons it is out of the question for sighted and blind students to follow common GPE .", "... Having regard to the relevant international agreements and legislative provisions , the course of action expected of the administration was not to force through amendments to a report drawn up by a hospital , thus impeding a blind citizen \u2019s right to education ... In conclusion , the Chief Medical Officer amended the form of the report , [ but ] its content remained the same , such that he can not be accused of negligence . The available administrative and judicial remedies should be used to aasert the right in question ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s parents , acting in her name and on her behalf , lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG against the DATE decision of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They submitted that that decision was contrary to the LAW , to LAW No . DATE , to LAW . DATE and to several international instruments and declarations . They submitted that the respondent administration \u2019s defence plea that eyesight was required in all the sections of ORG was fallacious , citing the names of blind former music students who held diplomas from the ORG . They requested the invalidation of the first - instance decision in accordance with the arguments set out in the opinion of the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administration of ORG filed its defence . It submitted that the applicant \u2019s medical report had mentioned that she could study in the sections of ORG which did not require eyesight , but that in fact the ORG had no such sections . Lastly , it affirmed that the applicant had not met all the requisite conditions for enrolment .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , served on counsel for the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law and upheld the impugned decision , having found that the latter had fallen within the jurisdiction of the administrative court , had not been unlawful and had complied with the procedural rules . Moreover , it transpired from the judgment of ORG that the reporting judge had come down in favour of admitting the appeal on points of law . In his opinion on the appeal on points of law , ORG with ORG , referring to LAW and sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Act No . DATE , also stated that educational establishments were required to take into account persons who required specialist teaching and to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee their education . In the circumstances of the present case , he considered that the decision not to enrol the applicant \u2013 who had passed the entrance examination for ORG and met all the legal conditions \u2013 flouted the relevant constitutional and legislative provisions and should therefore be set aside .", "CARDINAL . According to information transmitted to the ORG by the applicant , after the rejection of her application to ORG , she continued her education in an ordinary school before joining ORG of ORG .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
