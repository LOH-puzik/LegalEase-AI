ORG Mr PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , resides in GPE with his family .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , PERSON went to FAC to collect a parcel which he had been informed by telex message was to arrive on board an ORG flight . According to the applicant , he expected the parcel to contain samples of NORP food sent to him through the intermediary of CARDINAL of his relatives who was an ORG employee . As he was unable to find it , he approached an airline official who directed him to a padlocked trunk which had remained uncollected and bore an ORG luggage ticket but no name . The official , acting on the advice of police officers watching the trunk , suggested that he left it where it was , intimating to him that it might contain prohibited goods .", "The applicant took possession of it nevertheless , and passed through customs without difficulty . He had chosen to go through the \" green channel \" for passengers having nothing to declare . He was accompanied by CARDINAL other NORP nationals whom he had met there for the first time . Immediately afterwards he telephoned to his brother PERSON to come and meet him at a terminal near their home in order to help him since the package had proved heavier than expected .", "CARDINAL . ORG officials then detained Mr PERSON and his CARDINAL companions as they were about to board the ORG terminal coach . Mr Salabiaku identified himself as the person for whom the trunk had been intended and denied that it was anything to do with his CARDINAL compatriots who were immediately released .", "ORG officials forced the lock of the trunk and found , lying underneath victuals , a welded false bottom which concealed QUANTITY of herbal and seed cannabis . The applicant asserted that he was unaware of the presence of the cannabis and that he had mistaken the trunk for the parcel of whose arrival he had been advised . His brother was also arrested at the Porte Maillot ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG telephoned to Mr Amosi and Mr PERSON landlord , informing him that a parcel bearing the applicant \u2019s name and his address in GPE had arrived by mistake in GPE . It was opened by an investigating judge but was found to contain only manioc flour , palm oil , pimento and peanut butter .", "CARDINAL . Mr Amosi and Mr PERSON were released on DATE and , together with a certain PERSON , also a NORP national , were charged with both the criminal offence of illegally importing narcotics ( Articles PERSON , L.

By an order dated DATE , they were committed for trial before ORG , ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the CARDINALth Chamber of this court acquitted Mr PERSON and PERSON giving them the benefit of the doubt but found the applicant guilty . It stated in particular :", "\" The accused \u2019s bad faith is evidenced by the fact that he showed no surprise when the first package opened in his presence turned out to contain none of the foodstuffs contained in the second package , although he described clearly what he claimed to be expecting from PERSON and received in the second .", "The latter package arrived in GPE in circumstances which it has not been possible to determine and its existence can not rebut presumptions which are sufficiently serious , precise and concordant to justify a conviction .... \"", "Consequently , the court imposed on Mr PERSON a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a definitive prohibition on residing in NORP territory . Furthermore , in respect of the customs offence , it imposed on him a fine of MONEY ( FF ) , under LAW , to be paid to the customs authorities , which had joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant and ORG appealed .", "On DATE , ORG ( CARDINALth Chamber ) set aside the judgment with regard to the criminal offence of illegal importation of narcotics , on the following grounds :", "\" ... the facts alleged against the accused are not sufficiently proven ; ... in fact , although Mr PERSON , who had been expecting only a parcel of victuals , took possession of a very heavy trunk secured by a padlock to which he did not have the keys , which bore no name of any addressee and for which he did not have the corresponding luggage ticket counterfoil , it has been established that a package in his name containing victuals arrived DATE afterwards in GPE on an ORG flight from GPE . This package had apparently been sent to GPE in error , its intended destination being GPE ;", "... in those circumstances , it is not impossible that Mr PERSON might have believed , on taking the trunk , that it was really intended for him ; ... there is at least a doubt the benefit of which should be granted to him , resulting in his acquittal ... \"", "The court , on the other hand , upheld the first - instance decision as regards the customs offence of smuggling prohibited goods :", "\" ... any person in possession ( d\u00e9tention ) of goods which he or she has brought into GPE without declaring them to customs is presumed to be legally liable unless he or she can prove a specific event of force majeure exculpating him ; such force majeure may arise only as a result of an event beyond human control which could be neither foreseen nor averted ... ;", "...", "... Mr PERSON went through customs with the trunk and declared to the customs officials that it was his property ; ... he was therefore in possession of the trunk containing drugs ;", "... he can not plead unavoidable error because he was warned by an official of ORG ... not to take possession of the trunk unless he was sure that it belonged to him , particularly as he would have to open it at customs . Thus , before declaring himself to be the owner of it and thereby affirming his possession within the meaning of the law , he could have checked it to ensure that it did not contain any prohibited goods ;", "... by failing to do so and by having in his possession a trunk containing QUANTITY of herbal and seed cannabis , he committed the customs offence of smuggling prohibited goods ... \"", "ORG also confirmed the fine of CARDINAL ORG imposed on the applicant ; it fixed at the minimum period the duration of imprisonment for non - payment .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed on points of law . He relied on DATE CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ( article DATE , article DATE ) of the Convention : in his submission , by placing upon him an \" almost irrebuttable presumption of guilt \" , which \" operated in favour of the customs authorities \" , ORG had violated both his right to a fair trial and his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty .", "ORG ) dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE , finding that the judgment appealed against had \" properly \" applied LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW , under the terms of which \" the person in possession of contraband goods shall be deemed liable for the offence \" :", "\" ... contrary to what is alleged , the aforementioned Article was not repealed by implication by GPE \u2019s adhesion to the Convention ... and had to be applied since ORG , which reached its decision on the basis of the evidence adduced by the parties before it , found that the accused was in possession of the trunk and inferred from the fact of possession a presumption which was not subsequently rebutted by any evidence of an event responsibility for which could not be attributed to the perpetrator of the offence or which he would have been unable to avoid . \"", "CARDINAL . Infringements under LAW constitute criminal offences with various specific characteristics .", "The Customs Code essentially prohibits smuggling ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and undeclared importation or exportation ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . This case is concerned solely with smuggling .

ORG At the material time LAW classified these infringements in CARDINAL classes of petty offences ( contraventions ) and CARDINAL of more serious offences ( d\u00e9lits ) .

CARDINAL , p.
