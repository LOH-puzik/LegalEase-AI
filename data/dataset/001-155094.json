Act stipulates that where a Homeland War veteran has , before the entry into force of the LAW , died of illness directly caused by his defence of the sovereignty of GPE , applications for recognition of status and for disability benefit must be lodged within DATE of the date of entry into force of the LAW . As the LAW entered into force on DATE the application could have been lodged by DATE . It was not disputed that the claimant lodged her application on DATE , that is to say after the expiry of the time - limit stipulated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , and therefore this ORG finds that the decision of the defendant body was well - founded . The claimant \u2019s allegations in her administrative action are therefore ill - founded and irrelevant .", "In addition , it is noted that the claimant took over proceedings from her late father ... However , they were separate proceedings establishing the claimant \u2019s late father \u2019s status as a disabled Homeland War veteran , and not the proceedings establishing the status of a family member of a fallen Homeland War veteran and the right to family disability benefit ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant further lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) against that judgment . She reiterated her arguments from the administrative action , adding that the domestic authorities had spent DATE trying to establish her late father \u2019s status , which could have only been used as the legal basis for her request after DATE . She also argued that her status was de facto recognised when she had been allowed to take over the proceedings after her late father , and that she was only lacking a declaratory recognition of her factual status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasoning of ORG , declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded .
