The applicant company specialises in taking soil samples by way of drilling for geological examination , inter alia , for the purpose of assessing suitability for building sites and for the construction of wells .", "CARDINAL . In the building industry in GPE , a number of collective agreements operated , which contained regulations related to the social welfare of employees working in that sector ( see relevant domestic law and practice paragraphs CARDINAL ) . The ORG associations in the building industry ( PERSON and ORG ) and the trade union ( ORG ) concluded ORG in FAC ( Tarifvertrag \u00fcber das Sozialkassenverfahren i m Baugewerbe , \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The ORG contained rules about contributions and entitlements in relation to both the ZVK and ORG of ORG ( Urlaubs- und PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which jointly comprised ORG in the building industry which went by the common name \u201c PERSON - BAU \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As ORG declared the ORG generally binding ( allgemeinverbindlich ) pursuant to LAW of ORG ( Tarifvertragsgesetz ) , it was binding on all employers in the building industry , even if they did not belong to the ORG association ( LAW of ORG , see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph CARDINAL ) . As a consequence , all employers in the building industry were obliged to contribute to ORG an additional sum amounting to PERCENT of the gross wages paid to their employees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company was not a member of an ORG association that was party to the relevant collective agreements . It was thus not directly bound by any collective agreements by virtue of such membership .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a letter to the applicant company with key information about the supplementary welfare schemes , including with regard to contributions to be paid and possible benefits it might receive . The applicant company did not react to this letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following enquiries made in order to establish whether the applicant was obliged to pay contributions , ORG sent a letter to the applicant company , informing it about its duty to pay contributions and that an account had been opened into which benefits would be paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company \u2019s lawyer sent a letter to ORG , objecting to being registered with the Fund .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to pay PERSON euros ( ORG ) in welfare fund arrears for the period DATE to the ZVK . The applicant company was further ordered to submit copies of the wage slips issued to its employees DATE and DATE . ORG considered that the applicant company was bound by the ORG , which was binding on all employers in the building industry even if they did not belong to one of the ORG associations . The activities of the applicant company fell within the scope of the ORG which , in its LAW ( v ) no . CARDINAL , listed drilling as an activity within its scope .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal submitting , in particular , that the generally binding effect of the ORG violated the negative aspects of its right to freedom of association . It argued that it was obliged to contribute to a fund jointly set up by the ORG association and the trade union , even though it did not belong to either of these associations . The applicant company further complained that it was prevented from founding its own association , due to a lack of funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s appeal and did not grant leave for an appeal on points of law . As well as confirming ORG reasoning , ORG held that the generally binding effect of the ORG did not violate the applicant company \u2019s right to freedom of association . It observed that the generally binding effect did not entail an obligation to adhere either to one of the ORG associations or to ORG . Referring to the case - law of ORG ( decision of DATE , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph CARDINAL ) , ORG conceded that the applicant company , which was not a member of CARDINAL of the ORG associations , had the disadvantage of not being able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of ORG via these associations . The right to participate in the decision - making process within these associations was reserved to members of the respective association . In so far as this fact exerted a certain pressure to become a member of CARDINAL of the ORG associations , this was , however , not sufficient to amount to a violation of the negative aspect of its right to freedom of association .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the obligation to contribute to ORG did not prevent the applicant company from founding its own association . It observed that the major parts of the contributions due would be reimbursed to the applicant if properly declared .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that the obligatory contribution to ORG took account of the high fluctuation of employees in the building industry and served the public interest of allowing for management of the employee \u2019s claims by ORG , thus preventing a distortion of competition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s complaint against the refusal to grant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant company \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reasons ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
