On DATE the applicant stood trial before ORG , charged with unlawful purchase and possession of large quantities of narcotic drugs , an offence under LAW . A prosecutor was present . The applicant was unrepresented .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the trial court judgment that when questioned in the course of the trial , the applicant stated that he had been feeling unwell so had been taking ORG to relieve the pain . He admitted that on DATE he had bought CARDINAL blisters of Tramadol , a narcotic - like pain reliever , from a stranger in the street for the equivalent of about EUR CARDINAL and had been arrested shortly afterwards . He expressed remorse and asked for leniency in sentencing . In view of those admissions the trial court , relying on LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ruled it unnecessary to examine the evidence related to the \u201c circumstances \u201d , which were \u201c not contested by any party \u201d . On DATE the trial court convicted the applicant of illegal purchase and possession of drugs , an offence under LAW , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that his admissions before the trial court had related only to the facts and not to the legal classification of the offence , which he maintained was erroneous . He argued that mere possession of ORG was not unlawful as such , except where it was in breach of the applicable regulations . For this reason , his acts should have been classified not under LAW as drug possession but rather under LAW , namely breach of the rules related to the purchase and circulation of drugs and analogous products .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a singlejudge formation , denied the applicant leave to appeal . The court stated that the applicant had admitted the circumstances of the offence and the trial court had then proceeded under LAW of the ORG . However , in his appeal the applicant was contesting his conviction under LAW and the legal classification of his actions . The court held that , because of the applicant \u2019s admission and the procedure used at the trial under LAW CCP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the decision was not amenable to appeal on the grounds invoked by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , holding that ORG decision had complied with the rules of criminal procedure ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
