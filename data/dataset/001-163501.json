On DATE the applicant was dismissed . The reason given in the dismissal decision , which was issued on the same date , was that the company had faced financial difficulties following a severe drop in client orders , which had forced it to reorganise and reduce its activities , to downsize and to remove CARDINAL posts , including the applicant \u2019s . The dismissal decision noted that the applicant was given the opportunity to apply for a position that had not been removed , but did not take up that opportunity . The dismissal decision also took account of the criteria established by the collective agreement concerning the order of priority in respect of dismissals and the fact that no other posts suitable for his professional qualifications or other posts in general had been available within the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the dismissal decision before the domestic courts and asked to be reinstated . He argued , inter alia , that on the dates that the dismissal notice and decision had been issued by the company he had already been an elected member of the union \u2019s auditing committee and had therefore been occupying an elected position within the union . He stated that according to LAW the company was not allowed to fire him while he held such a position .

The court considered that even if it had accepted the company \u2019s argument that the auditing committee had not been part of the union \u2019s executive functions and that therefore the conditions set out by LAW had not been met , the dismissal decision had still been unlawful because the provisions of LAW ) applied . The conclusion that at the time of his dismissal the applicant had been occupying an elected position in a union body ( even if not an executive one , as LAW ) did not make the same distinction as LAW ) had become reasonable and even mandatory , given that he had been elected to the union \u2019s auditing committee .

The court held that according to the aforementioned legal provisions , taken together with the provisions of the union \u2019s constitution , the auditing committee was neither an executive nor an elected body .
