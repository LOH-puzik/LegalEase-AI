The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Head of ORG of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants married in DATE . They have a daughter ORG born on DATE . As the daughter \u2019s surname the parents wished to give her the mother \u2019s , i.e. the first applicant \u2019s surname PERSON was refused on CARDINAL DATE by ORG . Based on Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON , henceforth referred to as ORG ; see below , Relevant domestic law ) , the ORG found that the child would obtain the family name which in the present case was the second applicant \u2019s , i.e. the father \u2019s surname PERSON", "The ORG appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE . The decision stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the parents of the child are married , the child obtains the family name ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) . As a rule this is the name of the husband , exceptionally it will be the name of the mother if the parents have chosen this name as the family name according to LAW . If the mother puts her name first according to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL CC , this will have no effect on the name of the common child ...", "CARDINAL . NORP There is agreement with the parents that there would be discrimination contrary to LAW if the family name was based solely on the name of the husband . But no right can be deduced for the parents freely to chose the family name of their common child . The applicants overlook in their argumentation that the reform of matrimonial law considered the equality of man and woman to the extent that the spouses may obtain , according to LAW , the authorisation to have the woman \u2019s name as the family name , following an administrative procedure to change the name , if there are commendable grounds . This possibility to change names in case of commendable grounds , in respect of which only minor conditions ( geringe PERSON ) may be attached , is more easily attained than the CARDINAL stated in LAW . Justification herefor is that marriage in any event will oblige CARDINAL partner to renounce her / his name , for which reason there is less public interest in the irreversibility of a family name than in the case of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL CC ... A commendable ground can be seen in every , even only remotely understandable , not clearly unlawful or immoral reason ... Even if LAW continues to uphold the principle of the unity of the family name , the spouses are free to apply , with the Government of their GPE of residence , for the authorisation to employ the woman \u2019s name as the family name . The legislator thus enabled the spouses to choose as a family name the woman \u2019s name and to pass this name on to any common children ... The only difference in LAW to a complete freedom of choice lies in the envisaged administrative procedure which , according to LAW ) of LAW is free of costs . Contrary to the applicants\u2019 opinion , this merely formal difference can not amount to a breach of the prohibition of discrimination within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Upon announcing their marriage the applicants renounced filing a request within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL CC . As a result , they have opted for the name of the husband as the family name . According to LAW , their common daughter ORG obtains the family name of the parents ... \u201d", "The applicants\u2019 further appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( Bundesgericht ) , the decision being served on DATE . In its decision the ORG recalled that the applicants had not opted for the possibility to choose the wife \u2019s name as the family name . The case concerned not only the interests of the parents but , above all , the interests of the child who had an independent right to a family name and to be attached to the family . It would not be possible to grant parents with CARDINAL child the right freely to choose the family name for every child . It was not clear why a child \u2019s right to identity and individuality should demand the free choice of name for the parents , and LAW did not grant such a freedom of choice . Insofar as the applicants pointed out that there would be discrimination in respect of whichever name was chosen as the family name that of the husband or that of the wife , the ORG considered that it lay in the nature of things that parents had to agree on CARDINAL name for the child .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code state :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Government of the GPE of residence may grant a person the change of name , if there are important reasons herefor .", "( CARDINAL ) The request of the spouses to have the name of the wife as the family name is to be granted if there are commendable reasons ( achtenswerte GPE , int\u00e9r\u00eats l\u00e9gitimes ) . .... \u201d", "In practice , such \u201c commendable reasons \u201d are assumed if they are worthy of consideration and reasonable .
