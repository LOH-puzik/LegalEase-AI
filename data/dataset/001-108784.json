NORP In TIME of DATE he was arrested by the police and brought to FAC in GPE , on the grounds of having committed the administrative offence of insulting a police officer . He was allegedly forced to return the money which he had taken from PERSON for installing a roof drainage system on his house . According to the applicant , he had not managed to finish the work on that installation when PERSON asked for the money to be returned and also involved his relatives who worked at FAC in order to intimidate the applicant and obtain full repayment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON made a complaint to the police , according to which the applicant had defrauded him by accepting money and refusing to return it , while having failed to carry out any work . On DATE a criminal investigation against the applicant was initiated .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s relatives paid MONEY ( ORG ) to PERSON , who signed a statement to the effect that he no longer had any claims against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked ORG to order the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE . The applicant was accused of defrauding PERSON by accepting CARDINAL NORP lei ( approximately FAC at the time ) in DATE as payment for installing a roof drainage system , but failing to carry out any work . He was also accused of CARDINAL similar offences , but no details other than the case numbers were given . Details were given at subsequent court hearings . A hearing was scheduled for DATE at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was not able to read the prosecutor \u2019s request until immediately before the hearing and was not given a copy at that time . He did not see any other documents being submitted to the investigating judge to substantiate the prosecutor \u2019s request and no documents were shown to the defence or discussed by the investigating judge at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing of DATE the lawyer informed the court of the payment of ORG CARDINAL to PERSON The prosecutor present at the hearing declared that there was no evidence of any repayment of the monies to PERSON The lawyer then asked that PERSON be heard in order to confirm that payment . The court did not take any formal decision in respect of PERSON and the latter was not heard before the court adopted its decision . During the same hearing , the applicant submitted that he had been arrested on DATE . The prosecutor confirmed that , stating that the applicant had been arrested on an administrative charge and then arrested again as a suspect in the criminal proceedings . The applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that since his client was suspected of having committed a crime , he should have been arrested in accordance with the criminal procedure . The court did not react in any way to this argument , confining its reasoning to the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his decision of DATE the investigating judge of ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s request and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The reasons given were that :", "\u201c the act of which [ the applicant ] is accused is considered a minor crime , which is a legitimate ground for detention pending trial ; the character , degree of harm and circumstances of the crime constitute sufficient grounds for supposing that [ the applicant ] will interfere with the normal course of the investigation ; the materials submitted to the court clearly confirm that there is a reasonable suspicion that [ the applicant ] committed a minor crime , and there are sufficient grounds to prevent [ the applicant ] from hindering the establishment of the truth and from absconding from the investigating authority ; the materials in the file confirm the reasonable suspicion that [ the applicant ] might reoffend , as it follows from the information obtained by the investigating authority during the operational phase of the investigation that [ the applicant ] may have committed other similar offences ; ... [ the applicant ] has no stable income and works periodically , there is no information about his financial status and his state of health is not incompatible with detention ; [ the applicant ] and his lawyer did not submit any evidence in support of their statements ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed , complaining of the applicant \u2019s de facto arrest on DATE and his detention thereafter , and of the lack of legal assistance available to the applicant until DATE . He submitted that the lower court had not dealt with that complaint . He also informed the court of the fact that he had only read the prosecutor \u2019s request at the hearing of DATE and had not had time to properly prepare for that hearing . Besides the prosecutor \u2019s request , no other document had been submitted to the court or shown to the defence to substantiate the need for the applicant \u2019s detention . Nor had the prosecutor referred to any additional documents or other evidence during the hearing . The applicant had asked the first - instance court to hear a witness , who could have confirmed that the applicant had had a contract with PERSON and that PERSON relatives in the police had threatened the applicant if he refused to return the money for the ongoing work , but the court had refused to hear the witness without giving any reasons . Moreover , the judge had relied on grounds which had not been mentioned by the prosecutor , thus showing bias towards the prosecution . The lawyer relied on LAW and referred to the absence of any evidence to support the prosecutor \u2019s request for the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial , including the absence of any judgment or other evidence concerning the other similar offences allegedly committed by his client . In the lawyer \u2019s opinion , there had been no reason to believe that the applicant would abscond or interfere with the investigation . Relying on LAW , the lawyer also complained of the inhuman conditions of his client \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as unfounded , referring to similar grounds as those referred to by the lower court , including that the applicant had allegedly committed other similar offences \u201c as [ could ] be seen from the criminal file \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . He referred to CARDINAL separate occasions on which the applicant had been accused of having accepted money for installing roof drainage systems but had failed to do so , including in respect of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG granted the request and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The court noted that", "\u201c ... a serious crime has been committed for which the law provides a penalty of DATE imprisonment ; there has been no compensation for the pecuniary damage caused ; there are reasons to believe that [ the applicant ] could abscond or interfere with the normal and objective course of the investigation ; the grounds on which the initial detention was ordered remain valid . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed , relying on the same grounds as in his previous appeal . He added that his client had told the lower court that he owed no debt to PERSON , whom he had reimbursed fully . Moreover , the lawyer had read the prosecutor \u2019s request only immediately before the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . No documents other than the prosecutor \u2019s request had been examined by the court during the hearing or shown to the defence . The lawyer added that the applicant had a stable home life , had CARDINAL children to support and had not been previously convicted of any offence . He again complained of his client \u2019s inhuman conditions of detention , both at FAC and at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and relied on LAW in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , relying on the same grounds as those referred to by the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release . The court found that", "\u201c ... [ the applicant ] is accused of having committed a crime for which the law provides punishment [ through ] alternatives [ to imprisonment ] ; he did not abscond from the investigating authority ; he has a permanent residence and CARDINAL children . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of fraud and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , suspended for DATE . In his submissions to the court the applicant acknowledged having taken money from PERSON in DATE . After a while , he had manufactured the relevant items but had not been able to install them because of personal family circumstances obliging him to remain home with his children . The court found that he had taken money from CARDINAL other people in DATE and had also failed to carry out the work which he had undertaken to do for them .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant had been detained for TIME at FAC on DATE and had then been transferred to ORG ( Comisariatul General de Poli\u0163ie or \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , where he had been detained until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant described his conditions of detention at FAC as follows : he had been held in a cell without a bed or any other furniture ; there had been no ventilation , toilet or running water in the cell ; he had not been given any food and had had to beg for it from other detainees ; the cell had been overcrowded and many detainees had smoked , exposing the applicant to passive smoking ; and the cell had been damp .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at the ORG he had been placed together with CARDINAL other people in a cell measuring QUANTITY . The cell had been dirty and infested with parasitic insects and rats . There had been no furniture in the cell , and the detainees had slept directly on the floor , in their own clothes . The cell had been damp and very cold . A low - intensity lamp , covered by a metal sheet , had been switched on TIME a day and there had not been a window in the cell . The toilet had not been separated from the rest of the cell , offering no privacy . Due to the large number of people using it , the toilet had been occupied most of the time and had smelt bad . The applicant had not been given any personal hygiene items , clean clothes or bed linen . He had had to continually wear the clothes in which he had been arrested . The applicant had received little food , which had been of a very bad quality ( a cup of warm water in TIME and boiled vegetables with warm water for lunch ) . Even though he had had a stomach ulcer and high intracranial blood pressure , he had not received any medical assistance . He had been detained in such conditions for TIME a day , without any right to take exercise or to take part in recreational activities .", "CARDINAL .

The Government submitted a list of laws , regulations , Ministry orders and other acts or bills yet to be enacted which are aimed at improving various aspects of prison conditions and the medical treatment of detainees .", "CARDINAL . The Government annexed to their observations copies of judgments in the cases of PERSON v. ORG and ORG ; PERSON v. ORG and ORG ; PERSON v. ORG ; and GPE v.

Institutions of ORG", "In so far as the conditions of detention in the police establishments are concerned , it appears that this is the field in which the least progress has been achieved . It is not necessary to enumerate here in detail all the shortcomings observed by the delegation , which are more or less the same as those observed during past visits ( and of which ORG is perfectly aware ) . ... Numerous persons are still detained overnight in police establishments , in cells which should not be used to detain persons for TIME . It is high time to remedy these problems , in particular by placing accused persons under the supervision of institutions of ORG and building new prisons corresponding to ORG standards and to the norms laid down by the NORP legislation .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . Persons placed on remand should as a rule be detained in prisons under the authority of ORG . However , such persons may continue to be held in police temporary detention facilities ( izolatoare de deten\u0163ie preventiv\u0103 , abbreviated \u201c ORG \u201d ) under the authority of ORG , if this is required for the purposes of the criminal investigation or if the transfer to a pre - trial establishment can not be effected promptly . It is also possible for remand prisoners to be transferred back from prison to an ORG when necessary for the purposes of the investigation or the court proceedings , for periods of DATE at a time .", "At the time of the DATE visit , the delegation noted that the average length of stay in IDPs of persons remanded in custody had decreased . For example , at the ORG of ORG in PERSON , the majority of persons who had been remanded in custody were being transferred to Prison No . CARDINAL within DATE . This is a welcome development . Nevertheless , the delegation also gathered evidence of persons remanded in custody spending extended periods of time in IDPs ( e.g. uninterrupted stays of DATE at PERSON ; DATE at ORG in GPE ) . As regards the practice of repeated transfers of remand prisoners between prisons and IDPs , it continued unabated .", "As stressed by the ORG in the past , IDPs will never be capable of providing conditions of detention suited for holding persons remanded in custody . The NORP authorities are well aware of the limitations of the existing IDPs and , following a decision to transfer the responsibility for these facilities to ORG by DATE , have been exploring the possibility of constructing CARDINAL new remand prisons in different regions of the country . During the DATE visit , the delegation was informed that this project was still at the conception phase , due to the lack of budgetary resources . ORG was approaching various donors , banks and the public sector in the hope of raising the necessary funding ( estimated at MONEY per remand prison ) .", "The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to give the highest priority to the implementation of the decision to transfer the responsibility for persons remanded in custody to ORG . The objective should be to end completely the practice of holding remand prisoners in police establishments . The return of remand prisoners to police facilities , for whatever purpose , should be sought and authorised only when there is absolutely no other alternative , and for the shortest time possible .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . NORP In previous visit reports , the ORG recommended that administrative arrest be no longer exploited by operational police officers to detain and question persons suspected of criminal offences , without their being offered the safeguards inherent in the criminal procedure . Nevertheless , during the DATE visit , the delegation came across a number of persons who were officially being held in IDPs for having committed administrative offences ( e.g. at ORG and ORG in PERSON ) , but were in fact being questioned as criminal suspects , apparently without being allowed to contact a lawyer . Resolute steps should be taken to stamp out this abusive practice , which amounts to circumventing the legal provisions concerning the length of police custody in respect of criminal suspects . The ORG reiterates its previous recommendation that firm instructions be issued to law enforcement officials that persons suspected of criminal offences are to be held and questioned strictly in accordance with the provisions of LAW . ORG also calls upon the NORP authorities to ensure that compliance with this requirement is closely supervised .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention", "a. temporary detention facilities ( IDPs )", "CARDINAL . Following the ORG \u2019s visit in DATE , the GPE authorities launched a programme for improving material conditions in IDPs , with a view to implementing the ORG \u2019s recommendations . However , it became clear from the discussions held with ORG officials at the outset of the DATE visit that the programme had not progressed as rapidly as envisaged , due to the lack of funding . At CARDINAL of the establishments visited , the ORG in ORG , the refurbishment had been suspended , and it was unclear when the works would be finished . That said , the delegation was pleased to note that the ORG envisaged occupancy levels once the refurbishment had been completed would be in accordance with the ORG \u2019s standards ( i.e. cells measuring some CARDINAL m\u00b2 would hold CARDINAL persons each ) , and that the in - cell toilets would be partitioned off .", "CARDINAL . Despite the above - mentioned programme , conditions of detention in the IDPs visited remained , in general , very poor . The cells had either no windows ( e.g. at the ORG of ORG in GPE , some of the cells at GPE ORG , one cell at PERSON ORG ) or their windows were covered by shutters which substantially limited access to natural light . As for artificial lighting , it was , as a rule , dim . Particular mention should be made of one cell at PERSON , in which there was no electric bulb ; staff had reportedly told the detainee that he should provide a new bulb himself . Further , the cells were often stuffy , despite the presence of a ventilation system ( which was rarely turned on because of the noise it made ) . Detainees slept on wooden platforms , which took up most of the floor space ; no steps had been taken in respect of providing mattresses and blankets ( the presence of an occasional blanket was attributable to detainees\u2019 families ) . The only exception was the ORG in GPE , where most of the cells were fitted with bunk beds with mattresses .", "At the time of the visit , the number of persons held at the IDPs was well below their official capacity . Nevertheless , overcrowding was observed in some of the cells ( e.g. QUANTITY persons in a cell measuring QUANTITY m\u00b2 at PERSON ) . Further , the delegation came across several cells which were very small ( CARDINAL m\u00b2 at ORG ; CARDINAL m\u00b2 at PERSON ) . Cells of such a size are only suitable for short periods of detention .", "CARDINAL . The arrangements in respect of food varied from CARDINAL establishment to another : at the CARDINAL IDPs in GPE , CARDINAL meals a day were being provided , whereas in PERSON , the number of DATE meals was CARDINAL , and at GPE and PERSON , CARDINAL . The delegation received numerous complaints about the insufficient quantity and poor quality of the food . It was clear that most detainees relied primarily on food parcels delivered by their families .", "CARDINAL . On a more positive note , all the IDPs visited possessed exercise yards . Detainees were in principle entitled to TIME of outdoor exercise a day . However , at the IDPs in GPE and ORG in GPE , the delegation heard widespread allegations that the outdoor exercise periods were limited to TIME , and did not take place every day . Apart from outdoor exercise , there were no activities ( e.g. access to books , newspapers , radio , board games ) .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , the conditions prevailing at the IDPs visited continue to render them unsuitable for accommodating persons deprived of their liberty for prolonged periods of time ( which continues to be case of both persons remanded in custody and administrative detainees ) . Reference has already been made in paragraph CARDINAL to the envisaged transfer of responsibility for IDPs to ORG and the setting up new remand prisons , which should correspond to the requirements of NORP legislation and the ORG \u2019s standards . In the meantime , the GPE authorities should redouble their efforts to find the financial means necessary for providing for the fundamental needs and preserving the dignity of detained persons . In particular , urgent steps should be taken to ensure that :", "- all detained persons are provided with a clean mattress and blankets ;", "- detained persons receive food of sufficient quantity and improved quality ;", "- in - cell lighting ( including access to natural light ) and ventilation are adequate ;", "- there is a minimum of CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person in multi - occupancy cells ;", "- detained persons have ready access to communal toilet facilities , and in - cell toilets are equipped with a partition ;", "- detained persons are ensured access to washing facilities and are supplied with essential personal hygiene products ;", "- all detained persons have access to outdoor exercise of TIME per day .", "The ORG also recommends that steps be taken to provide some form of activity in addition to outdoor exercise to persons held in excess of DATE at IDPs . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . During the DATE visit , the delegation observed that the practice of holding remand prisoners in police temporary detention facilities ( izolatoare de deten\u0163ie preventiv\u0103 , abbreviated \u201c ORG \u201d ) continued unabated . In the report on the DATE visit , the ORG called upon the GPE authorities to give the highest priority to the implementation of the decision to transfer the responsibility for persons remanded in custody to ORG . In response , ORG indicated that it was in favour of a temporary transfer of responsibility for IDPs to ORG , pending the building of pre - trial establishments under the latter ORG authority . However , at DATE visit , the Minister of Justice indicated that the responsibility for the IDPs could not be taken over by his Ministry because conditions of detention in these facilities were substandard .", "The ORG shares the view that IDPs do not offer suitable conditions for holding persons remanded in custody . ORG would nevertheless like to stress that , in the interests of the prevention of ill - treatment , the sooner a criminal suspect passes into the hands of a custodial authority which is functionally and institutionally separate from the police , the better . The delegation \u2019s findings from the DATE visit support that ; most cases of alleged police ill - treatment in the context of the DATE events had emerged only after the persons concerned had been transferred to an establishment under ORG or released . The ORG recommends that , pending the building of new pre - trial establishments , the GPE authorities take steps to transfer the responsibility for IDPs to ORG . Further , the ORG would like to receive up - to - date information on progress made to build new pre - trial establishments under ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal framework for deprivation of liberty of administrative detainees is provided by LAW , which entered into force after the DATE events , on DATE , and replaced LAW . According to the new legal provisions , the persons concerned may be sentenced to DATE of deprivation of liberty , a period which may be extended to DATE if they have committed CARDINAL offence .", "In the past , the ORG repeatedly recommended that detention for administrative offences no longer be exploited by operational police officers in order to detain and question persons suspected of criminal offences , without their being offered the safeguards inherent in the criminal procedure . The delegation \u2019s findings from the DATE visit suggest that such abusive practices were widespread in the context of the DATE events . The ORG is therefore pleased to note that the new LAW restricts the powers of the police to hold persons , on their own authority , for TIME . However , the delegation heard some recent allegations from detained persons that proceedings under LAW ( for insulting law enforcement officials , for instance ) had been initiated against them after they had refused to confess to a criminal offence , despite their correct behaviour vis - \u00e0 - vis the police , and that their objections had little weight before prosecutors and judges . The lack of access to a lawyer in practice , at this stage of the procedure , had exacerbated this situation . The ORG recommends that prosecutors and judges be encouraged to be particularly vigilant as to the possible exploitation by the police of the provisions of LAW to circumvent the length of police custody in respect of criminal suspects . Reference is also made to paragraph CARDINAL as regards access to a lawyer .", "According to LAW , persons under administrative arrest by virtue of LAW should be detained , as a minimum , in conditions provided for sentenced prisoners placed under an \u201c initial \u201d regime in penitentiary establishments . That said , it appeared during the DATE visit that a number of persons under arrest continued to serve their administrative sentences in police establishments , which certainly do not offer such conditions . The ORG recommends that the GPE authorities take all the necessary measures to ensure that persons under administrative arrest serve their sentences in penitentiary establishments .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes with satisfaction that the cells of the ORG of ORG in PERSON had been fitted with beds and that some repair works had been carried out DATE before the visit . However , the conditions prevailing in this facility were still not suitable for the prolonged periods for which remand prisoners and administrative detainees were being held in it : high official occupancy levels in the cells ( e.g. CARDINAL places in a CARDINAL ORG cell ) , poor in - cell lighting , access to outdoor exercise limited to TIME .

Some of the cells were not equipped with mattresses and persons in police custody were not given blankets to sleep on .", "CARDINAL . The Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations that the minimum time required by national law for exercise ( TIME per day ) is not respected in many cases . At several police stations , detainees indicated that they are allowed to walk only for TIME . This is exacerbated by the fact that some spend long periods of DATE in police custody . The CARDINAL shower per week requirement is not always respected . Moreover , the toilet in the cells consists normally of a bucket or an open toilet without flush , at best separated by QUANTITY high walls .
