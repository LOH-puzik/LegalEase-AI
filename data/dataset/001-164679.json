The applicant noted that LAW allowed the use of physical force in order to prevent crime , arrest individuals who had committed crimes , or in other situations when justified by the public interest ( see paragraph DATE below ) , but not in order to establish a person \u2019s identity . He submitted that he was of advanced age ( DATE at the time of the incident ) and had a medium - level disability , so it was illogical that he could have violently resisted QUANTITY police officers .", "The applicant also pointed out several discrepancies between the ORG statements :", "( a ) V.B. had stated that the applicant had attempted to punch him inside the guard booth ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , whereas GPE had said that nothing had happened inside the booth ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "( b ) J.D. had stated that he and PERSON had approached the guard booth and the applicant had stepped outside , and that physical force had been used against the applicant only when handcuffing him and only inside the booth ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

The prosecutor also noted that the witness PERSON had not seen the officers hit the applicant . Lastly , the prosecutor held that the injury to the applicant \u2019s abdomen was not sufficient to find that he had been kneed by the officers , because the medical examination had shown that such an injury could have been caused either by being hit with an object or by bumping into an object .
