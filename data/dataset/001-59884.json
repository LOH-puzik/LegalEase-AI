On DATE at TIME the applicant requested the prison authorities to allow him to vote in the parliamentary elections , as there were voting facilities for detainees in the PERSON prison . The prison guard took him to the PERSON room . The applicant was then told by a group of CARDINAL guards that in order to be allowed to vote he must get undressed and undergo a body search . The applicant took off his clothes except his underwear , whereupon the prison guards allegedly ridiculed him , exchanged humiliating remarks about his body and abused him verbally .

On DATE the applicant brought an action before ORG , complaining that his right to vote had been breached in that he had been prevented from voting .

He complained of humiliation by the prison guards by vulgar comments and verbal abuse in the course of the events complained of .

ORG noted that , according to the note , the prison guards had stated that the applicant could have a razor hidden on him and threaten the members of the election committee therewith . The court considered that the prison guards had been acting in conformity with LAW , which provided that \" if such a need arose , a detainee should undergo a search \" and with the DATE unpublished Ordinance on Prison Security , concerning , inter alia , body search of detainees . It was not certain , noted the court , whether at the material time this regulation had still remained in force , but it could not be held against the guards that they had acted according thereto .
