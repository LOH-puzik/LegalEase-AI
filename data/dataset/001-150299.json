Shortly after the child was born , the mother refused the applicant any contact with him . In DATE the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to establish contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with the GPE / ORG for the regulation of contact rights . The course of proceedings before ORG is summarised in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE [ Committee ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE . By interim order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered DATE supervised contact between the applicant and his son . CARDINAL supervised contact meetings took place DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the applicant \u2019s contact rights for DATE . This decision was amended on DATE with respect to the applicant \u2019s right to be informed about the child \u2019s personal circumstances .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , the ORG found that the length of the proceedings before ORG , which had lasted from DATE to DATE , violated the applicant \u2019s right to a trial within a reasonable time under LAW . The ORG further considered that there had been a violation of the right to an effective remedy LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision given by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG held a hearing .", "CARDINAL . By interim decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided that the applicant had the right to see his son for TIME on CARDINAL specific dates between CARDINAL May and DATE . The first CARDINAL contact meetings were to take place in the presence of a supervisor . ORG further ordered the child \u2019s mother to take the child to the meetings on time . Finally , ORG warned the mother that an administrative fine ( NORP ) of MONEY ( ORG ) could be imposed if she did not comply with her obligations under this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the last contact meeting had taken place in DATE . There was no indication that contact with the applicant would jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare . According to expert opinion , the child \u2019s refusal to meet the applicant was not based on an autonomous decision , but was influenced by the mother \u2019s stance . This was in line with the personal impression the judge rapporteur had gained from hearing both parties and the child . ORG acknowledged that the conflict between the parents , and their ensuing lack of communication , posed a risk to successful contact . However , the course of the proceedings had shown that both parents were unwilling to settle these conflicts by availing themselves of specialist help . As it was unlikely that the parents would change their attitude , the granting of contact rights could not await the outcome of successful counselling .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that the overall course of the proceedings had demonstrated that both parents had contributed to the failure of contact visits . In view of the lengthy proceedings , which imposed an emotional burden on the child , it was particularly important to reestablish contact carefully after a regrettable interruption of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervisor reported on the first contact meeting , scheduled for CARDINAL DATE , which had been postponed to CARDINAL DATE . After a short conversation and some playful interaction with the applicant , the child had decided to go to his mother and subsequently refused to play with his father . The supervisor further informed ORG that the mother would be on holiday for the CARDINAL meetings scheduled for DATE and CARDINAL DATE and that the parties\u2019 counsels would have to agree on alternative dates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervisor reported on the second contact meeting scheduled for DATE . According to the report , the meeting had lasted TIME during which the applicant and his son had engaged in several play activities . The meeting was interrupted by CARDINAL interactions between the child and his mother . Subsequently , the child told the applicant that he did not wish to play with him and left with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother \u2019s counsel informed ORG that it had not been possible to find alternative dates for the meetings scheduled during the mother \u2019s absence and that she expected that the meetings would be re - scheduled for DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to schedule alternative dates for the meetings which were to take place during the mother \u2019s holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it did not see any reason to issue additional orders as to the organisation of the contact meetings , which fell within the competence of the supervisor . Furthermore , there was no room for scheduling alternative meetings . ORG further requested the mother to submit proof of her alleged holiday absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG to impose an administrative fine of at least ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL on the mother for having failed to enable him to exercise his contact rights on CARDINAL May and a further LAW for having prevented him from exercising his contact rights on DATE . He submitted that the mother had failed to deliver the child on CARDINAL DATE , allegedly for professional reasons . On the alternative date , CARDINAL DATE , the mother had brought the child , but taken him away after TIME . On DATE the mother had left the meeting place with the child after TIME and had thus prevented further contact . In view of the urgency of the subject matter and relying on the case - law of ORG ( the applicant \u2019s counsel referred to the case of PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , the applicant further requested ORG to reach a decision speedily .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervisor reported on the contact scheduled for DATE . The unsupervised contact ordered by ORG had not taken place because the child had refused to go with his father and the supervisor \u2019s mediation attempts had been to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother submitted documents to justify her absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to impose further administrative fines on the mother for failure to comply with her obligations under the interim decision . Relying on the report by the supervisor , he submitted that the mother had prematurely terminated the contact visit on DATE . Furthermore , she had failed to appear at the meeting place on DATE and DATE . On DATE the mother had failed to hand over the child to the supervisor , and induced the child to declare that he did not wish to have any contact . On DATE the applicant informed the supervisor that he would be TIME late because of traffic problems . The supervisor informed him that mother and child had left the building after TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the mother \u2019s counsel \u2019s request , postponed the hearing to DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing on DATE ORG heard the supervisor \u2019s oral submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that no decision could yet be taken for lack of the main case file on the contact proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested ORG to expedite the proceedings . He further submitted that ORG was in possession of all relevant documents and that it was not necessary to await the return of the main case file .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG imposed an overall administrative fine of ORG CARDINAL on the mother for having contravened the contact order CARDINAL times . ORG noted that it was not in dispute between the parties that contact did not take place , or took place only for a limited period of time , on the CARDINAL dates relied upon by the applicant . ORG further considered that the mother was accountable for the failed contact , albeit to a limited degree .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the fact that contact visits were terminated because of the child \u2019s resistance did not exonerate the mother . ORG had repeatedly stated that it was up to the mother to avail herself of the necessary educational measures in order to influence the child and thus to allow contact visits . The mother had failed to establish that she had undertaken such measures . She might have had good reason for requesting the dates to be rescheduled . However , she did not have the right to cancel these dates without ORG or the applicant \u2019s consent . Finally , the mother was under an obligation to wait for the applicant on DATE , taking into account that the applicant had informed her beforehand that he would be late .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the relevant provisions prescribed an administrative fine of up to EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each established contravention of the court order . Based on an overall assessment of the circumstances , ORG considered that only administrative fines within the lowest range could be envisaged . ORG took into account that , according to a report submitted by an access custodian on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) there were serious indications that it would not even have been possible for a professional counsellor to establish contact . Against this background , the mother \u2019s personal responsibility appeared to be minor . This was even more so as the mother did not completely prevent contact , but took the child to CARDINAL of the scheduled meetings . The demands on her educational capabilities had been high , as she had not only been obliged to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a period of DATE , but also to change the child \u2019s established pattern of behaviour . It had further to be taken into account that comparable contraventions would not have to be sanctioned in the mid - term future , because a contact custodian had been appointed . Against this background , the administrative fine had primarily the character of a sanction for past behaviour , but not of a coercive measure .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , account also had to be taken of the fact that the purpose of the first dates , on which the child had prematurely terminated the contact visits , was to institute contact . It was inherent in this constellation that contact could only be established gradually and might fail . ORG had pointed out this possibility and had also indicated that no undue pressure should be exerted on the child .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the contact meetings scheduled for DATE and DATE , the applicant had been informed beforehand that mother and child would be absent and this fact should also be taken into account . He had thus incurred travel and other expenses on these dates in spite of this knowledge .", "CARDINAL . Considering these circumstances , the ORG found it reasonable to impose an administrative fine of LAW for each of the CARDINAL occasions when contact did not take place at all and of LAW each for the CARDINAL remaining contraventions .", "CARDINAL . Both parties lodged complaints . The applicant submitted that the administrative fine imposed was far too low and obviously ineffective . He further complained that the length of the administrative fine proceedings had been excessive and had violated his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to amend its decision of CARDINAL DATE and forwarded the complaints to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited both parties to submit comments in reply by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both parties\u2019 complaints . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint , ORG considered that ORG had exercised its discretion in an acceptable way , taking into account all relevant circumstances . ORG further considered that while it was true that the proceedings on administrative fines had to be processed speedily , the courts had to retain the possibility of availing themselves of all relevant information . Even though there were several reasons to assume that the length of the proceedings had been acceptable , ORG did not consider it necessary to decide whether the proceedings had been conducted within a reasonable time , as there was no legal basis for establishing that the length of proceedings had been excessive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) with ORG , which was rejected by that court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , on DATE the applicant requested ORG to execute its decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to advance court fees . On CARDINAL DATE ORG requested the applicant to submit an original version of the decision to be executed . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant pointed out that the decision had to be executed ex officio . On DATE the mother , who had been granted leave to pay by instalments , had paid the administrative fine in full . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the administrative fine had already been paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the main proceedings , quashed the decision of ORG of DATE ( suspension of contact rights ) and granted the applicant contact rights on every second DATE TIME for TIME each time , beginning on QUANTITY DATE . Following CARDINAL supervised contact meetings , the applicant was to have the right to unsupervised contact meetings of TIME each . ORG further appointed Mr. PERSON as custodian for the implementation of contact rights ( Umgangspfleger ) . The mother was ordered to hand over the child to the custodian for the purpose of contact meetings . Both parents were ordered to have preparatory conversations with the custodian .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed its previous finding that there was no indication that contact with his father would jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare and that there was thus no reason to suspend contact rights . There was furthermore not sufficient evidence that the child insistently refused to see his father . ORG considered that the child \u2019s verbal refusals to meet his father were not based on the child \u2019s own assessment , but stemmed from the child \u2019s loyalty to his mother as his immediate caregiver . It was evident that contact meetings had solely failed because of the mother \u2019s lack of willingness or her inability to allow such contact .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further observed that both parents had contributed to the lack of communication and to the overall development of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In view of the mother \u2019s continuing failure to fulfil her parental duties , ORG considered it necessary to appoint a custodian for the implementation of contact rights . ORG observed that the custodianship had to be subject to a time - limit . It considered that the time until DATE should be sufficient for establishing a stable relationship between the applicant and his son , allowing continued contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the custodian informed ORG that he had met the applicant , who had been uncooperative and did not seem to take an interest in the child \u2019s welfare . Under these circumstances , contact could not take place as scheduled . Nevertheless , in order to allow for contact , he recommended that the applicant seek professional counselling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to discharge the custodian from his duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a curator ad litem to represent the child \u2019s interests and submitted the request to the mother , the custodian and to ORG for comments within DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained that ORG , when scheduling the hearing , had not respected the time - limit of DATE laid down in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on Proceedings in Family Matters ( see Relevant Domestic Law , below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that it had not been possible to schedule an earlier hearing , as the judge in charge had been replaced by DATE and the hearing was scheduled immediately after the new judge \u2019s return from holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place in the absence of the custodian , who had informed ORG that he was on holiday .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the custodian requested ORG to discharge him from his duties .", "CARDINAL . DATE the ORG judge contacted by telephone CARDINAL potential custodians . PERSON was ready to supervise the first contacts , while PERSON declared her readiness to hand over the child for the ensuing unsupervised visits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties that custodian PERSON could only be dismissed if a new custodian was appointed . ORG intensive endeavours to find a person who was ready to implement the decision of DATE proved difficult . On that same date , ORG judge wrote letters to CARDINAL potential custodians and enquired about their readiness to take up duties in the instant case . Furthermore , ORG informed the parties that it had instituted ex officio fresh contact proceedings in order to review the existing regulations ( ORG , see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother challenged the ORG judge for bias . She withdrew her motion on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel informed the mother \u2019s counsel that the applicant intended to exercise contact rights on DATE and that he expected the mother to hand over the child .

On DATE the mother \u2019s counsel replied that she considered that the applicant did not have the right to unsupervised contact .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG informed the parties of its intention to decide in written proceedings on the basis of submissions lodged by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s requests to impose administrative fines on the mother . ORG observed that the supervised contact ordered in the decision of DATE had not taken place . There was no indication that unsupervised contact could take place without an initial phase of supervised contact . This question was the subject matter of the new proceedings on the review of contact rights instituted by ORG . Under these circumstances , it could not be said that the mother had failed to comply with the contact order of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the GPE / ORG of Appeal confirmed the suspension of contact rights until DATE .

Relying on expert opinion , ORG considered that personal contacts against the consistently expressed will of the child , who had now reached DATE , would jeopardise the child \u2019s psychological development and had thus to be temporarily excluded . ORG further observed that the administrative fine imposed on the mother might have been insufficient and that the refusal of contacts between father and child , which had already lasted DATE , had not only been caused by the GPE and , in particular , the mother \u2019s failure , but also by a failure of the judiciary and of the children and youth welfare services involved ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
