The ORG represents all medical practitioners in GPE and also has its own website . The second applicant was the ORG \u2019s president at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisation \u2019s website , which was addressed to all members of ORG in GPE and was also sent out to all of them via e - mail . The letter was titled \u201c GPE funds want to take over medical practices \u201d ( \u201c LOC wollen PERSON \u00fcbernehmen \u201d ) . The second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleagues for a serious reason , namely , because it had been reported in the media that the F. company planned to go into \u201c the radiology business \u201d . He added that share - bidding companies planned to offer medical services \u2013 initially in the area of radiology , but soon enough in other areas of the profession as well and that doctors risked becoming mere employees of such \u201c locust \u201d companies . If they would not act according to the ORG wishes , they would be dismissed . The second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan : radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could , in future , also be offered by limited companies . Shares of those companies could then be bought by the F. company , and the \u201c locusts \u201d would reach their goal , namely control of the medical profession . Giving an example of a risky development , the second applicant stated that in DATE , colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards . DATE , almost all of those laboratories were owned by the PERSON group , which , in turn , was owned by insurance companies , investment funds and foundations , and which employed a large number of doctors . The second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee CARDINAL thing : that the ORG professional representative body would make use of all legal and political means available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead , to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by \u201c managers and controllers \u201d and to ensure , inter alia , that existing medical practices were protected from the competition from \u201c international locust funds \u201d ( \u201c internationale LOC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the F. company lodged an action against the CARDINAL applicants and an application for an injunction with ORG ( ORG ) . The applicants contested the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an injunction prohibiting the applicants ( each of them individually ) from repeating the statement that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties , in particular medical professionals . The injunction prevented the applicants from referring to the F. company as a \u201c locust \u201d , \u201c locust company \u201d or \u201c locust fund \u201d . The applicants were further prohibited from stating that the provision of services by the F. company , particularly services in the area of radiology , was a disastrous development . The court found that there was a competitive relationship between the F. company and the applicants , and found the statements made by the applicants to be defamatory under LAW of LAW and unethical under LAW ( Bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the injunction . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Wien ) partly granted the appeal , and prohibited the applicants from alleging that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties and medical practitioners , and from calling it , inter alia , a \u201c locust company \u201d . However , it dismissed the F. company \u2019s application to prohibit the applicants from calling its provision of services a \u201c disastrous \u201d development . ORG found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings . ORG held official authority status in relation to certain areas of its work ( Bereich der Hoheitsverwaltung ) , in addition to representing the interests of its members ; it was therefore considered a legal entity under LAW ( Amtshaftungsgesetz ) . However , when acting as a special interest group , it represented its ORG interests from a mainly economic perspective , rather than acting in its capacity as an official authority . According to ORG , the letter in issue pursued the interests of the ORG \u2019s members , outside the ORG \u2019s official sphere of activity .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further established , referring inter alia to ORG , that the term \u201c locust company \u201c ( \u201c Heuschreckenunternehmen \u201c ) was introduced into the political discussion in NORP speaking countries in DATE by Mr PERSON , a NORP politician , and is ever since used in political debates as a pejorative term for private - equity companies or other forms of capital funds with short - term or exaggerated return expectations \u2013 like hedge funds or \u201e vulture \u201c funds , which also had negative connotations . The domestic court found that there was a need to balance the interests involved in the present debate , reiterating that extreme opinions were only unlawful if they were excessive . As a result of that balancing exercise , ORG found that the \u201c locust \u201d statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate , and that the F. company could therefore not base its claim on LAW . However , ORG classified the ORG actions as competitive in nature . Statements of fact made in violation of LAW could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression . ORG found that NORP law provided wideranging protection for commercial and economic interests . Those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the non - competitive context of a public debate of general interest . Therefore , ORG upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statements about the \u201c locust company \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as regards the further statement , namely that provision of certain services by the F. company was a \u201c disastrous development \u201d , ORG found that , read in context , the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the F. company . It was therefore to be considered a personal opinion , and thus a value judgment that was not defamatory under LAW . It also did not fall under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the extraordinary appeal . It acknowledged the applicants\u2019 argument that where a competitor , even for economic purposes , took part in a debate of public interest , freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test . However , ORG observed that the applicants had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioners and companies which provided the same services . The applicants could have warned their members of the possible risks of cooperating with companies without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism . However , the applicants had exceeded that limit and stated that the F. company was a \u201c locust \u201d . That statement was CARDINAL of fact , and the applicants had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegations , and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitations of freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its judgment in the substantive proceedings and ordered the applicants to refrain from : repeating the statement that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties , in particular medical practitioners and patients ; and stating that the F. company was a \u201c locust company \u201d , a \u201c locust fund \u201d or a \u201c locust \u201d . It further ordered the applicants to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisation \u2019s website for DATE , and to publish it in the first applicant organisation \u2019s print newsletter .", "CARDINAL . ORG made substantial reference to ORG reasoning in the interim injunction proceedings . It followed the previous finding that the relevant statements did not constitute defamation pursuant to LAW . Examining the statements in relation to the provisions of LAW , ORG found that the letter had been written by ORG in a commercial and not a political context . It had also had the advancement of independent medical practices as an objective , and had contained a warning regarding capital ventures which allegedly threatened ORG independence . ORG found the relevant comparisons with \u201c locusts \u201d to be statements of fact regarding both the F. company and its conduct in relation to third parties , doctors and patients . The statements were also likely to damage the F. company \u2019s commercial interests , and had not been proved to be true .", "CARDINAL . The used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression as the statement was uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship . With reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under LAW with regard to commercial language , ORG observed that a competitor was required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitors . The term \u201c locust \u201d was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning , which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor . The applicants were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the F. company , pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as unfounded . It referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that , according to the case - law of ORG , the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed ; if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest , freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication . The greater the public interest in being properly informed and the less the statement related to commercial interests , the more the statement would be protected by LAW . In the present case , there was no doubt that there was an ongoing public debate ; however , the commercial interests of the applicants had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment , which was rejected by ORG on DATE . ORG found that the applicants had not only called the F. company a \u201c locust \u201d , but had also reproached this company for negative conduct , such as dominating doctors , dismissing doctors who did not act in accordance with company wishes , and focusing on economic factors rather than the welfare of patients ( \u201c Herrschaft \u00fcber den \u00e4rztlichen Berufstand , PERSON spurender \u201d GPE , PERSON an \u00f6konomischen ORG und damit nicht am PERSON der Patienten \u201d ) . Therefore , the expression used had turned into a statement of fact , giving the reader the impression that the F. company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened upon by the lower courts was justified . Even though the applicants had taken part in a debate of general public interest , an untrue and damaging statement of fact was not protected by freedom of expression . Furthermore , the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not , as such , prohibited by the decisions of the NORP courts ; the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors .", "CARDINAL .
