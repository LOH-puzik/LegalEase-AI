NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a DATE single male from GPE . He originates from GPE city in GPE . His whole family belonged to PERSON party ( ORG do PERSON Armadas de Cabinda ) , supporting and fighting for the independence of ORG . His parents were killed by the NORP security forces when he was DATE .

The applicant was also a member of the party but his activities within the party were minor , mostly limited to distributing leaflets .", "CARDINAL . The applicant described his problems with the authorities as first starting when he was around DATE ( in DATE ) . He was selling tinned food at the market when he ended up having a disagreement with a buyer who subsequently reported him to the police , alleging that he was conspiring to kill an important army colonel . The applicant was apparently held for a long time ( DATE ) in detention without a trial , but eventually his uncle managed to buy his release . The conditions in detention were extremely poor and he also claimed to have been beaten and stripped naked .", "CARDINAL . The events that led to his flight from GPE happened in DATE . When returning home after his working day at the market , the applicant found that his uncle , brother and sister had been killed in the house . His uncle \u2019s wife and his own common - law wife , who was also living in the same house at the time , had disappeared . The applicant has not had any information about them since . He heard that some people from his village had managed to escape to GPE and suspected that perhaps his spouse and his uncle \u2019s wife were among those people . Subsequently , the applicant was taken by ORG ( ORG ) soldiers to an unknown location where CARDINAL other persons were held . The applicant was questioned about the whereabouts of his uncle \u2019s documents concerning PERSON and ill - treated by the soldiers . He was beaten on the head with the butt of a rifle , his feet were beaten and burned , he was shot in the leg and the surface of his chest was cut with a knife . CARDINAL or DATE he managed to escape , together with another PERSON - FAC activist who had also been held captive . The applicant walked back to his village and went to see the local priest , who helped him to flee GPE . He stayed for a while with a friend of the priest and in a church in GPE . Eventually the priest organised his escape through a smuggler . The applicant flew to GPE and travelled by car to GPE , where he arrived on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a general physician examined the applicant . The applicant had already been hospitalised in DATE and DATE for epileptic fits which were at first diagnosed as psychogenic or caused by injuries to the head . The general physician reported scarring in several places on the applicant \u2019s body and diagnosed him as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder . He referred the applicant to ORG in GPE ( GPE kuntoutuskeskus , ORG f\u00f6r rehabilitering av tortyroffer ) for further examination and treatment .

The applicant complained also of chest pain and difficulties in breathing from time to time , which he claimed had been caused by being kicked in the chest . He was also very sensitive to touch in general , which the physician concluded to be most likely a psychological symptom of ill - treatment . The applicant had therapy sessions with both the psychiatrist and the psychologist of ORG from DATE until DATE . In their various medical reports the psychiatrist and the psychologist concluded that the applicant \u2019s psychological condition was consistent with him having experienced severe and multiple trauma , compatible with his claim of having been tortured and having experienced the killing of his family . The psychiatrist diagnosed the applicant with severe depression and post - traumatic stress disorder and reported him as suffering also from slight memory problems . His symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and his memory problems eased during treatment and the applicant managed to begin studies in GPE .

On DATE the applicant sought asylum immediately on arrival in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE , PERSON ) rejected his application and decided to send him back to GPE . In its decision ORG referred extensively and in detail to the applicant \u2019s asylum interview and found several discrepancies in his story . It noted that on some occasions the applicant gave exact dates and on other occasions he could not place the events at a specific moment in time . ORG found the applicant \u2019s story of his escape , in a wounded state , from the ORG soldiers to be unlikely and not credible . ORG concluded that as there were such credibility issues , the applicant \u2019s scars could have been caused by other means than torture , as he claimed . It also doubted whether the applicant was from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that ORG decision be quashed and he be granted asylum , or alternatively , secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances . He also requested that an oral hearing be held . The applicant also submitted to the court several new medical certificates , noting that it was common that such trauma as torture and epilepsy affect negatively a person \u2019s memory and ability to recount events consistently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and refused his request for an oral hearing as unnecessary . It noted , however , that the discrepancies in the applicant \u2019s story were minor and did not give reason to doubt that he originated from ORG . On the other hand , ORG did not consider it likely that the applicant would have been arrested and tortured after the rest of the family had been killed . The applicant \u2019s previous arrest when he was DATE seemed to be unconnected with later events . ORG considered , furthermore , that it was not likely that NORP officials would be interested in the applicant now that his uncle was dead . Although the human rights situation in PERSON was not very satisfactory , it concluded that the applicant could be returned there without a real risk of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL .

He also submitted certificates of his studies in GPE and relied on them as grounds for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application after having examined it in a fast - track procedure and decided to expel him to GPE . It also imposed a DATE ban on entry into GPE and the GPE - area . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s situation had not changed since the previous application and that there were no grounds for a residence permit or grounds preventing the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE . It noted that the situation in the ORG area had calmed down , even though some attacks were still reported between the NORP army and some rebel groups of the FLEC - FAC . However , the applicant could relocate internally to other parts of GPE if he wished . As for his health , ORG noted that mental health care was available in GPE , although a shortage of medical staff in general was reported .
