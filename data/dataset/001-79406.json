PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicants signed an agreement with ORG in GPE . Under the terms of the agreement they agreed to provide care to X , a boy born on DATE . The applicants were chosen as prospective adopters for X because of their professions since the child required special care on account of his health problems . In this connection , the applicants referred to the conclusions of a medical opinion of CARDINAL DATE which stated that X showed disturbed physical development and slightly retarded psychomotor development . It was also recommended in the opinion that the child should be placed without delay with a caring adoptive family , which would create the conditions for his proper development .", "On DATE ORG , the biological mother of X , was deprived of her parental authority for X. On DATE the boy began to live with the applicants .", "On DATE ORG appointed a guardian ( opiekun prawny ) for X.", "On DATE the applicants filed with ORG an application for the adoption of X.", "On DATE ORG requested ORG to restore her parental authority for X.

In particular , she asked the court to change the guardian of X and to grant her and her parents , PERSON and GPE , visiting rights .", "On DATE ORG rejected her application for interim measures . The court did not see any grounds for changing the guardian . It pointed out that X had been born with a serious neurological disorder and required physiotherapy on a DATE basis . As for the request to grant visiting rights to ORG and her parents , the court rejected it for the following reasons :", "\u201c The application for interim measures does not contain any reasons for allowing [ ORG ] and her parents to visit the child . ORG considers that this request is not aimed at the well - being of the child but results from the change in the attitude of [ ORG ] and ( ... ) her GPE endeavours to obtain the legal custody of [ X ] .", "The evidence gathered shows that [ ORG ] is still undergoing therapy . Getting back the child is a part of that therapy and would allow [ ORG ] to return to normal life .", "The decision to allow [ ORG ] and her parents to visit the child would require the return of the child to a child - care facility . Therefore , the child would be deprived of his present living conditions which provide him with proper physical and ( ... ) emotional development .

The court observed that since DATE ORG had cohabited with a man who had fathered X. Her parents had not approved of that relationship . ORG had concealed her pregnancy . She had not consulted a doctor and smoked . ORG had been interested in continuing the relationship with her child \u2019s father , who had , however , not accepted the child . When X was born , ORG declared that she wanted to leave him in the hospital for subsequent adoption . In DATE the father of X had left ORG and she had moved into her GPE flat . She started psychological therapy and in DATE informed her parents about the birth of X. The court considered that ORG was not emotionally ready to take care of a child . Moreover , her actions had been influenced by her parents . ORG was responsible for the fact that there did not exist any emotional bonds between her and X. At the same time , X had strong emotional bonds with the applicants who provided him with very good living conditions .", "On DATE ORG appealed against this decision .", "On DATE and DATE ORG held hearings and on the latter date it quashed the decision of ORG and remitted the case for reconsideration .", "On DATE ORG held the first hearing at which it decided to order opinions of CARDINAL experts in psychology .

At the same time the court decided that X should be placed in the foster family of PERSON and PERSON It pointed out that GPE was not able to provide X with proper care . The court referred to expert evidence which showed that she was emotionally and socially immature and behaved like a child who needed care and who was not responsible for her actions . As for its decision to place X with ORG \u2019s parents the court was of the view that \u201c it was justified to place the child in the foster family of the maternal grandparents since the advantages from growing up in a biological family exceeded the disadvantages resulting from the change of [ X \u2019s ] environment . \u201d", "ORG appealed against the decision .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicants\u2019 standing in the proceedings for an application for the restoration of ORG \u2019s parental authority .

At CARDINAL of the hearings ORG heard the applicants .", "On DATE ORG allowed ORG \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG and granted her parental authority for X. Basing itself on the expert opinions , the court established that there were at present no indications that ORG should not be personally taking care of X. The court then stated :", "\u201c An important issue , undoubtedly of the greatest significance , is to establish whether the wellbeing of [ X ] requires that he be returned to his biological mother . The interest of the child is the overriding factor in the instant case .", "According to the experts , whose opinions were followed by ORG , a child will have the best conditions for its development in the biological family . Other forms of foster family are allowed only if the biological parents are unable or inept to care [ for the child ] . Obviously , every change in the environment of [ X ] might give rise to difficulties of adaptation ; however , it is common knowledge that small children adapt quickly to new conditions . ORG offers to help in this respect .", "The experts underlined that the removal of [ X ] to the biological family had to be carried out correctly ; it did not have to create a shock for him . The pre - adoptive family , for which the separation would be extremely painful , declares that , to ensure the best for X , they will do everything to make the removal of X as painless as possible for him . The behaviour of the biological family ... shows their understanding that ... entering into X \u2019s life must come gradually , consensually and in a manner accepted by both parties . The [ ORG and GPE \u2019s ] position on that issue lead [ the court ] to believe that the biological mother \u2019s taking over the care of [ X ] would not create a shock for the child .", "In the light of the above , the court decided as in the operative part . \u201d", "The decision was final .", "On DATE , X , who had been living with the applicants for DATE and considered them as his parents , was taken away from them .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the adoption proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 application to grant them visiting rights .", "The custody and adoption of children are regulated by LAW ( PERSON i GPE ) .", "Article CARDINAL of the Family Code provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
