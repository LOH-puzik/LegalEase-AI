This area has a critical importance in terms of security . The terrorist organisation , ORG , is known to be transferring weapons and other goods along this route . It is also a route for other sorts of smuggling . The soldier on duty saw the car travelling from Batman in the direction of PERSON and waved to it to stop . Instead , the car increased its speed , came towards the soldier and passed him . The soldier tried to stop the car by whistling and firing a warning shot .

On DATE the tribunal decided that as the crime was not CARDINAL against another soldier or committed in a military location it had no jurisdiction to hear the case . The tribunal transferred the file accordingly to ORG so that the case could be tried under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to the tribunal on CARDINAL DATE to join the proceedings as a civil party in accordance with the provisions of LAW . She averred that her spouse had been intentionally murdered by Private Tuncay Deniz and for that reason wished to participate in the hearings as an intervening party . On the same date she also requested the tribunal to take statements from PERSON and PERSON , who had been waiting to be picked up by her deceased husband on DATE of the incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Since the tribunal had declared DATE that it lacked competence to hear the case against Private Tuncay Deniz it was unable to take a decision on the applicant \u2019s requests . Notwithstanding , it added the applicant \u2019s requests to the file .", "CARDINAL . The case file was transferred to ORG . In transferring the file , ORG declared :", "\u201c After the examination of the files , it is clear that the accused , who was the soldier on duty for road inspection and control at ORG gendarmerie headquarters , first warned the private car to stop ( licence plate number : CARDINAL Z CARDINAL ) then whistled to warn it ; immediately after that he fired a warning shot in the air , then fired once again towards the car without aiming at any specific target . The single bullet fired from his rifle hit the civilian , PERSON , in the head and caused his death . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When it was seized of the case ( file no . CARDINAL ) , the ORG organised on CARDINAL DATE the future procedure for dealing with the case and to that end drew up a list of witnesses and documents . The court ordered that the evidence of the witnesses be taken by other domestic courts by letters rogatory and their statements forwarded to it for inclusion in the case file . In accordance with the procedure so fixed , ORG obtained the statements of a number of witnesses , including PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . A statement was also obtained from Private GPE in which he claimed that he was not guilty of the charges against him as well as from Sergeants Murat Hekim and PERSON and Expert Sergeant Kutlu Alkurt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court accepted the submissions of the prosecuting counsel that the applicant be acknowledged as an intervening party in the proceedings on account of the possibility that she may have suffered as a result of the offence committed by Private Tuncay Deniz . The court had regard in this respect to the petition which the applicant submitted to ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court acknowledged at the same time that she would be represented in her capacity of intervening party by the lawyers to whom she had given a power of attorney ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . A statement was taken from the applicant by letters rogatory on DATE and forwarded to ORG . In her statement she informed the court that she had learned of the circumstances of her husband \u2019s death from PERSON and relied on his account of the circumstances in which her husband was killed . She also declared that she filed a complaint against the defendant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted to ORG at the latter \u2019s request a ballistics report on the CARDINAL spent bullets found at the scene of the incident . According to the report , the bullets had been fired from Private Tuncay Deniz \u2019s gun .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Private Tuncay Deniz was convicted under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) which governs causing death unintentionally , in conjunction with Article CARDINAL thereof ( using force in excess of that required by lawful self - defence ) and was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The court also ordered the defendant to pay the legal fees of the applicant as from the moment she became an intervening party in the proceedings . In its judgment ORG considered that :", "\u201c According to the defendant \u2019s evidence and the preliminary statement of his friend PERSON , who was at the gendarmerie headquarters , the defendant signalled the approaching vehicle to stop ; when the vehicle failed to stop he gave a warning with his whistle and fired one round in the air . The vehicle still not having stopped he fired towards it without taking any particular aim when it was QUANTITY away . By doing so he caused the death of GPE . According to the passenger witnesses\u2019 account they were not warned to stop in any way . However , if the driver was not warned to stop , it would have been illogical for him to have moved to the right . Under these circumstances the driver was warned CARDINAL way or another , even after he had passed . Nevertheless witness PERSON declared in his preliminary statement , and there is no reason for this statement not to be taken seriously , that he heard the sound of a whistle . The witness PERSON account that the defendant fired from a distance of QUANTITY without seeing anything at all was not confirmed by his father who was sitting in the same location .", "The primary issue to be resolved is whether the defendant acted with the intention to kill in this incident ...", "As it may be concluded from the content of the file , the defendant did not know the victim and the other passengers . The incident sketch in the file indicates that the firing distance was QUANTITY . In addition to the driver , there were QUANTITY persons seated in the back and CARDINAL other passenger in the front . Under these circumstances and at that distance it would not have been possible to identify the driver through the persons sitting in the back seat and take aim . Despite there being CARDINAL bullets in his rifle , the defendant fired CARDINAL single shot and despite that he still did not know whether this caused death . If his intention was to kill , he could have continued firing . Nevertheless there is no reason to ground a finding of murder . Having considered all these elements it is concluded that the defendant did not act with the intention to kill . Therefore , in due fairness , it is more appropriate to conclude that the intention was a wrongful assault .", "Although the defendant was on duty he should have assumed that the individuals in the vehicle did not hear him and he could have fired CARDINAL shot in the air ; and having considered the fact that a serious situation such as an escape or apprehending someone in the act was not present and since an assumption must be made that he knew the specification of his weapon , he should have been more careful and should have fired his weapon in a way which would not have harmed the persons in the vehicle . As a result of failing to comply with these considerations he exceeded the limits of his duty . However , the reduction of his sentence based on this factor is to be minimal as a result of the reasons , importance and seriousness of the offence , and the gravity of the harm caused by the offence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant , through a domestic lawyer , Mr Oktay Bagat\u0131r , appealed to ORG on DATE against the judgment of ORG on the grounds that the accused should have been convicted of intentional homicide .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the Government at the hearing , the victim \u2019s brother , Mr PERSON , requested that as CARDINAL of the intervening parties in the domestic proceedings he be permitted to exercise separately his right to appeal against the judgment . ORG acceded to this request on CARDINAL DATE . Furthermore , the Batman public prosecutor appealed to ORG on DATE against the judgment of ORG on the ground that Private Tuncay Deniz should have been convicted of the more serious offence of wilful homicide as defined under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The appeal is currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Although the ORG submitted to ORG on DATE details of the investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s husband as well as of the trial of the accused soldier before ORG and the state of the proceedings against him before ORG , the Commission did not in fact have the benefit of the full file when assessing the evidence surrounding the killing since the Government \u2019s submissions had been misplaced as a result of a clerical error .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of this error , the Commission based its assessment of the case on the following official documents only : the incident report prepared by Major PERSON ; the sketch map of the incident drawn by hand by PERSON ; the post - mortem and autopsy report prepared by the medical examiner ; statements taken by PERSON PERSON Ery\u0131lmaz on DATE from Private GPE and PERSON ; statements taken by ORG on DATE from Private Tuncay Deniz , PERSON , Expert Sergeant GPE and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .", "The ORG also had regard to the following : CARDINAL statements of PERSON , CARDINAL of which had been taken by ORG ; a statement of the applicant taken by ORG on DATE ; an expert statement dated DATE of Dr PERSON , a consultant pathologist for ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accepted firstly that there were speed ramps in place outside the gendarmerie headquarters which would have made it difficult and unlikely that the applicant \u2019s husband could have driven the car at speed through the checkpoint .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , no explanation was offered as to why the deceased would have driven recklessly through the checkpoint causing the soldier to jump to safety . For these reasons , the ORG found the soldier \u2019s account of being at risk to be unconvincing .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , while the Commission was unable to determine on the evidence whether the car was stationary or was still moving when the gendarme opened fire , it found it established that Private Tuncay Deniz signalled the car to stop . However , in its view there was insufficient material to conclude that he had fired a warning shot in the air as alleged since no ballistics report had been submitted .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , the Commission considered that there must be a very strong inference either that Private Tuncay Deniz aimed into the back of the car at the driver or fired so quickly as to render his aim inaccurate .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above findings the ORG concluded that the car driven by the applicant \u2019s husband was driven slowly up to and through the checkpoint , that the soldier signalled it to stop and that very shortly afterwards he opened fire intending to stop the car , either aiming at the driver or failing to take proper aim .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of detailed submissions on domestic law and practice , the ORG , like the ORG , has had regard to the relevant provisions and submissions made in the context of previous cases involving the respondent Government and the applicant \u2019s representatives .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review ...", "The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the authorities , whose liability is of an absolute , objective nature , based on the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus the authorities may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on the state of emergency , which provides :", "\u201c ... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of powers conferred by this PERSON are to be brought against the authorities before the administrative courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
