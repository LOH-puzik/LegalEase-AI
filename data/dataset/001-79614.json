The applicant \u2019s family in GPE owns a house in GPE with several apartments , which are used by the family upon their visits .", "It appears that as a child , he went for DATE to a private school which was attended mainly by pupils with a NORP background . The applicant left school after DATE schooling . He does not have any training or higher education and has not had any significant affiliation to the labour market .", "By a ORG judgment of DATE the applicant was convicted of assault , committed jointly with another perpetrator , and was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment suspended on probation .", "By a ORG judgment of DATE the applicant was convicted , inter alia , of assault , committed jointly with another perpetrator , and was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "By a ORG judgment of DATE the applicant was convicted of robbery and , inter alia , assault , committed jointly with several other perpetrators .

They were detained on remand the following day .", "On DATE they were convicted by ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) sitting with a jury . It found it established that on DATE , when the applicant was DATE and his cousin DATE , they had jointly threatened a young man , an NORP tourist , with a knife in order to steal his money . Although the young man was stabbed by the applicant , he first managed to flee . Shortly thereafter the applicant and his cousin ran him down , beat him , and the applicant stabbed him several times , the injuries inflicted resulting in the victim \u2019s death .", "In the same judgment of ORG of GPE , the applicant was also convicted of attempted burglary and violation of LAW committed on CARDINAL DATE ; and of aggravated assault , robbery and attempted extortion committed on DATE , when the applicant was DATE and detained on remand .

With regard to the order to expel the applicant and his cousin , the majority of CARDINAL judges held as follows :", "[ The applicant ] was born in GPE , whereas [ his cousin ] arrived as a threeyearold . They have spent their youth and had their schooling in this country where also their parents and siblings live . Thus , they have a strong connection with the NORP society and to people living here . At the same time , however , they have a [ significant ] connection with GPE and NORP culture . They speak NORP and DATE they have visited GPE where they have a big family . Both have been previously convicted , and have now been sentenced to longer prison terms , inter alia , for manslaughter , attempted robbery and aggravated assault . Having taken all considerations into account , in our view neither the elements mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) nor LAW speak decisively against [ their ] expulsion . Accordingly , we vote [ for their expulsion ] .", "The minority of CARDINAL judge held as follows :", "In my view , when taking all the elements mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW into account , the connection which the applicant and [ his cousin ] have with GPE and NORP culture , is not of such an extent and character that it has decisive weight when compared to their strong connection to the NORP society and people living here . In my opinion , the latter speaks significantly against expelling the applicant [ and his cousin ] from GPE . Accordingly , notwithstanding the serious crimes committed , I vote [ against their expulsion ] .", "The relevant provision of LAW ( PERSON ) applicable at the time read as follows :", "\u201c An alien who has lawfully stayed in GPE for more than DATE , and an alien issued with a residence permit under sections DATE may be expelled only if :", "( i ) the alien is sentenced to minimum DATE imprisonment or other criminal sanction involving or allowing deprivation of liberty in respect of an offence that would have resulted in a punishment of this duration .", "...", "( vi ) the alien is sentenced , pursuant to ...
