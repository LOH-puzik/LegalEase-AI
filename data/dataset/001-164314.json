Serghides;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and their friend PERSON were indicted for allegedly having stolen a wine press ( presu za gro\u017e\u0111e ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted all CARDINAL defendants of these charges . In so doing , it explained that while there was evidence that they had been in possession of a press , there was nothing to suggest that they had obtained it through any criminal activity . The applicants themselves maintained that they had found the press abandoned , while PERSON denied the charge and thereafter exercised his right to remain silent . No material evidence was introduced during the trial and , apart from the statement by the alleged victim \u2012 who maintained that the press worked and had been kept in a locked yard \u2012 the statements of CARDINAL witnesses supported the applicants\u2019 defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution lodged an appeal against this judgment , emphasising , in particular , that the first - instance court had failed to take into account a statement given to the police by PERSON on DATE ( albeit in the absence of the applicants and their counsel , who had not been invited to attend ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG quashed the impugned judgment and ordered a retrial . The court explained that the statement referred to by the prosecution was particularly important because on this occasion PERSON had confessed \u2012 in the presence of his counsel \u2012 that he had stolen the press together with the applicants . PERSON had subsequently revoked this confession claiming that it had been given under the influence of alcohol and then refused to answer any further questions , and all of these circumstances needed to be reconsidered by ORG , even though the prosecution itself had initially failed to request that ORG statement of DATE be admitted as evidence . The court found this failure by ORG to be \u201c unclear and inexplicable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON died and on DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held a hearing and read out PERSON \u2019s statement of DATE before the parties , found the applicants guilty . The first applicant was sentenced to an effective prison term of DATE while the second applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE . In its reasoning the court primarily relied on ORG statement of DATE . No evidence different from that admitted during the first trial was introduced during the retrial .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG upheld this judgment on appeal , and on DATE ORG rejected the ORG further appeal on points of law ( zahtev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosna\u017ene presude ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG , alleging that their conviction had been based on the testimony of a person whom they had never had a chance to cross - examine and who had , in any event , revoked it subsequently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal as manifestly ill - founded , adding that \u2012 as a consequence of the death of PERSON the lower courts had had no choice but to accept his prior statement given to the police and , clearly , could no longer accommodate the applicants\u2019 objection regarding his cross - examination ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
