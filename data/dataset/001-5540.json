A consignment of weapons had recently been delivered there by a CARDINAL - wheel - drive off - road vehicle in which the applicant had been a passenger and another person the driver .", "The Newtonstraat house was inhabited by CARDINAL PERSON , a close friend of the applicant from childhood ; the applicant had at CARDINAL time lived there too .

These items were packaged in sports bags and in dustbin liners wrapped with adhesive tape . A second mobile telephone was also found .", "It appears from a police report dated DATE that CARDINAL of the keys found in the Audi car fitted the door of the Newtonstraat house .

According to the official police report later drawn up of this event , he was carrying a pistol loaded with CARDINAL rounds of live ammunition .", "In the case against PERSON , which had begun before the applicant 's case , a hearing was held before ORG on DATE .

He stated that the informant was considered very reliable , having provided reliable information in the past , but refused to give any other information at DATE not even the precise date on which the weapons were delivered \u2013 so as not to place the informant 's life in danger . The date of delivery was given as \u201c after DATE \u201d . The official record of this hearing , including Police Officer PERSON 's statement , made its way into the file of the applicant 's case .", "On DATE CARDINAL PERSON 's father was questioned by the NORP police ( GPE ) . He stated that he had been tricked by his son into unwittingly overseeing the transport by air of QUANTITY of cocaine from GPE to GPE , from there to GPE and on to GPE .

The applicant denied all charges .", "The occupant of ORG , PERSON , was heard as a witness . He stated that it was incorrect that the applicant had delivered weapons to his house using a ORG Land Cruiser . The applicant had nothing to do with the weapons . CARDINAL other individuals , whom he refused to name ( being himself accused in connection with these dealings ) , had delivered the weapons , using a delivery van ( bestelbus ) . The applicant had visited the house to retrieve some diving equipment , which he had left there , before going on holiday ; it was possible that he might have touched some other items in the process , leaving his fingerprints .", "The owner of the ORG car , PERSON , was also heard as a witness .

These things which the person has heard , in combination with what he / she has seen and will make a statement about , namely persons including the accused carrying a large number of large firearms , puts the person in great fear . In addition , the person also gave an explanation of his / her situation , in which he / she feels vulnerable . The person is afraid of a drastic interference with his / her personal life if his / her identity becomes known to the accused and his circle of friends .", "The person informed me that he / she definitely did not want to testify under his / her own name .", "I , Investigating Judge , have discussed with the person whether he / she has a criminal record ( strafrechtelijke antecedenten ) and whether there was any relationship between the person and the accused , and also the person 's reputation and family situation .", "The person made a reliable and balanced impression on me , Investigating Judge . When asked , the registrar expressed the same opinion .", "After my conversation with the above - mentioned person [ police officer ] ORG ... informed me of the above - mentioned person 's situation . What I was told by PERSON corresponds to what the person told me him / herself and confirmed the vulnerability of the person 's situation . \u201d", "The applicant 's counsel appealed against the Investigating Judge 's decision on DATE , as did the applicant himself DATE .", "Also on DATE Investigating Judge PERSON wrote to the applicant 's counsel informing him of her intention to interrogate the anonymous witness on DATE . The actual interrogation would be held in a room in which the registrar and Police Officer PERSON would be present in addition to the witness and herself ; Police Officer PERSON would be able to help her decide which questions to prevent in the interest of the witness 's safety .", "On DATE the applicant 's counsel wrote to the Investigating Judge objecting against the presence of Police Officer PERSON in the same room as the anonymous witness and asked her not to allow any other person into the presence of the witness , the registrar and herself .", "A CARDINAL - judge chamber of ORG held a hearing in camera on DATE . The applicant was present in person , assisted by his counsel . He asked for an adjournment , as he had only been informed of the date of the hearing DATE and had had no time to discuss matters with his counsel . This was denied on the ground that the applicant had had the time since lodging his appeal , DATE before , to consult his counsel ; the hearing then proceeded .", "The same day ORG dismissed the appeal . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c Counsel argued in camera that , contrary to decisions in similar cases of ORG and ORG of GPE , not only the reasonableness , but also the merits of the decision of the Investigating Judge should be examined ( niet alleen marginaal , doch ook inhoudelijk dient te worden getoetst ) .", "In the present case ORG does not consider it necessary to go into the merits of the decision of the Investigating Judge . In the opinion of ORG the Investigating Judge has sufficiently checked the reasons for granting the witness anonymity . ORG considers in this regard that it appears from ORG official report of her findings that the witness 's situation is one of vulnerability , a circumstance for which ORG has accounted by obtaining information from [ Police Officer ] ORG . Counsel 's request will therefore be refused .", "ORG considers it credible ( aannemelijk ) on the basis of ORG official report of her findings , the content of the statement of ORG made at the public hearing of ORG of GPE on DATE , and the nature and importance of the crimes with which the accused is charged , that the witness has reason to fear for the life , health and safety of the witness him / herself and his / her direct surroundings .", "The witness has therefore rightly been granted the status of threatened witness , which means that the appeal against the decision of the Investigating Judge must be dismissed . \u201d", "The interrogation of the anonymous witness took place DATE .

It appears from ORG official record of the occasion that , in addition to ORG , the registrar , a police officer called GPE ( operating the sound link ) and another police officer , called ORG ( as listener - in , toehoorder ) , were present in the same room as the witness . ORG , the applicant 's counsel , a police officer operating the sound link and the Procurator General of ORG as listener - in were in another room . The sound link involved voice distortion . The witness 's answers were first heard by the Investigating Judge with the sound link switched off , then , if the Investigating Judge found that the answer did not jeopardise the witness 's safety , repeated through the sound link so that the persons in the other room could hear .", "The Investigating Judge 's official record includes the following :", "\u201c I , Investigating Judge , have spoken with the witness both within the framework of the proceedings under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and prior to the interrogation , the registrar , PERSON , being present . On these occasions the reasons why the witness wished to make a statement were discussed . On the first occasion the witness appeared worried about the risk of his / heir identity being disclosed . Prior to the interrogation the witness appeared reassured about the measures taken to prevent this from happening .", "The witness made on us , Investigating Judge and registrar , a direct , frank and sober impression .", "In view of the witness 's answers during the CARDINAL above - mentioned conversations , the way the witness behaved and the way the subsequent interrogation went , we , Investigating Judge and PERSON , come to the conclusion that the witness gives us an impression of reliability . \u201d", "The applicant 's counsel had previously submitted CARDINAL questions by fax . ORG official record lists the questions which were not allowed , giving the reasons why not ( mostly irrelevance or concern for the witness 's safety ) .", "The witness described the applicant as \u201c a tall man , with fair , slightly curly hair , thin , DATE , normal hair , slightly balding above the temples ( een beetje inhammen ) , no spectacles or moustache \u201d . He / she had positively recognised the applicant when he was unloading weapons wrapped in dustbin liners , sports bags and a heavy box . The question whether the witness knew the applicant , put by the prosecution , was not allowed in the interests of ensuring the witness 's safety . The question , put by the defence , on what DATE the witness saw the applicant unload the weapons was not allowed either , for the same reason . The interrogation took from TIME until TIME During the interrogation the witness made an outline drawing of the vehicle used to transport the weapons , which was transmitted by fax to the room where the applicant 's counsel and the prosecutor were . The vehicle was a delivery van with an outline apparently different from that of a ORG Land Cruiser : it had a sloping front instead of a protruding bonnet , and no spare wheel at the back .", "On DATE PERSON 's counsel wrote to the applicant 's counsel stating that the anonymous witness , when interrogated by the police in the presence of the Procurator General and ORG in addition to himself , had specified the date on which the weapons were delivered as \u201c DATE ] \u201d . He / she had given this information after it had been pointed out that , according to the calendar , \u201c DATE \u201d in DATE was from CARDINAL until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant 's counsel wrote to ORG asking for further witnesses to be brought forward . These included the wife of PERSON , who was the owner of the ORG Land Cruiser allegedly used to transport the weapons , and Investigating Judge PERSON . The applicant 's counsel made it clear that it was intended to determine with greater precision the date on which the delivery had taken place so as to establish the applicant 's alibi .", "The hearing before ORG resumed on DATE . Investigating Judge PERSON was heard as a witness . She persisted in her refusal to mention the date on which the weapons were stated by the anonymous witness to have been delivered ( LAW Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 Wetboek van Strafvordering ) . This was accepted by ORG on the ground that it was in the nature of things that only the Investigating Judge could decide whether such a refusal was necessary .", "PERSON was heard as a witness about the vehicle used for the delivery , which he stated to have been a ORG Land Cruiser . It had come into his wife 's possession no earlier than DATE .", "Police Officer PERSON was heard as a witness . He stated that he was aware that the anonymous witness had stated before the Investigating Judge that the weapons were delivered at DATE , but that the anonymous witness was mistaken as to the date . The President of ORG blocked a question relating to DATE on which the weapons were delivered . The registration number of the vehicle used was given by the anonymous witness to an unidentified RCID police officer , who gave it to Police Officer PERSON ; Police Officer PERSON refused to say who this police officer was , and was dispensed from so doing by the President of ORG .", "ORG viewed a video tape compiled from several tapes found in the house of PERSON . These showed a group of persons on various locations in the GPE , in the south of GPE and on a trip to GPE to attend the football world championship . Weapons were occasionally shown . Members of the group were frequently shown brandishing a pistol . The applicant appeared in some of the scenes wearing a baseball cap ; he was shown in the company of PERSON on the trip to GPE , and PERSON was at CARDINAL point shown laughing at a remark made by the applicant .", "The applicant stated , inter alia , that he had been in GPE at DATE , but had returned to the GPE by CARDINAL or DATE . He further admitted that he had been carrying a pistol and ammunition when he was arrested on DATE . However , he denied having had anything to do with the delivery of weapons at the Newtonstraat house . He had left some diving equipment with PERSON , which he had gone to pick up in DATE before going on holiday ; this explained the presence of his fingerprints on dustbin liners . He denied knowing PERSON .", "Witnesses were heard about the ORG Land Cruiser .", "Addressing ORG in the applicant 's defence , the applicant 's counsel stated that the only real indication that the anonymous witness was reliable was the statement of Police Officer PERSON and the subjective assessment of the Investigating Judge . He also protested against the refusal to allow the anonymous witness to give the date on which the weapons were delivered , which made it impossible to verify the applicants 's alibi . Much was made of the applicant 's alibi ; of the ORG Land Cruiser , which in counsel 's submission could not have been the vehicle used for delivering the weapons ; and of the description of the appearance of the man identified by the anonymous witness as the applicant \u2013 the description , counsel said , did not fit because the applicant was in fact quite bald . It was also denied that the applicant had anything to do with the cocaine or with the large sum of money found in the Audi .", "On DATE ORG gave judgment finding the applicant guilty of all the crimes charged . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The pistol and ammunition found in his possession when he was arrested was withdrawn from circulation ( onttrokken aan het verkeer ) and the money found in the Audi car was declared forfeit ( verbeurd ) .", "Proceedings in ORG", "The applicant appealed to ORG of GPE .", "On DATE Dr PERSON , professor of experimental psychology ( psychologische functieleer ) at the university of GPE , transmitted to the applicant 's counsel a report which he had prepared after studying the video tape . He came to the conclusion that the interactions between the applicant and PERSON , as recorded , suggested that they might have known each other by sight ; however , it was also possible that they might have had no lasting memory of each other as the applicant claimed .", "The hearing of ORG opened on DATE . The used - car dealer who had sold the ORG Land Cruiser to PERSON 's wife was heard as a witness : he gave a date for its sale ( DATE ) . The applicant again denied having known PERSON before the trial . He also denied having had anything to do with the delivery of the weapons and the cocaine : on DATE he had visited PERSON 's house in the Newtonstraat to retrieve his diving equipment , after which he had gone on holiday . Police Officer PERSON , heard as a witness , confirmed the statement he had made earlier . When the defence protested against the absence from the case - file of the fingerprint report of the ORG Land Cruiser , the Procurator General stated that no usable fingerprints had been found . Parts of the compilation video tape were shown in open court . The defence also asked for inter alios Investigating Judge PERSON to be heard as a witness . ORG so ordered , adjourning the hearing until DATE .", "ORG ordered the applicant 's release , overturning the decision of ORG of DATE , on the ground that the new information relied on by ORG was not such as to justify the second order for his detention on remand .", "The hearing , having been adjourned , resumed on DATE . Investigating Judge PERSON did not appear . An ORG explosives expert was heard as a technical witness . A police officer , who had been present when the cocaine and the weapons were seized at the Newtonstraat house on DATE , showed some of the dustbin liners . These , according to the official record of the hearing as dictated by the President of ORG , were made of grey plastic . CARDINAL of them had borne the applicant 's fingerprints . Some still bore traces of adhesive tape . The police expert stated that the dustbin liners had all been wrapped around firearms , and that all objects that might have carried fingerprints had been checked for them . Diving equipment had also been found .", "The hearing was continued on DATE . Investigating Judge PERSON gave evidence . Her statement , as taken down in the official record of the hearing , included the following :", "\u201c You ask me how I came to the finding that this anonymous witness was reliable , as I indicated in the official record of the interrogation on DATE .", "I spoke with the witness at some length . The way in which the witness reacted showed integrity . I asked some control questions to check reliability .", "I noted during the interrogation that there is a certain amount of discrepancy between a delivery van and an \u201c all - terrain vehicle \u201d but this has not caused me to doubt the reliability of the witness . After all , I do not know in what terms a witness describes things .", "...", "I reply as follows to questions put by counsel for the accused :", "At the beginning of the interrogation session the witness did not know exactly when the delivery had taken place . DATE he / she was able to indicate that it had been during the period from DATE until DATE . On DATE the interrogations took place first in the case of the co - accused PERSON and then in the case of the present accused [ i.e. the applicant ] . I can not now remember exactly all the differences in nuance between the CARDINAL interrogations . Later that day the witness remembered a number of things more distinctly .", "Things happened the way I described them in the official record . I have tried to take everything down with as much precision as possible .", "...", "The witness was in my opinion reasonably positive on the date of the delivery . I can not remember having heard the date . The date has not been taken down in my handwritten notes ( klad ) .", "The reliability of the witness was assessed before the beginning of the interrogation .", "You now ask me why I stopped the question of [ the applicant 's counsel ] as to the date of the delivery for reasons of protecting the source . I decline to answer that question .", "... \u201d", "In their final address , counsel for the applicant referred in general terms to all the submissions made in the course of the first - instance proceedings . More specifically , they contested the veracity and accuracy of the statements made by the anonymous witness to the police and before the Investigating Judge . Reference was made to what the defence argued were inconsistencies , such as that between the vehicle described by the anonymous witness as a delivery van and the ORG Land Cruiser identified as the vehicle used , and that between the physical appearance of the applicant as described by the anonymous witness and the applicant 's actual physical appearance . Inconsistencies such as these ought , in the submission of the defence , to have inspired the Investigating Judge to greater caution when expressing herself on the subject of the witness 's reliability . Moreover , one of a set of photographs taken in the Newtonstraat house showed a gun - shaped object wrapped in blue dustbin liners \u2013 the grey ones shown in open court were not shown in the photographs at all . ORG was invited to express itself on these points . The defence also protested against the decision of the Investigating Judge to block certain questions , for example , that concerning DATE on which the anonymous witness had allegedly witnessed the events in question , which prevented the applicant from establishing his alibi .", "Although admittedly the applicant 's fingerprints had been found on some of the dustbin liners , they were , in the submission of the defence , capable of another explanation than the applicant 's involvement in the crimes charged : the applicant and PERSON were friends from childhood ; the applicant had lived in the same house with PERSON , his mother lived next door ; and he was still a frequent visitor there , so that his fingerprints were to be found all over the place ; the applicant had at some point had to shift some bags to get at some diving equipment ; the weapons could have been repackaged in different dustbin liners DATE and DATE .", "It was denied that the applicant had had anything to do with the items found in the ORG car on DATE . The letters addressed to the applicant had been unopened and had not yet been seen by the applicant . The mobile telephone found in the car was not traceable to the applicant : it had been used by PERSON .", "Finally , the video showing both PERSON and the applicant did not admit of the conclusion that these CARDINAL knew each other at all well .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE . It overturned the judgment of ORG on the formal ground that the defence had wrongly been prevented from putting any questions to Investigating Judge PERSON . It then found the applicant guilty as charged . The evidence relied on included , inter alia , the statement of the anonymous witness ; the findings of Investigating Judge PERSON as to the witness 's reliability ; the statement made on DATE by Police Officer PERSON ; the applicant 's fingerprints on the dustbin liners ; the fact that keys found in the Audi car fitted the doors of both the Newtonstraat house and the applicant 's residence ; metering reports from which it appeared that the mobile telephone had been used to make a call to the Newtonstraat house ; and the official police reports from which it appeared that the mobile telephone in question had been used by the applicant . The applicant 's statement that he did not know PERSON was dismissed as a transparent lie , in view of the video tape which showed PERSON laughing at a remark made by the applicant , and as such was considered corroborative of his guilt .", "With regard to the reliability of the anonymous witness , ORG considerations included the following :", "\u201c Counsel for the accused has argued that [ Investigating Judge PERSON ] , on the occasion of the interrogation of the anonymous witness , has insufficiently discharged her duty as laid down by Article PERSON of LAW to check the reliability of the threatened witness interrogated by her , so that this statement can not be used in evidence that the accused has committed the acts charged DATE , CARDINAL and DATE .", "ORG does not share this opinion of counsel , in view of what the Investigating Judge has recorded in her official record of the interrogation of CARDINAL DATE and the statement she made at the appeal hearing on DATE .", "In so far as counsel may have meant to argue that ORG is competent to judge whether the anonymous witness was properly granted the status of threatened witness , this argument must be rejected . In accordance with the procedure provided for in ORG and following of LAW the anonymous witness was considered to be a threatened witness and interrogated . Any renewed investigation by the trial court in light of the preconditions for granting the status of threatened witness is contrary to the procedure laid down by law and the closed system of legal remedies .", "ORG finds that the statement of the anonymous / threatened witness , which does not support the conviction to a decisive extent ( in overwegende mate ) and which ORG has used with due caution , is reliable and credible . The information of the witness as rendered by the [ police ] only differs on nonessential details from the statement made by the witness on oath DATE before the Investigating Judge , on which occasion the witness affirmed the accuracy of the statement made before the [ police ] . On that occasion also , the witness was interrogated by counsel for the accused . The statement is detailed and consistent and in accordance with what was found , based on the information supplied , in the house situated at Newtonstraat no . CARDINAL in GPE . ORG bases this finding also on the statements of ORG referred to [ above ] . This finding is not affected by the fact that the anonymous witness was dispensed from answering certain questions put by the defence , nor by the fact that the Investigating Judge , when heard as a witness , did not answer certain questions . The failure to answer these questions was , after all , legally permissible ( rechtens geoorloofd ) in each case and connected with , in particular , ensuring that the identity of the threatened witness was kept concealed .", "In so far as , during the interrogation before the Investigating Judge on CARDINAL DATE , the threatened witness did not answer certain questions , ORG finds that the answers to the questions concerned could disclose the identity of the threatened witness . The Investigating Judge therefore acted properly in blocking these questions .", "In so far as the witness [ Investigating Judge PERSON ] failed to answer certain questions at the hearing before ORG on DATE , she stated her reasons for so doing and relied on her right to excuse herself from so doing . The defence has argued that she did not have such a right to excuse herself , but wrongly so . After all , the Investigating Judge has a right to excuse herself from answering questions under Article CARDINALa , taken together with LAW of LAW . It is in principle for the person claiming such a right to decide whether or not to excuse herself in this respect . From the nature of the questions in respect of which this witness excused herself it appears incontrovertibly that the questions relate to the subject matter \u2013 the identity of the threatened witness \u2013 in relation to which the right to excuse herself from answering was provided for . ORG is of the opinion that the Investigating Judge , when appearing as a witness at the hearing of DATE , properly relied on her right to excuse herself .", "In so far as the Investigating Judge , at the interrogation of the threatened witness , blocked certain questions because the answers were irrelevant to the case , ORG finds that these questions were in fact irrelevant to the case in which the witness was being interrogated . The Investigating Judge therefore acted properly in blocking these questions .", "...", "ORG further finds that the statement of the anonymous / threatened witness may be used as evidence that the accused has committed the acts charged DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , since it concerns the statement of a witness with respect to whom a court has ordered that on the occasion of his / her interrogation his / her identity shall remain concealed and the witness has been interrogated as such by the Investigating Judge in the way provided for by ORG CARDINALc \u2013 CARDINALf of LAW , the facts charged and held proven concerning crimes as referred to in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure which , given their nature and the organised context in which they were committed , constitute a serious violation of the legal order . ... \u201d", "ORG sentenced the applicant to , inter alia , a term of imprisonment of DATE and DATE , withdrew the pistol and ammunition found in the applicant 's possession when he was arrested from circulation and declared the money found in the Audi car forfeit .

It dismissed the appeal in its entirety . Its reasoning , in so far as relevant to the case before ORG , was as follows .", "In response to a complaint that ORG had failed itself to evaluate the alleged risk to the anonymous witness , ORG referred to the Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) to the PERSON enacting the relevant provisions of LAW ( see below ) , from which it appeared that it had been the intention of the legislature to remove this responsibility from the trial court ; ORG had therefore properly refused to go into this question anew . It was noted obiter dictum that no circumstances were apparent in the present case from which it would follow that the fairness of the proceedings had been adversely affected .", "In response to a complaint that the defence had had insufficient opportunity adequately to question the witness and assess his / her reliability , it was noted that not only the defence but also ORG had been in a different room when the witness was interrogated ; that the Investigating Judge had based the interrogation on , amongst other things , a list of questions submitted beforehand by the defence ; that the applicant 's counsel had asked additional questions and that questions had been blocked only in order to ensure the anonymity of the witness or because of irrelevance ; and that the witness was apparently ( kennelijk ) not a police officer .", "In response to a complaint that the applicant 's conviction was based \u201c to a decisive extent \u201d on the results of the interrogation of the anonymous witness , ORG held that in view of the alternative evidence this was not the case .", "In response to a complaint that the Investigating Judge had wrongly blocked certain questions asked by the defence , ORG held that the Investigating Judge had been entitled to do so in order to prevent the witness 's identity from being disclosed or to prevent the asking of questions that were irrelevant to establishing the truth of the matter or the propriety of the criminal investigation .", "In response to a complaint that police officers had been present in the same room as the Investigating Judge and the anonymous witness , it was held that although it must be assumed that it was generally not permissible for police officers to be present ( except in so far as their presence was required for the purpose of technical assistance ) , no defence of this nature had been put forward before ORG . The latter court had therefore not been required to go into this question .", "CARDINAL complaints , including CARDINAL to the effect that ORG ought not to have held what it considered the applicant 's apparent lie that he did not know PERSON to be per se corroborative of his guilt and another relating to the difference in colour between the dustbin liners shown in court and that appearing on the photograph , were dismissed collectively on the following summary reasoning :", "\u201c These points of appeal do not provide ground to overturn the judgment of ORG ( kunnen niet tot cassatie leiden ) .
