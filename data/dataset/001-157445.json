NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and is under house arrest in LOC di Pietrasanta . She was represented before the ORG by Mr D. Ammannato , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences by ORG . Such offences included criminal association , aggravated fraud , and ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date she lodged an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly upheld and partly reversed ORG judgment . The conviction for the offence of criminal association was upheld .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . She states that on DATE the President of Second Criminal Section of ORG set the hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Unione Camere Penali italiane ) called a DATE strike , scheduled to run from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed additional written submissions with the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel formally adhered to the strike and filed a notice to that effect with ORG , having obtained the applicant \u2019s consent in writing . For this reason , he was not present at the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the hearing record that the Prosecutor General requested that ORG refrain from adjourning the hearing on account of the counsel \u2019s absence . The court granted the prosecutor \u2019s request and the hearing was held as scheduled .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG preliminary investigations judge ordered that the applicant be placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion that she had committed further offences . These included the offence of criminal association , of which the applicant was suspected of being the leader , promoter and organizer . The applicant was also suspected of having committed the offence of unauthorized practice of medicine . Specifically , she was suspected of providing medical advice and treatment , as well as prescribing drugs to adults and minors , and using her home as an unauthorized medical clinic . She was further suspected of fraud , aggravated by a number of factors including the exploitation of vulnerable ORG pain and suffering , and the generation of ill - founded fears from which she profited . The preliminary investigations judge emphasised that the applicant had been previously convicted of similar offences .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the material in the case file that pre - trial detention had been requested on a number of grounds , namely the strong evidence against her , the seriousness of the suspected offences , and the significant risk that she might reoffend .", "CARDINAL . The applicant states that she was transferred to the LOC correctional facility in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged a request with the ORG preliminary investigations judge , seeking the replacement of the applicant \u2019s detention with a more lenient custodial measure , such as house arrest . He argued that both her advanced age and allegedly critical state of health were incompatible with detention in prison .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the judge ordered that she be examined by an independent medical expert with a view to determining whether this was the case .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the judge confirmed that the applicant would remain in custody , as the independent medical expert \u2019s report had stated that her state of health was compatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG on CARDINAL main grounds . She contended that while under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the detention on remand of persons aged over seventy was only allowed if exceptional reasons warranting such a measure existed , in her case no such reasons could be detected . She further reiterated the argument that her advanced age and critical state of health were incompatible with detention in prison , contending that she suffered from life - threatening medical conditions she identified as cardiovascular disease , acute osteoporosis and diabetes . She also highlighted that she had undergone major surgical procedures in the past , including a gastrectomy , mastectomy , and hysterectomy , and suffered from anxiety disorder and glucose intolerance .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting as the authority with jurisdiction to decide on measures involving deprivation of liberty ( tribunale della libert\u00e0 e del riesame ) , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It found that the exceptional grounds for her to be detained on remand , as listed in the preliminary investigation judge \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE , still existed . It further pointed out that she had in the past been convicted of analogous offences and had , as soon as she had been released , resumed her criminal activity . As to the applicant \u2019s health , the court drew on the expert medical report requested by the preliminary investigations judge to conclude that there was no incompatibility between it and her detention in a correctional facility . Referring to extracts from the report , the court observed that there was no evidence of an imminent risk of congestive heart failure or other life - threatening conditions , contrary to her contentions . It went on to acknowledge the expert \u2019s finding that she had undergone several major surgical procedures in the past , but that these had allowed for the treatment of serious medical conditions , thus leading to an improvement in her clinical situation . Drawing on the report , it further concluded that the provision of special meals to meet her nutritional needs and the necessary drug therapy could be adequately taken care of in a correctional facility . It appears from the order that the court also examined medical reports submitted by the prosecutor and applicant \u2019s counsel and took the latter into account when reaching its conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was committed for trial and the first hearing before FAC was scheduled for DATE . She was formally charged with all the suspected offences including criminal association , the unlawful practice of medicine , and aggravated fraud ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted a further request seeking the replacement of the applicant \u2019s detention with house arrest , reiterating the argument that both her advanced age and state of health were incompatible with detention in prison . He relied , inter alia , on a medical certificate issued by the prison doctor on DATE , in which her clinical condition was described as \u201c complex and multifaceted \u201d and \u201c difficult to manage \u201d in a regular correctional facility .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG ordered a new medical examination with a view to assessing the compatibility of her state of health with detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it dismissed the request for house arrest , having regard to the persistent danger that the applicant might reoffend . However , the court ordered that she be transferred to a correctional hospital ( centro clinico penitenziario ) in GPE with a view to ensuring increased medical supervision and the provision of any necessary treatment , and preventing a further deterioration in her health . The court reached its conclusions by relying on a number of findings by the expert , who found that the gastrectomy performed in DATE had left her with some long - term side effects , including insufficient absorption of calcium and vitamin NORP He also noted with some concern that she had experienced height and weight loss and that her osteoporosis had worsened during DATE spent in detention . In order to manage her condition effectively and prevent its deterioration , the expert noted that she would require small , frequent meals , a special diet enriched by dietary supplements , and some form of exercise . Finally , he pointed out a slight cerebral atrophy , coupled with a mild anxiety - depressive disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal , reiterating the incompatibility of her age and state of health with any form of detention , even in a correctional hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as the authority with jurisdiction to decide on measures involving deprivation of liberty , placed the applicant under house arrest . It relied on the medical report submitted by the expert to ORG to conclude that an \u201c incompatibility in substance \u201d with detention existed in her case and that a less restrictive measure , such as house arrest , was preferable under the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . It ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release and set out the specific conditions of her house arrest , including the requirement that she stay in her home at all times , leave only with the LOC prior permission , and refrain from contacting or interacting with anyone except her authorised cohabitees and medical staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested that the house arrest be substituted with detention on remand , as the applicant had breached its conditions . He provided evidence that , amongst other things , she had been in contact with several unauthorised individuals including co - defendants in the ongoing criminal proceedings and a number of her \u201c followers \u201d and \u201c admirers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG ordered a new medical examination with a view to determining whether her state of health was compatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s request and remanded the applicant in custody , ordering that she be transferred at once to the correctional hospital in GPE . It found that she had violated the terms of her house arrest , and that the situation which had arisen was conducive to her re - establishing the network which had supported her criminal activity . As to her health , the court drew on the medical report it had requested which stated that adequate monitoring and treatment of her medical conditions , as well as the provision of adequate nutrition in compliance with her special dietary needs , could be carried out in a correctional hospital . In particular , the expert noted that treatment of the applicant \u2019s osteoporosis to prevent future damage to her bone structure would not in any way be hindered by her detention in such a facility . He added that while under house arrest , she had experienced CARDINAL fractures , suggesting that the monitoring of her condition in a correctional hospital could be in no way considered inferior .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE correctional hospital issued a medical certificate concerning the applicant \u2019s state of health . It described her medical history and the outcome of various specialist consultations she had undergone in the facility in DATE . An orthopaedic specialist had confirmed her advanced osteoporosis and prescribed treatment , a cardiologist had reported good cardiac function , while an ophthalmologist had recommended that she undergo surgery for a cataract in her left eye . The report further contained a recommendation that the applicant undergo a colonoscopy . Concerns were raised regarding the difficulties encountered in the management of treatment and diagnostic tests which had required transporting her to external facilities . Both her cataract surgery and the colonoscopy had to be rescheduled due to the unavailability of police officers who should have escorted her to the external facilities . The doctors concluded that the continued detention of the applicant , albeit in a correctional hospital , could have resulted in the deterioration in her health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted a request to ORG , seeking the substitution of the detention on remand with house arrest . He reiterated all the arguments raised at first instance and referred to extracts from the report issued by the correctional hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The request was granted on DATE and the applicant was placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL .
