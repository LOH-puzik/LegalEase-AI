It was pointed out in the letter that all forms of inhuman and degrading treatment were prohibited in the destination country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer representing the applicant in the domestic proceedings filed objections against the extradition request . He argued that according to independent international observers , illtreatment was widespread in the NORP prison system and fair trial guarantees were not respected . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law on the matter , he submitted that the applicant , who was charged with a religious offence , would run a risk of illtreatment and would be deprived of the minimum fair trial guarantees if extradited to the requesting country .", "CARDINAL .

The Government submitted that \u201c according to the [ case ] materials on the applicant \u2019s detention \u201d he had had to be released from custody at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the custody register at the GPE police station , the applicant was released from detention at TIME on DATE , on account of the expiry of the time - limit for his detention .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region examined the applicant \u2019s case . During the hearing the applicant acknowledged that he had not left GPE after DATE , contrary to the requirements of the immigration laws . However , his representative submitted that , in accordance with Article CARDINAL of the ORG , administrative proceedings should have been brought against him immediately upon the obtaining of sufficient data indicating the occurrence of an administrative offence . The applicant had been arrested on CARDINAL DATE , and by DATE the authorities had been in possession of sufficient information on the applicant \u2019s immigration status . However , administrative proceedings had been brought against him DATE , once the term of his detention pending extradition had expired . In these circumstances , the defence considered that the administrative removal of the applicant , if ordered , would amount to a form of extradition in disguise .", "CARDINAL . The defence further referred to reports by the ORG , international nongovernmental organisations , and the ORG \u2019s case - law , arguing that the applicant was wanted by the NORP authorities in connection with charges relating to a religious offence , and thus he would run a risk of illtreatment if expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , they submitted that in any event his expulsion could not be ordered , since refugee - status proceedings were pending in respect of him . They pointed out in this connection that he had appealed against the refusal of CARDINAL DATE to grant him refugee status ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and had received no response by the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant had been residing in GPE in breach of the immigration laws . The court established that at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE at the address of the GPE police station \u201c the applicant had failed to leave GPE after the expiry of the registration term , that is , CARDINAL DATE \u201d . The court established that there were no circumstances precluding his administrative removal from GPE . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument as regards the refugeestatus proceedings , observing that \u201c according to the letter of DATE by ORG ( \u201c the NORP FMS \u201d ) , his relevant application had been rejected \u201d ( see , for the contents of the letter , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also noted , without giving further details , that the defence \u2019s submissions as regards the risk of torture in GPE \u201c could not be accepted as wellfounded \u201d . In accordance with LAW of the ORG the court found the applicant liable to pay a fine in the amount of MONEY ( RUB ) and ordered his administrative removal from GPE . Citing the provisions of the ORG on controlled forced removal ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the court decided that the applicant should be detained in a special detention centre at ORG of the Interior ( \u00ab \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043a PERSON \u043f\u043e PERSON \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 PERSON ) until his administrative removal .

On DATE the ORG indicated to the ORG , under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , that the applicant \u2019s administrative removal and extradition should be suspended until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In addition to their initial arguments , they submitted that the first - instance court had incorrectly established the facts of the case , including in respect of the applicant \u2019s arrest . Contrary to the case materials , they submitted , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had only been let out into the yard of the police station and , in any event , he had not been provided with any documents confirming his release from custody . Therefore , at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE he had not been at liberty and thus had been unable to deliberately \u201c avoid leaving GPE \u201d . They further maintained that the applicant \u2019s expulsion would amount to his \u201c extradition in disguise \u201d . The extradition proceedings in respect of him had been pending at the material time . The applicant , if removed to GPE , would be unable either to challenge any decision taken within the extradition proceedings , or to benefit from the minimum guarantees in such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . They also stated that , contrary to the court \u2019s findings , no final decision in the refugee - status proceedings had been taken on CARDINAL DATE , as clearly confirmed by the letter of the NORP ORG . Where an application for refugee status was made , domestic law prohibited the expulsion of an applicant in the absence of a final decision on his refugee status . They stressed that the first - instance court had failed to make any assessment of their ill - treatment argument , and reiterated their submissions as regards the risk of ill - treatment if the removal order were to be enforced . Finally , they submitted that the decision ordering the applicant \u2019s detention did not contain any time - limit and was therefore in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the administrative removal order , finding that the first - instance court had correctly established the facts of the case , assessed the admissibility of various items of evidence and applied the domestic law . The appeal court upheld the administrative sanction as lawful and found no grounds to amend it . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument about the authorities\u2019 failure to bring the administrative proceedings against him in a timely manner , the court noted that the administrative - offence record had been drawn up in accordance with the domestic procedure . The court found nothing in the applicant \u2019s submissions to suggest that his family members had been persecuted in GPE . Finally , it noted the applicant had not been granted refugee status in GPE . The administrative removal order became final .", "CARDINAL . After DATE the applicant was detained in the special detention facility in GPE . At some point before DATE he was transferred to the special detention facility in GPE , in LOC . He remains detained there to date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when interviewed by the GPE town prosecutor after his arrest , the applicant stated that he had moved to GPE to look for work . Since DATE , the date of his arrival in GPE , he had not registered as a foreign national temporarily residing in the country . He stated that he had not been persecuted on political grounds in GPE , and had not applied for refugee status in GPE . He had learned that a criminal case was pending against him in his home country from his parents , since at some point local police had searched their home . However , he had been unaware of the nature of the charges and the basis on which the criminal case had been brought against him until his arrest in GPE . He made similar submissions when interviewed by the GPE district prosecutor of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for refugee status with ORG on the ground of fear of persecution on account of fabricated charges relating to a religious offence . He stated that he did not have any religious beliefs . However , he had learned after his arrest that he had been charged with a religious offence . He submitted that the accusations against him were unfounded . He feared that in GPE he would be tortured , forced to incriminate himself and sentenced to imprisonment for religiously motivated anti - State offences he had not committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Novgorod ORG rejected the application . They referred to the applicant \u2019s own submissions , as well as the results of checks conducted by the local ORG and ORG . It also noted that ORG of ORG had recommended that the applicant should not be granted refugee status . The decision also contained a reference to an unspecified undated report on the ORG system and the social and economic situation in GPE . It was stated in the report , inter alia , the NORP authorities exercised close control over the religious life of the population , that GPE had ratified several ORG human rights treaties and that the use of any unlawful investigative methods was prohibited in the requesting country . The Nizhniy Novgorod ORG observed , with reference to the applicant \u2019s own submissions , that he had applied for refugee status after learning , at the time of his arrest , that he had been placed on the wanted list . Thus , there were grounds to consider the applicant \u2019s request as an attempt to avoid extradition . The GPE further found that the applicant had not had any problems with the authorities in his home country prior to his departure to GPE . Overall , ORG concluded that the applicant had not produced any \u201c objective evidence to the effect that he would be persecuted on national , religious or political grounds \u201d and that he had left GPE in order to look for employment , that is , for a reason falling outside the scope of an admissible refugee request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the refusal with the NORP ORG office , referring to the risk of illtreatment and imprisonment in his home country . He cited reports by various NGOs for DATE pointing to serious human rights problems in GPE and stated that ORG had omitted to take into account the political and religious nature of the charges against him and to analyse the specific circumstances of his case .", "CARDINAL . The NORP ORG received the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE and by a letter of CARDINAL DATE advised him that it would be considered upon receipt of documents from the Nizhny Novgorod FMS .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG dismissed his appeal . It upheld the decision of ORG , finding that the latter had examined all the relevant individual , social and political aspects of the case and had reached a well - founded conclusion . The NORP ORG found that there was no evidence that the criminal proceedings against the applicant \u201c had a political background \u201d . It noted that neither the applicant nor his wife , child , mother or father , who resided in GPE , had received any threats or been subjected to any kind of persecution , and reiterated that the applicant had only applied for refugee status after his arrest . It further found that the applicant did not fit the definition of a refugee , since a fear of criminal prosecution did not constitute a ground for granting refugee status .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the NORP ORG sent its decision to the applicant by post at the address of the remand centre in GPE . Having received the decision on DATE , he challenged it on CARDINAL DATE before ORG of GPE . He argued , in particular , that the NORP ORG had failed to address his arguments or to assess the circumstances of his case . He reiterated , in addition to his initial submissions , that the thrust of his grievance was not simply the fact of the criminal prosecution , but the fear of being subjected to torture in detention in GPE with a view to a confession being extracted in respect of offences he had not committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and endorsed the NORP ORG \u2019s decision as lawful , noting the applicant \u2019s failure to adduce \u201c convincing arguments to support his allegations of fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality or membership of a particular social group \u201d . The court noted from the questionnaire completed by the applicant on the date of the submission of his application that he had not been a member of any political , religious or military organisations in his home country and had not had any problems with the authorities prior to his departure for GPE . Nothing in the statement of charges drawn up by the NORP authorities revealed any political motivation . The court reiterated that the applicant \u2019s family members were living in GPE and were not subject to any kind of persecution . The actual purpose of his application was to avoid criminal prosecution in GPE . Further , the applicant had not complained of a risk of persecution in GPE and had not expressed his wish to remain in GPE as a refugee until after his arrest . Moreover , there existed no medical reasons precluding his departure from GPE . The court concluded that the applicant did not meet the \u201c refugee \u201d definition .", "CARDINAL . The court also refused the defence \u2019s request to have Ms LOC questioned as an expert on the human rights situation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating his earlier arguments and submitting that the first - instance court had failed to assess the risk on the basis of all the available information , as well as to address his counterarguments to the NORP ORG \u2019s decision . He maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated and emphasised the risk of illtreatment , with extensive references to reports by ORG and ORG , as well as to the ORG \u2019s case - law . As regards the court \u2019s finding that none of his family members had been persecuted , he noted that on DATE his brother had also been arrested in GPE , but had then been released because his extradition had been refused by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . The applicant in his observations of CARDINAL DATE provided a copy of the information note on the case progress from the city court \u2019s website containing the case references and indicating that the appeal had been rejected and the judgment had been upheld . The parties did not submit a copy of the decision .", "CARDINAL . In their letter of CARDINAL DATE the Government submitted that at some point the applicant had applied for temporary asylum in GPE , and on DATE the ORG NORP FMS had refused his application , the refusal being upheld on DATE by the Sormovskiy ORG of Nizhniy Novgorod .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had not applied for temporary asylum and enclosed a letter from ORG of CARDINAL DATE confirming that the authority had not received any such application from him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
