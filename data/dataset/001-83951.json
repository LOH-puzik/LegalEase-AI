The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . By a charter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant company chartered a NORP - owned vessel called the Cape Maleas ( \u201c the vessel \u201d ) . The charter party was on an amended ORG time - charter form , and was for a time - charter voyage to the south NORP ports . The duration of the voyage was stated to be DATE and the purpose to carry general cargo , steels and commercial containers .", "CARDINAL . By agreement between the parties , namely the applicant company and the owner of the vessel , ORG , on DATE the charter party became subject to \u201c Addendum No . CARDINAL \u201d . This provided that the applicant charterer could load QUANTITY of \u201c FAC cargo . \u201c FAC denotes cargo which falls within the \u201c Class DATE Explosives \u201d category of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company ordered the vessel to proceed to the port of GPE in GPE and , on DATE , further cargo commenced loading . This consisted of general cargo but also arms , ammunition and military spare parts which fell within the \u201c IMCO Class CARDINAL \u201d category ( \u201c the arms cargo \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s agent in GPE drew up bills of lading in respect of the cargo , including the arms cargo ( \u201c the bills of lading \u201d ) . These bills of lading described the arms cargo as \u201c special equipment \u201d , followed by a reference to a numbered contract . The port of discharge for the \u201c special equipment \u201d was specified as Tartus in GPE . The shipper was stated to be \u201c NORP \u201d and the consignee as \u201c to order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s agent in GPE also prepared a manifest of cargo . Like the bills of lading , this described the arms cargo as \u201c special equipment \u201d , and gave the port of discharge as Tartus . The applicant company at all times intended that the arms cargo should be discharged at the port of PERSON in GPE . The vessel sailed from GPE at TIME on DATE and was ordered to proceed to GPE in GPE in order to load further cargo . In order to reach GPE from GPE , the vessel had to transit through the LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the vessel was about to commence transit through the LOC . Before entering the LOC the master of the vessel requested the assistance of a pilot for navigation through the LOC . The vessel was flying the international signal flag to indicate that it carried dangerous cargo .", "CARDINAL . As a result of information received by the NORP customs authorities from a NORP vessel which had recently arrived from GPE , the NORP authorities believed that the arms cargo on board the vessel was bound for GPE , from where it would be smuggled into GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the NORP authorities , the vessel was first sighted when it was QUANTITY outside the LOC . After the vessel had entered the LOC , a pilot went on board and invited the master to declare any hazardous materials which were on board . The master duly did so , and the vessel proceeded for TIME through the LOC before the pilot instructed the master to stop the engines .", "CARDINAL . The NORP coastguard and other NORP authorities boarded and seized the vessel . Since the waters were rough at the point where the vessel was stopped , it was towed by a military boat to the NORP port of B\u00fcy\u00fckdere . All parties to the case subsequently proceeded on the basis that the seizure of the vessel had taken place in the LOC , governed by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At B\u00fcy\u00fckdere the vessel was searched and the bills of lading and manifest of cargo examined . The NORP authorities discovered the arms cargo and questioned the master of the vessel . The statement entitled \u201c LAW of Facts \u201d , in which the NORP authorities summarised their allegations and the actions which they had taken in respect of the vessel , was prepared and signed by all the officials who were present at the seizure and search of the vessel . The master , the first officer and the radio operator of the vessel were taken into custody by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE statements were taken from the master and first officer in the form of affidavits . These formed part of the file which was submitted by the public prosecutor to a single judge of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having examined the file and citing , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , a single judge of ORG approved the arrest of the vessel and the detention of its crew , namely the master , the first officer and the radio operator . The judge referred in his decision to \u201c systematic weapon smuggling \u201d and stated that the \u201c evidence confirmed that the above - mentioned smuggled weapons could be used against the security of GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that decision was served on the lawyer instructed on behalf of the vessel and the master . The following day , the lawyer filed an objection against the decision , setting out the relevant provisions of LAW and noting that GPE was not in a state of war with any country within the meaning of the provisions of its LAW and that there was neither a threat nor a risk of war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG indicted the master , the first officer and the radio officer of the vessel , charging them with organised transportation of firearms and ammunition . In the public prosecutor \u2019s view , GPE was at war with GPE . He cited various decrees of the NORP parliament which had authorised the sending of troops to GPE , and stated that :", "\u201c ... notwithstanding the ceasefire achieved through the efforts of ORG putting an end to the armed conflict , no treaty having yet been signed , the state of war is ongoing from a legal point of view . Consequently , it has become necessary to enforce LAW . ...", "Pursuant to [ LAW ] , the commercial vessels of countries at war with GPE do not enjoy free passage through the LOC . Therefore , there being no right of unrestricted passage through the LOC of a ship flying the NORP flag and laden with weapons , ORG may exercise , for its own security and based on its sovereign rights and LAW , control over that ship and the weapons contained therein . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the vessel was registered as a NORP ship and flew the NORP flag , the NORP authorities concluded that they had been entitled under LAW to seize the vessel and to launch proceedings for arms smuggling .", "CARDINAL . During DATE and DATE the government of GPE sought the release of the vessel and its cargo through high - level diplomatic meetings . The issue was raised at presidential level and , on CARDINAL DATE , the NORP ambassador to GPE visited the Deputy Minister for ORG to deliver copies of CARDINAL of the bills of lading and of LAW . This was intended to establish that the arms cargo was in fact being carried on behalf of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Minister for ORG wrote to ORG , giving an account of the meetings which had taken place , enclosing copies of the bill of lading and LAW and offering to obtain further information on the \u201c special equipment \u201d listed on the bill of lading .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the lawyer acting on behalf of the owners and the master of the vessel pointed out to ORG that the assumption that GPE and GPE were at war with each other was the \u201c crucial point \u201d of the case . He requested ORG to enquire immediately of ORG whether a state of war existed . He also submitted that the Presidency of the ORG should be asked whether there had been a declaration of war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer filed another application with the court reiterating that GPE was not at war with any country ( GPE included ) and seeking the release of the master on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer submitted a petition to ORG asking the court to rephrase the question which it had put to ORG . He objected to the question which had been put , namely \u201c whether the peace operations in GPE have ended with a treaty of peace ... \u201d , and submitted that the proper question to be asked was \u201c whether GPE is in a state of war or not with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In another communication , dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicant company \u2019s lawyer sent ORG translations of the charter party and the bills of lading . He explained that the nature of a time charter was similar to a lease , and that charterers had control over the cargo and its documentation .", "CARDINAL . ORG responded to the questions posed by ORG in CARDINAL letters of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . The letters stated :", "\u201c ... as there is no \u2018 state of war\u2019 between GPE and any other country , including ORG , it is obvious that the seizure of the ship can not be based on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . In fact , ships carrying the flag of ORG have always traversed the LOC freely .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the Note sent to our Ministry by the NORP embassy in GPE , it was stated that the arms found on the ship belonged to GPE . This had been certified by the NORP authorities on several occasions .", "On the other hand , the NORP authorities stated that the said arms had officially been sold to GPE by an agreement signed between GPE and GPE in DATE and that the arms had been loaded in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Except for the limitations set out in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW in \u2018 time of war\u2019 , commercial ships flying foreign flags enjoy full freedom of transit passage at times of peace , whatever their flag and cargo may be . As stated above , it is impossible to invoke the \u2018 time of war\u2019 provisions of LAW in this case because no state of war with ORG exists . Moreover , in accordance with customary international and treaty laws , ships have the \u2018 right of innocent PERSON through the territorial waters of other countries ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision for the release of the master on bail , but ordered the seizure and confiscation of the vessel and its cargo on suspicion of their being intended for use for the commission or preparation of a crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor filed his observations on the merits . He maintained his earlier position , relying upon LAW , contending that the vessel and the arms cargo should be seized and the master imprisoned .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the applicant company had concluded that attempts to secure the release of the vessel and its cargo through diplomatic negotiations were unlikely to succeed . The applicant company applied through its NORP lawyer , PERSON , to intervene in the proceedings before ORG . In its application , the applicant company set out its interest in the case as the owner of the cargo and stressed that the arms cargo was being carried as part of a normal and legal commercial transaction and that GPE was not at war with any country . It therefore asked for the unconditional release of the vessel and its cargo . The court ordered that the applicant company be joined as an intervening party in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then Prime Minister of GPE , PERSON PERSON , issued a certificate which stated :", "\u201c GPE is not in a state of war with any country , LOC included ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acquitted the first officer and the radio operator , but convicted the master of the vessel of importing arms into GPE without official permission and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( TRL ) . The court ordered that the arms cargo and the vessel be confiscated pursuant to the final paragraph of CARDINAL of PERSON no . DATE , that all the cargo other than the arms be returned to the applicant company and that the master bear the costs of the court hearing . With reference to a judgment of ORG in a similar case , ORG held that in the present case there was bad faith on the part of the applicant company since the bill of lading gave inaccurate information as to the contents of the cargo and the route of the vessel . It noted that there was no justification for not informing the NORP authorities of NORP weapons passing through the LOC . The court further considered the following in relation to LAW :", "\u201c The second question is whether the NORP authorities were entitled to seize the munitions and weapons . Pursuant to the relevant LAW , the passage of ships carrying firearms and owned by any ORG with which GPE is in a state of war is forbidden .", "The other important issue is whether GPE is in a state of war with ORG , or in other words , whether a peace agreement has been reached after the war . It is known that GPE has engaged in war with ORG , as a result of which GPE has been divided into CARDINAL sections , that GPE has been established , that ORG has not recognised GPE and until now no agreement has been reached , and that inter - State negotiations are in progress .", "Therefore , the letter of ORG ... and the letter of the Prime Minister ... were disregarded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment went on to refer to the PERSON case , concerning another vessel , and concluded that \u201c the existence of a state of war has been confirmed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment of ORG , the applicant company paid the hire charge and expenses due to the owner and the charter party in the sum of CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL United States dollars ( ORG ) . Although the judgment of ORG had ordered the return of the non - arms cargo to the applicant company , it was not returned and , by an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted an injunction to the owner of the vessel which imposed a lien of GPE MONEY over the cargo to secure the unpaid hire . The owner of the vessel , ORG , then commenced enforcement proceedings for encashment of the lien over the cargo which belonged to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed against the judgment of ORG . The applicant company disputed the court \u2019s conclusion that a state of war existed between GPE and GPE . The ground of appeal also questioned the legitimacy of the court \u2019s reliance on the earlier GPE case , and pointed out that the arms cargo had only been in transit through the LOC .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment . It held that there was no material evidence in the file indicating that the arms would be discharged from the vessel in GPE . As regards the applicability of the provisions of LAW , ORG held :", "\u201c ... that the state of war mentioned in LAW did not exist as also evidenced by the letters of ORG and the Prime Minister which explicitly state that \u2018 GPE is not at war with any country , including ORG ... and that there is no room for application of LAW of LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case was remitted to ORG for retrial .", "CARDINAL . In an application of CARDINAL DATE , pending the retrial of the master of the vessel before ORG , the applicant company sought removal of the lien which had been imposed by ORG over the cargo .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant company \u2019s request , so on DATE the applicant company agreed to pay the owner some of the hire charges , without prejudice as to liability . In return , the owner agreed to relinquish its lien on the non - arms cargo . Under that agreement the applicant company had to pay PERCENT of the hire charge in respect of the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE inclusive ( GPE CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . The applicant company also agreed to pay PERCENT of future charges , as and when the payments fell due . The owner provided the applicant company with a guarantee to repay the sum of GPE CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The applicant company considered that it was obliged to pay the hire charges due , otherwise ORG and the owner would not have released the vessel and its cargo .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the master on retrial . An appeal by the public prosecutor against that judgment was dismissed by ORG in a decision of CARDINAL DATE , which was approved on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the release of the vessel and the arms cargo . The vessel left GPE on DATE and was returned to the owner by the applicant company under the terms of the charter party on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a written application of DATE , the applicant company brought an action before ORG claiming TRL CARDINAL ( equivalent to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) plus interest against ORG and ORG , with reference to ORG and ORG . The applicant company based its claim on LAW and submitted that the seizure and detention of the vessel and its cargo had been unjustified . It argued in this connection that the arms and ammunition had belonged to GPE , that the vessel had been wrongfully impounded for DATE , TIME and , as a result , it had had to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to the owner , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in fuel charges and ORG ORG in harbour fees .", "CARDINAL . The application went on to distinguish this case from the PERSON case , and to explain the circumstances in which the applicant company had been forced to pay the hire charges and other expenses to the owner of the vessel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a first expert report was submitted to ORG following its interlocutory order of CARDINAL DATE . The experts advised that the applicant company \u2019s claim should be declared inadmissible , principally on the basis that the applicant company had chosen voluntarily and without legal compulsion to pay the hire charges under the charter party .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company objected to the first report and ORG ordered the preparation of a second expert report on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second expert report was submitted to the court with the conclusion that the applicant company \u2019s claim should be dismissed . This second panel of experts considered that the owner of the vessel , but not the applicant company , might in appropriate circumstances claim compensation from ORG . They expressed the opinion that the applicant company \u2019s claim might succeed in relation to dock and fuel expenses incurred , as well as supplementary losses LAW CARDINAL of LAW , but that the claim in respect of hire charges should fail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed an objection against the second report and requested the court to rule on the case without obtaining a further report , or alternatively to order a third expert report .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s claim for compensation , holding that the vessel was not a merchant vessel since it was carrying , in part , a cargo of arms . It considered that the security authorities had merely carried out their statutory duty to investigate serious allegations of arms smuggling . The court therefore ruled that there had been no breach of LAW or of NORP law , in particular LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of ORG . A request by the applicant company for rectification of that decision was rejected by a new decision of ORG of DATE , served on the applicant company on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The charter party provided , inter alia , that any dispute arising under it should be referred to arbitration in GPE . As a result of the seizure and subsequent detention of the vessel and its cargo by the respondent government , a dispute arose between the applicant company and the owner of the vessel concerning the hire charges and other expenses paid by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Following arbitration proceedings in GPE , on DATE the arbitration panel decided that the charter party had been frustrated by ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant company therefore recovered from the owner of the vessel the hire charges and other expenses which had been paid in respect of the period after DATE , but was unable to recover CARDINAL which it had paid or which it thereupon had to pay to the owner in respect of the period between the seizure on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the owner of the vessel , ORG , brought an action in ORG in GPE seeking a lien on the cargo for the hire charges . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG accepted the owner \u2019s claim on the ground that it was owed freight charges .", "CARDINAL . The cargo receiver , ORG , also brought an action in the ORG claiming CARDINAL in damages from ORG on behalf of ORG and ORG . It submitted that it had lost revenue as a result of the detention of its merchandise carried on the vessel and that new commercial goods had been purchased in order to replace the seized merchandise .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed that claim on the grounds that the seizure of the vessel had been lawful since the arms cargo was not clearly indicated on the bill of lading . On appeal by the plaintiff , ORG quashed the judgment . Relying on the outcome of the criminal proceedings , ORG noted that the goods in question were not contraband or of a kind requiring them to be confiscated . It accordingly held that the defendant must be liable for the damage resulting from the wrongful confiscation of the goods .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG confirmed its earlier judgment and held that the plaintiff \u2019s claim must be dismissed on the grounds that the seizure and detention of the vessel had been in compliance with domestic law and LAW governing the LOC . Taking into account the fact that the vessel had been sailing under the NORP flag , and the inconsistency between the cargo and the documents , the court considered that the seizure of the vessel had been lawful . The court further noted that ORG had acted with the aim of preventing activities designed to undermine it . The plaintiff again appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sitting as a full civil court upheld the judgment of ORG and dismissed the action . It considered that while under LAW merchant ships were entitled to innocent passage , this did not outweigh GPE \u2019s sovereign rights . That being so , any arms trafficking would adversely affect GPE and would thus mean that the passage was no longer innocent . It further stated the following :", "\u201c ... On the other hand , the bill of lading described the CARDINAL boxes opened as containing \u2018 Special Equipment\u2019 . LAW specifies in Articles DATE and CARDINAL the points to be included in the bill of lading . The cargo received or loaded onto the vessel for transportation must be described on the bill of lading in order for the acknowledgment of receipt and the delivery contract to be complete ... This description , which is an essential element of the bill of lading , must be such as to allow the cargo to be distinguished at all times from the other cargoes on the vessel and must be complete . The carrier is obliged to indicate on the bill of lading the amount , brand and external appearance as well as the characteristics of the cargo ... Clearly , as is apparent from the bills of lading in the case file , these indications , some of which are mandatory , were not included on the bill of lading and invited suspicion .", "A country may purchase the arms it needs for its defence from another country , or may secure them by means such as aid or donations . In other words , arms trading between GPE is a normal and lawful procedure . Transportation of these arms is also normal and lawful . Arms purchased and transported must be indicated clearly as such on the bill of lading and other documents , in accordance with international rules . There should be no need to conceal them or make use of other channels . The file did not include a sales contract to the effect that the party sending these arms had purchased them lawfully , nor did it include any evidence to the effect that a letter of credit had been opened by banks . Given the manner in which the arms were loaded onto the vessel , it was essential from the point of view of GPE \u2019s security to inspect the vessel . In the matter of innocent passage , the coastal ORG has the right to impose sanctions on the vessel and cargo in accordance with the rule on the prevention of non - innocent passage which stems from customary law and LAW . LAW , customary law and the principle of ex aequo et bono do not prevent GPE from exercising this right . For these reasons , the trial court \u2019s decision to dismiss the action must be upheld on the grounds that it is in conformity with the law and with statutory procedure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The former signatories to LAW ( DATE ) , together with GPE and GPE , met at GPE , GPE , in DATE and abolished ORG , returning the LOC zone to NORP military control .
