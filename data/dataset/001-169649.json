During the period from DATE to DATE identity checks of NORP nationals residing in GPE were carried out in the streets , markets and other workplaces and at their homes . Many were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations . After a period of custody in police stations , they were grouped together and taken by bus to a court , which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from NORP territory . Subsequently , after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test , they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time , taken by bus to airports in GPE , and expelled to GPE by aeroplane . ( for further details as to the background of the case see GPE v. GPE ( I ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE in PERSON ( GPE ) and married to Mr PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE . Together they had lived in GPE since DATE . In DATE Mr PERSON had started suffering from coughing fits , shortness of breath and thickening of the aorta walls .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant returned to GPE because her visa had expired . Mr PERSON , whose visa had expired on DATE and whose registration was no longer valid either , stayed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE Mr PERSON was arrested by police officers in GPE and placed in detention .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the ORG of GPE ordered PERSON to be expelled from GPE and detained at the GPE special detention centre for aliens pending his administrative expulsion on the ground that he had infringed the residence rules governing foreign nationals , namely LAW . The court also fined the applicant in the amount of RUB CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was subsequently brought to the reception centre for foreigners of ORG for GPE and GPE Region . Upon his arrival he was examined by a medical officer , who found that PERSON did not show any health problems preventing him from being placed in the reception centre . PERSON informed the medical staff that he suffered from asthma attacks and was subsequently placed together with another NORP detainee who suffered from asthma in a cell measuring CARDINAL other NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . The sanitary conditions of the cell were very poor , as the toilets were only separated from the rest of the cell by a partition measuring QUANTITY at CARDINAL side , and there was a lack of fresh air . In addition , while PERSON was provided with possibilities to take walks , he was not permitted outdoor activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was suffering from nausea and a headache and asked for medical assistance . Subsequently a medical officer checked his blood pressure and temperature , which was slightly raised . He was given paracetamol . A re - examination the same day showed that his temperature was back to normal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , visited the detention centre . When he saw PERSON , who was having difficulties breathing and whose face had turned black , he had requested that PERSON be immediately transferred to a hospital but that request was not complied with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , together with CARDINAL other NORP nationals , was placed in a bus to FAC in GPE with a view to his expulsion by aeroplane to GPE . Prior to entering the bus the detainees and their belongings were searched . In addition the detainees were accompanied by CARDINAL officers of the special police force of ORG ( ORG ) on the bus and CARDINAL further police cars escorted the bus on the way to the airport .", "CARDINAL . The conditions of transport in the bus were very difficult , with no air conditioning , and although the journey lasted TIME , the officers who had been accompanying the detainees had not allowed them to open the windows . On the way to the airport the bus stopped CARDINAL times to let people , allegedly for a bribe , use the toilet and purchase food . Exiting the bus was closely monitored by the accompanying police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE between CARDINAL and TIME the bus arrived at the airport and around TIME Mr PERSON , whose health had deteriorated during the bus ride , was allowed to leave the bus upon the request of PERSON PERSON , who was awaiting the NORP nationals at the airport .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON indicated that when PERSON PERSON had got off the bus he had seen that he was very ill and was \u201c suffocating like a fish out of water \u201d and begging to be allowed to breathe fresh air .", "CARDINAL . On the way to the terminal Mr PERSON collapsed after walking a few steps and died . A called ambulance was unable to resuscitate him and he was declared dead at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG conducted an autopsy of Mr PERSON \u2019s corpse and indicated that his death was caused by tuberculosis . In addition blood and urine samples were taken and sent for forensic chemical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to initiate criminal proceedings , as the competent prosecutor found that Mr PERSON had died of a natural cause .", "CARDINAL . During the forensic chemical examination of the taken blood and urine samples methadone was detected in both samples . In regard to the urine sample a high - performance liquid chromatography ( ORG ) was applied , which established CARDINAL,CARDINAL mg% methadone and CARDINAL,CARDINAL mg% methadone metabolite in Mr PERSON \u2019s urine . A closer inspection of Mr PERSON \u2019s blood was not conducted and the exact level of methadone in his blood was not established . Based on these findings ORG finally concluded that Mr PERSON had died of methadone poisoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision not to initiate criminal proceedings of DATE was quashed and the case file was forwarded for additional examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided again not to initiate criminal proceedings . This time finding that , owing to detecting methadone in the urine and blood of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and finding MONEY on his corpse , there was evidence for repeated use of narcotics for DATE . Therefore the prosecutor concluded that PERSON took the methadone voluntarily and that his death was caused by negligent poisoning with methadone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE proposed that the decision of CARDINAL DATE would be quashed and further investigations would be conducted . It held that thus far the deterioration of PERSON health during the bus ride had not sufficiently been examined and that relevant officials had not been interviewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG challenged the allegation that PERSON had died of methadone poisoning , saying that he had died of tuberculosis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation was initiated against an unknown person for selling methadone to Mr PERSON at an unknown date and unknown location .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision to dismiss criminal proceedings was quashed and the case was forwarded for additional examination . In particular it was held that the dismissal was premature and that it should be established whether any narcotics were found on PERSON , the amount of methadone taken by him , whether such a dose could be lethal , why Mr PERSON \u2019s health deteriorated during the bus ride and whether he received adequate health care during his detention and transfer to the airport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings were dismissed and on DATE the dismissal was quashed again , as the instructions of CARDINAL DATE had not been fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings were dismissed again and the dismissal was quashed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were finally dismissed . A subsequent request to quash the dismissal was denied on DATE and confirmed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Based on the documents provided by the ORG , and in particular on the autopsy report and the report of the forensic chemical examination , the applicant submitted her own medical report regarding her husband \u2019s death . The report was compiled by a forensic pathologist , PERSON PERSON \u2013 a former lecturer at different universities in GPE and chief pathologist for ORG for the Former GPE ( ORG ) \u2013 supported by a forensic toxicologist , Dr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The experts pointed out that the NORP authorities gave the cause of death as methadone intoxication based on the fact that methadone was detected in the blood and urine of PERSON and that he had MONEY on his body . They also emphasised that the authorities concluded from these facts that PERSON had repeatedly used narcotics for DATE of time . As regards the needle punctures they pointed out that the injection mark at the bend of the left elbow stemmed most probably from the resuscitation attempts at the airport , in which intravenous drugs were given , and that the other MONEY , on the lower third of the left shoulder , appear as a very unusual site for self - injection of drugs . They further indicated that methadone is usually taken in liquid form and only very uncommonly by injection . In addition , according to their opinion , TIME of Mr PERSON \u2019s life did not coincide with the \u2018 normal\u2019 death of a person dying from methadone intoxication . Being a sedative , people dying from methadone intoxication typically do so after a period of unconsciousness . PERSON , however , did not show any signs of drowsiness and was able to talk to the NORP consul and walk a few steps before suddenly collapsing . Lastly they pointed out that the conclusion of repeated drug use was not confirmed by an analysis of a hair sample or finding any supporting evidence , such as needles , ampoules or syringes , on PERSON corpse or in his cell .", "CARDINAL . As regards the forensic chemical examination the experts indicated that the applied analyses appear not to have been carried out according to international recommendations and that the level of methadone was only measured in the urine and not in the blood . In their opinion it is unacceptable to conclude intoxication on urine levels alone , as drugs accumulate in the bladder over time and only blood levels can give an indication of a likely intoxication or incapacitation .", "CARDINAL . In sum the forensic pathologist concluded that there was no scientific justification for giving methadone intoxication as the cause of death . He himself would have given the cause of death as suppurative bronchopneumonia due to chronic obstructive airways disease . He further indicated that , given Mr PERSON \u2019s chronic lung disease , he was more likely to develop a chest infection and to progress his pneumonia in a crowded , airless space . The deterioration of his health , however , would have been noticeable , as he would have been unwell and showed signs such as wheezing and coughing . A timely hospitalisation and antibiotic treatment would have been the correct course of action ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
