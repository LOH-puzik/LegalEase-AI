{"ITEMID": "001-5375", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "DANKOVSKY v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Antonio Pastor Ridruejo", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is a NORP national and resident in GPE . When lodging his application , he was serving a prison sentence in FAC . In the proceedings before the ORG , he is represented by PERSON R. ORG , a lawyer practising in ORG . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , ORG .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and others on the suspicion of inter alia theft . In these proceedings , the applicant was assisted by a court - appointed defence counsel .", "The trial against the applicant and the CARDINAL co - accused , PERSON opened before ORG ( Landgericht ) on DATE . In the course of the trial , the applicant repeatedly applied to the presiding judge to be allowed to put personally questions to the co - accused S. This was refused . The applicant \u2019s defence counsel did not put the questions concerned .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of theft . Taking into account the applicant \u2019s previous sentences imposed by ORG ( Amtsgericht ) in DATE and ORG in DATE , respectively , ORG fixed a cumulative sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Moreover , he was convicted of kidnapping ( r\u00e4uberischer ORG ) and extortion with violence ( r\u00e4uberische GPE ) as well as of theft on CARDINAL counts and , in respect of these offences , a cumulative sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment was imposed . He was acquitted of the remainder of charges .", "ORG convicted the co - accused PERSON kidnapping and extortion with violence and , taking into account his previous prison sentence , it fixed a cumulative sentence of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and confirmed his preventive detention . PERSON was convicted of kidnapping and extortion with violence on CARDINAL counts as well as of CARDINAL counts of theft , and he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "In its judgment , insofar as it concerned offences involving the applicant , ORG found that in DATE the applicant and PERSON had committed several burglaries and , together with PERSON , they had taken part in a bank robbery . Moreover , DATE , the applicant , while serving an earlier prison sentence in an open prison , had committed further counts of burglaries with PERSON and other persons , including PERSON , who had meanwhile been convicted .", "ORG noted that the accused Mr S. had fully confessed his participation in the offences in question . The applicant had , to a large extent , confessed his participation in the burglaries . These statements were confirmed in particular by the statements made by the other participants in the offences in question as well as by the statements of the victims as to the stolen goods .", "As regards the offences of kidnapping and extortion with violence , ORG found that the applicant had denied any participation in bank robberies , which had taken place on CARDINAL and DATE , respectively .", "ORG found that the statements made by the co - accused Mr S. on the bank robbery of DATE , including his indications as to the participation of the applicant and the co - accused PERSON , were credible . In this respect , ORG considered that several witnesses had confirmed Mr S. \u2019s account of details of the robbery .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s and GPE \u2019s defence that Mr S. had made false statements about his and their participation in this offence . ORG noted their allegation that PERSON himself had intended to obtain a long term of imprisonment or that he had wanted to cause sensation and that he had wanted to revenge himself on them . ORG considered that these arguments were far - fetched . In particular , PERSON own participation in the offence was proven by his detailed knowledge about the robbery . Moreover , PERSON had stated a valid reason for his confession , namely the intention to terminate his criminal activities and to start a new life following therapy in the course of his detention after conviction . From the angle of psychiatric evidence , ORG found no indication that , due to mental reasons , PERSON had wrongly accused himself and the co - accused . According to ORG , PERSON disappointment and annoyance about bad treatment and insufficient pay by the applicant might have contributed to his open confession . However , there was nothing to show that he had therefore wrongly accused the applicant of a serious criminal offence . Moreover , there was no explanation that , for such a reason , PERSON would wrongly accuse himself and PERSON , who in the past had been his friend .", "In assessing the credibility of PERSON , ORG had also regard to the general context of statements made in the course of the investigations against the persons involved in the offences in question . It noted that , following the full confession of Mr S. at an early stage , the applicant and the other accused , who had been prosecuted separately , had confessed their participation in the burglaries . Furthermore , an accomplice , who had been prosecuted separately , had stated that the applicant had told him in the course of a telephone conversation in DATE that he had robbed a bank . ORG noted that the applicant had admitted the contents of this conversation , pretending that it had been a joke . Further statements made by PERSON the weapon used in the course of the robbery as well as statements made by witnesses on the circumstances of the bank robbery confirmed Mr S. \u2019s deposition . The applicant \u2019s and PERSON affirmations that they had been elsewhere at the relevant time were contradictory and inconclusive . The witnesses named by them had not confirmed their alleged alibi .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to hear PERSON , one of the accomplices having been convicted in separate proceedings , on the question that the applicant had never talked about having been with the other accused after the bank robbery . ORG considered that this issue was irrelevant , as the circumstance that the applicant had not told others about his participation in the offence could not prove his innocence .", "As regards the second bank robbery of DATE , ORG found that the statements of Mr S. were credible as far as his own participation in the offence was concerned . However , as regards his accusation of a participation of the applicant and PERSON , his statements , though plausible , were , unlike in the other case , not corroborated by any other evidence . ORG therefore acquitted the applicant and PERSON of the charges in respect of the bank robbery of DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( Revision ) , quashed ORG judgment as far as the fixing of a cumulative sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment was concerned , and referred this matter back to ORG . The remainder of the appeal was dismissed .", "ORG found in particular that ORG had not been required to stay the criminal proceedings and to refer to ORG the question concerning the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of the NORP Code of Criminal Procedure ( PERSON ) , excluding the direct questioning ( direkte GPE ) of an accused by a co - accused .", "According to ORG , the decisions of the Presiding Judge on this matter could not be objected to from a procedural point of view . Moreover , in the circumstances of the present case , the applicant , as conceded by him , could have availed himself of the opportunity to have his questions to the co - accused Mr S. put by the Presiding Judge . Having regard to LAW ( d ) of the LAW , ORG considered that the right to examine or have examined witnesses against him was a procedural right of the defence . However , it was the applicant \u2019s own submission that his defence counsel had not wished to put questions to Mr S.", "As regards the fixing of the sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , ORG found that ORG reasoning did not show that it had considered the cumulative effect of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment appropriate .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( ORG ) about his conviction by ORG , as confirmed by ORG .", "ORG considered that the complaint did not raise any fundamental questions of constitutional law and that the refusal of a decision on the merits did not cause the applicant any particularly serious disadvantage .", "As regards the main issue raised by the applicant , ORG found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW was not unconstitutional . This provision did not affect the right of an accused to a fair trial . In this respect , ORG recalled that in a fair trial an accused should not be the object of proceedings , but be in a position actively to participate in the proceedings in order to safeguard his rights . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second sentence , did not limit the contents of the right of the defence to examine a co - accused . In the interest of the proper conduct of the trial , the right to put questions to a co - accused was merely limited to an indirect questioning , i.e. the right to have a co - accused examined by the defence counsel or by the presiding judge . In these circumstances , there was no indication of a breach of the right to a fair trial .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "PERSON Relevant domestic law", "", "Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Upon request , the presiding judge shall permit the associate judges to address questions to the accused , to witnesses and to experts .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge shall permit the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the accused and the defence counsel , as well as the lay judges , to do the same . Direct questioning of an accused by a co - accused is not permitted . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
