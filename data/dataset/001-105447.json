THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON and ORG ( ORG ) , is a company based in GPE . The application was lodged on its behalf by Mr PERSON , its managing director . The applicant was advised by Mr A. ORG , a barrister practising in GPE . ORG were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as presented in the judgment of ORG , may be summarised as follows .", "ORG is a small family company founded in DATE . It provides independent financial advice , and is authorised and regulated by ORG . In DATE , the company was approached by L , a pilot with ORG who was soon to reach the company retirement DATE . He was covered by his employer \u2019s occupational pension scheme . There was a significant difference in age between L and his wife , with whom he had CARDINAL children . He intended to continue working as a pilot until DATE , and beyond that if possible . He sought PERSON \u2019s advice about his pension arrangements .", "ORG arranged CARDINAL lengthy meetings with PERSON At the first of these , a company representative discussed CARDINAL alternatives in detail : remaining in the company scheme but deferring his pension until DATE ( viewed as the safer option ) , or leaving the scheme on retirement and using the funds to purchase a private pension plan . PERSON wrote to DATE recapitulating the points made at the meeting . It referred to the potential advantage of making alternative pension arrangements , assuming a fund growth rate of PERCENT per annum , which it described as \u201c very modest \u201d . PERSON considered it \u201c illogical \u201d not to take up the option in view of the transfer value offered by the company scheme , and emphasised that the projected return on the investment did not presume \u201c a very heavy fund performance \u201d . At the second meeting , which involved the same company representative , the option of transferring to a private plan was discussed at length , including the associated risks and possible choice of fund . ORG sent L a written note of the meeting shortly afterwards .", "Having doubts , L then consulted another independent financial adviser , C. The balance of the latter \u2019s advice was against leaving the company scheme , on the ground that it offered a quite substantial benefit package and a good level of guaranteed income which was not dependent upon investment returns or annuity rates . C took the view that some of ORG \u2019s comments were in breach of the regulator \u2019s guidance . In particular , he considered that the assumption of PERCENT growth was \u201c anything but modest \u201d , and contrary to the lower investment growth assumptions that the regulator had recently introduced and had to be used by all advisers when projecting pension benefits . L provided a copy of this letter to ORG \u2019s representative , who nevertheless maintained his advice . L ultimately decided to accept the advice tendered by PERSON . He left his employer \u2019s scheme and invested with another fund .", "The investment performed strongly in DATE , increasing by PERCENT , but by DATE the value of GPE pension fund had fallen by PERCENT . In DATE , PERSON wrote to PERSON , claiming compensation in the sum of GBP CARDINAL . ORG rejected his complaint , pointing out that L had made a free choice in full knowledge of the potential risks , and having considered contrary advice from another adviser . L filed a complaint with ORG ( ORG ) on DATE , alleging that ORG had given him inappropriate advice regarding his pension . He claimed that the relative security of his company \u2019s scheme compared to the high risk of the investment he had been advised to choose had not been adequately emphasised during his meetings with ORG . The figures used by ORG had been very optimistic and far above actual performance .", "ORG forwarded the complaint to ORG and requested copies of the relevant documents and any evidence that the company wished to have taken into account . ORG initially asked that the complaint be dismissed without consideration of its merits . It subsequently provided the requested documents and submitted a detailed outline of its case , by letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "The complaint was considered by an ORG adjudicator , who communicated his opinion on it in a letter to ORG dated DATE . He found that L should have been aware of the risks inherent in the investment he chose to make , in view of the second opinion he had obtained from C , and so the complaint should not be upheld in that respect . Pointing out the greater security offered by occupational pension schemes , he stated that the advantages and disadvantages of a transfer should have been explained and compelling reasons should have been given . He considered that the meeting notes that PERSON provided to L did not adequately caution him in this respect . While the risks may have been discussed during the meetings , the notes did not balance the advantages and disadvantages , nor did they show that all options had been duly considered . Further , the adjudicator took the view that the investment funds recommended to L entailed a higher risk than he was prepared to accept . He concluded that the transfer and investment funds recommended to L may have been unsuitable . He recommended that ORG carry out a loss assessment and , if this revealed a loss , to pay redress . PERSON was asked whether it was prepared to make such an offer to L.", "PERSON disagreed with the adjudicator \u2019s opinion and gave a substantial response to it by letter dated DATE . It argued that since the amount involved greatly exceeded the maximum amount that ORG could order a firm to pay a complainant ( GBP CARDINAL ) , ORG should decline jurisdiction so that the complaint could be determined in court . If this was not accepted , PERSON requested an oral hearing to establish the facts of the complaint .", "By letter dated DATE , the adjudicator rejected the request for a hearing on the ground that there were no contradictions in the documentary evidence . A hearing would not therefore be advantageous .", "ORG maintained its request for a hearing , arguing that since the complaint concerned ORG \u2019s \u201c civil rights and obligations \u201d LAW applied . If its version of events was not accepted by L then a hearing , with cross - examination , would be necessary .", "On DATE an ORG ombudsman wrote to PERSON in relation to its request for a hearing . He observed that LAW did not require a hearing at every stage of the determination of civil rights and obligations and that ORG would be able to seek judicial review of the decision . If the company \u2019s view was correct , then every complaint to the ORG would have to include a hearing . There did not appear to be any dispute over the facts in GPE \u2019s complaint . Even if there were , it did not follow that there should be cross - examination of witnesses at a hearing . With its inquisitional powers , ORG could use other means to establish the facts . Where hearings were held , they were informal and the procedure was set by the ORG . ORG was uncommon . The ORG also rejected the argument that ORG decline jurisdiction in view of the amount of money potentially involved , which , ORG said , would endanger its commercial viability .", "A provisional decision on the complaint was issued by another FOS Ombudsman on DATE . Giving detailed reasons , he indicated that he intended to uphold the complaint , subject to any further evidence or comment received .", "On DATE HME responded in detail to the provisional decision . It again sought a hearing to allow L to be cross - examined . It also submitted a witness statement from an experienced financial adviser , PERSON The latter stated that , in his opinion , there had been a \u201c respectable school of thought \u201d in DATE that an assumed growth rate of PERCENT was modest . He considered that \u201c some competent advisers \u201d would have recommended that L transfer his pension fund .", "more clearly . Understating the increase in the deferred pension benefits made the option of remaining in the company scheme appear much less attractive than it was . Had LOC shown L the lower assumed growth rates , this might have caused the latter to express concern over the viability of the transfer . Having regard to the opinions received from the other financial advisers , ORG , the ORG placed greater weight on the former \u2019s view , as it was contemporaneous . He considered that a competent adviser would , in view of L \u2019s family situation , have established the value of the widow \u2019s benefit payable and would also have looked at the benefits payable on late retirement and compared these to the benefits available on transfer . He was therefore satisfied that good industry practice in DATE would have been to advise L against transfer . He agreed with the previous decisions that a hearing had not been necessary , observing that the ORG had an inquisitorial role , not an adversarial one . He directed PERSON to pay the maximum sum to L ( GBP CARDINAL ) and recommended that it also pay compensation for any loss in excess of that amount . L accepted that decision , which therefore became binding on ORG .", "ORG sought judicial review of the decision . The claim was initially rejected on the papers on CARDINAL DATE . A renewed application involving an oral hearing in ORG was rejected on DATE . Permission to appeal was granted on DATE . Following a threeday hearing before ORG , the claim was dismissed on DATE . The main judgment was given by PERSON .", "ORG first argued that ORG was required by the relevant statutory provision \u2013 section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see below ) \u2013 to determine complaints solely in accordance with the rules of LANGUAGE law . PERSON rejected this , finding that it was clear from the wording of the provision that ORG had not intended to limit the basis for ORG decisions in this way . Certain other provisions of the LAW reinforced this view , as did the general objective of the complaints scheme , which was to resolve disputes quickly and with minimum formality . Accordingly , ORG could reach a subjective opinion on the merits of a complaint ; if that opinion was perverse or irrational it could be set aside by judicial review .", "PERSON claimed that LAW applied , since their civil rights had been determined by the ORG \u2019s decision . Moreover , since the decision deprived the company of its property , LAW No . CARDINAL was also engaged . A decision that was not entirely based on law would be contrary to both of these provisions . The scope for subjectivity in ORG decisions meant that they were unpredictable and arbitrary . Companies could not know how to regulate their behaviour so as to avoid complaints , or how to defend themselves where complaints were made against them .", "PERSON observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A statutory provision is only incompatible with a Convention right if and to the extent that it necessarily involves infringing that right . It is not suggested that the ombudsman is not an independent and impartial tribunal . The scheme does not preclude the ombudsman from hearing cases in public , or from pronouncing his decision in public : whether and to what extent he may decide not to do so I consider below . And so the only question is whether the ombudsman scheme satisfies the requirements of the Convention as to the law to be applied to a dispute and as to the fairness of the applicable procedure . \u201d", "He then referred to the criteria of accessibility and precision set down in DATE ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , and continued :", "\u201c DATE . Does the scheme established under LAW , interpreted in accordance with its natural meaning , comply with these requirements ? In my judgment , it can and does . The ORG is required by ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL to take into account the relevant law , regulations , ORG rules and guidance and standards , relevant codes of practice and , where appropriate , what he considers to have been good industry practice at the relevant time . He is free to depart from the relevant law , but if he does so he should say so in his decision and explain why . The other matters referred to in this rule are matters that a court would take into account in determining whether a professional financial adviser had been guilty of negligence or breach of his contract with his client . Again , if the ORG is to find an advisor liable to his client notwithstanding his compliance with all those matters , the ORG would have to so state in his decision and explain why , in such circumstances , assuming it to be possible , he came to the conclusion that it was fair and reasonable to hold the adviser liable . In these circumstances , I consider that the rules applied by the ORG are sufficiently predictable . All the matters listed in ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL are formulated or ascertainable with sufficient precision . So far as guiding the conduct of financial advisers are concerned , provided that they comply with \u201c the relevant law , regulations , ORG rules and guidance and standards , relevant codes of practice and , where appropriate , ... good industry practice \u201d , they can be assured that they will not be liable to their client in the absence of some exceptional factor requiring a different decision . Lastly , the common law requires consistency : that like cases are treated alike . Arbitrariness on the part of the ORG , including an unreasoned and unjustified failure to treat like cases alike , would be a ground for judicial review . \u201d", "He rejected the argument that firms were unable to know the principles on which ORG would decide complaints . The procedure followed meant that the ORG \u2019s provisional assessment was copied to the parties , who could indicate their disagreement with it and make further representations . Since that had been done in the present case , there was no unfairness .", "ORG argued that the ORG should have accepted the request for an oral hearing . PERSON considered that if the determination of the complaint involved the resolution of a dispute as to what had been said at the meetings , or if it could be sensibly argued that L would have taken the same course of action even if he had been advised differently , then the case for an oral hearing might have been substantial . However , the existence of contemporaneous records would normally make a hearing unnecessary . He stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I have been unable to identify any issue as to ORG \u2019s advice to [ L ] that arguably required an oral hearing in order fairly to determine his complaint . Perhaps more importantly , [ ORG \u2019s counsel ] did not identify any such evidence . The advice given in meetings was the subject of PERSON extensive notes , and was confirmed in correspondence . PERSON did not suggest that PERSON notes were inaccurate . In any event , given the length of time between the meetings and [ L \u2019s ] complaint , any such contention would have been highly unlikely to succeed . PERSON did not suggest that PERSON had contradicted or modified orally the advice he had previously given in writing . In any event , the ORG , sensibly in my view , considered that the written report provided by ORG to [ L ] carried greater weight than information provided orally .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the issue of reliance , I think it obvious that if [ L ] had received the advice that the ORG held he should have received , it is inconceivable that he would have removed his pension fund from the ORG scheme . It would have been pointless to ask him whether he would have acted differently if differently advised : he undoubtedly would have answered affirmatively . \u201d", "He considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINALXIII and found a number of similarities with the facts of the present case : the purpose of the oral hearing was crossexamination , which was reasonably found to be unnecessary ; the demands of efficiency and economy referred to in PERSON resembled the objective of the complaints scheme in the present case . There was therefore no unfairness about the ORG \u2019s decision not to hold a hearing . There had in any event been a public hearing before ORG in the context of the judicial review proceedings , and this was available to any complainant or respondent who considered that the ORG had made an unlawful decision .", "The complaint that the ORG \u2019s decision had not been pronounced publicly was rejected for the same reason . The decision would be made public with the publication of ORG judgment , which achieved the purpose of ensuring public scrutiny of ORG decisions , as required by LAW .", "Lord Justice PERSON agreed with the judgment of PERSON . He added some further observations on the rule of law and publicity . Regarding the latter , he said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Finally , I would like to say something about the matter of the ORG \" register \" . This has been the subject of written submissions , but has not figured in oral argument , no doubt because the parties appreciated that it would not affect the outcome of this appeal . Nevertheless , it remains the case that LAW , at para CARDINAL , in providing for the enforcement of an ORG \u2019s money award in the county courts of GPE and GPE and by similar means in GPE and GPE speaks of such an award \" which has been registered in accordance with scheme rules \" . Thus it is a statutory requirement that the scheme rules provide for the registration of money awards . Accordingly , ORG CARDINAL R requires the ORG to keep a register : \" The ORG must maintain a register of each money award and direction made . \" In referring to directions , the scheme rules go beyond the statute . ORG seeks to comply with its rule by keeping an internal data base . It is not available to public inspection . I have my doubts as to whether such an internal data base amounts to a \" register \" properly so called . A register is an official list or record . It may be that it can be kept in any form , but I suspect that it needs to be open to public inspection . Since we have not heard oral argument on this matter , I merely refer to this point in passing . \u201d", "Permission to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "The applicable primary legislation is ORG , DATE .
