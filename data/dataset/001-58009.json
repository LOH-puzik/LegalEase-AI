ORG In early DATE Guinness was competing with another public company , ORG ( \" Argyll \" ) , to take over a third public company , ORG ( \" Distillers \" ) . The take - over battle resulted in victory for ORG . ORG \u2019s offer to ORG shareholders , like ORG , included a substantial share exchange element , and accordingly the respective prices at which ORG and GPE shares were quoted on ORG was a critical factor for both sides . During the course of the bid the ORG share price rose dramatically , but once the bid had been declared unconditional it fell significantly .", "CARDINAL . ORG The substantial increase in the quoted ORG share price during the bid was achieved as a result of an unlawful share - support operation . This involved certain persons ( \" supporters \" ) purchasing ORG shares in order to maintain , or inflate , its quoted share price . Supporters were offered secret indemnities against any losses they might incur , and , in some cases , also large success fees , if the ORG bid was successful . Such inducements were unlawful ( CARDINAL ) because they were not disclosed to the market under LAW on Take - overs and Mergers and ( CARDINAL ) because they were paid out of ORG \u2019s own moneys in breach of LAW DATE ( \" the CARDINAL Act \" ) , which prohibits a company from giving financial assistance for the purpose of the acquisition of its own shares .", "CARDINAL . ORG Supporters who had purchased shares under the unlawful sharesupport operation were indemnified and rewarded . In addition , some of those who had helped find supporters were rewarded by the payment of large fees . These too came from ORG funds . In most cases payments were made using false invoices which concealed the fact that payment was being made in respect of the supporters or other recipients\u2019 participation in the unlawful share - support operation .", "CARDINAL . ORG Allegations and rumours of misconduct during the course of the bid led the Secretary of ORG to appoint inspectors DATE after the events pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The inspectors were empowered to investigate the affairs of Guinness .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the inspectors began taking oral evidence . Mr GPE , a director of the merchant bank advisers to Guinness , was the first witness .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the inspectors informed ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) that there was concrete evidence of criminal offences having been committed . On DATE the ORG contacted PERSON PERSON of the Director of Public Prosecutions\u2019 office ( \" the ORG \" ) . It was decided that the proper thing to do was to permit the inspectors to carry on with their inquiry and to pass the transcripts on to ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) which had come into being in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant was dismissed from ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the Secretary of ORG required the inspectors to inform him of any matters coming to their knowledge as a result of their investigation pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act . Thereafter the inspectors passed on to the Secretary of ORG transcripts of their hearings and other documentary material which came into their possession .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , a meeting was held attended by the inspectors , the solicitor to and other officials of the ORG , Mr PERSON and a representative from the ORG . Amongst other matters , potential accused were identified - including the applicant \u2013 possible charges were discussed and it was stated that a decision had to be made as to when to start a criminal investigation . All concerned agreed on the need to work closely together in preparing the way for bringing charges as soon as possible . The inspectors indicated their readiness to cooperate although they reserved the right to conduct their investigations as they thought right .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr PERSON , who had been appointed head of legal services at the ORG , appointed a team of counsel to advise on the criminal aspects of the investigation . Transcripts and documents from the inspectors were passed on to the team after receipt and consideration by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was interviewed by the inspectors on CARDINAL occasions : on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . He was accompanied by his legal representatives throughout these interviews .", "CARDINAL . ORG During DATE of DATE the police were formally asked by the ORG \u2019s office to carry out a criminal investigation . The transcripts and documents obtained as a result of the inspectors\u2019 interviews were then passed on to the police .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was subsequently charged with numerous offences relating to the illegal share - support operation and , together with his codefendants , was arraigned before ORG on DATE .", "In view of the large number of counsel and the number of defendants CARDINAL separate trials were subsequently ordered by the trial judge in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the court held a voir dire ( submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury ) following the application of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , PERSON , to rule the ORG transcripts inadmissible . PERSON argued , principally , that the statements obtained during CARDINAL interviews before the inspectors should be excluded", "( i ) pursuant to section DATE of ORG \" PACE \" ) on the basis that they had been obtained by oppression or in circumstances which were likely to render them unreliable ;", "( ii ) pursuant to section CARDINAL of PACE because of the adverse effect the admission of the evidence would have on the fairness of the proceedings having regard to the circumstances in which it was obtained .", "In a ruling given on DATE , the trial judge ( Mr Justice PERSON ) held that the transcripts were admissible . He stated that it was common ground that the interviews were capable of being \" confessions \" as defined in section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of PACE . He found that as a matter of construction of the DATE Act inspectors could ask witnesses questions that tended to incriminate them , the witnesses were under a duty to answer such questions and the answers were admissible in criminal proceedings . He rejected Mr Parnes \u2019s assertion that the inspectors should have given a warning against self - incrimination . He was satisfied that there was no element of oppression involved in the obtaining of the evidence and that the answers were not obtained in consequence of anything said or done which was likely to render them unreliable in all the circumstances existing at the time .", "CARDINAL . ORG From DATE the court held a further voir dire following the application of the applicant to rule inadmissible the ORG transcripts concerning the eighth and ninth interviews on the basis that they should be excluded either as unreliable under section DATE of PACE or pursuant to section CARDINAL of PACE because of the adverse effect the admission of the evidence would have on the fairness of the proceedings having regard to the circumstances in which it was obtained . ORG was placed on the applicant \u2019s alleged ill - health at the time and on the fact that the CARDINAL interviews in question had taken place after the applicant had been charged .", "In his ruling of CARDINAL DATE Mr Justice PERSON rejected the defence argument as to the applicant \u2019s medical condition . He did , however , exercise his discretion pursuant to section DATE to exclude the evidence from the CARDINAL above - mentioned interviews which had taken place after the applicant had been charged on the grounds that his attendance could not be said to be voluntary . In his view , moreover , it could not be said to be fair to use material obtained by compulsory interrogation after the commencement of the accusatorial process .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was tried together with CARDINAL co - defendants . The trial involved DATE of evidence , DATE of speeches by counsel and a DATE summing - up to the jury by the trial judge . The applicant faced CARDINAL counts including , inter alia , CARDINAL counts of false accounting contrary to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) b of LAW DATE and CARDINAL counts of theft and several counts of conspiracy .", "In the course of his trial the applicant , who was the only accused to give evidence ( DATE ) - after the reading of the transcripts ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) - testified that he knew nothing about the giving of indemnities or the paying of success fees and that he had not been consulted on such matters . He asserted that he had been guilty of no wrongdoing . The ORG relied heavily on the evidence of PERSON ( ORG \u2019s finance director ) who had been granted immunity from prosecution . It also referred to the statements made by the applicant in the course of interviews to the ORG inspectors .", "CARDINAL . ORG The transcripts of the interviews were read to the jury by the prosecution over a DATE period during the trial ( DATE ) . They were used in order to establish the state of the applicant \u2019s knowledge and to refute evidence given by the applicant to the jury .", "For example , counsel for the prosecution used passages from the interviews to demonstrate that PERSON had been aware , inter alia , of the payment to Mr PERSON , who had been allegedly involved in the sharesupport operation , of MONEY , before the inspectors had shown him an invoice for the payment of the money to Mr W. In his answers to the inspectors Mr PERSON had stated that he had agreed on the payment to Mr W. of MONEY as an appropriate success fee . When the inspectors showed him the invoice for the payment of this money to a company ( ORG ) used by PERSON to receive fees for work done , he replied that he had not seen the invoice before but had deduced that it related to his agreement to pay Mr MONEY .", "In his opening speech to the jury , counsel for the prosecution stated as follows :", "\" PERSON also told [ ORG ] inspectors why the [ MONEY ] had been paid . He said that PERSON [ W. ] had performed invaluable service during the bid for ORG and that Mr [ W. ] had persuaded him that MONEY was an appropriate fee as a reward . Mr PERSON accepted that there was no documentation to support his decision to pay Mr [ W. ] MONEY . Mr PERSON admitted to the [ inspectors ] that he knew that ORG was a company used by PERSON [ W. ] and his associates to receive money . \"", "During the trial Mr PERSON testified that he did not know that the money had been paid to Mr PERSON prior to being shown the invoice by the inspectors . In his cross - examination of the applicant , counsel for the prosecution referred to the above answers in the transcripts to contradict PERSON PERSON \u2019s testimony . In his closing speech to the jury he stated :", "\" But PERSON ... evidence to the inspectors make it clear that he knew perfectly well ... that PERSON [ W. ] had been paid . You will remember those passages in his ... interviews where he knew all about this payment before he was shown the invoice . \"", "CARDINAL . Reference was also made to the interview transcripts by counsel for the co - accused [ Mr NORP ] in an attempt to demonstrate that PERSON was not telling the truth . In his answers to the inspectors Mr PERSON had repeatedly stated that he did not recall any conversations with Mr NORP concerning the purchase of shares in Guinness or about indemnities against loss in the event of such purchase . However , a letter written by PERSON to another person stating that such conversations had taken place and generally implicating PERSON in the share - support operation had been previously published in the press .", "During cross - examination of PERSON , counsel for PERSON suggested that PERSON answers to the inspectors on this point were not believable , that he had \" lost his nerve \" before them and that this explained his replies that he could not recollect the conversations with PERSON taking place . He repeatedly asked why PERSON did not take the opportunity to tell the inspectors that PERSON accusations in the published letter were a \" pack of lies \" instead of replying as he did .", "CARDINAL . ORG In his summing - up to the jury , the judge also compared and contrasted what the applicant had said in court with the answers which he had given to the inspectors .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL counts in respect of conspiracy , false accounting and theft . He received an overall prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the second set of proceedings concerning the other co - defendants , further challenge was made to the admissibility of the transcripts of the interviews on the ground , inter alia , that there was an abuse of process in that there was misconduct by the inspectors and/or the prosecuting authorities in the use of the inspectors\u2019 statutory powers for the purpose of constructing a criminal case . In particular , it was alleged by CARDINAL of the codefendants , Mr GPE , that there was a deliberate delay in charging the accused in order that the inspectors could use their powers to obtain confessions .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a ruling given on DATE Mr Justice PERSON found that there was no prima facie case of abuse by either the inspectors or the prosecuting authorities . He had heard evidence from both the inspectors and the police officer in charge of the criminal investigation . In a ruling given on DATE the judge rejected the application for a stay , finding that there had been no abuse of the criminal process in the questioning of the defendants or in the passing of Mr GPE \u2019s depositions to the inspectors to the prosecuting authorities or in their conduct of the prosecution . He saw nothing improper or sinister in the decision by Mr Wood not to involve the police until DATE He concluded rather that proper use had been made of the statutory powers . The judge also refused an application to exclude the evidence of the interviews under section CARDINAL of PACE as constituting evidence which had such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it .", "CARDINAL . ORG On appeal ORG in a judgment dated DATE ( NORP v. PERSON ) upheld the trial judge \u2019s ruling as to the admissibility of the interviews before the inspectors . On DATE leave to appeal was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence . He argued , inter alia , that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the weight to be allowed to the evidence given by PERSON , the finance director of ORG who had been afforded immunity from prosecution .", "The applicant was granted leave to appeal against conviction . Following a hearing at which the applicant was represented , ORG gave its judgment on DATE . It held that while there were some blemishes and infelicities in the judge \u2019s summing - up , it was in the main a masterly exposition , which left the main issue of dishonesty to the jury . It commented that the applicant \u2019s counsel had expressed the possibility that he might wish to address the court as to the admissibility of the transcripts . It stated however that the question had been decided , as far as it was concerned , by the decision given by another division of ORG in the case of NORP v. GPE , which had held that such statements were admissible . It went on to reject the applicant \u2019s appeal on all but CARDINAL count : it found that the judge had erred in his direction on CARDINAL count and quashed that conviction . It reduced his sentence to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Home Secretary referred the applicant \u2019s case and that of his co - defendants to ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE . He did so on the basis of applications by the applicant \u2019s co - defendants - but not the applicant himself - who submitted that the prosecution had failed to disclose certain documents at their trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the appeal the applicant argued , inter alia , that the use at the trial of answers given to the ORG inspectors automatically rendered the criminal proceedings unfair .", "The court rejected this argument , pointing out that ORG had expressly and unambiguously provided in the DATE Act that answers given to ORG inspectors may be admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings even though such admittance might override the privilege against selfincrimination .", "In its judgment the court noted that the interviews with each of the accused \" formed a significant part of the prosecution case \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG With reference to the allegation that it was unfair that those interviewed by ORG inspectors should be treated less favourably than those interviewed by the police under PACE , the court noted as follows :", "\" ... the unravelling of complex and devious transactions in those fields is particularly difficult and those who enjoy the immunities and privileges afforded by LAW and the Companies Acts must accept the need for a regime of stringent scrutiny especially where fraud is suspected ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In relation to the argument that the difference between LAW and LAW regimes ( see paragraphs DATE below ) was anomalous the court stated :", "\" ... the explanation lies in the very different regime of interviews by ORG inspectors compared with that of interviews either by police or the ORG [ ORG ] . ORG inspectors are investigators ; unlike the police or ORG they are not prosecutors or potential prosecutors . Here , typically , the CARDINAL inspectors were a Queen \u2019s Counsel and a senior accountant . They are bound to act fairly , and to give anyone they propose to condemn or criticise a fair opportunity to answer what is alleged against them ... Usually , the interviewee will be represented by lawyers and he may be informed in advance of the points to be raised . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The court also rejected an allegation that there had been an abuse of process in that the ORG inspectors were used wrongly as \" evidence gatherers \" for the prosecution or that there had been improper or unfair \" collusion \" , as follows :", "\" We have carefully considered the effect of the events of DATE in the light of all the documents . We conclude that to allow the inspectors to continue their inquiry and to bring in the police only in DATE was a proper course subject to CARDINAL essentials .", "( CARDINAL ) That the inspectors were left to conduct their inquiries and interviews independently without instruction , briefing or prompting by the prosecuting authority . We are quite satisfied that the inspectors themselves made that clear and abided by it . Counsel also laid down those ground rules correctly and they were observed ...", "( CARDINAL ) That the interviews were conducted fairly and unobjectionably . It was not suggested to the trial judge or before us that the inspectors could be criticised on this score . These were carefully structured sessions of proper length in suitable conditions . The appellants , experienced businessmen of high intelligence , were each represented either by counsel ( usually ORG ) or a senior solicitor . The questions were put scrupulously fairly and the Code laid down in the PERSON case ... was observed . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Finally , the court also rejected the allegation that non - disclosure prior to the trial of the material alleged to indicate abuse caused any unfairness to the applicant . It subsequently refused to certify that the case involved a point of public importance and denied leave to appeal to ORG . Following this decision no further avenue of appeal was open to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .
