MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The case originated in an application ( no . CARDINAL ) against GPE lodged with ORG under LAW ( \u201c the LAW ) by a NORP company , ORG ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , on DATE . The applicant company was represented by PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Attorney General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG and the ORG issued a call for tenders for the design , organisation and management of a quality national event , on the occasion of the celebration of GPE \u2019s accession to ORG .", "The deadline for submitting bids was DATE .", "CARDINAL participants ( the applicant company , ORG and ORG ) paid the relevant fees and guarantees and submitted their bids .", "On DATE the tender was awarded by ORG .", "On DATE the applicant company objected to this decision . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "The applicant company alleged that the bid made by PERSON had not met the formal requirements of the tender . In particular , its components had been presented collectively and not individually and it had not been submitted in an itemised format . Moreover , the bid in question had been based on incorrect and misleading information . It had made reference to \u201c laser cannons \u201d which , according to the applicant , did not exist , and to a TV transmission deal with ORG ( the \u201c GPE ) , which was not dependent on the involvement of PERSON . In the applicant \u2019s view , as the ORG would have broadcast all the major shows from the CARDINAL acceding countries , this matter should not have been taken into consideration during adjudication . The applicant company further stated that its bid was better value for money .", "Welcomeurope challenged the applicant company \u2019s arguments . It contended that \u201c cannon lights \u201d would be used in the show . Furthermore , the ORG had informed them that , due to the presence of an artist who had signed a contract with PERSON for the exclusive right to use his services , GPE would have been allotted a longer transmission period .", "Representatives from ORG gave oral evidence , stating that both bids had satisfied the formal requirements of the tender and that the final choice in favour of PERSON had been based on the price and on the satisfactory standard reached .", "The applicant company requested the production of a number of documents , namely ORG report , TIME of meetings regarding the bids , letters from PERSON relating to TV coverage , ORG detailed list of equipment and its certificate of insurance cover . It alleged that these documents were indispensable for allowing it to substantiate its objections .", "PERSON objected to this request , noting that some of the documents contained commercial information of a highly confidential nature .", "The ORG observed that it could authorise the production of documents only in so far as they were relevant to the objections raised and strictly necessary for giving a ruling on their merits . As a consequence , only a small extract from ORG report was produced . The chairman of ORG had in fact noted that other parts of the report might have contained commercial and other information of a confidential nature .", "In a decision of DATE , the ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s claim . It held that the invalidity of ORG bid had not been proved and that there had been no reason to doubt the method used by ORG to assess the bids , which had been based on an overall assessment and had not been dependent on the amount or type of lasers used .", "On DATE the applicant company lodged an application with ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . It alleged that the rejection of its request for the production of documents had infringed its right to a fair hearing .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s claim on the ground that LAW was not applicable to the proceedings before the ORG .", "It recalled that this provision only applied to disputes concerning civil rights and obligations . These rights belonged to private and not to public law and existed only if they arose from a \u201c clearly defined statutory right \u201d . Thus , although a company was entitled not to be discriminated against in the adjudication procedure , it did not have a civil right to be awarded the tender . The fact that it carried out commercial activities aimed at earning profit was not in itself sufficient to bring LAW into play .", "Moreover , it could not be said that the ORG was a \u201c tribunal \u201d within the meaning of this provision . It was not independent since essential features of its constitution and of the exercise of its functions depended on the Prime Minister . Furthermore , its decisions took the form of specific recommendations , which were final as regards the award of the contract . They were binding on ORG who could not be considered a body having judicial powers . According to domestic case - law , a recommendation did not have the same authority as a judgment of a competent court determining the existence of civil rights and obligations .", "On DATE the applicant company appealed to ORG .", "It claimed that according to the case - law of ORG , the word \u201c tribunal \u201d in LAW had to be given a wider interpretation , not based on the distinction between quasi - judicial and purely administrative bodies . All judicial authorities that determined a person \u2019s complaints affecting his or her rights should be considered a \u201c tribunal \u201d . In particular , the dispute submitted to the ORG concerned civil rights and obligations . Indeed , the participation in the tender involved substantial financial and logistical efforts and the award of the contract would have entailed significant financial benefits for the applicant . By its very nature , the whole process gave rise to rights and obligations in respect of any person entering into negotiations to obtain such an award .", "The applicant further argued that , having regard to the manner of appointment of its members and to its procedures , the ORG resembled more a court or judicial tribunal than an administrative body .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s appeal .", "It held that NORP law applicable at the time ( ORG ) did not grant any rights in the context of a public call for tenders . The mere act of submitting a tender did not give the applicant company the right to have its tender accepted . It was true that the amount of work involved in submitting a tender and the financial expenses attached to it carried with it an obligation to act in good faith and with the diligence of a bonus pater familias throughout the negotiations . However , these obligations only had a pre - contractual nature ; they could give rise to a claim for damages , but not to any right to demand specific performance .", "In the present case , the applicant did not request damages but a reconsideration of the decision . The fact that the result of the proceedings before the ORG had economic consequences for the applicant was not sufficient to conclude that the dispute concerned the determination of a civil right . ORG distinguished the applicant company \u2019s case from the case of ORG and Others and PERSON and Others v. GPE ( see judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV ) . Although that case had dealt with tenders , the right at issue was the right not to be discriminated against in the job market .", "In view of the above , ORG concluded that the proceedings before the ORG did not involve a determination of civil rights and obligations . It was therefore irrelevant to establish whether the ORG was a \u201c tribunal \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "LAW A ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( the \u201c COCP \u201d ) , reads as follows :", "\u201c Save as is otherwise provided by law , the courts of justice of civil jurisdiction may enquire into the validity of any administrative act or declare such act null , invalid or without effect only in the following cases :", "( a ) where the administrative act is in violation of the LAW ;", "( b ) when the administrative act is ultra vires on any of the following grounds :", "( i ) when such act emanates from a public authority that is not authorised to perform it ; or", "( ii ) when a public authority has failed to observe the principles of natural justice or mandatory procedural requirements in performing the administrative act or in its prior deliberations thereon ; or", "iii ) when the administrative act constitutes an abuse of the public authority \u2019s power in that it is done for improper purposes or on the basis of irrelevant considerations ; or", "iv ) when the administrative act is otherwise contrary to law . \u201d", "Regulation CARDINAL.CARDINAL of ORG read as follows :", "\u201c These regulations do not confer any right on any tenderer , supplier or contractor beyond those pertaining under civil law . \u201d", "Regulation CARDINAL of the sixth schedule to LAW to :", "\u201c evaluate tenders submitted as well as reports and recommendations made thereon by the respective departments and public organisations and make definite recommendations for the award of tenders ensuring that the best value for money at the lowest possible cost is attained .
