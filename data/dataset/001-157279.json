On DATE the public prosecutor withdrew the charges against the applicant for lack of evidence . In a written statement of that date the public prosecutor indicated that there was no evidence that the applicant had known or had reasonable grounds to believe that he had transported illegal migrants . He had met them for the first time at the NORP bus station . He had never had any contact with them before . Since PERSON was fluent in NORP , the applicant could not have suspected that he ( PERSON ) was a migrant . The other CARDINAL migrants had not spoken during the journey . Furthermore , PERSON had confirmed that he had misled the applicant , since otherwise nobody would have driven them . For that reason , he had advised ORG and ORG not to speak . When the police had stopped them , he had apologised to the applicant . That had been confirmed by ORG and ORG and CARDINAL police officers who had stopped them on DATE in question . On DATE , the investigating judge discontinued the investigation concerning the applicant . The latter decision indicated that the applicant had no previous criminal record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court convicted GPE of migrant smuggling and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court established that PERSON had told PERSON and ORG , illegal migrants from GPE , that he could transfer them illegally into GPE . They had paid him MONEY ( ORG ) .

The applicant appealed , arguing that the confiscation order had not been based on any fact . He had not been convicted of any crime and the trial court was not entitled to order confiscation of his car . PERSON , who was convicted , had been travelling in the car as a passenger .

Lastly , he had never been involved in migrant smuggling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the confiscation order .

Article CARDINAL of [ the Code ] concerns the confiscation of objects , and paragraph ( CARDINAL ) refers to objects used for the commission of a criminal offence . When those objects are owned by a third person , they may be confiscated CARDINAL persons knew or could and ought to have known that the objects are being used or are intended to be used to commit an offence . In the present case there is no need for the application of this rule , because the rule contained in LAW ( CARDINAL ) necessarily requires the confiscation of the objects and the means of transport used to commit the offence , irrespective of whom they belong to , whom they are for , or whom they come from .", "In such circumstances , coupled with the fact which was established beyond any doubt , ( namely ) that this offence was committed by the accused with the [ applicant \u2019s ] vehicle , the court was correct to confiscate the vehicle by its decision contained in the operative provision of the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
