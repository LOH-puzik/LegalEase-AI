While criminal proceedings are pending , the materials in the criminal case file are an investigative secret ( section CARDINAL of GPE ) , which is why it is impossible to give you more specific information concerning the investigative steps that have been taken and will be taken . It might be for that reason that you have formed an incorrect opinion that the investigation is being intentionally delayed and not conducted with the aim of establishing the culprit ; however , such an opinion does not find support in the steps actually taken in the criminal proceedings .", "In the course of the pre - trial investigation of the criminal case ... a sufficient amount of investigative steps were carried out : CARDINAL expert reports were ordered and received and the need to order [ additional ] expert reports and the planning of further investigative steps was determined by the [ findings of the ] expert reports already received . In addition , the preparation of expert reports took significant time ; CARDINAL witnesses were questioned and other investigative steps carried out . Unfortunately the pre - trial investigation to this date has not allowed us to establish the circumstances [ of PERSON \u2019s death ] or the culprit . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
