The applicant was born in DATE and now lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant moved to the city of GPE . She took up residence in rented property at the address NORP Street CARDINAL . This address is located in the GPE district in GPE . The applicant had previously resided outside LOC ( Stadsregio Rotterdam ) .", "CARDINAL . The owner of the property asked the applicant , who by this time had CARDINAL young children , to vacate the property as he wished to renovate it for his own use . He offered to let the applicant a different property at the address LOC CARDINALA , also in the GPE area . The applicant stated that , since it comprised CARDINAL rooms and a garden , the property was far more suitable for her and her children than her FAC dwelling which comprised a single room .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , GPE had been designated under LAW ( Wet bijzondere maatregelen grootstedelijke problematiek , see below ) as an area in which it was not permitted to take up new residence without a housing permit ( huisvestingsvergunning ) . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant lodged a request for a housing permit with the PERSON and Aldermen ( burgemeester en wethouders ) of GPE in order to be permitted to move to B. Street CARDINALA.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON and Aldermen gave a decision refusing such a permit . They found it established that the applicant had not been resident in LOC for DATE immediately preceding the introduction of her request . Moreover , since she was dependent on social - security benefits under ORG ( PERSON ) , she did not meet the income requirement that would have qualified her for an exemption from the residence requirement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the LOC and Aldermen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON and Aldermen gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s objection . Adopting as their own an advisory opinion by ORG ( PERSON bezwaarschriftencommissie ) , they referred to housing permits as an instrument to ensure the balanced and equitable distribution of housing and the possibility for the applicant to move to a dwelling not situated in a \u201c hotspot \u201d area .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal ( beroep ) with ORG ( rechtbank ) . As relevant to the case , she argued that the hardship clause ought to have been applied . She relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . As relevant to the case before the ORG , its reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LOC ( LAW provides for the possibility of temporary restrictions on freedom of residence in areas to be indicated by the Minister [ sc . the Minister of ORG and the Environment ( Minister PERSON , PERSON en Milieubeheer ) ] . The aim of these restrictions is to reverse a process of overburdening and decreasing quality of life , particularly by striving towards districts whose composition is more mixed from a socioeconomic point of view . The restrictions are also intended actively to counteract the existing segregation of incomes throughout the city through the regulation of the supply of housing in certain districts and in so doing improve quality of life for the inhabitants of those districts ( Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) DATE , CARDINAL CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , pages CARDINAL ) . In view of the aims of the law , as set out , these temporary restrictions on the freedom to choose one \u2019s residence can not be found not to be justified by the general interest in a democratic society . Nor can it be found that , given the considerable extent of the problems noted in certain districts in GPE , the said restrictions are not necessary for the maintenance of ordre public . ORG takes the view that the legislature has sufficiently shown that in those districts the \u2018 limits of the capacity for absorption\u2019 have been reached as regards care and support for the socioeconomically underprivileged and that moreover in those districts there is a concentration of underprivileged individuals in deprived districts as well as considerable dissatisfaction among the population about inappropriate behaviour , nuisance and crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s further appeal . As relevant to the case before the ORG , its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c ORG finds that , considering that the area in issue is CARDINAL designated under LAW , the LOC and Aldermen were entitled to take the view that the restriction [ on freedom to choose one \u2019s residence ] is justified in the general interest in a NORP society within the meaning of LAW of the DATE LAW . The area in issue is a so - called \u2018 GPE , where , as has not been disputed , quality of life is under threat . The restriction resulting from section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing Bye - law ( DATE ) is of a temporary nature , namely for DATE . It is not established that the supply of housing outside the areas designated by the Minister in ORG is insufficient . What [ the applicant ] has stated about waiting times does not lead ORG to reach a different finding . ORG further takes into account that pursuant to section MONEY ) , introductory sentence and under b of ORG , the Minister is empowered to rescind the designation of the area if it turns out that persons seeking housing do not have sufficient possibility of finding suitable housing within the region in which the municipality is situated . In view of these facts and circumstances ORG finds that the restriction in issue is not contrary to the requirements of a pressing social need and proportionality . ORG therefore finds , as ORG did , that section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing Bye - law does not violate LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An evaluation report after DATE following the introduction of the housing permit in GPE , commissioned by GPE \u2019s own ORG ( ORG ) , was published on DATE by ORG voor NORP en PERSON ) , a research and advice bureau collecting statistical data and carrying out research relevant to developments in GPE in areas including demographics , the economy and employment ( hereafter \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The report notes a reduction of the number of new residents dependent on social - security benefits under the Work and Social Assistance Act in \u201c hotspot \u201d areas , though not , of course , a complete stop because GPE residents of CARDINAL years\u2019 standing are not prevented from moving there .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE there had been CARDINAL requests for a housing permit . Of these , CARDINAL had been granted ; CARDINAL had been refused ; CARDINAL had been rejected as incomplete ; and CARDINAL were still pending . The hardship clause ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LOC ) had been applied in CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . DATE of the housing permits granted concerned housing let by private landlords ; the remainder DATE had been granted through the intermediary of social housing bodies ( woningcorporaties ) . The latter selected their tenants with due regard to the official requirements , so that refusals of housing permits with regard to social housing were unheard of .", "CARDINAL . Of the persons refused a housing permit , DATE ( PERCENT of all those who met with a refusal ) had managed to find housing elsewhere relatively quickly .", "CARDINAL . The DATE evaluation report was presented to the local council on DATE . On DATE the local council voted to maintain the housing permit system as was and have a new evaluation report commissioned for DATE .", "CARDINAL . A second evaluation report , also commissioned by GPE \u2019s ORG , was published by ORG on DATE . It covered the period from DATE until DATE ( \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) , during which the events complained of took place .", "CARDINAL . During this period , the social housing bodies had let CARDINAL dwellings in the areas concerned . Since the social housing bodies could only accept tenants who qualified for a housing permit , no applications for such a permit had been rejected in this group .", "CARDINAL . Out of CARDINAL applications for a housing permit relating to privatelylet housing , CARDINAL had been accepted ( PERCENT ) ; CARDINAL had been refused ( PERCENT ) ; and CARDINAL had been pending at DATE . Examination of a further CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) had been discontinued without a decision being taken , generally because these applications had been withdrawn or abandoned ; the assumption was that many of these applications would in any case have been rejected . It followed , therefore , that if the pending cases were not taken into account , CARDINAL of this category of applications had been either refused or not pursued to a conclusion .", "CARDINAL . The reason to reject an application for a housing permit had been related to the income requirement in PERCENT of cases , sometimes in combination with another ground for rejection ; failure to meet the income requirement had been the sole such reason in PERCENT of cases .", "CARDINAL . Of CARDINAL persons refused a housing permit , CARDINAL had managed to find housing elsewhere in GPE ( PERCENT ) or elsewhere in the GPE ( PERCENT ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The hardship clause had been applied CARDINAL times \u2013 expressed as a percentage of applications relating to privately - let housing , PERCENT of the total . These had been cases of preventing squatters from taking over housing left empty ( antikraak ) , illegal immigrants whose situation had been regularised by a general measure ( generaal pardon ) , assisted living arrangements for vulnerable individuals ( begeleid wonen ) , cooperative living arrangements ( woongroepen ) , start - up enterprises , the re - housing of households forced to clear substandard housing for renovation , and foreign students . In addition , in CARDINAL of cases the hardship clause had been applied because a decision had not been given within the prescribed time - limit .", "CARDINAL . The effects of the measure were considered based on CARDINAL indicators : proportion of residents dependent on social - security benefits under ORG , corrected for the supply of suitable housing ; perception of safety ; social quality ; and potential accumulation of housing problems :", "( a ) It had been observed that in the areas where the housing permit requirement applied , the reduction of the number of new residents dependent on social - security benefits under the Work and Social Assistance Act had been more rapid in \u201c hotspot \u201d areas than in other parts of GPE . In addition , the number of residents in receipt of such benefits as a proportion of the total population of those areas had also declined , although it was still greater than elsewhere .", "( b ) In CARDINAL of the areas where the housing permit requirement had been introduced , the increase in the perception of public safety had been more rapid than the GPE average . GPE had shown an increase initially , but was now back to where it had been before the measure was introduced . CARDINAL other area had actually declined significantly in this respect . All of the areas where the housing permit requirement applied were perceived as considerably less safe than GPE as a whole .", "( c ) In terms of social quality , there had been improvement in most of the parts of GPE where problems existed , GPE among them . It was noted , however , that the effect of the housing permit in this respect was limited , since it only influenced the selection of new residents , not that of residents already in place .", "( d ) Housing DATE defined in terms of turnover , housing left unused , and house price development \u2013 had increased somewhat in the affected areas including GPE , though on the whole at a slower rate there than elsewhere . Reported reasons for the increase were an influx of immigrants of mostly non - NORP extraction ( nieuwe Nederlanders , \u201c new GPE nationals \u201d ) and new short - term residents from LOC ; the latter in particular tended to stay for DATE or less before moving on , and their economic activity was more difficult to keep under review as many were self - employed .", "CARDINAL . Social housing bodies tended to view the housing permit requirement as a nuisance because it created additional paperwork . They perceived the measure rather as an appropriate instrument to tackle abuses by private landlords , provided that it be actively enforced and administrative procedures be simplified . Others with a professional involvement in the GPE housing market mentioned the dissuasive effect of the measure on would - be new residents of the affected areas .", "CARDINAL . The report suggested that the housing permit requirement might no longer be needed for CARDINAL of the existing \u201c hotspots \u201d ( not GPE ) . Conversely , CARDINAL other GPE districts scored high for CARDINAL indicators , while a sixth exceeded critical values for all CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . A third evaluation report , this time commissioned by GPE \u2019s ORG ) , was published by ORG in DATE ( second revised edition ) . It covered the period from DATE until DATE ( \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Based on the same indicators and methodology as the previous report , it concluded that the housing permit system should be continued in GPE and CARDINAL other areas ( including CARDINAL in which it had been introduced in the meantime , in DATE ) ; discontinued in CARDINAL others ; and introduced in CARDINAL area where it was not yet in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior and ORG ( Minister PERSON en ORG ) sent a separate evaluation report assessing the effectiveness of GPE and its effects in practice to ORG of ORG , as required by LAW . The Minister \u2019s missive stated the intention of the Government to introduce legislation in order to extend the validity of LOC . Requests to that effect had been received from a number of affected cities . It was noted that not all of the cities concerned had made use of all of the possibilities offered by the LAW ; in particular , only GPE used housing permits to select new residents for particular areas . Appended to the Minister \u2019s letter was a copy of the DATE evaluation report and a letter from the PERSON and Aldermen of GPE in which , inter alia , the desirability was stated of extending beyond DATE periods the indication of particular areas for applying the housing permit requirement : the measure was considered a success , and a DATE programme involving the large - scale improvement of housing and infrastructure ( the \u201c ORG GPE \u201d ( ORG , see below ) ) had been started in the southern parts of GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior and ORG ( on behalf of ORG ) , PERSON on behalf of the municipality of GPE ) , and the presidents of a number of LOC boroughs ( deelgemeenten ) , social housing bodies and educational institutions signed ORG .
