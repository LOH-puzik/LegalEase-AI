On DATE the ORG informed the court that according to ORG \u2019s relatives , she had left the country after marrying a NORP national , and confirmed that she had changed her name and was residing at an unknown address in GPE . The authorities provided the courts with the available information concerning the aforementioned remaining missing witnesses , and stated repeatedly that they had no other records of their current valid addresses .", "CARDINAL .

He did not attend any subsequent hearings and the authorities failed to find him , although they also attempted to summon him at the aforementioned unregistered address .", "CARDINAL . Some of the witnesses who testified against the applicant at the pretrial stage of the proceedings were located by the authorities and brought before the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the ORG heard M.A , NORP , ORG , F.H.A. and J.L.A. The court dismissed PERSON \u2019s request to be heard in the applicant \u2019s absence . PERSON stated amongst other things that the applicant had threatened her and had forced her into prostitution . She had not met any other girls apart from ORG and had been sold to the applicant by PERSON withdrew her previous statement given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings and declared that the authorities had forced her to accuse the applicant of procurement .

Although he had had sex with several of the girls he had met at the club allegedly run by the applicant , he had not paid for it . PERSON withdrew his statement given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , denied that he knew the applicant or that he had previously been asked by the authorities if he had paid for sexual relations .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG dismissed , among other things , a request lodged by the applicant \u2019s lawyer to adjourn the proceedings in order to allow him to locate NORP and to bring him before the court as a witness . Having assumed that PERSON would be heard by the court , he had not examined the file thoroughly enough to be able to submit oral observations on behalf of the applicant . The court refused his request , holding that it had already decided that it was impossible to have PERSON heard and that the absence of the witness did not hinder the examination of the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the statement given by PERSON at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings was read out before the court . Subsequently , the court allowed the parties to submit oral observations on the merits of the case and allowed a request submitted by the applicant \u2019s lawyer to adjourn the proceedings in order to allow the parties to submit written observations on the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of unlawful deprivation of freedom , convicted him of procurement and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It held that the facts of the case had been established on the basis of the statements given by ORG ; the statements of the girls forced into prostitution , namely ORG , NORP , ORG and GPE \u2013 the girls described how they had met the applicant and his co - defendant , and how they had prostituted themselves ; they provided details on how they had been contacted by clients , the money given to the applicant , and the appearance of some of the clients ; the report of the search carried out at the applicant \u2019s home ; the description of the objects found in the applicant \u2019s home which belonged to ORG ; the letter received by ORG from her mother , which referred to rumours that her daughter and the other girls had been prostituting themselves ; the list of telephone calls made from the applicant \u2019s phone , which established the phone contact between the applicant , his co - defendant and some of the clients who had contacted the applicant \u2019s co - defendant or with whom she had had sexual relations , namely ORG , FAC , ORG , GPE , GPE , F.H.A. , PERSON and PERSON ; and the witness testimonies of NORP , PERSON , ORG , F.H.A. , J.L.A. and PERSON made at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , which established , with the help of the list of telephone calls and the statements of the QUANTITY underage girls , the applicant \u2019s involvement in procurement . The court noted that only GPE and ORG had confirmed their own statements given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings . It also noted that ORG , PERSON and M.M.K. could not be heard as witnesses by the court . In addition , witnesses NORP , J.L.A. and F.H.A. , like the applicant \u2019s co - defendant , had significantly changed the statements they had given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings by affirming that they had never paid for sex . Having regard to the conflicting witness and co - defendant statements , the court decided to rely on those testimonies which had been confirmed by the other evidence available in the file . Consequently , it considered that the testimonies given by the witnesses and the co - defendant at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings were accurate as they had been made closer to the date of the unlawful acts and had also been corroborated by the remaining available evidence . Furthermore , it dismissed PERSON \u2019s statement and those of the defendants given before the court because they contained several inaccuracies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment , arguing that the court had summoned as witnesses , but had failed to summon as victims , the QUANTITY girls who had allegedly been forced into prostitution . In addition , the statements of the QUANTITY girls were not supported by any other evidence , and all the victims of his alleged unlawful acts should have been heard by the court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed in part the applicant \u2019s appeal in so far as the classification of his offence was concerned , upheld his sentence and dismissed the remaining points of his appeal . It held that given the nature of the unlawful act with which the applicant had been charged , it would not have been justified to summon as victims the girls he had forced into prostitution . Moreover , the applicant could not rely on the court \u2019s failure to do so as long as his personal interest was not affected . As for the facts established by the first - instance court , the appeal court held that they had been confirmed by the evidence in the file . In particular , the testimonies of the CARDINAL girls , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG had been corroborated by the testimonies of PERSON , GPE , ORG , ORG and FAC that with the help of the applicant \u2019s co - defendant , they had paid for sexual relations with several girls . PERSON had testified that the applicant had been interested in meeting girls who wanted to leave the country and work as dancers in bars , and PERSON had repeatedly driven the applicant and the girls to various hotels . Consequently , the appeal court considered that the first - instance court had correctly convicted the applicant of procurement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment . He argued , amongst other things , that the court had summoned as witnesses , but had failed to summon as victims the QUANTITY girls who had allegedly been forced into prostitution . In addition , the judicial investigation of the case had been insufficient because the evidence had not been administered publicly .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing of DATE before ORG the applicant \u2019s lawyer reiterated some of the arguments which he had raised before the second - instance court . Moreover , he contended that some witnesses , including ORG , ORG , had not been heard directly by the first - instance court and that the court had not provided reasons for its failure to hear them . Also , the address on the summons intended for I.I.C. had been incomplete . The summons had been sent to a town in the county of GPE , even though ORG had stated that the witness was not registered there . The courts had failed to hear other witnesses as well , including GPE , and to take measures to bring those witnesses before them . Consequently , he asked the court to quash the judgments of the lower courts and to order a review of all the evidence in the file .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed in part the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law in so far as it reduced his sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , and dismissed the remainder of the appeal . It held that the lower courts had correctly established the facts of the case and the applicant \u2019s guilt on the basis of the evidence administered at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings and re - confirmed at the trial . The fact that the girls forced by him into prostitution had been summoned during the trial not as victims but as witnesses was not an argument the applicant could rely on as long as his personal interest had not been affected . As for the evidence establishing the facts of the case , the court reiterated the reasoning of the second - instance court . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s arguments that the court had failed to administer and examine directly all the evidence raised during the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , that his rights of defence had been breached and that the debate had not been adversarial were unsubstantiated . A court could rely either on the testimonies given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings or on the ones given before the court if it was convinced that only some of them reflected the truth and were corroborated by the evidence in the file . A court could rely on the testimonies given at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings if it was impossible to hear the witness directly . A judgment could not be quashed on the grounds that a witness had not been heard directly by the court , unless a party had been prejudiced . In the present case , the lower courts had allowed the applicant \u2019s requests to hear the witnesses who had testified at the pretrial stage of the proceedings and had taken measures to secure their attendance at the trial . The judgments of the lower courts could not be quashed because they had provided reasons for their inability to hear some of the witnesses , namely that they had left the country , and the testimonies had been read out at a public hearing . Consequently , the lower courts had followed the correct procedure in establishing the applicant \u2019s guilt by using evidence collected both at the pre - trial and the trial stages of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal ( contesta\u021bie \u020bn anulare ) , seeking the quashing of the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE . He argued that his right of defence had been breached on DATE because he had been unable to attend the hearings held before the last - instance court on account of his serious medical condition and therefore he had been unable to ask for additional evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal , quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered the last - instance court to re - examine the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE because he had been unable to attend the hearings before the last - instance court on account of his medical condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted his reasons for appeal on points of law before the last - instance court . He argued , among other things , that some of the witnesses , including ORG , ORG , had not been heard . In addition , the first - instance court had dismissed the request to re - summon the witness I.I.C. , whose testimony had been relevant for the case . Other witnesses , including GPE , had also not been heard and no steps had been taken to bring them before the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG allowed in part the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and reduced his sentence to DATE imprisonment . It held that the first and second - instance courts had been active and had collected all the relevant evidence for the case . They had diligently taken all the necessary steps in order to hear the evidence directly and to verify the applicant \u2019s defence arguments . They had valid reasons for not having directly heard all the victims and witnesses in the case , namely that the individuals in question had left the country . Consequently , the courts had applied LAW . The factual circumstances had been established on the basis of ORG and ORG \u2019s statements ; the statements of the girls forced into prostitution , namely ORG , NORP , ORG and ORG , who described how they had met the defendants and how they had prostituted themselves , and provided details on how they had been contacted by clients and on the money given to the applicant ; the report of the search carried out at the applicant \u2019s home ; the report containing a description of the objects belonging to ORG , which had been found in the applicant \u2019s home ; the letter received by ORG from her mother , which had been found in the applicant \u2019s home ; the list of telephone calls made from the applicant \u2019s phone , which had established the phone contact between the defendants and some of the clients who had contacted the applicant \u2019s co - defendant or with whom she had had sexual relations ; and the witness testimonies of NORP , PERSON , ORG , F.H.A. , J.L.A. and M.M.K.", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG instituted criminal proceedings for perjury against the witness NORP who had changed her testimony before the first - instance court in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings for perjury against NORP on the grounds that her action had not met the level of severity required for an offence and the domestic courts had disregarded her statement given at the trial . However , it fined NORP the sum of RON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for her behaviour . G.S.S. did not challenge the order before the domestic courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
