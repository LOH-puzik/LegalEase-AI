The court also ordered that he be permanently expelled from GPE .", "On DATE the GPE and PERSON of Appeal ( hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the judgment of ORG . The applicant did not appeal against the appellate court \u2019s judgment , which accordingly became legally binding on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Kriminalv\u00e5rdsmyndigheten ) determined the period during which the applicant was to remain in prison . It noted that he had begun to serve his sentence on DATE and that DATE of the prison term , having regard to the total period spent in detention , would be on DATE . The ORG further determined that the applicant would be eligible for conditional release on DATE at the earliest .", "On DATE ORG ( NORP , hereafter \u201c the Administration \u201d ) declared its intention to make a request to the applicant \u2019s country of origin , GPE , for him to serve the remainder of his sentence there .", "The applicant declared on DATE that he did not consent to such a transfer .", "On DATE the ORG requested the transfer of the applicant to GPE under LAW ( hereafter \u201c LAW ) and LAW .

On DATE a single judge decided that the applicant \u2019s sentence was to be converted into DATE imprisonment under NORP law , to be served under a strict prison regime ( fegyh\u00e1z ) . The effect of the latter condition was that he would become eligible for conditional release after having served CARDINAL of the sentence . The applicant appealed against that decision and requested to serve his sentence under a normal prison regime ( b\u00f6rt\u00f6n ) , which would have made him eligible for release on parole at an earlier date .
