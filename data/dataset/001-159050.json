SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Expulsion;Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;George Nicolaou;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants , who are cousins , contracted a religious marriage in GPE , where they were residing illegally . At the time , the first applicant was DATE and the second applicant DATE . Their religious marriage was not registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied for asylum in GPE , which they had entered from GPE on an unspecified date . Both applicants had been already registered as asylum seekers in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum request , considering that GPE was the responsible ORG by virtue of Regulation no . PERSON ( the \u201c FAC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant had a legal guardian appointed by ORG ( ORG tut\u00e9laire , now ORG protection de l\u2019adulte et de l\u2019enfant ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the \u201c FAC \u201d ) rejected the second applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision . The ORG noted that the applicants had failed to submit a certificate of marriage and that in any event their alleged religious marriage could not be validly recognised in GPE , pursuant to LAW , because it was illegal under the relevant provision of LAW , which contained an absolute prohibition on marriage for women DATE , while the first applicant was DATE . In any case , independently of the applicable NORP law , the applicant \u2019s marriage was manifestly incompatible with NORP ordre public , since having sexual intercourse with a child under DATE was a crime under LAW . The first applicant could therefore not be qualified as a member of the second applicant \u2019s family under LAW and the applicants could not claim any right to family life under LAW .", "The decision against the first applicant entered into force on DATE , as the second applicant had not appealed against it .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG decided to reexamine the first applicant \u2019s asylum request in GPE . Following this decision , the second applicant requested that his own asylum request be also reexamined in order to preserve the family unity . The second applicant \u2019s request was rejected by the LAW on procedural grounds : as the applicant \u2019s claim was deemed without prospects of success , he had been asked an advance judicial fee of MONEY ( \u201c CHF \u201d ) , which he had failed to pay .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was expelled to GPE on DATE . However , on DATE he returned illegally to GPE , where he could see the first applicant \u201c intermittently \u201d , in the applicants\u2019 own words .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged the present application before this Court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant again requested the reexamination of his asylum request , which was rejected by the LAW on ORG DATE because the second applicant had again failed to pay the CHF CARDINAL advance judicial fee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants requested the recognition of their religious marriage in GPE . The first applicant was then DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the FAC examined the second applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE and ruled in favour of the second applicant . The FAC considered that the ORG had wrongly imposed on the second applicant the payment of an advance judicial fee because by then the first applicant was DATE and the applicants could therefore claim to be a family within the meaning of LAW as interpreted by this Court and by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government requested that the application be struck out of the list of cases pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to the ORG \u2019s request , the applicants submitted that their application included a complaint about a past violation , not only a prospective one , namely that on CARDINAL September CARDINAL the second applicant had been expelled to GPE and thus separated from the first applicant . Such forcible separation constituted a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their family life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of the GPE of GPE recognised the validity of the applicants\u2019 religious marriage contracted in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants informed the ORG that they had been granted asylum in GPE by a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , referring to their submissions of DATE , the applicants informed the ORG that they wished to maintain their application , considering that as the alleged past violation of their right to respect for family life had neither been acknowledged nor remedied they had not lost victim status even if they had now obtained asylum in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
