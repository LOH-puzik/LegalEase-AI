NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently detained at ORG . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows . On DATE the Government of GPE issued CARDINAL warrants of arrest against the applicant seeking the applicant \u2019s extradition on CARDINAL charges of conspiracy to supply ecstasy and conspiracy to possess ecstasy with intent to supply . He was accused of being a member of an international gang engaged in a conspiracy to import large quantities of ecstasy into GPE in DATE . The ecstasy intercepted by the NORP authorities as part of their investigation amounted to CARDINAL tablets weighing QUANTITY with a street value of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested under the extradition request at his home in GPE . On DATE a District Judge sitting at FAC found that there was a case to answer on all CARDINAL charges and committed the applicant to await the decision of the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant asked the Secretary of ORG to refuse to order his return to GPE under LAW of LAW DATE . He claimed his involvement in the conspiracy was under duress ; if extradited he would be unable to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses who would give evidence to this effect under the same conditions as witnesses against him , in breach of LAW ) of the LAW . He maintained that he could be prosecuted in GPE for conspiring to export ecstasy and that if convicted in GPE he would inevitably receive a life sentence with , probably , no right of parole , which would be manifestly excessive . He also argued his extradition would be a disproportionate interference with his family life in GPE , which consisted of a wife , CARDINAL children ( born in DATE and DATE ) and a mother who was in poor health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the Secretary of ORG was considering the applicant \u2019s representations , the Attorney - General \u2019s Department of ORG provided the following information on the applicant \u2019s likely sentence :", "\u201c While it is possible , given the seriousness of the offences , that PERSON may receive a sentence of life imprisonment , the sentencing ORG is required to set a nonparole period unless , having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence and to the antecedents of the person , the ORG is satisfied that it is not appropriate to fix a non - parole period . It would be highly unusual for the ORG not to fix a nonparole period .", "The sentence imposed will depend upon the findings of the ORG in relation to matters such as the type and amount of narcotics involved , the role of the defendant in the importation and other particular distinguishing factors . The sentence imposed will also depend upon whether there is a plea of guilty or not guilty and whether any assistance has been provided by the defendant .", "Comparative sentences imposed in [ GPE ] over DATE for offences of importation of a commercial quantity of narcotics consisting of MDMA [ ecstasy ] , heroin or cocaine , where the quantity consisted of QUANTITY and a plea of not guilty entered shows head sentences in the range of DATE to life imprisonment with non - parole period in the range DATE . The maximum penalty of life imprisonment is , of course , usually reserved for the most serious offences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . NORP In reply to the complaint about the likely imposition of a life sentence in the event of conviction , it was noted that it would be highly unusual for NORP courts not to fix a non - parole period , and , in any event , it would not be unjust or oppressive to return the applicant to GPE purely on the basis of the sentence he could receive if convicted of serious criminal offences . As to the argument that the applicant would be unable to plead duress in GPE , no evidence had been submitted to substantiate the claims of intimidation of the applicant and his family or that these mattes were reported to the police . The NORP authorities had confirmed that should any of the applicant \u2019s witnesses be subjected to threats , appropriate action would be taken by the NORP police . They also advised that it was open to the applicant to apply for a suppression order in relation to the names of any witnesses who feared for their safety . If his witnesses were unable or unwilling to attend trial in GPE he could apply to the NORP courts for evidence to be given via video link . It was also possible for evidence not requiring crossexamination to be submitted in the form of a written statement . On this basis , the Secretary of ORG was satisfied that there was sufficient provision to allow the applicant \u2019s witnesses to give evidence to the NORP courts and there would be no breach of his rights under LAW ( d ) . As to the LAW complaint the applicant \u2019s family circumstances were not so exceptional as to engage this provision . In addition , GPE was obliged to fulfil its international obligations towards its extradition partner . The applicant \u2019s co - accused had already been tried in GPE , and , as such , it would not be unreasonable for the NORP authorities to expect related trials to be conducted in the same jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then made further representations , arguing that there would be a further breach of LAW since he would not obtain legal aid in GPE . He renewed his representations on DATE and also claimed that the NORP provisions governing the transfer of prisoners were discriminatory and were applied inconsistently and arbitrarily .", "CARDINAL . These further representations were rejected by the Secretary of ORG on DATE . As to the legal aid complaint the NORP authorities had confirmed that persons charged with serious criminal offences would normally be granted legal aid if their means were insufficient to engage private legal representatives . If the applicant were to be refused legal aid , he could make an application for a stay of the trial : the relevant NORP case - law ( PERSON v. the Queen ( DATE ORG CARDINAL ) ) provided that where an accused charged with a serious offence , who through no fault on his or her part was unable to obtain legal representation , applied to the trial judge for an adjournment or stay then , in the absence of exceptional circumstances , the trial should be adjourned , postponed , or stayed , until legal representation was available . If an application that the trial be delayed was refused , and by reason of the lack of representation of the accused , the resulting trial was not a fair one , any conviction of the accused would have to be quashed by an appellate court for the reason that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that the accused had been convicted without a fair trial . Further , the Secretary of ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s co - accused had been granted legal aid for their trials in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s contention concerning the NORP provisions for the transfer of sentenced prisoners , GPE was a party to the multilateral ORG on ORG , which was incorporated into NORP domestic law . The applicant , if convicted , would be eligible to apply for transfer . The Secretary of ORG was satisfied that any application for transfer he might wish to make would receive appropriate and fair consideration . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG again found the applicant \u2019s circumstances were not so exceptional as to prevent extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court refused permission for judicial review . It refused to interfere with the Secretary of ORG \u2019s finding that GPE was the appropriate venue for the trial , especially when the alleged co - conspirators had been tried there . On the fairness of the trial in GPE , Lord Justice PERSON ( with whom PERSON Justice PERSON agreed ) accepted that the legal aid authorities in GPE would not fund the travel of defence witnesses but this was remedied by the fact that there was no bar on witnesses giving evidence by video link . He added :", "\u201c However more importantly , the evidence before this court simply does not raise a scintilla of a suggestion that the NORP judicial authorities will permit a trial to proceed if to do so would be unjust to the applicant . The case of PERSON has been cited by the NORP authorities to the Secretary of ORG , who has considered it . As one would expect of NORP jurisprudence , it essentially says that if there is unfairness to a defendant arising out of difficulties from legal aid funding , the court will be astute to exercise such powers as it has to ensure that the trial is ultimately a fair trial or is stayed . I can therefore see no justification for concluding that there will be any breach of LAW in the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to return the appellant to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL further letters from the Attorney - General \u2019s Department of ORG addressed the applicant \u2019s likely sentence and general sentencing practice for drugs offences . The first , dated DATE , summarised the trial and sentencing of CARDINAL co - accused of the applicant , PERSON and PERSON . ORG considered PERSON to be one of the most senior members of the conspiracy in GPE . He received a \u201c head sentence \u201d of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a non - parole period of DATE . PERSON received a head sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , with a non - parole period of DATE and DATE . The letter noted that it was the prosecution \u2019s case that the applicant \u2019s level of criminality was higher than that of PERSON but any sentence would have to be proportionate to that imposed upon the co - accused . Subsequent developments in the cases of PERSON and PERSON were set out in the third and fourth letters ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The first letter went on to state that there were CARDINAL people in GPE who had been sentenced to life imprisonment without a non - parole period ; a third was re - sentenced to life imprisonment without a non - parole period after he breached a life sentence with a non - parole period on his release . The CARDINAL who were sentenced to life imprisonment without a nonparole period at first instance were the principals in an organisation which had imported QUANTITY of heroin . In other cases of the importation of narcotics where life imprisonment has been imposed , but a non - parole had been set , the highest non - parole period has been CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , ranging down to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second letter , dated DATE and provided in the context of the proceedings before this ORG , reiterated that it was unlikely that the applicant would receive a life sentence with no non - parole period . Since his co - accused had already been sentenced , should the applicant be convicted a major concern for a sentencing judge would be that of parity of sentence with those of the co - accused . The letter noted that , in addition to PERSON , CARDINAL other co - accused - Hands , PERSON and Alkarim - received head sentences of CARDINAL DATE imprisonment with non - parole periods of DATE . A fourth co - accused , ORG , the CARDINAL to plead guilty , received a discount of CARDINAL for that plea and for his assistance to the relevant law enforcement agencies . The discount reduced his head sentence from CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment to DATE . His non - parole period was set at DATE and DATE . ORG in their observations ( see below ) indicated that another co - accused , PERSON , had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that she serve a minimum of DATE before being eligible for parole . The letter from ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s sentence would necessarily be higher than his coaccused to reflect his role as the principal organiser . However , any sentence imposed would not be so much higher as to be out of proportion with the sentences imposed on the co - accused . Should the applicant be convicted , the ORG would not submit to the court that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole was an appropriate sentencing option .", "The letter also recorded that a person convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment could appeal as of right to ORG and , thereafter , seek special leave to appeal to ORG of GPE . A federal offender was also able to petition ORG to exercise the Royal Prerogative of ORG to remit or commute part of his sentence of imprisonment . It continues :", "\u201c It is likely that the Prerogative would only be exercised if there were circumstances that did not exist , or were unknown to the court , at the time the matter was dealt with , which warranted some mitigation of the sentence . A federal offender could also apply for early release on licence under section CARDINALAP of LAW CARDINAL . The Attorney - General or his ORG may grant early release on licence where exceptional circumstances exist that warrant early release , for example assistance to law enforcement agencies or health problems that can not be adequately managed within the prison system . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The third and CARDINAL letters , dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE , were also provided in the context of the proceedings before this ORG . The letters stated that PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had appealed to ORG on the basis that their convictions were without jurisdictional foundation because of the form of the indictments . Their appeals were allowed . At the end of the retrial of PERSON and PERSON in DATE , the jury was discharged because it was unable to reach a verdict . On DATE , PERSON pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to possess a prohibited import . On DATE , he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with a non - parole period of DATE from DATE . PERSON \u2019s third trial commenced on DATE and , on DATE , he pleaded guilty to CARDINAL charge of aiding , abetting , counselling or procuring an attempt to possess prohibited imports . The ORG accepted that plea of guilty in full satisfaction of all charges brought against him . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment commencing on DATE and expiring on DATE . The non - parole period was DATE on DATE and expiring on DATE . PERSON was also retried and , on CARDINAL DATE , found guilty of aiding , abetting , counselling or procuring an attempt to possess prohibited imports . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with a non - parole period of DATE and DATE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , extradition arrangements between GPE and GPE were governed by LAW DATE . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the Secretary of ORG has a general discretion to order a person \u2019s surrender , including when it would , having regard to all the circumstances , be unjust or oppressive to return the person . The Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was open to challenge by way of judicial review , inter alia , on the basis that it was incompatible with a Convention right . This is by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , which makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
