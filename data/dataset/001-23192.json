THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . They are siblings of PERSON , a black man who was killed as a result of being set on fire by assailants in a racist attack during TIME DATE . The applicants are all NORP nationals living in GPE . They are represented before ORG , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE , GPE .", "At the time of his death , PERSON was a single DATE black man . He suffered a mental breakdown in DATE and was subsequently diagnosed and treated in hospital for schizophrenia .

However , DATE before his death he moved into accommodation for persons with mental health problems at FAC , GPE .", "On DATE , PERSON was given leave from ORG and went to stay at FAC .", "On TIME , at TIME , PERSON telephoned PERSON at FAC . She told him that she had received a message from ORG that he was to return there as soon as possible for his \u201c ward - round \u201d . Some time after that telephone call PERSON left FAC with the apparent intention of returning to ORG .", "It appears that having left PERSON , PERSON took the wrong bus for his destination and he ended up getting off the bus in GPE , GPE . He was subsequently attacked by CARDINAL white youths who had got off the bus with him . They set his back on fire , probably whilst he was lying face down on the ground .", "He was found on fire at TIME on DATE by an off - duty fireman who had been passing by in a car . At the time he was found , PERSON appeared to be in a severe state of shock with severe burns to his back , buttocks and upper thighs . The off - duty fireman flagged down a passing police car with CARDINAL police officers in it . They in turn summoned an ambulance .", "According to the applicants , the CARDINAL police officers did not treat the circumstances of PERSON \u2019s discovery as suspicious and wrongly assumed that he had set fire to himself . Consequently , they failed to investigate the crime scene at all at that stage or to set in motion any trains of inquiry to search for or identify and catch PERSON attackers . It was only after specific instructions from PERSON family at a later stage that the police began to treat the attack as suspicious and to investigate it .", "An ambulance arrived and PERSON was taken to ORG where he was admitted and treated . It seems that the police officers left the scene of the incident when PERSON was taken to hospital .", "PERSON was found to have sustained full thickness third degree burns to PERCENT of his body . Owing to the severity of his burns , he was transferred to ORG in ORG .", "Sometime between TIME and TIME on DATE , CARDINAL officers arrived at the house of PERSON , PERSON friend , in the mistaken belief that he was PERSON next - of - kin . It appears that the police had made this mistake as a result of inquiries to ORG where PERSON name and address were obtained .", "The CARDINAL police officers told PERSON that PERSON had set himself on fire whilst walking along FAC in LOC . The officers repeated this and stated that PERSON had been lucky because they had been passing , saw him on fire and had stopped and helped to extinguish the fire . PERSON asked these officers if they had informed PERSON family . They told him they had not and he immediately gave them the address of PERSON brothers , PERSON and PERSON .", "Shortly afterwards , again sometime between TIME , the same QUANTITY police officers arrived at PERSON and PERSON home . The police officers told them that PERSON had set himself on fire in GPE , that he had been seriously injured and had initially been taken to ORG but had been subsequently transferred and was receiving treatment in LOC in ORG . The officers then asked PERSON to sign for some charred papers and CARDINAL burnt keys which had been found on PERSON person and asked him whether PERSON had been on medication or whether he had a mental health background .", "ORG and PERSON immediately went to ORG TIME They could not see PERSON at first because he was still receiving treatment for his burns . At TIME they were allowed to see him briefly . He appeared alert and lucid and was able to answer their questions . PERSON asked his brother what had happened and PERSON replied that he had been attacked by CARDINAL white boys .", "PERSON explanation to his brother conflicted with the report given by the police officers and so PERSON telephoned ORG at TIME on DATE . He spoke to a police officer and told her that PERSON had told him that he had been attacked by CARDINAL white boys .", "On TIME , PERSON telephoned the hospital and was able to speak to PERSON . Once again , although in pain , he was lucid and able to tell his sister about his recollection of the incident . He said that he remembered catching a bus in the wrong direction and that there had been CARDINAL white boys on the bus , CARDINAL of whom had been wearing a black leather jacket . He had got off the bus at the same stop as these white boys and followed them to ask for directions . He remembered that shortly after this he was leaning against something and then had felt something on his back . He then discovered that he was on fire and started to take his clothes off .", "Following this conversation PERSON spoke to the ward sister at the hospital and a consultant treating PERSON and received confirmation that there were no contra - medical indications preventing PERSON from being interviewed by the police . She also made requests to the police that they should come and interview PERSON about the attack .", "Over TIME , PERSON again asked PERSON about what had happened . PERSON gave the same account . PERSON took notes on these occasions . PERSON had been asked to keep notes of these conversations by his sister , PERSON , because the police had resisted her requests to take a statement directly from PERSON .", "PERSON called the police on CARDINAL occasions from DATE urging them to come to the hospital to take a statement from PERSON . PERSON also called the police on repeated occasions over the same period requesting them : to take a statement from PERSON ; to go to the site of the incident ; to take finger prints from the telephone box near to the place where PERSON had been found ; to interview local people ; to put up an incident board requesting information ; and to launch a media appeal for witnesses .", "On DATE Detective Inspector PERSON came to the hospital , but he arrived at a time when PERSON was drowsy . Detective Inspector PERSON decided not to take a statement from PERSON . PERSON gave a statement to Detective Inspector PERSON summarising PERSON \u2019s account of the incident . However , during this meeting PERSON became very concerned because Detective Inspector PERSON did not appear to take a full or accurate record of what PERSON was saying .", "During the period DATE PERSON received surgical treatment DATE . When he was not in a post - operative state and up until DATE , he was lucid , sitting up , talking to his family , feeding himself , doing crosswords , chatting with hospital staff and taking telephone calls . This included a telephone conversation with PERSON during which PERSON repeated his account of the incident and the attack by CARDINAL young white men which , he stated , had occurred near a telephone box in GPE .", "Notwithstanding PERSON \u2019s ability to make such statements to his family and friends , neither Detective Inspector PERSON nor any other police officer took a statement from him at any stage .", "On DATE PERSON had a cardiac arrest and fell into a coma until DATE , when he died .", "On DATE the inquest into PERSON death before the Coroner \u2019s ORG was opened . It was adjourned on a number of occasions . During this time the police reported to the Coroner on several occasions , but copies of these reports were not disclosed to PERSON family .", "In DATE an examination into the procedures and practices during the first stage of the investigation into PERSON death was carried out by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In DATE the results of this examination were produced . The family were informed that this examination confirmed some of the doubts that the enquiry was not handled as well as it could have been and that an Investigating Officer had been formally appointed to look into the matter . The examination was made available to the Coroner but was kept back from the family as being confidential .", "On DATE the PERSON family sent a letter of complaint to ORG ( \u201c PCA \u201d ) concerning the ORG \u2019s decision to withhold evidence from PERSON family prior to the inquest .", "On DATE Deputy Assistant Commissioner PERSON of Area CARDINAL of the ORG responded informing the family that the complaint did not fall within CARDINAL of ORG and therefore would not be recorded as such . This letter went on to respond to points of concern expressed in the letter of complaint .", "On DATE a verdict of unlawful killing was returned by a jury at ORG following a hearing lasting DATE during which evidence had been given by a number of witnesses including fire experts on behalf of the ORG .", "On DATE Deputy Assistant Commissioner PERSON issued a statement on behalf of the ORG regretting that for DATE after the attack on PERSON , the police treated it as a case of self - immolation .", "On DATE the family lodged a further letter of complaint with the ORG setting out the particulars of complaints in detail from the time that PERSON was discovered by the police in TIME of DATE until shortly after the inquest . The following criticism of the police \u2019s handling of the case was made in the letter of complaint :", "CARDINAL . There were major errors in the police investigation of PERSON death , at the very outset of the case ( and beyond ) which substantially diminished the chances of detecting and prosecuting those responsible for PERSON death .", "CARDINAL . NORP There was a concerted effort by all key officers ( from the officers first on the scene , to Deputy Assistant Commissioner level ) to minimise and obscure these errors and deflect criticism from the police .", "CARDINAL . These imperatives led the police :", "\u2013 to continue , beyond TIME of the investigation of PERSON death , to fail diligently or promptly to investigate the death ;", "\u2013 to pressurise , abuse and mislead the PERSON family about how PERSON met his death and the police investigation , with a view to affecting their ability properly to grieve and be represented at the inquest ;", "\u2013 improperly to influence the Coroner conducting the inquest and to seek to lead the jury to bring a verdict which was least embarrassing to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police investigation into PERSON death was affected by racism and the subsequent internal investigation into the quality of the investigation failed even to address this issue .", "The ORG appointed the Chief Constable of ORG to carry out an investigation into the family \u2019s complaint .", "On DATE the applicants were advised by Counsel that there were no reasonable grounds for advising the grant of legal aid to bring proceedings against the police in the light of the domestic law in respect of actions in negligence and claims of racial discrimination against the police .", "On DATE a Report of an Inquiry chaired by Sir PERSON of ORG , a retired High Court Judge , was published into matters arising from the death of PERSON , a black CARDINAL-year old youth who was murdered by a group of youths on DATE . The Inquiry investigating his death and its subsequent investigation by the ORG found that institutional racism existed both in the ORG and in other police services and institutions countrywide . The ORG found institutional racism primarily apparent in the actual investigation of PERSON murder , including the police treatment and approach to the victim , key witnesses and the family of PERSON and the \u201c lack of urgency and commitment in some areas of the investigation \u201d .", "On DATE the family of PERSON , with the assistance of campaigners , leafleted the area within which the suspects lived appealing for further information in respect of the murder .", "On DATE a suspect was arrested and later charged in connection with the death of PERSON .

CARDINAL of the accused ( GPE and ORG ) were committed for trial at ORG , GPE , for the murder of PERSON and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . The third accused ( PERSON ) was committed to stand trial at ORG for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . On DATE another suspect ( ORG ) was arrested in northern GPE and charged there on CARDINAL DATE with the murder of PERSON .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 solicitor wrote to the ORG asking that the ORG also investigate other areas of complaint including the failure of the pre - inquest investigating teams to co - operate fully with ORG and the making of untrue and misleading press statements damaging to PERSON family .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 solicitor was informed that the ORG had felt it wise to delay any further investigation into the applicants\u2019 complaints pending the outcome of the criminal case against the accused in the LANGUAGE courts .", "Further letters of complaints were addressed by the applicants\u2019 solicitors to the Director of ORG alleging a failure on the part of the Task Force to liaise or to communicate adequately with the PERSON family in respect of the criminal proceedings against the accused including the trial taking place in northern GPE .", "On DATE a criminal court in northern GPE found GPE guilty of the manslaughter of PERSON and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .

All CARDINAL accused received separate sentences on this count . According to the ORG lawyer \u2019s letter of DATE , all of the accused \u2019s appeals were rejected although the sentence of CARDINAL of them was reduced .", "The applicants maintain that the evidence given in the trials against the accused revealed the inadequacy of the police investigation . The applicants listed CARDINAL areas of concern in a letter addressed by their solicitor to the ORG on DATE , including : the unfounded belief of police officers following the attack on PERSON that he had tried to commit suicide ; the failure to seal the scene of the crime resulting in a loss of evidence ; the failure to record or act on PERSON accounts to medical and nursing staff that other persons were responsible for what happened to him ; the error of the police in recording the deceased \u2019s injuries as non - life - threatening ; threats made to and harassment of members of the deceased \u2019s family by the police when , for example , they queried the police appeal for witnesses to come forward ; assertions made by a police officer at the inquest that there was no evidence that others were involved in PERSON death ; and the conduct of the police with respect to the conduct of the inquest and the criminal trials .", "The PERSON family members made formal statements to the GPE Constabulary investigating the case on behalf of the ORG in support of these complaints , as well as the complaints set out in the letter dated CARDINAL DATE from the applicants\u2019 solicitor .", "On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicants\u2019 solicitor reporting on the evidence collated to date . The letter stated among other things :", "\u201c Carefully examining TIME will be fundamental to understanding what came later as it appears that once flawed explanations had entered the minds of police officers , to varying degrees it appears it remained present throughout the ensuing period up to , including and after the inquest . To what extent racial stereotyping of both PERSON and the PERSON family took place and how this may have affected the investigation of his death will be an integral part of the investigation throughout . Similarly we will be examining whether there was an institutional failure by ORG to challenge with sufficient rigour the assumptions made at the start . This will include examining this issue up to and including Chief Officer levels if necessary . \u201d", "On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicants\u2019 solicitors stating , among other things :", "\u201c There is now available a significant body of evidence containing new information about these events , which appears to provide support for the family \u2019s complaints from a number of independent directions .... \u201d", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 solicitor received an anonymous statement dated DATE from a member or ex - member of the ORG .

A further difficulty was that certain key police officers had retired or were about to retire and could not be interviewed without their consent , and in any event not under caution . A report could not expected before DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL key officer ( S. ) retired on at DATE and was therefore no longer subject to the police disciplinary code .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicants\u2019 solicitors in writing that it had received the Investigating Officer \u2019s report and that the ORG was satisfied with the investigation which had been carried out into the applicants\u2019 complaints .

The applicants\u2019 solicitors\u2019 were further informed that they would be notified if the ORG decided to bring criminal charges in the event of findings that any police officers had committed a criminal offence .
