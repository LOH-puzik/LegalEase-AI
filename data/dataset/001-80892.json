FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , who is a carpenter by profession , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had an accident at work . He sustained a splinter fracture of his left elbow which later developed into degenerative arthritis . The insurance company paid him an occupational injury pension ( tapaturmael\u00e4ke , olycksfallspension ) until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to have the pension continued from DATE . On DATE the insurance company rejected his application finding that the applicant 's working capacity had been reduced by PERCENT . It further held that the applicant 's inability to return to his previous profession as a carpenter was not based on the injury to his left arm , but on his neck and shoulder pains which had not been caused by the accident .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( tapaturmalautakunta , olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ) , repeating his requests . He relied on a medical opinion dated DATE in which he was found to be unfit for carpentry work as well as an another medical opinion dated DATE . He submitted CARDINAL further medical opinions dated DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected his appeal on DATE by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . It ruled , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c [ t]he medical opinions at its disposal show that the strain tolerance of [ the applicant 's ] left elbow was reduced due to the limitations on moving it and its susceptibility to pain . Therefore he is incapable of full - time carpentry work . ... In the work - testing project ( ty\u00f6kokeilututkimus , arbetspr\u00f6vning ) no plan for vocational education was tested due to [ the applicant 's ] pain . [ The applicant 's ] neck and head pains were not caused by the accident and therefore can not be compensated under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by a lawyer , appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) submitting further evidence . ORG received several other documents , for example medical opinions and case histories of the applicant . The insurance company gave its opinion , to which the applicant replied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the bulk of his appeal . It however modified ORG decision so as to grant the applicant a PERCENT occupational injury pension for DATE , during which the applicant had participated in a work - testing project .", "CARDINAL . Having telephoned ORG , the applicant was told that his case file consisted of CARDINAL pages of material . He acquainted himself with the case file at the office of the court 's registry and found CARDINAL documents , which allegedly had not been communicated to him by ORG . In his application for leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) he claimed , inter alia , that he had not been sent all the documents relevant to his case .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , using an extraordinary procedure , requested ORG to annul its decision and that of ORG . He argued that the latter court had failed to send him documents , including a hand - written memorandum dated DATE not indicated ) written by a lawyer of the insurance company concerning her telephone conversation with an employee of ORG r.y . , PERSON r.f . , \u201c the Association \u201d ) . The note included , inter alia , the following comments : \u201c [ the applicant ] does not consider pain rehabilitation possible \u201d and \u201c [ the applicant ] is currently awaiting ORG decision \u201d . On DATE he submitted that the case file had also included an assessment and rehabilitation advice by the ORG dated DATE and DATE , respectively , which had not been sent to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his application by a majority . It found that the non - communicated documents related to decision - making within the insurance company and that it remained unclear when and how the memorandum was included in the case file , which was exceptionally voluminous . In any event , the non - communicated documents were not submitted to the court in connection with either of the parties ' submissions relied on in evidence by them or by the court in reaching its decision . One of the Justices considered that the CARDINAL documents mentioned by the applicant were not entirely irrelevant to the proceedings before ORG . In his view , ORG had made a procedural error and concluded that the applicant had not received a fair trial within the meaning of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
