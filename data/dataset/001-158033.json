Subsequently a fourth person , Mr E.D. , appeared , presenting himself as a police officer . ( In fact , he was a penitentiary officer . ) When Mr PERSON was about to leave , the applicant questioned him about his attitude using offensive and vulgar language , upon which Mr PERSON turned back and got into a fight with the applicant , which ended due to the intervention of CARDINAL persons , the applicant \u2019s acquaintances .", "Following the fight , Mr E.D. called the police . CARDINAL officers arrived . The applicant , Mr E.D. and PERSON were then escorted to the local police station . They were released DATE after . Although both the applicant and Mr E.D. had visible injuries , only Mr E.D. underwent a medical examination .

Here is money ! \u201d and thrown cigarettes and money at him .

In these posts , Mr PERSON commented that TIME before he \u201c had been kicking in the head a gypsy lying on the ground when [ he ] was overcome by CARDINAL of his buddies \u201d . In reply to favourable posts by other users , Mr E.D. posted an Internet link to a video clip containing a widely known excerpt from a feature film with overtly intolerant and explicitly racist language .

On DATE ORG opened a criminal investigation against Mr E.D. for the offence of \u201c violence against a member of a group \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL .

As regards his comments on a social network , Mr PERSON stated that he had posted them for no particular reason and specified that \u201c in fact [ he ] had not been kicking the boy \u2019s head ... had [ he ] done so the [ applicant ] would have suffered more serious injuries \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG discontinued the investigation into the offence of \u201c violence against a member of a group \u201d , considering that there was no evidence substantiating that Mr E.D. had attacked the applicant out of racial hatred . Relying on the applicant \u2019s complaint , PERSON testimony , Mr E.D. \u2019s statement given as a suspect in the parallel proceedings and the medical evidence , ORG concluded that it could not be established who had provoked the fight and whether there was a causal link between the insults directed against the applicant and the fight .", "The applicant filed a complaint against the discontinuation on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was given the opportunity to study the case - file .

On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision , considering that :", "\u201c Accepting the background of the incident , as recounted by the victim and Ms GPE , although it is likely that the action had racist motives , it can not be proven sufficiently for establishing criminal responsibility \u2013 that is , unequivocally and beyond any doubt \u2013 that Mr E.D. ill - treated the applicant precisely because of his GPE origin . The racist motive can not be established , in particular , since before the incident Mr E.D. had intended to leave the scene and only turned back because of the victim \u2019s reproach , and the only information about the start of the fight originates in the contradictory statements of the victim and Mr E.D. Neither the victim nor Ms D.L. could provide further details as to the question whether after having turned back , Mr E.D. made any further racist comments before or during the fight . The ORG post attached to the criminal complaint only reveals that Mr E.D. had insulted an unnamed and unidentifiable person of GPE origin TIME . It can not be established unequivocally and beyond doubt , either from the post or from the subsequent messages , that [ the insult ] took place precisely because of the victim \u2019s GPE origin .", "Based on the above reasons and considering all available information and evidence in their entirety , Mr E.D. \u2019s racist motive is probable at the maximum , but can not be established beyond doubt . \u201d", "As regards further investigative measures , ORG stated that given the fundamental contradictions between the statements of ORG , the applicant and PERSON , a confrontation between them had no prospects of success . Furthermore , Mr PERSON had given a detailed account of the facts in his testimony given as a suspect in the parallel proceedings , which rendered futile his further questioning .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON was convicted of disorderly conduct by ORG for having got into a fight with the applicant and was placed on DATE probation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
