{"ITEMID": "001-4751", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "NAVIEDE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . He is currently detained in GPE in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "On an unspecified date the applicant was charged by ORG with various offences of dishonesty . He applied and was granted legal aid .", "At DATE the applicant 's case was transferred to ORG . It was first listed before a judge in DATE . At that stage the applicant was represented by solicitors and senior and junior counsel .", "On DATE the applicant was arraigned . The hearing was fixed for DATE . However , that date was vacated because the applicant 's representatives had sent to ORG detailed submissions as to why the prosecution should have been discontinued . Following the rejection of these submissions , the applicant decided that he wished to represent himself .", "On DATE the applicant 's counsel appeared before the judge and asked to be allowed , together with their solicitors , to withdraw from the case . The judge heard the applicant 's senior counsel , his solicitor and the applicant himself . He also heard counsel for the ORG .", "The applicant 's position was that he wished to present himself the factual side of the case , examine and cross - examine witnesses and address the jury . At the same time he wanted to be allowed to have his solicitors and counsel to advise him upon and argue on his behalf such matters of law as might arise in the course of the case . The applicant 's solicitor told the judge that he had advised the applicant that he should be represented by counsel if his case was to be conducted properly . However , according to the solicitor , there had been a serious breakdown of confidence between himself and the applicant and in those circumstances , unless directed to the contrary , he wished to withdraw .", "The applicant 's counsel said that he knew of cases where a defendant had retained solicitors and counsel to argue the law and the ORG 's counsel accepted that , provided that proper ground rules were established , such a course of action could be followed .", "The judge , having satisfied himself that the applicant had formed a firm and considered opinion and that his views had been properly presented to the court , decided that it would be improper to allow the applicant to proceed with the case in the manner he envisaged . The judge considered that , if counsel were to continue to participate in the proceedings , they should have control over the case . Counsel for the applicant and the ORG agreed . Then the applicant was asked whether , in the light of this development , he wished to reconsider his decision to represent himself . He refused .", "The court reconvened on DATE . The matter of the applicant 's representation was again discussed . The judge formally allowed the applicant 's counsel and solicitors to withdraw . The applicant was allowed to represent himself . However , new solicitors were retained to advise the applicant who could seek advice from counsel on particular matters . These solicitors assisted the applicant throughout the proceedings and occasionally consulted counsel .", "On DATE the applicant requested that the court should sit DATE a week . However , the judge refused this request .", "On a number of subsequent occasions , before the actual beginning of the trial , the applicant repeated his wish to have the kind of representation he had favoured from the beginning . However , the judge reaffirmed his earlier ruling . On CARDINAL occasion , on DATE , the judge again sought and received confirmation that the applicant had decided to represent himself .", "The judge 's last pre - trial re - iteration of his ruling was on DATE when he stated the following :", "\u201c It is an absolute right for someone to represent themselves ; and Mr GPE has decided to represent himself in this trial . I have considered the question of whether I should extend his legal aid for leading and junior counsel to represent him ; and I have come plainly to the conclusion that it would be wholly inappropriate in this case for Mr GPE to represent himself , have control of cross - examination and the calling of witnesses [ on ] issues of fact , then instruct counsel to represent him on points of law throughout the course of the case . It seems to me that that would be wrong . It would involve , were I to grant this application , an adjournment of this case for ... a considerable period ... and , in all the circumstances , I have no alternative but to reject the application that is made . The defendant has had ample time to prepare himself for this trial ... [ A ] great deal of work has been done on his behalf . The documents have all been got in order and , in my view , the representation that he has - which in the representation of experienced solicitors , who no doubt are knowledgeable in the law - is a proper basis on which we ought to proceed . \u201d", "The trial began on DATE . The applicant requested that the hearing be adjourned for a period of DATE because he was suffering from mental exhaustion and stress . The judge , having heard expert evidence from CARDINAL doctors for the defence and CARDINAL for the prosecution , refused the applicant 's request on the ground that the applicant was fit to continue with the hearing . Then the applicant cross - examined the most important prosecution witness .", "On DATE the applicant informed the judge that he was to undergo an operation as he was suffering from the disease of pneumothorax . He applied for an adjournment that would also give him sufficient time to recover from the post - operative effects . The court adjourned the case for DATE . On returning , however , on DATE , the applicant was still suffering from post - operative discomfort and requested another DATE 's adjournment . In support of his request the applicant invoked his doctor 's opinion that he was at risk of a nervous breakdown . However , the judge relied on the evidence of another doctor that the applicant was in a fit state and refused his request .", "On DATE the judge , in the absence of the jury , threatened the applicant that he could be found in contempt of court because CARDINAL of his witnesses was not present .", "On DATE the applicant , having completed DATE in the witness box , asked for an adjournment until DATE in order to prepare for the examination of the defence witnesses . The judge decided that the rest of DATE would be sufficient for the applicant to prepare himself .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of a number of dishonesty offences . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "", "The applicant obtained leave to appeal to ORG against conviction and sentence . He relied on a number of grounds including the failure of the judge to grant his above - mentioned requests concerning the presentation of his case , the number of DATE and the adjournments . In the proceedings before ORG the applicant was represented by legal aid counsel .", "On DATE ORG , for technical reasons , quashed the applicant 's convictions on some counts , substituted convictions for different offences and reduced his sentence to DATE . However , the court did not allow any of the grounds of appeal concerning the above - mentioned requests . Furthermore , it refused to certify any question of law involved in the determination of the appeal as being of general public importance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
