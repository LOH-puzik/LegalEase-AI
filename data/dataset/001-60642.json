On CARDINAL DATE the same social worker provided the applicant with further information gleaned from the file in the form of typed notes ( covering DATE ) . She also discussed certain areas of particular concern to the applicant including the impact of childhood neglect and ill - treatment which he remembered at the hands of his father , his feelings about having had a violent father and his vague suspicions of having been abused while in local authority institutional care . They also discussed the allegations of ill - treatment of the applicant by his father which had been made by neighbours via the school to the local authority in DATE , and the consequent investigation and decisions made by the local authority .

Further to the applicant 's queries , the local authority confirmed by letter dated DATE that there were no detailed records relating to him after DATE except an indication of juvenile offending .

LAW did not , however , apply to records created before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Circular GPE was issued to provide guidance to the local authorities on the implementation of LAW and LAW . The previous circular ( LAC(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) was cancelled and LAW to the new circular pointed out that , while there was no obligation to furnish pre - DATE information , \u201c there is likely to be significant advantage in authorities making available as much information as possible . This could lead to greater clarity and understanding of an individual 's background . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) came into force and repealed LAW , LAW and circular GPE . It provided a statutory right of access for a \u201c data subject \u201d to information held about him in care records and other personal files ( both manual and electronic ) regardless of the date when the information was recorded , together with a right of appeal to the domestic courts or to ORG Commissioner if access were refused , or where a contributor or a relevant third party had not consented ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
