It further noted that the Governor had based the impugned decision on this succinct advice without any additional examination having taken place from which it could appear that the risk of a \u201c balance suicide \u201d was actually present . It lastly noted that , in his decision , the Governor had not given any additional reasons demonstrating that , in the applicant 's case , there was an increased suicide risk rendering camera surveillance necessary . It held that the reasons stated by the Governor for his decision of CARDINAL DATE , even if these were understandable , given the reactions in society to the offence at issue , were insufficient for complying with the criterion under LAW that the physical or mental condition of the detainee must render permanent camera surveillance necessary .", "On DATE , the Governor filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG .", "On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the Governor 's appeal and upheld the decision of DATE . It considered that :", "\u201c The second paragraph of LAW [ of the June CARDINAL Regulation ] provides that an advice of the penitentiary medical officer must be obtained before the Governor decides on camera surveillance . The explanation to this LAW states , on this point , that this must take place as only the medical officer is deemed capable of assessing whether visual control is necessary in the interest of the detainee .", "Where the Governor wishes to place a detainee under permanent camera surveillance , it must be established that camera surveillance is necessary because of the physical or mental condition of the detainee . The circumstance adduced in the reasoning given by the Governor , that it has not been established that a suicide risk did not exist , is insufficient for assuming that necessity . The circumstance , mentioned in the advice drawn up by the psychiatrist for the purpose of the impugned decision , that \u201c balance suicide \u201d can not be excluded , is general in nature since it does not refer to the specificities of the [ applicant 's ] physical and mental condition .", "The foregoing is in itself insufficient for concluding a necessity for camera surveillance . This is not altered by taking into account the seriousness and particularities of the offence of which [ the applicant ] is suspected .

In this respect , he further asks for consideration of the contents of your TIME programme as you have no contact with co - detainees .", "The seriousness of the offence of which you are suspected and the reaction in society which this offence has caused , justifies that the realisation of any risk of suicide or other harm to your physical and mental condition must be prevented .", "It has not been established that , in your case and noting the emotion shown and statement made by you , as well as the contents of your lawyer 's letter , these risks are not at all present .", "Camera surveillance for prevention of the realisation of the above - cited risks is necessary and is also the most adequate tool . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of ORG and requested it to examine this appeal together with his appeal of DATE against the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeals of CARDINAL and DATE , holding :", "\u201c Pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) , taken together with LAW [ this ] LAW , the Governor has the power to order measures ( ordemaatregelen ) , provided these are necessary in the interests of the order or security in the institution or the undisturbed execution of the deprivation of liberty .", "Amongst such measures must also be understood that of camera surveillance . Camera surveillance is a very drastic measure , that seriously restricts the freedom of movement of the detainee within the institution and at no moment allows him the possibility of \u201c being on his own \u201d . This measure is thus only to be applied as an ultimate means of guarding a detainee .", "ORG must now determine whether the decision of the Governor , in balancing all relevant interests and circumstances , must be considered as unreasonable or unfair .", "The ORG puts first the seriousness of the fact of which [ the applicant ] is suspected and the reaction that fact has caused in society , which lead to the conclusion that a suicide [ of the applicant ] will ( also ) affect order and security in the penitentiary institution . This element justifies measures to prevent [ the applicant 's ] suicide . ORG further takes into account that suicide is difficult to predict .", "As to the question how far such measures may go , it is true that the applicant has not shown signs indicating a mental disorder [ usually ] ... associated with an increased suicide risk , but [ the applicant 's ] detention regime has changed on DATE in that he can take notice via the media , for the first time since his arrest , of the reactions in society to the act of which he is suspected and he may receive visits .", "As it can not be excluded that the applicant , following this change ... is exposed to great pressure , the possibility of a ' balance - suicide ' must be taken into account and the Governor 's decision to apply permanent camera surveillance , in balancing all the interests and circumstances involved , can not be regarded as unreasonable or unfair . The appeal will therefore be declared unfounded in both cases .", "The above does not signify that , in unchanged circumstances , camera surveillance will automatically remain justified . When the new situation in which [ the applicant ] finds himself is stabilised , the conclusion must be that , in unchanged circumstances , camera surveillance is no longer called for , and thus must be considered as unreasonable . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG accepted the applicant 's appeal , quashed the decision of DATE and declared well - founded the applicant 's appeals of CARDINAL and DATE .

The detainees are obliged to comply with these orders . \u201d", "In Part CARDINAL of the Explanatory Memorandum to LAW in part b ) on ordering measures , the following is stated :", "\u201c The package of measures at the disposal of the Governor is greater . In the interests of order it can indeed be necessary to give indications to detainees that are less far - reaching in nature than those cited above and therefore do not have to be equipped with extra legal guarantees . The above - cited LAW offers a sufficient basis for taking such measures . \u201d", "The general rules governing the ordering of measures offer an insufficient basis for applying camera surveillance . In this context , it is important to note that camera surveillance is a very far - reaching measure of which it can not be said that this follows more or less from the ( nature of the ) deprivation of liberty . In this light it is understandable that , to the extent that camera surveillance in a cell is allowed , an explicit legal basis is foreseen [ in DATE Regulation ] . It goes too far to extend the cases in which camera surveillance is allowed beyond that explicit legal basis . In view of the above , ORG is of the opinion that , when the Governor took the impugned decisions , the legal basis for imposing and prolonging camera surveillance was lacking . It will therefore declare the appeal founded .

No such assessment appeared to have been made since DATE . In the absence of such an assessment , the President considered that he could no longer assume that the applicant 's situation had not materially changed .

The legal position of a detainee , in particular his right to privacy already subjected to restrictions by the detention , should in this light be balanced against the interests of preventing escape or possible harm to his health in whatever form .", "This balancing of interests should be set off against the knowledge that research has shown that there are different circumstances open to objectification that can be considered as risk moments for suicide . For example , apart from segregation , the first period of detention is indicated as a risk moment , as well as not being allowed to have contacts with codetainees on grounds of restrictions imposed by the investigating judge . It is also of importance that by far not all cases show prior signals that a detainee wants to commit suicide . Literature indicates that suspects or persons convicted of violent and sexual crimes are overrepresented in the suicide statistics , as well as persons having been found guilty or who are suspected of murder or manslaughter and who are facing life imprisonment . The social unrest or stir in the relations of the GPE with other GPE and international organisations caused [ by the offence ] can entail a certain pressure on the detainee that can and may play a role in balancing the interests involved . The threat of possible harm [ to the detainee ] may also come from outside . Then information from ORG can play an important role in the considerations for camera observation .", "The decision [ to place a detainee under camera observation ] is valid for DATE , but can be prolonged by the Governor for periods of the same duration each time . It is conceivable that the camera observation will place a great psychological pressure on the detainee . For this reason , the institution 's medical officer or behavioural expert must see the detainee at least once DATE . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
