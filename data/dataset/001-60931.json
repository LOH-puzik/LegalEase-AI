NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Bjugn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the social services in the municipality of Bjugn contacted the local police after having received reports from PERSON kindergarten indicating that the applicant , who was an assistant at the kindergarten at the time , had sexually abused CARDINAL or more of the children there . Subsequently , a criminal investigation was carried out . On DATE the applicant was interrogated . He denied the accusations . On the same date he was suspended from his post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally indicted with respect to various offences under LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( straffeloven ) concerning the sexual abuse of minors , allegedly committed against CARDINAL children at the kindergarten , and under LAW with respect to one of them . On DATE the indictment was extended to CARDINAL children at the kindergarten and , on DATE , a new indictment was issued involving CARDINAL children . On DATE the indictment was again extended to offences of sexual abuse of CARDINAL named children and an unknown number of children at the kindergarten .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL further persons were indicted for sexual offences in relation to the same matter : the applicant 's wife , CARDINAL employees at the kindergarten and the local sheriff .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above , the applicant spent CARDINAL periods in pre - trial detention \u2013 respectively CARDINAL , DATE and DATE \u2013 a total of DATE . In the course of the investigations , CARDINAL searches were carried out at the applicant 's home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally indicted under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code for having allegedly committed various offences of sexual abuse against CARDINAL kindergarten children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charges against the CARDINAL other accused persons were dropped . They later claimed compensation under ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW ( straffeprosessloven ) . The local sheriff obtained a settlement of ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage ; the CARDINAL others obtained a court order requiring the ORG to pay ORG CARDINAL to each of them . The applicant 's wife obtained , in addition , ORG CARDINAL in compensation for pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's trial took place before FAC ( lagmannsrett ) , sitting with CARDINAL judges and a jury , over a period of DATE , DATE and DATE . After the jury had answered all of the CARDINAL questions relating to the indictment in the negative , the applicant was acquitted by a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently filed a petition with ORG , claiming compensation under ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG , sitting with CARDINAL of the judges who had taken part in the trial and a new judge ( replacing the judge who had presided at the trial , disqualified from sitting in the compensation case ) , held an oral hearing CARDINAL DATE .", "In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered the ORG to award him the entirety of his claim of ORG CARDINAL in compensation for pecuniary damage under Article CARDINAL , according to which provision such \u201c compensation for special or disproportionate damage as a consequence of the criminal prosecution \u201d could be awarded as was \u201c reasonable in the circumstances \u201d . Moreover , under Article CARDINAL , cf . CARDINAL , ORG awarded him ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the prosecution . However , on the basis of an assessment , the relevant parts of which are quoted in ORG ( PERSON ) decision cited below ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , ORG rejected his claim for supplementary compensation under LAW , it not having been shown probable that he did not commit the act which was the basis of the charge . ORG referred to the evidence presented during the trial hearing DATE and DATE and during the oral hearing in the compensation case in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) . He complained that ORG decision contained assumptions of criminal liability and that , consequently , it violated LAW . He requested ORG to quash ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , notified to the applicant by mail on DATE , ORG , considering that the applicant 's appeal concerned ORG application of LAW , rejected the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG first recalled that in its decision reported in GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL , ORG had stated ( at p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c It is the accused who carries the burden of proof that he did not carry out the act . It is sufficient that it is more probable than not . I do not agree with counsel for the defence that the accused has discharged the burden of proof where both alternatives , on the basis of the available evidence , appear to be equally likely . In this assessment the ordinary standards of evidence shall apply and the requirements in respect of the strength of the evidence must then to some extent be adapted to the possibilities for the accused to show that he did not carry out the act . Given the manner in which the provision has been formulated the situation may easily arise that an acquittal is not sufficient to justify a compensation claim when the accused is unable to discharge this burden of proof . I should like to stress that the refusal of a compensation claim does not entail that the previous acquittal is undermined or that the acquittal is open to doubt . The compensation case must be determined on an independent basis and the rules on evidence applying in such compensation cases do not differ from those which apply to ordinary compensation claims . The legislator has as a starting point opted for a solution whereby the financial burden caused by the institution of criminal proceedings , which are discontinued or which end with an acquittal , must be borne by the accused unless he is able to show that it is probable that he did not commit the act . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Appeals Selection Committee further recalled that in the above case ORG considered the relationship between the conditions for compensation under LAW and the case - law of ORG , in particular the GPE v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) . ORG concluded that the rules in LAW were not , as such , contrary to LAW . ORG affirmed that it would base itself on this view in its assessment of the present case . It further recalled that , in the DATE decision , ORG had expressed the following view on the PERSON judgment :", "\u201c [ In this case ] decisive importance was attached to the reasoning in the particular case for rejecting the compensation claim . If in the reasoning for refusing compensation doubt is voiced as to whether the acquittal was correct or if the reasoning contains assumptions about criminal liability , then the relationship to LAW would be problematic . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Then ORG went on to state :", "\u201c As pointed out by the prosecution in its reply to the appeal , ORG had to justify why it considered that the conditions for making an award for compensation under LAW had not been fulfilled . ORG must determine whether the reasoning of ORG conflicted with the requirements of LAW .", "The ORG refers to the fact that the reasoning must be formulated in the light of the conditions for compensation as mentioned above . It is further clear that ORG ... was aware of the rules in LAW , ORG PERSON judgment and the DATE decision of ORG . In its decision concerning compensation under LAW , ORG , after having quoted the provision , specifies the subject - matter of the case as follows .", "' Following the High Court 's acquittal , Mr PERSON is not guilty under the criminal law . This question has not been submitted to ORG which will not deal with it . The present case is a compensation claim brought by PERSON . The question is whether he , in view of the rules of evidence under the law of compensation , is able to show that he did not carry out the acts which were referred to in the indictment . '", "The ORG points to the fact that here the High Court clearly specifies that Mr ORG is not liable under the criminal law . Furthermore it is specified that the compensation claim must be determined on the basis of the rules of evidence applying under the law on compensation . ORG then concludes , against the background of the evidence adduced , that considering the case as a whole , PERSON PERSON ' has not shown it to be probable that he did not carry out the acts which grounded the charge . '", "Moreover , in the concluding remarks , it is stated :", "' When ORG , considering the case as a whole , reached the conclusion that Mr PERSON had not discharged his burden of proof , account was also taken of the fact that the requirements as to the strength of the evidence must to a certain extent be adapted to the possibility which he has for showing that he [ Mr NORP ] did not commit the acts .... Nevertheless , in the assessment , it is the usual rules on evidence which should apply .... '", "In support of his submission that ORG reasoning contains assumptions about criminal liability , he points to certain intermediate passages in which the ORG states :", "' Medical experts have in the light of their investigations reached conclusions which in practice imply a very high degree of probability that the CARDINAL children referred to in the indictment have been exposed to sexual abuse . The medical experts have discounted the possibility of self - inflicted injuries , that the injuries are caused by pathological conditions or conditions at variance from the norm . As pointed out by the prosecution , the children themselves gave statements to their parents , during the judicial examinations and to a psychologist , about abuse by PERSON . Through the video recording of the judicial examinations of the children , the ORG has been able to see how the children expressed themselves .", "The ORG has been able to apprise itself of how the children during the examinations changed their behaviour when presented with questions of sexual abuse .", "Nor does the following fact make it less likely that he carried out the acts for which he was charged : the children markedly changed their behaviour , inter alia , in the form of bedwetting , refusing or expressing fear about going to the kindergarten , several children had a sore crotch , sore abdomen and , on CARDINAL or several occasions , blood on their underwear , circumstances which essentially occurred after PERSON NORP started to work at the kindergarten and which diminished after his departure .", "The High Court further finds it established that at the kindergarten it was possible to perpetrate such abuse without it being revealed either from a technical or practical point of view .", "In the aftermath , several of the employees at the kindergarten have pointed to a few surprising situations : for instance the governor 's eyewitness evidence , her perception of the situation , when she came over to Mr NORP while he was washing a child in the crotch under peculiar circumstances .", "ORG does not find any reason to go further into the discussion about the possibility of paedophilia . It is not only the so - called real paedophiles who commit abuse against children . Nor can a diagnosis which excludes paedophilia be deemed accurate , or notional paedophilia be defined precisely . '", "Having regard to the fact that the High Court clearly specified that its assessment was confined to the compensation case which was to be determined on the basis of the rules of evidence applying in such cases , ORG finds that ORG s reasoning does not go further than is necessary to carry out a careful examination of the compensation claim and that it does not entail any infringement of the presumption of innocence laid down in the Convention . The ORG once more emphasises that a refusal to award compensation under LAW does not imply that the previous acquittal is being undermined .", "In the light of the foregoing , the appeal must be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the NORP jury system , when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion , and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant 's guilt was not unanimous . The criminal system knows CARDINAL conclusions in a criminal case \u2013 guilt or acquittal ( see Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . There is no third alternative , which was known in some other NORP countries , where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence for establishing guilt .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW provide for compensation where a person has been acquitted , or the prosecution discontinued . The provisions read as follows :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL : If a person charged is acquitted or the prosecution against him is discontinued , he may claim compensation from the ORG for any damage that he has suffered through the prosecution if it is shown to be probable that he did not carry out the act that formed the basis for the charge . If a sentence of imprisonment or other custodial sanction has already been served , any damage resulting from this shall be compensated without regard to what has been shown to be probable .", "Compensation shall not be awarded when the person charged , by making a confession or otherwise , has wilfully instigated the prosecution or the conviction .", "If he has otherwise contributed to the damage by negligence , the compensation may be reduced or dispensed with entirely .", "Article CARDINAL : Even if the conditions prescribed in Article CARDINAL are not fulfilled , the court may award the person charged compensation for special or disproportionate damage as a consequence of the criminal prosecution whenever this appears to be reasonable in the circumstances .", "Article CARDINAL : If the conditions relating to compensation prescribed in ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL are fulfilled , the court may , when special reasons so indicate , award the person charged a suitable amount as redress for the indignity or other damage of a noneconomic nature that he has suffered as a result of the prosecution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , there are certain formal conditions set out in Article CARDINAL for the submission and examination of a compensation claim made under ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL :", "\u201c Any claim for compensation or redress must be submitted not DATE after the person charged has been informed of the decision that finally concludes the case . The provisions of LAW , first paragraph , shall apply correspondingly .", "If the case has been concluded without any judicial trial of the evidence relating to the issue of guilt , the claim shall be submitted to a court of summary jurisdiction .", "Otherwise the claim shall be submitted to the court that shall conduct or has last conducted any such trial . If the claim is submitted to ORG or ORG , but has not been decided when an appeal against the assessment of evidence in relation to the issue of guilt proceeds to an appeal hearing , ORG shall also decide the question of compensation . On the hearing of the claim the court shall as far as possible sit with the same judges who decided the criminal case . In ORG lay judges or the selected jurors who join the court pursuant to LAW shall not take part unless the decision is made at the same court sitting as that at which judgement is pronounced in the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Compensation after acquittal or a discontinued prosecution is not automatic and is not granted unless the conditions in the above - cited ORG are met .", "CARDINAL . When compensation is granted to persons considered innocent as they have been acquitted or the prosecution against them has been discontinued , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL are the general provisions and , de facto , the main provisions providing for compensation . In the present case the applicant was awarded compensation both under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "In addition the applicant requested compensation under the special provisions of LAW , under which the ORG may be liable to pay compensation even in the absence of any proof of negligence or fault on the part of the authorities . The liability of the ORG to pay compensation is strict where it has been shown to be probable that the claimant did not carry out the act of which he or she was charged . In the assessment of the latter , none of the other constitutive elements of a criminal offence , such as criminal intent , is in issue .", "CARDINAL . According to the case - law of ORG , the evidentiary standard applying with respect to liability to pay compensation under LAW differs from that applying to criminal liability . Whereas in criminal proceedings it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the incriminated act , in compensation proceedings it is for the claimant to show that , on the balance of probabilities , it was PERCENT probable that he or she did not carry out the act grounding the charge . The requirement of proof in compensation cases may nevertheless be adjusted ( i.e. to PERCENT ) in the light of the claimant 's ability to adduce evidence , especially where a long time has elapsed since the alleged criminal act . The competent court has to make a new assessment , independently of the acquittal , of all the evidence available in order to establish whether it is probable that the claimant did not carry out the act which formed the basis of the charge .", "CARDINAL . It is not a requirement for obtaining compensation that the acquitted claimant adduce new evidence . The compensation claim may thus be made with reference to the evidence made available in the criminal proceedings or obtained by the court of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ) made a recommendation to ORG that ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW be amended in a number of respects , including the abolition of the condition whereby the claimant must prove that on the balance of probabilities he or she did not carry out the act giving rise to the charge . Nevertheless , the ORG was of the view that the provisions in force are not inconsistent with GPE 's obligations under LAW , as interpreted by ORG in its case - law ( see PERSON GPE ORG ) , PERSON i anledning straffeforf\u00f8lgning ( Compensation in connection with ORG ) , DATE : CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL ) . On DATE a Government PERSON was presented to ORG ( Ot.prp.nr.CARDINAL , DATE ) , proposing inter alia the repeal of this condition ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
