The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently serving a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was serving his sentence in FAC , took a walk together with other detainees . When he entered the accommodation block , CARDINAL prison guards searched him in the stairwell of the building . According to the applicant he was requested to lower his trousers and underpants twice and lift his sexual organ . A guard felt his underpants to find out whether any tobacco products had been hidden therein . According to the applicant he was in the sight of other detainees , since the door to the stairwell where the search was carried out had a transparent window . Another door leading from the stairwell to a corridor of the accommodation block also had a transparent window and detainees or female prison officers could have seen him through it or entered the stairwell at any time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed from the prison administration CARDINAL kroons ( EEK ) ( corresponding to MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the non - pecuniary damages he had allegedly sustained . He named CARDINAL of the detainees who had been behind him when he had entered the building and had been searched .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison administration rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . Relying on the statements of CARDINAL of the prison guards involved , the administration found that the search had been conducted in private and not in the sight of other detainees . According to the prison guard \u2019s written statements , the detainees had entered the stairwell CARDINAL by CARDINAL . CARDINAL guard had searched their jackets and the other one had searched the detainees . In the event that they suspected a detainee , they had closed the door in order to create a private space and the detainee in question had been requested to lower his trousers .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It found reliable the statements of the prison guard , according to whom the applicant \u2019s privacy had been respected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . At ORG hearing he submitted that the windows of the doors to the stairwell had measured QUANTITY and that DATE after his complaint to ORG they had been covered by metal sheets to prevent other detainees from seeing the searches .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It established that the search had lasted for TIME at most and noted that the applicant had not been sure whether any other detainees had been in the stairwell . He had been unable to explain from where exactly the detainees named by him had seen his search . ORG concluded that his privacy had not been violated . It further found that in order to effectively manage a large number of detainees , the prison also had to have the possibility of carrying out a body search of a detainee , when necessary , in a location other than a private room designated for that purpose . In order to conduct such a search it was sufficient that the authorities had a suspicion that a detainee re - entering the building after a walk had hidden cigarettes \u2013 which were prohibited in prison DATE in his underwear .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It upheld ORG finding that the applicant \u2019s privacy had not been infringed and his dignity had not been diminished . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges delivered a separate opinion . He considered that it was not decisive whether the third persons had in fact seen the detainee \u2019s body search . It could not be presumed that a person who was being searched was able to establish at the same time whether the search had been seen , what exactly had been seen and by whom . When a body search was carried out in a situation and location where it was not guaranteed that third persons would not see the person \u2019s nudity , the person concerned was bound to feel that his privacy had not been respected and that other persons might have seen the procedure being performed . Such a situation damaged the person \u2019s dignity and could cause feelings of insecurity , anguish and degradation .", "CARDINAL . According to information provided by the ORG , the applicant had CARDINAL reprimands on record at the time of the search in question , including for unauthorised possession of a cigarette . From the date of the events at issue until DATE , CARDINAL further disciplinary punishments had been imposed on him , primarily for violations related to the possession of unauthorised items , mainly cigarettes ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
