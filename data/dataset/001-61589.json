The detention order was based on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . As to the grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention , the prosecution first relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he had been charged . They also considered that the offence in question represented a serious danger to society ( wysoki stopie\u0144 spo\u0142ecznego niebezpiecze\u0144stwa czynu ) and considered that there was a risk that the applicant might induce witnesses to give false testimony or obstruct the criminal proceedings against him by other unlawful means .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an application made by ORG , the FAC ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he had been charged and the serious nature of that offence . The court also found that , in the light of the material collected in the investigation , there was a high risk that the applicant would obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings . Finally , the court held that the interests of the investigation , such as the need to obtain and secure evidence , militated in favour of keeping him in custody .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG ( Prokurator Wojew\u00f3dzki ) took over the investigation from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG PERSON ) , on an application made by ORG , prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , finding that it was necessary because there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence . Furthermore , the court found that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings militated against releasing him since , at the current stage of the investigation , it was necessary to hear evidence from all the injured parties , to carry out confrontations between witnesses and defendants and to lay further charges of dealing in stolen goods against several other persons who had not to date been involved in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the subsequent application from ORG , the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the serious offence with which he had been charged . The court also stressed that the applicant should be kept in custody in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , especially as the charges originally laid against the suspects needed to be supplemented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG completed the investigation and , on DATE , lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was indicted on several counts of aggravated fraud . The bill of indictment comprised charges against CARDINAL co - defendants . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL expert witnesses and ORG lay witnesses , and to consider CARDINAL pieces of documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was to be held on DATE . Yet it was eventually cancelled because CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , who had already been released under police supervision , was absent .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , DATE and DATE , ORG listed CARDINAL hearings for various dates but cancelled all of them because several of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants who had already been released under police supervision had repeatedly failed to appear before it . They had submitted medical certificates to the effect that they could not participate in the trial because of their poor health and asked the court to adjourn the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . During that time the applicant made numerous unsuccessful applications for release on bail or under police supervision . He submitted that even though his detention pending trial had exceeded any reasonable limits , not a single hearing on the merits had so far been held . He also asked ORG to order , under LAW of LAW , that the charges against the released co - defendants be severed from the case so as to ensure that the trial proceeded without any further impediment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG had released PERSON , one of the CARDINAL co - defendants , under police supervision . From then on , only the applicant and CARDINAL other co - defendants ( PERSON and PERSON ) were still kept in detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a session in camera at which ORG was present . It made an application under LAW to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) , asking it to prolong the applicant \u2019s and his CARDINAL co - defendants\u2019 detention for DATE . That application was prepared in view of the fact that on DATE the amendments to LAW were to take effect . The new provisions set statutory time - limits for detention pending trial and , in consequence , in all cases where detention had already exceeded , or was about to exceed , the relevant terms , the courts had either to release the person concerned or to ask ORG to prolong his detention ( see also \u201c B. Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "The reasons for ORG application read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c [ In respect of the applicant and CARDINAL other co - accused ] the [ maximum ] time - limits for detention on remand laid down in LAW of LAW have expired and DATE is the deadline for lodging a request for further prolongation of their detention on remand .", "During the period following the date on which the bill of indictment was lodged with this court , it scheduled numerous hearings ; however , the trial has not yet began as this court , for valid reasons [ , such as the fact that the defendants , one after another , had failed to appear before us , ] could not proceed with the trial . In this connection , this court has , in accordance with the suggestion of ORG , considered whether it would be sensible to sever the charges laid against the co - defendants concerned , pursuant to LAW . Yet , as all the charges in the present case are interrelated , this court finds that there is no just cause to proceed in this way .", "The detained defendants have repeatedly asked this court to lift or vary the preventive measure imposed on them . This court has dismissed their applications and in doing so it has had [ particular ] regard to the serious nature of the offences , the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed and , more particularly , to the conduct of the defendants during the investigation , that is to say [ the fact that they had had to be ] searched for by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice and that there had been problems in the course of their arrest [ which had justified the risk that ] they might go into hiding . The [ ORG , which has dealt with the GPE appeals [ against decisions refusing to release them ] , expressed the same opinion .", "That being so , and there being other serious obstacles [ to the proper course of the trial ] the present application for the GPE detention to be prolonged must be submitted to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The application was posted to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting in camera as FAC , after obtaining oral comments from ORG ( Prokurator PERSON ) , who had been summoned to the session and represented the prosecution , dealt with , and granted , the application . ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s and his co - defendants\u2019 detention \u201c from DATE to DATE \u201d . The defendants were not present . Nor were they legally represented since , under NORP law as it stood at that time , defendants or their counsel were not entitled to participate in court sessions held in camera ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision contained exhaustive reasons , the relevant part of which may be summarised as follows :", "ORG , noting that the application was filed on DATE but posted as late as DATE , first considered what was the proper date of \u201c lodging \u201d such an application for the purposes of LAW .", "ORG next observed that , depending on the answer to this question , it would have to determine the legal consequences of a potential failure on the part of ORG to respect the rule laid down in DATE a ) LAW of DATE , which stated that in cases where no request for a further prolongation of detention on remand had been \u201c lodged \u201d , the detention on remand had to be lifted and the person concerned released not later than on DATE .", "ORG considered that it should also deal with the question of whether it was competent to rule on the application if it had been \u201c lodged \u201d after the expiry of the term referred to in LAW ( a ) of LAW of DATE , i.e. after DATE .", "Referring to the first question , ORG held that the proper date of \u201c lodging \u201d an application under LAW of LAW had to be deemed either the date of posting the request or the date of submitting it to the registry of ORG since to hold otherwise would mean leaving a detainee without any guarantee that ORG was properly supervising his detention . Moreover , if the requesting court was not bound by any time - limits for submitting its application , detention , the most severe among the preventive measures , might continue for an unspecified and unlimited time outside ORG supervision . In consequence , an application under LAW of LAW , a mere \u201c proposal \u201d to continue detention , would , for all practical purposes , transform into a basis for continuing detention . Clearly , that was not the intention of the legislator .", "ORG therefore concluded that since in the applicant \u2019s case no application for a further prolongation of his detention was \u201c lodged \u201d before DATE , the applicant \u2019s ( and his co - defendants\u2019 ) detention from that date to the date of its present decision lacked any legal basis and was , accordingly , unlawful .", "It went on to find that it was , nevertheless , competent to deal with the application lodged outside the relevant date . It considered that a lower court \u2019s obligation to release a detainee in case of its failure properly to lodge an application under LAW of LAW was CARDINAL thing , but its right to make such an application at any time was another . In ORG opinion , the application in question should be deemed a \u201c fresh application \u201d and be examined as such .", "It considered that further prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary . In essence , it repeated the arguments adduced by ORG and stressed the complexity of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made another application under LAW of LAW . It asked ORG to prolong the applicant \u2019s , PERSON \u2019s and ORG detention until DATE . ORG submitted that regardless of its consistent efforts to proceed with the trial , it could not begin the main hearing because several released co - accused had repeatedly failed to appear before it . However , the applicant had to be kept in custody since there was still a risk that he might go into hiding because at the initial stage of the proceedings he had had to be searched for by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice and , likewise his CARDINAL detained co - defendants , had obstructed his arrest . Finally , the court relied on the complexity of the case and the fact that evidence gathered in the investigation sufficiently supported the charges laid against him .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE and DATE , the applicant repeatedly complained to ORG , ORG , ORG , the Minister of ORG and the Ombudsman ( PERSON ) that , from DATE , he had been kept in detention without any legal basis . He also asked for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting in camera as FAC , after obtaining oral comments from ORG , prolonged the applicant \u2019s , PERSON \u2019s and ORG detention pending trial until DATE . ORG fully upheld the arguments adduced by ORG in its application . However , it expressed the opinion that , for the sake of the proper conduct of the trial , the charges against the released co - defendants should be severed from the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the first hearing . It did not deal with the merits of the case but ordered that the charges against CARDINAL of the released co - defendants be severed from the case and adjourned the trial until DATE . The applicant asked for release . The court refused , holding that the reasons for his continued detention , as cited in ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , were still valid .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant sent numerous petitions , letters and applications to , inter alia , the Minister of ORG , ORG , the ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . He complained about the unlawfulness and length of his detention , the slow conduct of his trial and asked the authorities to release him and to institute criminal proceedings against the persons who had kept him in unlawful custody . He invoked LAW , submitting that he had no remedy whereby he could challenge the lawfulness of his detention from DATE and obtain release . He also relied on LAW and maintained that his right to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial was not respected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an application for release to ORG . He asserted that there was no risk of his going into hiding . He admitted that it was true that , DATE previously and before he had been detained , he had used a false identity card . However that single fact could not justify holding him in custody for such a long time . At that point , he added , his detention had already exceeded DATE . The applicant further complained that there had been an exceptional delay in the proceedings which , in his opinion , had resulted solely from the fact that ORG had failed to ensure the presence of the released co - defendants at the trial . He also maintained that , following his arrest , there had been no single attempt on his part to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings . In his view , there was no evidence whatsoever to demonstrate that , had he been released , he would have evaded justice or any sentence that might be imposed .", "CARDINAL . That application was dismissed on DATE . ORG repeated the reasons previously given to justify the applicant \u2019s detention . It was stressed that he should be kept in detention to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . Moreover , the court considered that the applicant had failed to adduce any arguments militating in favour of his release . On DATE the court cancelled a hearing since one of the released co - defendants had failed to appear before it and submitted a medical certificate stating that he was ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the first hearing on the merits . Since some of the co - defendants decided not to give any oral evidence at the trial stage , the court read out the record of evidence given by them in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was to be held on DATE but was cancelled because CARDINAL of the released co - defendants had submitted a medical certificate stating that he was ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the Minister of ORG \u2019s request , submitted to the Ministry a report on the progress of the proceedings . Further similar reports were submitted on DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing and had the record of evidence taken from other CARDINAL co - defendants in the investigation read out . The court then started to hear witnesses . After hearing evidence from CARDINAL of them , it adjourned the trial in order to hear CARDINAL other witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant had again filed several petitions with the ORG , the Minister of ORG and ORG ) of ORG . He complained that the overall period of his detention had meanwhile amounted to DATE but the determination of the charges against him had merely begun . He asked the authorities concerned to react , in an appropriate manner , to the fact that he had been unlawfully detained in DATE , a fact that had already been confirmed by the highest national court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a further application for release which had been filed by the applicant on an unknown date . The court held that all the legal and factual grounds previously given for his detention were still valid . It also considered that since there were no circumstances justifying release , as listed in LAW , his detention should continue to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing . It heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses and adjourned the trial until DATE because other witnesses had not appeared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a fresh , and third , application under LAW of LAW to ORG , asking for the applicant \u2019s , PERSON \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s detention to be prolonged until DATE . It stressed that it had eventually been able to begin the trial . It considered that , given that evidence had already been taken from all the co - defendants , it could not be said that the court had not handled the case efficiently . While it was true that the process of obtaining evidence had not come to an end , that was not due to any fault on the part of the trial court but had arisen out of other factors . There were still valid reasons justifying the GPE continued detention , notably the well - founded suspicion that they had committed the offences with which they had been charged and the risk that they might abscond or go into hiding .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE the applicant filed numerous petitions with the Minister of ORG , ORG and ORG , submitting that his constitutional right to personal liberty , as well as his rights secured by LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , had been violated . He maintained that he had spent DATE in detention because the trial court had \u2013 wrongly \u2013 concluded that there was a risk of his absconding even though , after his arrest , there had never been a single basis for such a finding . Whatever his arguments , the court had never believed him and never given him a chance to prove that his release would not have obstructed the course of the trial . In fact , the applicant claimed , the proper conduct of the proceedings had constantly been impeded by his CARDINAL released co - defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting in camera as FAC , after obtaining oral comments from ORG , prolonged the applicant \u2019s , PERSON \u2019s and ORG detention until DATE . ORG fully upheld the reasons given by ORG to justify its application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing but the trial was again adjourned since , in the applicant \u2019s words , \u201c one of the defence counsel [ had ] left the courtroom \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court released the applicant , PERSON and PERSON under police supervision . In its decision , the court conceded that the period of DATE that the applicant had spent in detention had been nearly as long as the anticipated penalty and that , in consequence , his continued detention would amount to serving a sentence of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings . At the hearings held on DATE and DATE the court heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses . On DATE the court heard CARDINAL witnesses . The applicant twice failed to appear before the court .", "CARDINAL . Further hearings were held on DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL May and DATE .
