ORG The incident on DATE was reported to the PERSON police ( PERSON ) DATE , first by a neighbour at the applicant \u2019s request and then by the applicant himself . According to him , his wife and step - daughter - who had TIME called him a \" convict \" ( PERSON ) - attacked him at TIME during a quarrel . In particular , he claimed that his wife had inflicted several head wounds with a paper - knife and gashed his forehead close to his eyebrow . He had needed treatment by a doctor .", "He admitted that he had pushed his wife at the time and had tried unsuccessfully to slap his step - daughter in the face .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the police questioned the applicant \u2019s wife as a \" suspect \" ( PERSON ) and his step - daughter , PERSON , as a \" person involved \" ( Beteiligte ) .", "Mrs. PERSON stated that she had been slapped in the face and beaten by her husband , who had grabbed her daughter by the hair to stop her running away ; both of them had then fought back . She had been holding a paper - knife and had , she said , probably struck him with it , but neither she nor her daughter had deliberately caused him any wounds to the head or face .", "Miss PERSON admitted having called her step - father a \" convict \" that TIME , and said that he had responded by slapping her in the face , but without injuring her . During the quarrel at TIME , he had hit her mother several times , once in the face . When she herself had tried to escape , he had grabbed her by the hair and scratched her just below the right eye . He had also grabbed her mother by the hair and by the scruff of the neck . The CARDINAL women had therefore fought back , and she had pulled her step - father \u2019s hair but had not hit him ; she had not seen her mother strike him with the paper - knife . Her step - father \u2019s forehead was bleeding , but she had not seen a wound on the back of his head . She added that a doctor she had consulted had issued a certificate in respect of her own injury .", "CARDINAL .

He himself had allegedly ( angeblich ) hit his step - daughter in the face and scratched her slightly just below the right eye .", "Under the heading \" Evidence \" , the report referred to the statement by the above - mentioned neighbour of the PERSON to the effect that the applicant , whose face was covered in blood , had asked her to alert the police . The applicant had appeared in person at the police station TIME later holding a paper - knife ; he had explained that his wife had struck him on the head with it several times . Since Mr. PERSON seemed to need first aid , the officer on duty had suggested that he should see a doctor .", "The police went on to say that they had already had to intervene in several quarrels in the household . They added that the CARDINAL protagonists had given conflicting accounts of the incident on DATE . Miss PERSON , who had been questioned as an informant ( ORG ) , had clearly taken her mother \u2019s side .", "The report indicated that the applicant \u2019s injuries had been described as \" slight \" by the doctor .", "Under the heading \" Information given by the suspects \" , the police summarised Mr. and Mrs. PERSON \u2019s statements .", "The report was accompanied by several documents , including the statements made by the applicant , his wife and his step - daughter and the certificate issued by the doctor who had examined Miss PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG The second incident , which took place on DATE , was reported to the PERSON police on DATE by Mrs. PERSON . She stated that her husband , who was slightly drunk , had kicked her right arm during a quarrel , causing her acute pain .

ORG The police took a statement from Mr. PERSON on DATE . He denied injuring his wife on DATE , saying that her hand had already been bandaged when he had come home . She had actually attempted to hit him on the head with a hairbrush , but had missed and collided with the stair - rail instead . This might have aggravated the thumb injury , but the accusation she had made against him was a complete fabrication .", "The applicant confirmed that divorce proceedings had been pending for some time .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the PERSON police sent ORG a report \" concerning PERSON , suspected of causing grievous bodily harm \" . This stated that the couple had had a quarrel on DATE , during which Mr. PERSON had kicked his wife \u2019s right arm . It went on to summarise Mrs. PERSON \u2019s and her husband \u2019s statements , which were appended .", "CARDINAL . ORG On an application from ORG , ORG decided on DATE to open an investigation against the applicant in respect of the CARDINAL incidents . After separating the proceedings against Mrs. Unterpertinger in respect of the first incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG acquitted her on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mrs. PERSON appeared before a judge at GPE , who told her that , as the wife of the accused ( PERSON ) , she was entitled to refuse to give evidence . In fact , LAW provides : \" members of the accused \u2019s family ... shall not be required to give evidence \" .", "She replied that she nonetheless wished to do so , and gave an account of the facts in dispute , summarising what she had already told the police and disputing her husband \u2019s version of the incident on DATE .", "Suspected of causing actual bodily harm contrary to Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , the applicant was questioned on DATE by a judge of ORG . He admitted slapping his wife in the face on DATE . According to him , he had pulled Miss PERSON \u2019s hair in order to escape the CARDINAL women \u2019s attacks and might in so doing have injured her close to her eye ; he had also struck her in the face . As regards the second incident , he repeated what he had already said ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; he also stated that he had not seen his wife come into contact with the stair - rail and added that he was not sufficiently agile to have been able to kick her thumb .", "CARDINAL . ORG The case was heard on DATE by a judge of ORG ( PERSON ) , sitting alone .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the record of the hearing , the applicant pleaded not guilty . He admitted that he had hit his step - daughter on the head , but not that he had injured her . Nor had he broken his wife \u2019s thumb by kicking it ; he had no idea where she had broken it .", "CARDINAL . ORG then called Mrs. PERSON and PERSON . On being told by the court of their right to refuse to give evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , they replied that they wished to avail themselves of that right . The court was consequently unable to examine them or to read out the record of Mrs. PERSON \u2019s interview with the judge at PERSON ( Article CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "At the request of ORG , however , the documents it had mentioned in its application for leave to prosecute ( PERSON ) , including the police reports , the accused \u2019s criminal record and CARDINAL files relating to previous convictions of his , were read out . These documents thus included the various statements made to the police : in NORP judicial practice these had to be regarded as documents for the purposes of DATE ) of LAW ( see in particular judgment of DATE of ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof , PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ; this meant that they had to be read out , unless the parties agreed that they should not be .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the end of the hearing , ORG found the applicant guilty of having committed , on DATE , the offence ( PERSON ) of causing actual bodily harm ( Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) to his step - daughter and , on DATE , the offence of causing grievous bodily harm ( schwere ORG , PERSON ) and PERSON ) of LAW ) to his wife . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "Referring to the \" inquiries made \" and to the defence ( ORG ) put forward by Mr. PERSON , the court held that the following facts had been established .", "During the quarrel on DATE , the applicant had hit his wife several times and had struck his step - daughter in the face , bruising her between the eye and nose and scratching her close to her right eye . His account could not be believed : he had admitted to the judge at GPE that he had struck Miss PERSON in the face and he had not ruled out the possibility that this might have caused the scratch . The injuries were slight , but his conduct showed that his actions had been deliberate .", "On DATE , Mr. PERSON had broken his wife \u2019s right thumb by kicking her . Again , his defence did not stand up to examination . In addition , his record showed that he was quite capable of behaving in this way . He and his wife had had frequent quarrels , often ending in assault .", "The court pointed out that Mrs. Unterpertinger - who in the meantime had divorced her husband - and her daughter had refused to give evidence at the trial . It nonetheless found their statements to the police \" sufficiently clear and specific to support a conviction \" ; \" there [ could be ] no doubt as to the truth of these statements \" . In this instance too , the applicant had acted deliberately .", "The court found no mitigating circumstances ; on the contrary , it saw the applicant \u2019s criminal record as an aggravating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON appealed on DATE .", "He argued that the judgment of DATE was null and void ( Article CARDINAL ) of LAW ) : in spite of LAW , his former wife and step - daughter , whose statements to the police had formed the sole basis of his conviction , had not been informed at the outset that they were entitled to refuse to give evidence , and had thus been unable to avail themselves of this right .", "Furthermore , ORG had not taken sufficient account of certain circumstances which made the credibility of Mrs. PERSON and her daughter doubtful . In this connection , the applicant requested that evidence should be taken from several witnesses , including CARDINAL doctors , a police officer , a neighbour and his own mother , step - daughter and former wife .", "Finally , he emphasised that in the past he had always admitted the offences with which he had been charged - as was clear from the files on the earlier proceedings . In this instance , however , he had acted in self - defence during the first incident and with no intention of injuring his step - daughter - if indeed he really had injured her . ORG had disregarded his version of the events of DATE . As for the incident of CARDINAL September CARDINAL , he repeated that his former wife had been having trouble with her right thumb even before that date , as he had mentioned when he was first questioned . He further claimed that he himself had been suffering from a knee injury which would have prevented him from kicking hard enough to break his wife \u2019s thumb . He requested that these points should be investigated further and , in particular , that evidence should be taken from a number of people and an expert opinion ( PERSON ) obtained .", "In conclusion , Mr. PERSON asked ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) to quash the conviction of DATE and acquit him . Failing this , he asked it to review his sentence in the light of the degree of his guilt .", "CARDINAL . ORG sat on DATE .", "Counsel for the applicant submitted the grounds of appeal and requested , inter alia , that additional witnesses be called by the court . He added that the fact that his client was not allowed to put questions concerning the statements made to the police by the prosecution witnesses contravened LAW . The prosecution sought to have the appeal dismissed .", "Thereupon , the court decided to re - examine the evidence submitted to the court of first instance and to supplement it ( LOC ) by having the file on the divorce proceedings read out and hearing testimony from the wife of Mr. PERSON \u2019s brother . She was unable to say whether the applicant \u2019s former wife had had a bandage on her hand in the DATE or DATE . The applicant waived his right to cross - examine her .", "The court had the documents in the file on the case read out and put several questions to Mr. PERSON , in particular about his knee injury . According to him , he was asked to walk up and down so that the judges could form an idea of his condition .", "The court refused to admit the remaining evidence proffered , as to part , on the ground that the circumstances to which it related were of no importance and , as to the rest , because the applicant had not specified the matters he wished to be investigated further .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal immediately after the hearing on DATE .", "With regard to the ground of nullity on which he had relied ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it noted , on the basis of ORG case - law , that a lawful refusal to give evidence did not prevent the court from having read out witnesses\u2019 statements which had been made to the police ( PERSON ) and not during the judicial proceedings proper . It added that ORG had ruled that the courts were indeed obliged to have such statements read out and to weigh them as evidence .", "Otherwise , ORG was of the opinion that the evidence it had heard confirmed the findings of ORG . The ORG statements to the police were plausible and credible ; their account of the incident was logically coherent . The applicant \u2019s previous convictions showed that conduct like that of which he was accused was by no means alien to his nature . Moreover , he had given the police and the investigating judge conflicting versions of what had happened on DATE . His sister - in - law , who had been called as a witness , had been unable to give any information in this regard . As for his claim that he was not sufficiently agile to have been able to break his wife \u2019s thumb with a kick , this did not stand up to examination either .", "Except for his sister - in - law , it was unnecessary to hear the witnesses the applicant had sought to have called , since he had referred to them in connection with matters that were either of no importance or else extremely vague .", "Consequently , Mr. PERSON \u2019s conviction on the CARDINAL counts against him was justified ; he had not been acting in self - defence on DATE . The sentence imposed was consistent with the degree of his guilt ( schuldangemessen ) .", "CARDINAL .
