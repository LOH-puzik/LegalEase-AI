The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , at the relevant time a judge of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , was convicted of abuse of office for having exploited a certain Mr I. as a worker on the renovation of his father \u2019s house under the following circumstances . In DATE the applicant , having sentenced I. to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for disorderly conduct , had the site manager for the house renovation , PERSON . , check I. out of the police detention facility ( \u201c the facility \u201d ) where the latter was serving his sentence and take him to the construction site where he was to work under PERSON . \u2019s direction . Then , in DATE , a police officer , PERSON , conspired with the applicant in drawing up a report falsely accusing PERSON of another episode of disorderly conduct . PERSON fabricated written statements by false witnesses , GPE and GPE , incriminating ORG , and submitted the file to the applicant . Knowing that PERSON was innocent and the report was false , the applicant convicted PERSON and sentenced him to another CARDINAL days\u2019 detention . The same scheme was used to exploit NORP on the construction site .", "CARDINAL . On DATE officers of ORG discovered NORP on the construction site in LOC . \u2019s company .", "CARDINAL . According to the transcript of his statement dated DATE , which was also video - recorded , PERSON . stated that the applicant had employed him to work on his father \u2019s house , that in DATE ORG had worked on the site on terms he had negotiated with the applicant and that in DATE had worked while serving his DATE sentence . The applicant had instructed PERSON . to collect ORG from the detention facility , so he had done so . The statement was signed by ORG . on the first and second pages , where his rights as a witness were explained . The statement consists of CARDINAL more type - written pages containing the transcript of the interview but is not signed by PERSON . at the end . It contains a note by the investigator to the effect that PERSON . did not sign because he failed to appear when summoned by the investigator . The file contains a report of DATE , signed by PERSON . , to the effect that he had watched the video recording of his interview and had no comment to make .", "CARDINAL . On DATE I. was interviewed by the investigator . He stated that around DATE ( sic ) DATE he had been sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for disobeying the orders of a police officer . While serving his sentence he had worked on the construction of a house belonging to the applicant , under the direction of Sh . After his release , he had agreed to work for the applicant in return for payment and had carried out construction work for him in DATE and DATE . He had then stopped working for the applicant . On DATE he had been taken from his home by police officers , who had told him that the applicant had accused him of stealing some cables from the building site . He had been taken to the office of the applicant , who had told him that since he refused to work for money , he would have to work for free . As he had refused to work for free , the applicant had responded that then he would rot in a cell , and had given him a DATE sentence . While he had been serving his sentence , PERSON . had taken him out of the detention facility several times and he had worked on the applicant \u2019s construction site : he had refused to build a fence and had done some other work on the site . He had not been remunerated . The applicant had visited the site once and had seen him working but they had not spoken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE I. made a notarised statement to the effect that his statement incriminating the applicant had been given \u201c under the influence of psychological violence and trickery \u201d ( \u0437 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443 ) and that in fact he had worked willingly and for remuneration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE I. was again interviewed by the investigator . The interview was video - recorded . He largely confirmed the tenor of his statement of DATE and denied knowingly signing the notarised statement repudiating it . In addition to repeating various elements of his statement of DATE , he said that although the house where he had worked formally belonged to the applicant \u2019s father , it was the applicant himself who had organised the work . He stressed that he had not been remunerated for his work in DATE and DATE and had not worked voluntarily . In DATE the applicant had made him visit a notarial office to formalise some papers , the nature of which he was not clear about .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and his co - defendant , former police officer PERSON , stood trial before ORG , which was acting as the trial court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant testified that he had had no connection to his father \u2019s house or work on it . He had not requested that ORG be sent there . When convicting PERSON , he had not been aware that the charges against him had been false . PERSON had worked voluntarily and for remuneration . The applicant did not deny that PERSON . had been the construction site manager on the renovation of his father \u2019s house but argued that it had been his father who had been concerned by those works and that the applicant himself had had minimal contact with PERSON . The phone number which the prosecution argued he had used to contact PERSON . in fact belonged not to him but to his father .", "CARDINAL . PERSON admitted that he had forged the administrative arrest report in respect of PERSON but stated that he had done it at the request of officers PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY below ) . He said that the applicant had not been involved and had been unaware of the forgery when convicting I.", "CARDINAL . B. , the head of the detention facility , testified that in DATE or DATE the applicant had told him that ORG had stolen some things from his construction site and had asked PERSON to bring PERSON to him . On DATE he had taken PERSON from his home to the police station . He denied having instructed PERSON to forge documents in ORG case . On DATE B. was informed by another officer that a stranger claiming to be a court officer showed up at the station and was asking for prisoners to perform works at the court . This was refused . Sometime afterwards the applicant called the station to discuss the release of prisoners and spoke to the commanding officer of the station who gave permission for release of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . S. , an officer on duty at the police station , testified that ORG had on several occasions been handed over to a person introduced as an employee of ORG , supposedly for work at the court . On DATE the applicant had called personally and asked that I. be handed over for such work . The applicant contested the way S. \u2019s testimony was recorded in the domestic court \u2019s judgment and asserted that S. had not identified him by name . It appears that PERSON also denied having given any unlawful instructions to PERSON concerning ORG case .", "CARDINAL . Other police officers testified that PERSON . had checked PERSON out of the facility on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . P. , a ORG officer , stated that he was in charge of taking prisoners from the police detention facility to ORG to carry out work , and that he knew NORP well . However , in DATE the latter had not worked at the court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father confirmed that he had bought the house and had had PERSON . perform renovation works on it . He denied knowing I.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court , noting that ORG had failed to appear despite the fact that summonses had been duly sent to him , ordered the police to escort PERSON to the next court hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police reported that ORG could not be found at his last known address in GPE and that his whereabouts were unknown . His mother , niece and another neighbour had informed the police that PERSON had not been living at his usual address in GPE for some time , having left to work in GPE . Although he visited briefly from time to time , they had no way of contacting him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court asked the GPE regional prosecutor to establish the whereabouts of NORP and PERSON . , and to escort them to the hearing scheduled for DATE . The prosecutor in turn asked ORG for assistance in establishing the whereabouts of those CARDINAL individuals . On DATE ORG reported essentially the same information as gathered by the police on DATE . They also stated that PERSON . was not living at his address and his whereabouts were unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court again ordered that the police bring PERSON to the next court hearing on DATE . The police could not locate I. at his last known address . His mother gave the same explanation for his absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court decided that as the presence of NORP and PERSON . could not be ensured , their statements should be read out and video recordings of their interviews shown .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he met with NORP several times and attempted to persuade him to testify , but PERSON refused , stating that officers of ORG had threatened him with imprisonment if he did .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court convicted the applicant and PERSON of abuse of office under the circumstances described in paragraph CARDINAL above and sentenced each of them to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE . In convicting the applicant , the court relied on :", "( a ) PERSON statements , including the CARDINAL video - recorded , and PERSON . \u2019s statement ;", "( b ) evidence presented by the co - defendant PERSON and witnesses PERSON , PERSON see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) ;", "( c ) NORP evidence that the applicant had had regular telephone contacts with PERSON . at the relevant time ;", "( d ) NORP expert evidence to the effect that it had been PERSON . who had signed for ORG in the register of prisoners taken out of the detention facility in DATE and DATE and evidence of police officers that PERSON . had taken PERSON from the detention facility ;", "( e ) the statements of witnesses ORG , who had been identified in the forged police report as witnesses to ORG alleged disorderly conduct ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , to the effect that their statements had been forged . They stated that they did not know I. , had not observed him committing the offence , and had not made any statements about it to the police . PERSON testified at the trial . GPE gave video - recorded evidence in the course of the pre - trial investigation but did not testify at the trial ;", "( f ) NORP expert evidence showing that the signatures attributed to ORG on the statements incriminating PERSON had in fact been made by certain police officers ; and", "( g ) the statements of other witnesses , primarily police officers , concerning the circumstances of ORG arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation to ORG . He argued that PERSON . \u2019s statement should not have been relied upon because PERSON . had not signed it and had not been examined at the trial . The applicant also stated that the trial court had misstated PERSON \u2019s evidence , in particular by ascribing to ORG statements which were not in his video - recorded interview shown in the course of the trial . In that interview ORG had also made other statements indicating that he had worked voluntarily . The applicant questioned the trial court \u2019s decision to trust the statements given by ORG , a drunk who had a prior conviction for murder and who had failed to remember the content of the notarised statement he had signed DATE before , which showed that he was susceptible to signing anything presented to him by the investigator .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing to examine the appeal . No representative for the defence was present . A prosecutor was present and made oral submissions in opposition to the appeal . At the close of the hearing the court ordered that references to Sh . \u2019s statement be struck from the judgment , since he had not signed his pre - trial statement and thus his statement was inadmissible . The court listed the remaining evidence supporting the applicant \u2019s conviction and considered that , other than Sh . \u2019s statement , the evidence was admissible and sufficiently supported the verdict . The court upheld the remainder of the judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
