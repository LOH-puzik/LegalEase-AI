On DATE GPE found inter alia that the knife was PERSON and could be considered to be a weapon for the purpose of that provision . The court ordered the applicant \u2019s detention on remand for the alleged offence under LAW on the grounds of his serious criminal record , his unemployment and a risk that he might commit new offences , within the meaning to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . His remand in custody was authorised until DATE . The applicant and his defence counsel were present in court .", "The applicant appealed against the detention order , asserting that there were no reasons for holding him in custody . He stated in particular that there was no danger of his committing new offences .", "On DATE ORG held the appeal hearing in the presence of the applicant \u2019s defence counsel . ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence . The court held that ORG had erred in detaining the applicant under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW as he had not been suspected of having committed any offence listed in paragraph CARDINAL of that provision . ORG found no reason to suspect that the applicant might commit any new offence envisaged by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW . However , it ruled that these errors were not of such a nature or degree as to render the applicant \u2019s detention unlawful . By reference to the fact that the applicant had misled the authorities concerning the question of his address and that he had no permanent place of residence , ORG also held that there was a danger of his absconding , thereby justifying his detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "On DATE the Palanga City District Court extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody to DATE , emphasising the danger of his absconding , given the applicant \u2019s contradictions about his place of residence . The applicant and his representatives were present in court .", "The applicant appealed , claiming that there was no danger of his absconding that the case - file contained no proper evidence of his guilt , and that the alleged offence alleged was minor . He requested ORG to quash the decision of DATE and to release him . On DATE ORG , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s defence counsel , rejected the appeal as unsubstantiated .", "On DATE GPE extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody to DATE , finding that there was a danger of his absconding , given the applicant \u2019s contradictions about his place of residence . The applicant and his defence counsel were present in court .", "On DATE the Palanga City District Court convicted the applicant of the unlawful possession of a weapon under Article CARDINAL of LAW . He was given a prison sentence of DATE , which was deemed served on account of the time spent in detention on remand . He was released in the courtroom .", "The applicant did not appeal against that judgment .", "Relevant provisions of LAW ( NORP kodeksas ) :", "Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides that a person may be punished with a sentence of up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the unlawful possession , production or sale of weapons specifically made to kill or inflict bodily harm , including hunting knives .", "Relevant provisions of LAW ( ORG proceso kodeksas ) :", "Article CARDINAL :", "\u201c No one shall be arrested or detained save by virtue of a decision of a court or judge . \u201d", "Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW provide that the accused and their counsel have the right to submit requests and appeal against acts and decisions of an interrogator , investigator , prosecutor or court .", "Article CARDINAL :", "\u201c Detention on remand shall be used only \u2026 in cases where a statutory penalty of DATE imprisonment is envisaged . \u2026 .", "The grounds for the detention on remand shall be the reasoned suspicion that the accused will :", "( CARDINAL ) abscond from the investigation and trial ;", "( CARDINAL ) obstruct the determination of the truth in the case ;", "( CARDINAL ) commit new offences \u2026 whilst suspected of having committed crimes . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL :", "\u201c \u2026 the arrested person shall be brought before a judge within not more than TIME .

If the appellate court finds procedural irregularities that do not affect the essence of the detention order , the court must eliminate the defects without quashing the order .", "Pursuant to the general provision of LAW , a first instance decision , including remand decisions , was not effective pending the time - limit for an appeal against that decision or during the appeal proceedings .
