TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant company Voyager Ltd. ( hereinafter the applicant ) is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of LOC . It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a firm of solicitors in GPE .", "The applicant is a subsidiary company of ORG ( \u201c PPI \u201d ) . Mr PERSON was the director of PPI from DATE until he was declared bankrupt in DATE . In DATE , the applicant owned CARDINAL of the CARDINAL shares in ORG , a company registered in GPE and incorporated in accordance with NORP law .", "On DATE , a meeting of the applicant \u2019s ORG was held in GPE . ORG of the applicant provided that the quorum for a board of ORG meeting is CARDINAL . However , this meeting was only attended by PERSON , a director of the applicant , and PERSON Nevzat , a former director of the applicant , who had formally resigned from his post a day before the meeting . The other CARDINAL directors of the applicant were not informed about this meeting . At this meeting a decision was taken to appoint PERSON as director of Voyager . On DATE another ORG of ORG meeting was held in GPE , this time in the presence of PERSON and Mr PERSON . At this meeting , the transfer of CARDINAL shares held by the applicant in ORG to PERSON for a payment of ORG was ratified . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL shares in ORG were registered in the share register in the name of PERSON .", "On DATE an Administrative Order was made by the NORP courts in respect of PPI whereby CARDINAL administrators were appointed to act as the company \u2019s officers .", "On DATE Mr Nadir was made bankrupt in accordance with LANGUAGE law .", "On DATE ORG of GPE declared that the meetings of the applicant \u2019s Board of Directors held respectively on DATE and CARDINAL DATE were inquorate and therefore null and void .", "The applicant accused Mr Nadir of wrongful transfer of shares with the intention of transferring them outside ORG to ensure that they remained under his personal control after ORG became effective on DATE . Consequently several proceedings were brought before the NORP courts against ORG and PERSON .", "", "On DATE the applicant initiated legal proceedings before ORG for a declaration that CARDINAL of its shares in ORG had been unlawfully transferred into the name of PERSON .", "On DATE , after having examined all the evidence and the arguments submitted by the parties , the court found that there was no dispute between the parties concerning the nullity of the Board meetings held on DATE and DATE . Accordingly , the ORG held that the transfer of CARDINAL shares into the name of PERSON was null and therefore void . The court further ruled that the restoration of the shares in the applicant \u2019s name was dependent on the payment of ORG to PERSON , this sum being fixed in the light of TIME of the meeting of ORG held on DATE .", "The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first instance court as regards the nullity of the share transfer . However , it quashed the remainder of the judgment concerning the obligation to pay back GBP CARDINAL to PERSON to restore the shares , on the ground that PERSON had not made such a claim before the first instance court .", "Subsequently , PERSON requested the rectification of the decision dated DATE . On DATE ORG found that ORG decision , dated DATE , was in fact in line with the established case - law of ORG , which provides that first instance courts are entitled , ex officio , to establish a lien even though the parties do not make such a claim . Thus , ORG concluded that the first instance court had acted in accordance with domestic law in establishing a lien over the shares in favour of the defendant . Accordingly , it ruled that the reasoning of ORG decision dated DATE was erroneous . However , the court further held that , as there was a dispute between the parties about the payment of ORG , the first instance court should have first examined in detail whether the defendant had really paid the sum in question before ruling on a lien in respect of the shares . In view of its findings , the court remitted the case to the first instance court for a detailed examination .", "On DATE ORG decided to apply ORG decision of DATE . Recalling that under NORP law the conditions which apply to share transfer are regulated by the provisions governing the contract of sale in LAW , the court placed the burden of proof on the applicant to show that it had not received any consideration from the defendant in return for the shares . The court granted DATE to the applicant to submit any evidence in support of its allegations . However , the applicant stated before the court that it did not have any proof . Accordingly , on DATE ORG held that pursuant to LAW , the vendor and the purchaser should fulfil their contractual obligations at the same time unless there was an agreement to the contrary . The court observed that the defendant claimed to have paid the sum in question to the applicant in return for the shares and that , according to NORP domestic law , the burden of proof was on the applicant to show that its allegations were true . Accordingly , the court accepted that the defendant had paid GBP QUANTITY in return for the shares and was therefore entitled to a lien on the shares until this sum was paid back to him .", "On DATE , finding the reasoning and the cogency of the first instance court in line with domestic law , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for rectification . It held that the transfer of limited liability company shares was governed by LAW and therefore the burden of proof was on the applicant to show that it had not received any consideration in return for the shares . As the applicant failed to do so , ORG held that the decisions of ORG and ORG were in line with domestic law . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a further application with ORG for a declaration that CARDINAL of its shares in ORG had been unlawfully transferred into the name of PERSON .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the transfer of CARDINAL shares to Mr Nadir by the applicant was null and void . The court further held that pursuant to LAW , the burden of proof was on the applicant to show that no consideration had been received from the defendant in return for the shares . As the applicant failed to adduce any evidence in support of its allegations , ORG granted the defendant a lien over the shares and made the restoration of shares dependent on the payment of ORG .", "On DATE ORG , finding the cogency and reasoning of the first instance court in line with domestic law , upheld the judgment dated DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested the rectification of this decision . Subsequently , on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests , stating that the transfer of shares was governed by LAW and the national courts had acted in accordance with this provision .", "On DATE the Isle of Man High Court granted a declaration that the applicant had never received payment from PERSON for the transfer of CARDINAL shares in ORG .", "In addition to the principal proceedings described in subsection ( a ) and ( b ) above , the applicant also initiated an action to establish and enforce its rights as a shareholder in ORG including its right to participate in NORP meetings . On DATE ORG dismissed the case . It recalled that pursuant to LAW , only the persons whose names are registered in the share register could be considered shareholders . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s name was not registered in the share register and that no proceedings had been brought to amend the share register . Accordingly , the court ruled that the applicant was not entitled to convene a ORG meeting . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The applicant asked for rectification of this decision . During these proceedings , the applicant also requested disqualification of CARDINAL of the members of ORG . The applicant maintained that these CARDINAL judges had previously sat in the proceedings concerning the establishment of the applicant \u2019s ownership to the CARDINAL shares in ORG , and had acted in favour of PERSON . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request basing itself on DATE of ORG , which provides that motions for disqualification will not be heard where disqualification can result in the loss of quorum . On DATE , the court also refused the applicant \u2019s request for rectification ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
