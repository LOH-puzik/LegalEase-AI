On DATE the applicant , assisted by a lawyer , was charged with the theft of the electricity cables and a restriction was imposed on him not to leave the village of ORG without the authorisation of the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . The preliminary investigation was concluded on an unspecified date and the case was forwarded to the public prosecutor \u2019s office . On an unspecified date the case was remitted for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charges against the applicant were amended ; he was once again assisted by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . NORP The results of the preliminary investigation were presented to the applicant and his lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant left the village of ORG without authorisation from the public prosecutor \u2019s office . He claimed to have moved to live at an address in GPE which was registered with the police and where he received his pension .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the public prosecutor \u2019s office entered an indictment against the applicant and his CARDINAL accomplices with ORG for the theft of the electricity cables .", "CARDINAL . A copy of the indictment was sent to the applicant \u2019s address in the village of ORG , apparently by registered post with return receipt . The indictment and the receipt were returned to ORG in their entirety and without an indication whether they had been served .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing before ORG was scheduled for DATE , but was postponed , for undisclosed reasons , to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . A summons to the first hearing was sent to the applicant \u2019s address in the village of ORG , which was returned without any indication whether it had been served . In an accompanying letter , the mayor of the village of ORG informed ORG that the applicant was not registered as living in the village , that he had not resided there for DATE and that he had moved to the city of GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the ORG established that the applicant had not been duly summoned because he had not received the summons . Nevertheless , at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the court decided to examine the case in his absence as it found that this would not impede the proceedings , and assigned a court - appointed lawyer to represent the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The second hearing was conducted on DATE ; the applicant was summoned to it through his court - appointed lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant and his accomplices guilty as charged . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the judgment , so it became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE to serve the prison sentence , which he did until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant requested ORG to reopen the criminal proceedings against him . He relied on Article CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure DATE ( \u201c ORG \u201d : see Relevant domestic law below ) and claimed that he had not been aware of the criminal trial against him . The applicant argued that even though he had been aware of the preliminary investigation against him he could not be expected to constantly follow the subsequent development of the proceedings against him . Moreover , as he had not received the indictment entered against him by the public prosecutor \u2019s office , he had been unaware that formal court proceedings had been initiated against him . The applicant also argued that once the authorities had established that he was no longer residing in the village of ORG they should have attempted to find him at his other address in GPE , where they would have found him without difficulty .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to reopen the case . It found that the applicant had been aware of the criminal proceedings against him because he had been present , together with his lawyer , when he had been initially charged on DATE , when the charges had been amended on DATE and also when the results of the preliminary investigation had been presented on DATE . Moreover , he had violated the restriction order imposed on him not to leave the village of ORG without the authorisation of the public prosecutor \u2019s office and had moved to another address without informing the said authorities . Thus , the court found that the applicant had wilfully made himself unavailable to participate in the criminal proceedings against him and had lost the right to seek their reopening .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , revoked in DATE , allowed trial in absentia in certain limited instances . It provided in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time , the following :", "\u201c When it would not hamper the ascertaining of the truth , the case can be examined in the absence of the accused if :", "CARDINAL . [ he ] was not found at the address he had given or had changed it without informing the competent authorities ;", "CARDINAL . [ he ] was duly summoned and had not indicated a good cause for his failure to appear . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When an accused was tried in absentia , there was a statutory requirement that he be represented by an ex officio counsel ( LAW ) of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE NORP law did not provide for the reopening of criminal cases heard in absentia . Thereafter reopening became possible in cases where the convicted person was unaware of the criminal proceedings against him or her and had submitted a request for a reopening within DATE of learning of the conviction ( Article CARDINALa of the ORG ) . The request was examined by ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) , which could quash the conviction and either order a rehearing of the case ( LAW ORG ) or discontinue or suspend the criminal proceedings ( LAW ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts\u2019 prevailing practice has been summarised in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In further judgments , ORG stated that a convicted person can not claim not to have been aware of the criminal proceedings against him if he had been charged with the offence in question in the course of the preliminary investigation and had had a restriction placed on him not to leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , LOC ; \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , LOC ) . Moreover , it considered that it was irrelevant whether in such instances the convicted person was actually seeking to evade justice or had simply moved to another address without having duly informed the competent authorities where he could be summoned ( \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u2116 ORG \u0433. , II \u043d.\u043e. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 ) .", "CARDINAL . The new Code of Criminal Procedure DATE provides for the reopening of criminal cases heard in absentia in cases where the convicted person was unaware of the criminal proceedings against him or her , including of the conviction , and had submitted a request for a reopening of the case within DATE of learning of the conviction ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the first reported case under the new rule , ORG restated its understanding that the possibility for reopening of criminal cases heard in absentia aimed to restore the right of the convicted person to participate personally in the criminal proceedings , which he or she had previously been denied for reasons outside his or her control . In particular , its aim was not to be of benefit to convicted persons who had known of the criminal proceedings against them , but had belatedly learnt of their conviction because they had absconded or had avoided participating in the court proceedings ( \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , I \u043d.\u043e. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u041a\u0421 ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
