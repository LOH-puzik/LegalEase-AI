The applicant was born in DATE in the town of LANGUAGE , in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , a constituent member of GPE . DATE he served in ORG in GPE . In DATE he enrolled as a student at the military academy in the town of ORG in GPE . When GPE was dissolved in DATE , GPE became an independent ORG . Under NORP law , all those who were permanent residents of GPE in DATE acquired NORP citizenship . A similar law was enacted in GPE . In DATE the applicant left the military academy and for personal reasons returned to GPE . He had a GPE passport and was married to a NORP woman .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was convicted in GPE for armed robbery . According to him , he was wrongly accused and ill - treated by the investigating officers . He claimed that the conditions of his detention in GPE were very poor , that prison officials ill - treated him and other convicts , that he was subjected to discrimination as an ethnic NORP and that prison officials extorted money from him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served part of the sentence in a prison and was later transferred to an \u201c open colony \u201d , where convicts could move around unguarded . In DATE , when he was on leave from the colony , he fled to GPE . He explains that he feared for his life and for the lives of his relatives . In GPE he was put on the wanted list .", "CARDINAL . Upon his arrival in GPE the applicant obtained a false NORP passport . He lived and worked in GPE under a false name using that passport . The applicant \u2019s real identity was discovered in DATE ; he was sentenced by a judge to a fine for forgery of an official document , but remained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that he tried to regularise his residence status . In particular , he claims that he was eligible for NORP nationality , since in DATE ( when the law on NORP nationality was enacted ) he had been residing in GPE , not GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP authorities requested the extradition of the applicant to GPE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested and detained in GPE in connection with that request , but on DATE he was released on the order of Judge PERSON extradition followed .", "CARDINAL . It appears that some time later the NORP authorities renewed their request . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was detained again upon the orders of the NORP town prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the detention order before the court . The case was received by Judge PERSON from ORG , who set the date of the first hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor challenged Judge PERSON on the ground that she had already participated in the examination of the applicant \u2019s extradition case earlier , in DATE , when she had ordered his release . It is unclear whether the applicant or his lawyer objected to the replacement of the judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON from ORG examined the applicant \u2019s complaint and ruled that the prosecutor \u2019s detention order of CARDINAL DATE was unlawful . ORG found that under NORP law a prison sentence handed down by a foreign court was not sufficient for a person to be detained without a detention order issued by a court in GPE . ORG ordered the prosecutor to take measures in order to rectify the situation complained of .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing the prosecutor filed a request with ORG seeking the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition . ORG examined it on the spot and ruled that the applicant was to be detained to prevent him from absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that detention order was quashed by ORG as unsubstantiated . ORG noted , in particular , that in view of the applicant \u2019s profile and his previous behaviour ( namely , the fact that after his first arrest pending extradition in DATE he had continued to live openly at his officially known address ) there was no reason to suppose that he would flee . The applicant was released , and house arrest was imposed on him . He was required to stay at home during TIME .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the Deputy Prosecutor General ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The applicant challenged that decision before the court . He referred to the facts which , in his view , made him eligible for NORP nationality . He also claimed that if he returned to GPE he risked being subjected to ill - treatment by the prison authorities . In support of this argument he invoked reports by various human rights defence groups and international organisations concerning the human rights situation in GPE , in particular in the area of the rights of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer , examined the applicant \u2019s extradition case on the merits . In particular , it examined his allegations about the risk of illtreatment in GPE , the fact that he had been serving a sentence for an ordinary criminal offence and the fact that the NORP authorities had given assurances to the NORP authorities that he would not be illtreated . The extradition order was upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the decision of ORG . It noted , in particular , that the applicant had been convicted of an offence which was not political in nature and had not tried to seek refugee status in GPE because of the alleged persecution , preferring instead to live there under another name . The fact that he had been granted leave from the colony was at odds with his allegations that he had been ill - treated there . ORG further examined reports by international organisations and NGOs on ill - treatment and poor conditions of detention in NORP prisons but concluded that they were not sufficient to show that the applicant personally ran the risk of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant asked ORG to grant him NORP nationality . He claims that it was not his first attempt to that end , but the case file contains no documents in support of his claim . ORG replied that in view of his background ( in particular , the fact that at the time of the collapse of the GPE his permanent place of residence was in GPE ) he was not eligible for automatic conversion of his GPE passport to a NORP passport , and that he had not satisfied the formal criteria for lodging a naturalisation request .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant challenged the refusal of ORG in court . He claimed , in particular , that in DATE he was studying in GPE and was therefore eligible for NORP nationality . On DATE the ORG of GPE dismissed his complaint . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE is still pending .", "CARDINAL . It is unclear whether or not the applicant has been extradited ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
