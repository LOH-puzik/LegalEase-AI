They are NORP nationals , retired farmers and were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Since DATE the applicants\u2019 family has owned a farmhouse with pertaining agricultural land , including a plot of QUANTITY situated along the LOC road ( hereinafter \u201c the plot \u201d ) and used as a meadow for dairy cattle . After the death of their father in DATE , the applicants inherited and continued jointly to exploit the farm . For reasons of health and age , the applicants ceased their farming activities on DATE .", "Under the DATE LAW ( GPE aanwijzende de bestemming in hoofdzaken ) of the then ORG and PERSON municipality ( subsequently incorporated into the GPE municipality ) , the plot was designated for the construction of hotels and country houses .", "DATE the municipal council ( gemeenteraad ) adopted a preliminary planning decision in preparation for a ( new ) zoning plan ( voorbereidingsbesluit bestemmingsplan ) for an area comprising the plot . In accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de Ruimtelijke Ordening ) , these preliminary planning decisions were laid open for public inspection , notice being given through ORG ) and the local press . Each of these preliminary planning decisions prohibited any construction activities without a prior permit issued by the municipal executive ( burgemeester en wethouders ) and adjourned the issuance of a building permit by the municipal executive pending the validity of the preliminary planning decision .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG ( gedeputeerde staten ) had adopted a local area development plan ( streekplan ) for the area of south GPE . The area in which the plot is situated was classified as a \u201c rural area with a highly valued landscape and/or cultural historical background \u201d . In a subsequent local area development plan , adopted by ORG on DATE , the plot was classified as a \u201c rural area with the interwoven categories agriculture CARDINAL , nature CARDINAL , landscape CARDINAL , and recreation and tourism CARDINAL \u201d . Both plans were duly laid open for public inspection .", "On DATE , the ORG adopted the new zoning plan \u201c PERSON \u201d , which was preservation - oriented . The plot was designated for \u201c residential purposes to be further defined in accordance with CARDINAL of ORG \u201d . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG withheld their approval of this part of the zoning plan , finding that new residential buildings on the plot would affect the landscape in an irreparable manner . The municipal authorities as well as other appellants , including the applicants , unsuccessfully challenged this decision in administrative appeal proceedings in which the final decision was handed down by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the Margraten municipal council adopted a revised version of the \u201c PERSON \u201d zoning plan in which the plot was designated as an \u201c agricultural area with natural and landscape values \u201d . On DATE ORG approved the revised zoning plan . The applicants\u2019 appeal against this approval was dismissed by ORG on DATE . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "On DATE the applicants filed a claim under section CARDINAL of ORG with the GPE municipal authorities for compensation for damage in consequence of the revised zoning plan , affecting land owned by them , the burden of which they could not reasonably be expected to bear alone . The applicants estimated this damage at MONEY .", "This claim and the applicants\u2019 subsequent objection were rejected by the ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . The ORG appeal against this last decision was dismissed by ORG ( rechtbank ) on DATE .", "A further appeal lodged by the applicants was rejected on DATE by ORG , which found it established that the applicants had not availed themselves of the possibility to build on the plot as rendered feasible under the DATE zoning plan . It accepted that the applicants had incurred damage as a consequence of the new zoning plan , but it had to be determined whether this damage was to be borne , either partly or in full , by the applicants , by determining whether they could be regarded as having accepted the risk that the possibility to build on the plot would disappear . It accordingly had to be examined whether there had been any indication of such a disadvantageous change in the plot \u2019s designation and whether \u2013 considered from the position of a rationally thinking and acting owner \u2013 the applicants should have given serious consideration to that prospect . After having noted the developments since DATE as regards the classification and destination of the plot , the ORG agreed with the municipal authorities and ORG that the applicants , or their legal predecessors , should be regarded as having accepted the risk that the possibility to build on the plot would disappear and , consequently , that the damage did not justify compensation under section CARDINAL of ORG .", "In so far as the applicants relied on LAW No . CARDINAL , the ORG held :", "\u201c ... the new zoning regulation does not deprive the appellants of their property ; they retain the right to dispose of it freely albeit within the defined planning framework . In so far as the limitations contained in the zoning plan as to the use of the plot are to be seen as an interference with the right to undisturbed enjoyment of property , LAW No . CARDINAL leaves unimpeded the application of laws that can be regarded as necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest . ... the zoning plan in force in the area concerned constitutes such a control . It further does not follow from LAW No . CARDINAL that the control of the use of property as a result of limitations laid down in the zoning plan should be compensated for if LAW offers no basis for this . In the instant case there has therefore been no violation of LAW . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
