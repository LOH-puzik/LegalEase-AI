The applicant , who was a wheelchair user at the time , objected without success .", "CARDINAL . In those proceedings the plaintiffs ( the applicant and his relatives ) amended their claims . In particular , they claimed that damages should be paid by the ORG , because ORG had been a police officer at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . The applicant formulated his claims in respect of pecuniary damage as follows . The accident and resulting injuries had deprived him of the ability to work . Although the applicant , who was a qualified naval operator mechanic , had had no actual work at the time , he had been promised an offer of employment overseas on a cargo ship , and had been on a waiting list for a job . If he had accepted that job , his salary would have amounted to ORG CARDINAL per month . Consequently , he asked to be compensated the CARDINAL years\u2019 salary he would have earned but for the accident ( USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Further , he asked for reimbursement of various medical expenses , including several operations and consultations in GPE and GPE , and legal costs related to his participation in the proceedings against P. ( RUB CARDINAL ) . He also claimed reimbursement of his expenses related to a special diet he had to follow , and the personal assistance he had required during his periods of complete disability . Lastly , the applicant claimed that he still needed further surgery , which could only be done at a clinic in GPE because he had developed several brain cysts as a result of the previous operations ( EUR CARDINAL ) . Lastly , he claimed compensation for his expenses for having to retrain in another field , which would enable him to work again ( RUB CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to non - pecuniary damages , the applicant claimed RUB CARDINAL under this head , referring mostly to the same facts and the suffering caused by the accident , the subsequent surgery , his participation in the proceedings , and lost opportunities related to his disability .", "CARDINAL . The representative of the ORG claimed that the ORG could not be held responsible for the accident . In their words , liability would arise when CARDINAL conditions were met : if the damage was caused in the course of realisation of the ORG \u2019s public functions , and if the ORG \u2019s acts were unlawful . Where damage was caused in the context of an economic activity , it should be compensated in the ordinary way , by the immediate wrongdoer . P. had injured the applicant while driving his own car , and had not been on duty at the time . He had therefore had to be the defendant in the civil proceedings , not the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the court obtained ( through the applicant or otherwise ) a letter from an employment assistance agency , ORG , dated DATE . It said that the agency had an opening for the applicant on an overseas voyage on a DATE contract basis , with a salary of ORG CARDINAL . A letter from another shipping company , ORG , which had the applicant \u2019s name on a waiting list for an offer of employment at the time of the accident , said that he could have earned ORG CARDINAL working as an operator mechanic on a ship in DATE . It also indicated that on overseas voyages on foreign ships , the pay of operator mechanics varied between USD CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Verkhnedonskoy District Court gave judgment in the civil case . The court \u2019s findings of fact were almost identical to the findings of the criminal court . It concluded that P. had been fully responsible for the injuries caused to the applicant . As to the amount of pecuniary damages , the court noted that the applicant had only been on a waiting list for future employment and had not received an actual job offer . At the time of the accident he had been unemployed . Moreover , it could be seen from the material in the case file that he could not have obtained a job as a naval operator mechanic on overseas voyages in DATE owing to a lack of previous work experience and his poor LANGUAGE . Furthermore , the applicant had a chronic kidney problem , which would have prevented him from going overseas . As a result , the court calculated the applicant \u2019s loss of earnings as CARDINAL times the minimum wage and took into consideration the \u201c minimum subsistence level \u201d which existed at the relevant time in the area where the applicant lived . The resulting amount for loss of earnings for the period under consideration was RUB CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court also ordered that the defendant pay him RUB CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) DATE until the next expert examination of his health . The court also partially satisfied the applicant \u2019s claims concerning the reimbursement of his medical expenses ( RUB CARDINAL ) and his and his father \u2019s travel expenses connected to consultations in GPE clinics ( RUB CARDINAL ) and the cost of those consultations ( RUB CARDINAL ) . The part of the applicant \u2019s claim related to his special diet , treatments , legal and postal expenses and so forth were dismissed by the court as unnecessary , unsubstantiated , or not actually incurred . In particular , the court held that further treatment in GPE had not been proven necessary by the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . The court ordered P. to pay non - pecuniary damages , dismissing the claims against the ORG . The court fixed the amount of compensation referring to , inter alia , the defendant \u2019s financial situation , at RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The overall amount to be recovered from P. was RUB CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court dismissed the claims of the applicant \u2019s relatives as unsubstantiated .", "DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal , but it appears to have been dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The amount of compensation awarded by ORG was paid in full by DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during the trial P. made repeated death threats towards him and other members of his family . As a result of that stressful situation , the health of some his relatives worsened and they have since died . The applicant asked the prosecutor to initiate criminal proceedings against P. in respect of the death threats but his request was refused for lack of evidence . The applicant tried to challenge the refusals in the courts but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also sought to initiate a criminal investigation into the alleged falsification of the results of the blood tests by M. However , the prosecutor decided not to open a case , a decision which was upheld by the courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant tried to initiate a criminal investigation into the actions of the surgeon PERSON . , but the investigator did not find any grounds on which to prosecute him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
