He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On an unspecified date a preliminary investigation for robbery was opened against the applicant .

On an unspecified date the preliminary investigation was suspended .", "The preliminary investigation was resumed on DATE and then again suspended on DATE .", "The preliminary investigation against the applicant was again resumed on DATE . On an unspecified date in DATE it was discontinued in respect of the applicant and was transformed as being against an unknown perpetrator .", "The applicant was never formally charged with an offence .", "In the course of the search of the applicant 's apartment on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the investigating authorities seized various items , such as a helm , an electric sander , a car radio , a stereo , QUANTITY turbot fishing nets , CARDINAL goby fishing nets , CARDINAL bluefish and shad fishing nets , CARDINAL fishing hooks , a car battery , CARDINAL life jackets , a leather bag , CARDINAL signal rockets and a reversible boat coupling .

He argued that the ORG 's liability under LAW arose from the fact that there had been a preliminary investigation against him for robbery , subsequently discontinued , which amounted to having been subjected to unlawful criminal proceedings .", "In a final judgment of DATE ORG found against the applicant and upheld the lower courts ' judgments . It also found that the applicant had no right of action under the ORG because the liability of the investigation and the prosecution authorities arose only in the exhaustively listed instances in LAW . In so far as the applicant had never been charged , but had only been questioned as a suspect and then as a witness , the court found that no liability arose for the authorities in question . Moreover , ORG noted that the investigation and the prosecution authorities could also not be held liable under LAW for any of their actions or inactions related to the safekeeping of the seized items .", "The relevant domestic law and practice have been summarised in the judgments in the cases of GPE and Others v.
