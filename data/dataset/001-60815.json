GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and the second applicant in DATE ; they both live in LOC ( Germany ) .", "CARDINAL . Under a purchase agreement dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicants purchased a dwelling house in GPE , on the territory of GPE ( GDR ) for MONEY . The house was built on land belonging to the ORG ( volkseigenes ORG ) over which the applicants obtained a usufruct ( dingliches ORG ) under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( PERSON ) of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made an official request for permission to leave the GPE , as they believed that they had been discriminated against on political grounds in their work .", "The applicants say that they were informed by ORG ( GPE innere ORG ) in GPE that to obtain permission to leave the GPE permanently they would have to transfer ( ver\u00e4ussern ) their property by sale or gift .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants purported to transfer the property to a couple , PERSON and PERSON , by a notarial deed of gift in which the dwelling house was stated to be worth MONEY . In reality , PERSON and PERSON paid the applicants MONEY ( ORG ) into a NORP bank account .", "CARDINAL . The applicants say that the true value of their house and land would DATE be CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . That figure is disputed by the Government , who say that the applicants had possessed only a usufruct over the land .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following NORP reunification , the applicants attempted to recover their house and their usufruct over the land , firstly from the purchasers and subsequently in proceedings in the civil and administrative courts of GPE ( FRG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to ORG ( GPE ) for an order for restitution of their house and rectification of the entry in the land register ( Grundbuch ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Instance rejected that application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) dismissed an appeal by the applicants , holding that they had no right to restitution . It pointed out that no transfer of property had in fact taken place , as both the gift and the sale in the GPE were null and void . However , the applicants were not entitled to rely on that nullity , as they had opted for that form of contract in full knowledge of the facts and the purchasers had not taken advantage of any coercion ( GPE ) to which the applicants may have been subject at the time . The application for restitution accordingly failed under the principle of good faith and fair dealing ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged an administrative appeal with ORG requesting the restitution of their property . They relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , ORG turned down their request on the grounds that the conditions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) were not satisfied , as the applicants had not shown that they had acted under duress ( GPE ) . Duress linked to a departure from the GPE could only have existed prior to the opening of the border on DATE . Thereafter , it was clear that all restrictions on leaving the GPE had been lifted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that decision to ORG for ORG ( Landesamt zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) of ORG , which dismissed their appeal , again on the grounds that the applicants had not acted under duress following the opening of the border on DATE , and in particular following ORG see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) of CARDINAL DATE and its publication on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) found against the applicants following a hearing .", "It found that they were not entitled to restitution ( R\u00fcck\u00fcber - tragungsanspruch ) in the absence of any unfair dealings ( unlautere GPE ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The border had been opened on DATE , with the result that all citizens of the GPE had been free to leave the country , while ORG DATE stipulated that they were no longer required to transfer their property prior to their departure . However , the deed of transfer was only executed on DATE . It added that there had not been any deception ( PERSON ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "ORG also found that even if the previous position had remained unchanged , the conditions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW would not in any event have been satisfied , as the applicants did not own the land but merely had a usufruct over it . Under GPE legislation \u2013 ORG Act of DATE ( ORG \u00fcber die PERSON an einem volkseigenen ORG ) \u2013 persons entitled to a usufruct were required to use the land themselves . Even if the applicants had moved house within the GPE , the land would have reverted to the ORG and the applicants ' only entitlement would have been to compensation . The applicants had been aware of that situation , which is why they had sought to transfer their property .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL decisions of DATE and DATE , ORG ( ORG ) declined to examine an application for review by the applicants .", "It referred to its leading judgment of DATE in which it had stated that instances of unfair dealings between CARDINAL DATE ( the date of publication of ORG in ORG ( Gesetzblatt ) of the GPE ) and DATE ( when ORG the GPE dated DATE was revoked ) would be rare . ORG had conducted a thorough review of the facts of the case and concluded that there had been no duress or deception within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "ORG also referred to its leading judgment of CARDINAL DATE , in which it stated that there would not be unfair dealing within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW in cases in which the obligation to transfer property had arisen under LAW of DATE of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL decisions of DATE , ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) declined to hear constitutional appeals by the applicants against either the civil courts ' or the administrative courts ' decisions .", "It referred , inter alia , to its leading judgment of DATE in which it had held that it was not unconstitutional for civil rights to be supplanted ( verdr\u00e4ngt ) by the provisions of LAW in cases involving the departure of GPE citizens for the ORG . Accordingly , ORG interpretation in the instant case was consistent with that authority .", "CARDINAL . During the reunification process in DATE , the CARDINAL NORP governments began negotiations on the many property issues arising and subsequently issued the Joint Statement of GPE and GPE on ORG Bundesrepublik GPE und der GPE zur GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) , which became an integral part of LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) of DATE . The negotiations covered both the questions of restitution of property that had been expropriated in the GPE to its owners and the transfer of property by citizens of the GPE on leaving the country .", "In the statement , the CARDINAL governments said that in seeking solutions to the contentious property issues , they needed to find a socially acceptable balance ( sozial vertr\u00e4glicher Ausgleich ) between the competing interests , while taking into account the need for legal certainty and clarity and to protect the right of property .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE , also known as LAW , entered into force on DATE and was also a part of LAW . Under the terms of the LAW , LAW was to continue to subsist in the reunified GPE after the reunification of the two GPE on DATE . The aim of the LAW was to resolve disputes over property in the territory of the GPE in a way that was socially acceptable , in order to achieve permanent legal order in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides :", "\u201c This Act shall also apply to rights in or over immovable property and usufructary rights acquired by unfair dealings , such as abuse of power , corruption , duress or deception by the purchaser , the ORG authorities or third parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW established the principle of a right to restitution for citizens of the GPE who had been forced to transfer their property in order to leave the country legally , save where restitution was precluded , as for instance if the purchasers had acted in good faith ( redlicher GPE ) ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) . In such cases , the former owners had a right to compensation under ORG of DATE ( ORG \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung nach dem ORG zur GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the rule set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW does not apply in principle if the transfer was made after DATE of DATE ( when Mr PERSON , President of ORG ( PERSON ) of the GPE , resigned ) and without the parties ' agreement ( however , see below for the decisions of ORG on this point ) .", "CARDINAL . The legislature deliberately chose to give the administrative courts jurisdiction for the interpretation of LAW in litigation concerning the transfer of property by citizens wishing to leave the GPE , in order to avoid direct confrontation between former owners and new owners in the civil courts . To that end , it set up offices for the resolution of outstanding property issues which were responsible for deciding the disputes by carrying out investigations of their own motion ( GPE ) , while also having regard to the general interest .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL further leading judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( ORG , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , ORG held that LAW could apply to legal transactions entered into after the transitional date of DATE if the factors vitiating consent would have resulted in the transfer being null and void in the light of the new situation obtaining in the GPE , both on the facts and in law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
