On DATE a mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her child NORP , a girl born in DATE , had DATE been sexually abused by a relative , the applicant . On DATE the police took a statement from the mother . On DATE the police questioned the applicant . NORP was interviewed by the police on DATE in the presence of a social worker . No other person was present at the interview , nor was it recorded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently charged before the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) with having sexually abused NORP , who was DATE at the time , by touching her sexual organs . The applicant denied the charge . The court received testimony from NORP \u2019s mother and the applicant as well as CARDINAL witnesses who testified on the applicant \u2019s behalf . The prosecutor submitted a video recording of CARDINAL interviews with NORP conducted by a medical expert , PERSON , on CARDINAL and DATE . PERSON was heard as a witness in this connection . The prosecutor also submitted a medical statement containing an assessment of the interviews in question and another medical certificate containing findings relating to NORP \u2019s physical examination . The prosecutor further produced a statement given on DATE by a rehabilitation centre for intellectually disabled persons . From the statement it transpired that NORP had the intelligence level of a child aged DATE . Written evidence of NORP \u2019s need for professional help was submitted on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of sexual abuse of a child and sentenced him to a suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . As evidence , the court relied firstly on the testimony of NORP \u2019s mother , which it found more credible than that of the applicant and his witnesses and secondly , on the video recording along with PERSON \u2019s testimony . The court noted that NORP had given similar accounts of the events to her mother and to H. It further noted that during the interviews NORP had talked to PERSON openly and with confidence , but her behaviour had clearly changed when the issue of the alleged abuse had been broached . NORP had , nevertheless , been able to give an account of the events in a rather versatile and detailed manner . The recording gave the court no reason to suspect that NORP had been repeating some other person \u2019s words or that she had imagined the events .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , arguing , inter alia , that ORG should not have decided the case without hearing NORP in person . He had not been given the opportunity to put questions to NORP at any point of the proceedings . Nor had he been given an opportunity to watch the video recording of her interviews before the main hearing , yet the recording had been an essential part of the evidence leading to his conviction . The applicant requested that ORG hold an oral hearing and that NORP be heard in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to hear NORP in person as it might be detrimental to her , taking into account her level of development and the nature of the issue in question . The court relied on the principle contained in section QUANTITY ) of the LAW on ORG ( laki oikeudenk\u00e4ynnin julkisuudesta , lag om offentlighet vid r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ng , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which provided that a person below DATE could not attend a hearing if the court found that this could be detrimental to him or her , and to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and Right of Access Act ( laki lapsen huollosta ja tapaamisoikeudesta , lag ang\u00e5ende v\u00e5rdnad om barn och umg\u00e4ngesr\u00e4tt , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which provided that a child could be heard in court only if it was clear that this would not be detrimental to him or her . This decision was not subject to separate appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the subsequent oral hearing , ORG was presented with the same evidence as had been before ORG , with the addition of CARDINAL photographs and the floor plan of the applicant \u2019s apartment . On DATE the court upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment finding no reason to deviate from its assessment of the evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) maintaining , inter alia , that his Convention right to examine witnesses against him had been breached . He requested , inter alia , that the court refer the case back to the lower courts for re - examination and that he be granted an opportunity to put questions to NORP , either in an oral hearing or by using other arrangements . In the alternative , the applicant requested that an oral hearing be held in ORG and that testimony be obtained from the applicant and the CARDINAL witnesses on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "NORP The pre - trial investigation", "CARDINAL . The Decree on Criminal Investigations and Coercive Measures ( asetus esitutkinnasta ja pakkokeinoista , f\u00f6rordning om f\u00f6runders\u00f6kning och tv\u00e5ngsmedel ; Act No . DATE ) provides that when questioned during a pre - trial investigation a child must be treated with due respect having regard to his or her age and level of development . Where possible , the interview should be carried out by a police officer acquainted with that task . If need be , a doctor or an expert must be consulted before the interview ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that the investigator may permit a party and his counsel to be present during the questioning of another party or witness , provided this does not hinder the investigation of the offence ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A party and his or her counsel may , with the permission of the investigator , put questions to the person being questioned in order to clear up the case . The investigator may decide that the questions are to be put through him or her . A party and his or her counsel have the right to request the investigator to ask the person being questioned about matters necessary for the clearing up of the case at other times as well ( section CARDINAL , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , FAC provides also that the questioning of a victim or a witness ( from now on referred to as a witness ) must be recorded on videotape , or by using other comparable audio - visual means of recording , if there is an intention to use the statement given in the interview as evidence in court proceedings , and where it is not possible to hear the witness in person , due to his or her young age or disturbed mental state , without causing him or her harm . The special requirements set by the level of that person \u2019s development for the methods used , for the number of participating persons , and for other conditions , must be taken into account . The person in charge of the investigation may also allow other authorities , under supervision of the investigator , to put questions to the witness . The suspect must be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the witness . The suspect may also put the questions through legal counsel or another representative . However , the investigator may order that the questions be put through his or her intermediary ( section LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "B. The receipt of evidence in court", "CARDINAL . At the time of the proceedings in question , apart from the leave to appeal proceedings in ORG , there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of testimony given by a child during the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) lays down the applicable rules on receiving testimony . The relevant provisions at the time of the proceedings in question , as regarded the proceedings in the lower courts , provided as follows .", "CARDINAL . A statement included in a pre - trial investigation report or another document , or a statement recorded by other means , may , as a rule , not be admitted as evidence in court . The court may , exceptionally , admit such a statement as evidence , if the witness in question can not be questioned before the court ( LAW , sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ORG ) , Act No . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

According to the current provisions , the testimony of a person DATE , or a mentally disturbed person , recorded on audio or videotape during the pre - trial investigation , may be used as evidence if the accused has been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to the person giving the testimony ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) , Act No . CARDINAL ) . According to the explanatory report to the relevant Government PERSON ( No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , this new provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to , inter alia , a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . As to hearing a child under DATE , or a mentally disturbed person , LAW , section CARDINAL ( Act No . DATE ) provides that he or she may be heard as a witness , or for the purpose of obtaining evidence , if the court finds it appropriate , and if the hearing in person is of significant relevance for the establishment of the facts of the case , and the hearing is not likely to cause such suffering or other harm as could be detrimental to the person concerned ( from now on referred to as the witness ) or to his or her development . Where necessary , the court shall designate a support person for the witness . The witness shall be questioned by the court , unless it finds particular reason to entrust the questioning to the parties .
