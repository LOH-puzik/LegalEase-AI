On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant and ORG all charges , holding that there was no evidence of force on PERSON body , one of the constituent elements of the offences of rape and unlawful detention . The court further held that despite PERSON \u2019s statement of DATE , the forensic report of DATE had established that the applicant had had intercourse with her . In the absence of evidence that corroborated the fact of the applicant having forced himself on PERSON , it could not be established beyond doubt that the act of sexual intercourse itself had not been consensual . The court stated in that connection that even if PERSON had been drunk that night , her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance . In the light of the conclusion that there had been no indication of a criminal offence committed by the police officers , the court then held that the applicant and ORG could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle .
