The third applicant began his schooling in primary school no . CARDINAL in PERSON in DATE ( at DATE ) . In conformity with the wishes of his parents he did not attend religious instruction . It appears that he was the only pupil in his class who opted out of that subject . Religious instruction was scheduled in the middle of DATE , between various compulsory courses . The school , despite the wish expressed by the first CARDINAL applicants , did not offer their son an alternative class in ethics . It appears that when other pupils in his class were following religious instruction the applicants ' son was either left without any supervision in the corridor or spent his time in the school library or in the school club .", "CARDINAL . The Government , for their part , maintained that appropriate supervision had been provided for PERSON while religious instruction classes were in progress . The school had a general obligation of care and supervision towards all pupils who were on its premises at any time .", "CARDINAL . According to the first CARDINAL applicants , their son was subjected to discrimination and physical and psychological harassment by other pupils on account of the fact that he did not follow religious instruction . For that reason , in the course of DATE of primary school the applicants moved their son to primary school no . CARDINAL and subsequently to primary school no . CARDINAL in the same town .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when their son was in DATE of primary school , the applicants sent a letter to the headmistress of primary school no . CARDINAL in PERSON . They drew her attention to the fact that their son had been ridiculed and harassed by other pupils in the class .

In a letter of DATE the headmistress of primary school no . CARDINAL explained that PERSON had attended that school from DATE to DATE . She noted that he had frequently provoked his colleagues by mocking religious symbols and children who attended religious instruction . The class tutor had informed PERSON and PERSON about their son 's behaviour but they had not responded . The headmistress explained further that the school did not ask for a written declaration as to children 's attendance at religious instruction . It sufficed for a parent who did not wish for his or her child to attend religious instruction to report that fact to the class tutor .", "CARDINAL . The Government further maintained that PERSON and PERSON had requested primary school no . DATE to provide their son with a course in ethics . According to the Government , the headmistress of that school had contacted ORG ( kuratorium o\u015bwiaty ) to establish whether it was possible to provide such a course for an inter - school group . Since that was not possible owing to the lack of sufficient numbers of interested pupils and parents , the school proposed to the third applicant that he participate in alternative classes in the school club or school library . It appears that the applicants did not report any problems to the school concerning their son 's education .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants sent a letter to the Minister of Education , stating that since the beginning of their son 's education they had encountered religious intolerance and that the school authorities had failed to react . They put a number of questions to the Minister concerning the Ordinance on the organisation of religious instruction in ORG schools ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . In particular , the applicants raised the following matters in their letter :", "CARDINAL . NORP Why did some schools require declarations from parents as to whether their children would be following religious instruction ?", "CARDINAL . NORP Was the school obliged to organise a class in ethics just for one pupil ?", "CARDINAL . NORP Why should children like the applicants ' son pass their time unproductively in the school club while other children were attending religious instruction or when the schools were closed for Lent retreat ?", "CARDINAL .

What could parents do when their child was discriminated against and harassed for not having attended religious instruction ?", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to the applicants . In respect of the issues raised by the applicants it informed them as follows :", "Re question CARDINAL : Religious instruction and courses in ethics were organised at the parents ' request , and where a declaration to that effect was asked for , it was for organisational reasons only .", "Re question CARDINAL : If CARDINAL pupil was interested in following a course in ethics , then the school authorities should enquire whether it would be possible to follow that course in an inter - school group . If in a given municipality there was no such group , then the school had to arrange for supervision of the pupil during the religious education class .", "Re question CARDINAL : In the case referred to above the school should organise other activities for pupils not following religious instruction or supervise them adequately by allowing them to do their homework or to use the library , etc .", "Re question CARDINAL : Paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance regulated the manner in which marks for \u201c religion / ethics \u201d were entered in school reports . That provision had been interpreted by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . ORG had noted that the inclusion of marks for \u201c religion / ethics \u201d in a school report was a consequence of providing courses in those subjects in ORG schools . Furthermore , ORG observed that this rule did not breach the right to freedom of conscience and religion .", "Re question CARDINAL : ORG against pupils on the ground of their not having attended religious instruction amounted to a breach of the LAW and should be reported to the relevant education authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also applied to the ORG on DATE , alleging that in their son 's case Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and various other provisions had been breached . The ORG replied that he could not challenge the GPE again following the judgment of ORG of DATE . The problems raised in their letter had more to do with the inappropriate behaviour of some teachers and pupils than the law itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sent a letter to the President of the Republic . They requested him to amend the Ordinance with a view to providing guarantees for non - religious children . On DATE ORG requested ORG to reply to the applicants ' letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed its position as set out in the letter of CARDINAL DATE .

Such a practice would contravene the provisions of the LAW and should be reported to the education authorities . ORG further informed the applicants that the parents ' declaration could not be understood as a declaration concerning their beliefs .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that they had made repeated requests to the school authorities , asking for their son to be allowed to follow a course in ethics instead of religious instruction . However , none of the primary schools attended by their son had provided a course in ethics . The refusals had been based on the lack of suitable teachers , financial reasons and insufficient numbers of pupils interested in following a course in ethics .", "CARDINAL .

It found that PERSON was the only student in all the schools run by LOC whose parents wished him to follow a class in ethics . Accordingly , the conditions for the provision of such a class , as set out in the GPE , had not been met .", "CARDINAL . NORP The school report of the third applicant for DATE of primary school contained CARDINAL subjects : behaviour ( zachowanie ) , religion / ethics and general education .

In the school report for DATE in respect of the subject \u201c religion / ethics \u201d there was a straight line and the word ethics was crossed out . A similar situation applied to the primary school leaving certificate which the third applicant obtained in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The majority of schoolchildren attend State schools . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG issued CARDINAL circulars ( instrukcje ) , introducing instruction in ORG and other religions into ORG schools on a voluntary basis . According to these circulars , parents of primary school pupils and parents and/or pupils in secondary schools were to make a declaration as to whether they wished to attend religious instruction .", "CARDINAL . The ORG challenged the conformity of certain provisions of these circulars with the constitutional provisions in force at the time and the statutory law . She stressed that the problem of religious instruction should be regulated by statute and not by subordinate legislation . The ORG submitted that declarations by parents or students concerning attendance of religious instruction classes constituted a form of public manifestation of their religious convictions . Such a practice ran contrary , in the ORG 's view , to the Freedom of Conscience and Religion Act , which stipulated that citizens had the right not to disclose their religion or beliefs . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the provisions challenged by the ORG were in conformity with the LAW and the statutes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted the PERSON on education ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) . LAW expressly provided that religious instruction could be provided in ORG schools at the request of parents or of pupils who had reached the age of majority .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG replaced the CARDINAL ministerial circulars issued in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Ordinance provided that religious education and ethics were optional subjects . Parents of pupils who wished their children to follow either of those subjects were to make a declaration to the school authorities to that effect . If the number of pupils in a given class interested in following any of these subjects was CARDINAL , then the school was to organise the relevant course for pupils of different classes from the same school ( an inter - class group ) . If the inter - class group was smaller than CARDINAL pupils , the authorities were to organise the relevant course in cooperation with other schools in the municipality ( inter - school group ) , provided that there was a minimum of CARDINAL pupils interested in following it .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The mark for religion or ethics is placed on the school certificate directly after the mark for behaviour . In order to eliminate any possible manifestations of intolerance the school certificate shall not contain any data that would indicate which religion ( or ethics ) course was followed by a pupil . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The mark for religion ( ethics ) has no influence on whether a pupil moves up to the next grade . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG challenged the conformity of numerous provisions of the GPE with the constitutional provisions in force at the material time and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG objected to , among other provisions , paragraph CARDINAL of the GPE , arguing that the insertion of a mark for \u201c religion / ethics \u201d on school reports was unacceptable since reports were official documents issued by ORG schools and the teaching of religion was the prerogative of the ORG . In addition , this provision created the risk of intolerance . He further alleged that the provision in question was in breach of the constitutional principle of separation of ORG and ORG and the principle of the ORG 's neutrality , as provided for in the Freedom of Conscience and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also contested the obligation imposed on parents ( pupils ) to make a \u201c negative declaration \u201d to the effect that they did not wish their children to follow religious instruction in a ORG school ( paragraph PERSON ) of the Ordinance ) . He argued that no public authority in the ORG , which had a duty to remain neutral in the sphere of religious beliefs and philosophical convictions , could require citizens to make such declarations .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further alleged that paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance allowed for excessive display of crucifixes in other places in schools than classrooms designated for religious instruction .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld for the most part the constitutionality and legality of the Ordinance . It noted that the inclusion of religious instruction in the ORG school curriculum did not infringe the constitutional principle of separation of ORG and ORG and the principle of the ORG 's secular character and neutrality . According to ORG , the principles in question required that both ORG remain autonomous in their respective spheres of activity . However , their autonomy should not lead to isolation or even competition between them , but on the contrary should allow them to cooperate in those areas , such as the ethical education of children , which served the common good and the development of the individual . ORG further observed that the secular character of the ORG and its neutrality could not amount to a prohibition on providing religious instruction in ORG schools . Moreover , according to LAW , the provision of religious instruction was always subject to parents ' wishes . Referring , among other provisions , to LAW , ORG noted that the ORG could not escape its obligation to provide religious education which conformed to parents ' wishes .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the GPE should be construed as granting each pupil the right to follow classes in both religion and ethics as opposed to the alternative of choosing CARDINAL of them . Adopting such an interpretation of the Ordinance would deal with the ORG 's concerns about the division of pupils into believers and nonbelievers .", "CARDINAL . As to the insertion of marks for religious instruction in school reports , ORG found it to be in conformity with LAW . Furthermore , it observed that this was a consequence of the provision of religious instruction , on a voluntary basis , by State schools . In accordance with LAW , school reports should contain marks for all subjects ( compulsory and optional ) taken by a pupil in DATE . This rule applied equally to marks for religion if that subject was taught in a ORG school .", "CARDINAL . Replying to the ORG 's concerns , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c In order to dispel possible doubts in this respect , ORG indicated in the seventh point of the operative part of its judgment that a mark on a school report may refer not just to religious instruction alone or to ethics alone ; in cases where a pupil follows both those courses he or she may be given a joint mark [ for the CARDINAL subjects ] . The impugned provision therefore contains a dual safeguard . First , a mark shown on the school report does not indicate any specific religion , and secondly it is not known whether such a mark relates to religious instruction , ethics or both subjects jointly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the obligation to make a \u201c negative declaration \u201d , ORG struck down paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Ordinance on the grounds of its incompatibility with LAW . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Ordinance as amended made no reference to a \u201c negative declaration \u201d . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the display of the crucifix in State schools , ORG found that the paragraph CARDINAL of the GPE provided for such a possibility but did not mandate the presence of the crucifix in schools . Accordingly , this provision was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the DATE LAW provides :", "\u201c Public authorities in GPE shall be impartial in matters of religious and philosophical convictions , and shall ensure freedom to express them in public life . \u201d", "LAW provides :", "\u201c Parents shall have the right to raise their children in accordance with their own convictions .

No one may be compelled by organs of public authority to disclose his philosophy of life , religious convictions or beliefs .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court was asked to review the constitutionality of amendments to LAW . The amendments repealed the provisions of a number of laws regulating relations between certain Churches and the ORG , which granted the former the right to have marks for their religious instruction entered in school reports . ORG upheld the constitutionality of the impugned provisions and held that the Churches concerned were not , in fact , divested of the above - mentioned right . Following the entry into force of the amendments , the ORG simply had to fulfil the conditions set out in the Ordinance of the Minister of ORG on the organisation of religious instruction in ORG schools , which were equally applicable to all Churches and religious organisations .", "CARDINAL .

The amended Ordinance introduced for the first time the rule that marks obtained for religious instruction or ethics , as well as other optional courses , would be counted towards the \u201c average mark \u201d obtained by a pupil in DATE and at the end of a given level of schooling . The amended Ordinance entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG in its judgment of DATE held that the impugned amendments to the LAW on the marking of pupils ' work were compatible with LAW , DATE , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the LAW . ORG found , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The counting of the mark for religion towards the average DATE mark and the final mark is DATE as the [ Constitutional ] Court emphasises again \u2013 a consequence of the introduction of religious education into the school curriculum and of the recording of marks for religion on school reports in ORG schools . It is a consequence of the constitutional guarantees of religious freedom rather than of support for theistic beliefs . On the basis of the existing regulations , pupils ( or their parents or legal guardians ) have the possibility to choose between classes in a specific religion or classes in ethics as an alternative subject for those who do not hold religious beliefs . The LAW does not provide specific guarantees for instruction in the beliefs enumerated by the claimant ( atheistic , pantheistic or deistic ) . It would be difficult even from an organisational viewpoint to offer such a range of subjects to choose from . The knowledge necessary at this level of teaching can be gained by interested [ pupils ] , for instance , in the framework of the subject ' ethics ' or other subjects coming into the category of ' additional educational courses ' which are mentioned in the impugned ordinance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the reasoning , ORG relied on and confirmed the findings made in its judgment of DATE . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ORG points out that the issue of conformity of the inclusion of marks for religion in official school reports with section CARDINAL ) of the Freedom of Conscience and LAW , which stipulates that ' GPE is a secular ORG , neutral in the sphere of religion and beliefs ' , was already reviewed by ORG in its judgment of DATE , case ORG . The subject of the review ( also under LAW of LAW ) was paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance of DATE . ... Ruling in the above case , inter alia , that paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance of DATE was compatible with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( and with LAW ) , the Court held that :", "' The recording of marks for religion in school reports is a consequence of the organisation of religious instruction by ORG schools . ...
