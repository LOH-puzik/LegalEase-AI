NORP In DATE the applicant was convicted in GPE of criminal damage , burglary , arson and aggravated theft ( offences committed during his stay in the above - mentioned residential unit ) and sentenced to DATE in prison . In DATE , and at the request of ORG , ORG granted a warrant ( pursuant to ORG ) allowing the applicant to serve the balance of his DATE sentence in PERSON Institution ( \u201c PERSON PERSON 's \u201d ) in GPE .

He slept rough the first night of his release and subsequently resided on a temporary basis in a homeless boys ' hostel run on a voluntary basis by a priest . From then until the judicial review proceedings ( described below ) issued , the applicant 's solicitor wrote to the Board CARDINAL times requesting that proper accommodation be made available to the applicant . A case conference was held on DATE where it was agreed that his needs would be met in a high - support therapeutic unit for CARDINAL- to DATE but that no such unit existed in GPE and could not be put in place in time for the applicant 's needs . It was decided that ORG would look into placements outside GPE and into interim options in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a guardian ad litem and gave the applicant leave to apply for judicial review ( citing , inter alia , ORG and the Attorney - General as respondents ) for ( a ) a declaration that , in failing to provide suitable care and accommodation for the applicant and in discriminating against him as compared with other children , the respondents deprived the applicant of his constitutional rights under , in particular , Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) , QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant referred in this context to his being a child at risk , namely dangerous to himself and potentially to others , and pointed out that the lack of appropriate care meant that his rights had not been vindicated ; ( b ) an order of mandamus and an injunction directing the respondents to provide suitable care and accommodation for the applicant were also requested . The grounds submitted by the applicant related to the ORG 's failure to comply with its statutory duties to provide such accommodation under sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE LAW DATE ; and ( c ) damages , although the applicant had submitted that he would suffer irreparable loss and damage for which monetary compensation would not suffice ( hence the application for an order of mandamus and an injunction ) .", "CARDINAL . The application for interlocutory relief ( namely for relief until the making of a final order following the hearing of the case ) came before ORG on DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . However , on DATE the applicant was assaulted by another resident with an iron bar and taken to hospital with a fractured skull . He was operated on and subsequently discharged on DATE and spent TIME in bed - and - breakfast accommodation . On DATE the application was adjourned on the basis that the applicant would reside in the hostel ( run by the priest ) under continuous CARDINAL-hour supervision of childcare workers of ORG . ORG was to continue its enquiries for a suitable facility . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant reside in PERSON , another hostel , under the care of social workers of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The interlocutory matter was again considered by ORG on DATE . Evidence was presented to the effect that the applicant 's continued residence in that hostel was no longer feasible . Evidence was also heard from the ORG 's leader responsible for the applicant 's case who stated that the ORG 's facilities could no longer cater for the applicant . A consultant psychiatrist at ORG in GPE gave evidence to the effect , inter alia , that he knew of no services in the ORG that could even start to address the problems the applicant represented . A report was presented detailing a number of serious incidents , including threats of assault made by the applicant , and the court heard the legal submissions of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The High Court delivered its judgment on DATE . ORG judge commented at the outset as follows :", "\u201c This is yet another case in which the ORG is called upon to exercise an original LAW jurisdiction with a view to protecting the interests and promoting the welfare of a minor . The application arises because of the failure of the ORG to provide an appropriate facility to cater for the particular needs of this applicant and others like him . It is common case that what is required to deal with his problem is a secure unit where he can be detained and looked after . No such unit exists in this ORG and even if one did , there is no statutory power given to the ORG to direct the applicant 's detention there . Such being the case , and in the absence of either legislation to deal with the matter or the facilities to cater for the applicant , I have in the short - term to do the best that I can with what is available to me . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment described the applicant 's history and family situation as \u201c quite appalling \u201d . He was CARDINAL of a family of CARDINAL children . His father was serving a life sentence for murder and serious sexual offences . His mother lived a \u201c chaotic lifestyle \u201d , refusing to settle in any type of permanent accommodation . Of his siblings , CARDINAL led a normal life . The others were in care , in detention or were drug users .", "CARDINAL . On the evidence before it , ORG accepted that the applicant was not mentally ill but that he had a serious personality disorder ; that he was a danger to himself and to others ; that he had a history of criminal activity , violence and arson ; that he had absconded from non - secure institutions ; that he had failed to cooperate with ORG and its staff ; and that he had failed to cooperate in the carrying out of a psychiatric assessment of him in the past . It was \u201c common case \u201d that the applicant required a \u201c secure unit where he can be detained and looked after \u201d and that no such unit existed in GPE . ORG judge considered the welfare of the child to be paramount , noted the conflicting constitutional right to liberty of the applicant and observed that the evidence before him as to the child 's needs and the facilities available would resolve the conflict . The court considered that there were CARDINAL possible options .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , ORG could order the applicant 's release from the custody of ORG . However , given the real risk of serious self - injury possibly resulting in death , this option was excluded . Secondly , the applicant could be sent back to PERSON . However , given the danger he posed to himself and to others and his previous lack of cooperation , the ORG ruled out this possibility . The third option was ORG but the evidence before ORG and the applicant 's own preference ruled out this option .", "CARDINAL . The fourth option was the applicant 's detention in PERSON , which option was adopted with \u201c considerable reluctance \u201d by the court as the only manner of vindicating the applicant 's constitutional rights . ORG acknowledged that it was a penal institution . However , having noted the conflicting constitutional rights of the applicant , the applicant 's needs , the constitutional obligations of the ORG to the applicant and the relevant jurisprudence of the High and ORG in similar cases , the High Court judge was satisfied that the evidence supported his findings that , in the absence of any other facility within the State , the place most suitable to ensure the applicant 's welfare was PERSON , and that ORG could exercise its \u201c inherent jurisdiction \u201d developed by the jurisprudence ( to which the judgment referred ) in making an order for the applicant 's detention there . It was noted that the applicant had been in that institution previously and seemed to have done well there . Accordingly , he ordered that the applicant be brought to PERSON by the police and be detained there for DATE ( until DATE ) , all parties agreeing that detention for longer was not appropriate . ORG judge pointed out in conclusion that he was", "\u201c extremely unhappy at having to make this order ... but of the CARDINAL options available to [ him ] it is the CARDINAL which , in [ his ] view , is best suited to the welfare and needs of this applicant in the short term . It is not a solution . None of the other options are a solution either . But of the CARDINAL unattractive options it seems to [ him ] that from the welfare of this applicant it is the least offensive and in [ his ] view his welfare will be best served by being committed there as [ he has ] ordered \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Certain conditions were attached to the order by ORG . The applicant was to be subject to the \u201c normal discipline \u201d of that institution and was to have a full psychiatric assessment . The \u201c fullest cooperation \u201d was requested by ORG between ORG and the authorities of the institution as regards access by the staff of ORG to the applicant to allow the professionals who had been dealing with the applicant to have input into his welfare whilst in PERSON , provided that that did not create insuperable difficulties from the point of view of the management of the institution . In particular , ORG recommended that the normal visiting restrictions applicable be waived as much as possible in the vital TIME after the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG concerns about the suicide risks presented by the applicant were to be notified to the Governor of GPE PERSON 's and the appropriate facilities were to be put in place in this respect . ORG was to receive a report by the psychiatric staff of GPE PERSON 's and by ORG on the applicant 's progress , if any , and on his general well - being by DATE . There was to be liaison between the ORG and the guardian ad litem , the latter of whom was to obtain the reports to be prepared for the court on the applicant . In the meantime , ORG was to continue to try to find a suitable place for the applicant 's needs outside the jurisdiction and the matter was to be reviewed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE ) the applicant was brought to PERSON and placed in a padded cell TIME .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the Chief Officer informed the applicant of the rules and regulations , the daily routine and of the services that were on offer ( educational , welfare , spiritual , library , gym , work and recreation ) , which latter matters were detailed in a booklet given to the applicant . The applicant was asked if he wished to attend educational classes . He made no such request and did not participate in the institution 's educational programme .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He referred to the ORG 's failure to fulfil its statutory duties under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE and to respond to his constitutional rights under LAW . He also submitted that detention in a penal institution did not appropriately harmonise his conflicting rights under LAW and LAW ( CARDINAL ) . He also dealt , in his submissions , with the place of detention proposed by ORG arguing that , if detention was necessary and lawful to protect and vindicate a child 's rights , detention in a penal institution was not . A penal institution is a place of punishment , the effect of detention there , with or without conviction , constituted punishment and it was completely different to a high - security unit staffed by qualified childcare workers and operated in a manner consistent with LAW . His placement in a suitable high security environment would be more appropriate to his needs and the effect of such an order would be to oblige the Board to comply with its statutory duties and the ORG to comply with its constitutional duties through the ORG . He also relied on LAW ( d ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor prepared a short conduct report for ORG in which he noted that the applicant was well behaved , mixed freely with other inmates and had not come under any adverse attention .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the applicant 's appeal on DATE and reserved judgment . Judgment was delivered on DATE and , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , rejected the appeal . The Chief Justice gave the main judgment of ORG ( CARDINAL judges concurring ) and described the issues before him as being whether ORG had jurisdiction to order the detention of the applicant and , if so , whether that jurisdiction extended to making an order directing the applicant 's detention in a penal institution and , if so , whether the jurisdiction was properly exercised in the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Justice noted that ( apart from the particular jurisdiction assigned by the LAW and by the Statute ) ORG has an inherent jurisdiction \u201c as ample as the defence of the LAW requires \u201d . The Chief Justice noted the conflicting constitutional rights of the applicant at issue in the case : on the one hand , he had the right to liberty ( Article CARDINAL ) and , on the other hand , he had the unenumerated right \u201c to be fed and to live , to be reared and educated , to have the opportunity of working and of realising his or her personality and dignity as a human being \u201d . The Chief Justice accepted that ORG could be called upon to establish a priority of such rights as the case demanded . He noted that all parties agreed that the applicant 's welfare ( which was of paramount importance ) required his detention in a \u201c safe and secure unit \u201d , but he regretted that ORG judge was forced , by reason of the lack of any suitable facility , to order the applicant 's detention in a penal institution .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the Chief Justice was satisfied that ORG had jurisdiction to make the order it did , that it did so in a lawful manner consistent with the requirements of the welfare of the applicant and that ORG was correct in exercising such jurisdiction for a short period of time . He added , however , that the exercise by the courts of their jurisdiction in the case should not be considered by the respondents in the proceedings to relieve them of their statutory obligations regarding the applicant and that they should continue their efforts to make suitable alternative arrangements consistent with the needs of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . A fourth judge considered that ORG jurisdiction had not been directly disputed by the parties , and went on to agree with the option chosen by ORG . The fifth and dissenting judge in ORG considered that it was not for the courts to conjure up the necessary accommodation but to protect and vindicate the child 's rights and for the ORG to address its statutory duties and obligations . It was , in that judge 's view , a step too far to order the child 's detention in a penal institution having regard to his moral , intellectual , physical and social welfare and his rights to liberty , equality and bodily integrity .", "CARDINAL . The High Court heard further expert evidence on DATE and apparently the applicant had been cooperative in PERSON . ORG continued his detention in PERSON until DATE on the conditions previously applicable , the ORG being required to inform the court on the return date of the full details and efforts made to provide facilities for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted that it had identified a property which would take a short time to equip and staff to enable it to receive the applicant and it was indicated that it would be ready by DATE . ORG also indicated that the applicant was to travel to GPE to be assessed with a view to possible placement there . While the applicant wanted to be immediately released , his guardian ad litem considered that he should not be left on the street . ORG directed his continued detention in PERSON until DATE and that every effort should be made by ORG to ensure that the relevant property be ready to receive the applicant by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from PERSON by order of ORG . Apart from basic personal details and the relevant court orders constituting authority for detention , the applicant 's file from that institution contains few entries and his \u201c prisoner 's profile \u201d forms were mainly not filled in . There was a note to the effect that he had been placed in a padded cell in DATE and a copy of the Governor 's report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE ) the applicant was placed in the accommodation prepared by the ORG under CARDINAL-hour supervision . He was allowed to leave the LOC occasionally for limited periods . Leave was also given to take the applicant to GPE for assessment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then absconded from that property and a warrant for his arrest was issued by ORG on DATE . He was arrested and brought before ORG on DATE . On DATE , and having heard submissions from counsel for the applicant and ORG together with the evidence on behalf of ORG and of the applicant , ORG ordered the applicant 's detention in PERSON until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

By DATE ORG was to be in possession of a report in relation to the applicant 's drug - addiction problem prepared by ORG and the staff of PERSON .
