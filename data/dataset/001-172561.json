A psychologist present at the meeting concluded that it was impossible to hand the child over at that point in time as he was in a state of psychological stress and had a clearly negative attitude to his mother .

The father was categorically opposed to contact between the child and the mother , which meant the child was afraid to express his need and wish to maintain a relationship with her . The child missed having contact with his mother , but could not express that openly for fear of his father \u2019s disapproval . The child suffered from parental alienation syndrome and there was a risk to his emotional and psychological development . On DATE the social centre put an end to the counselling because of Kh .

P. exhibited a tendency to verbal aggression , that he continuously demeaned the mother and criticised her personality and that this had turned the child into \u201c a child at risk \u201d . The obsessive and controlling love demonstrated by him towards the child risked making him rebel in the future ; the permanent pitching of the child against the third applicant had led to psychosomatic disorders , as evidenced by the child \u2019s frequent headaches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant asked the bailiff to schedule a new date for implementing the court \u2019s decision and to not suspend enforcement . She also asked the bailiff to direct the child to attend mandatory sessions with a psychologist and psychiatrist before his actual handing over to her , given that he needed specialist assistance to overcome his feelings of alienation towards her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant asked the social services to provide her child with psychological counselling and support .

On DATE she asked the bailiff to order DATE meetings between her and the child on the premises of the social services , emphasising that that was something to which Kh . P. had agreed but with which he had not complied . The third applicant also stressed that the child \u2019s health and well - being were the most important aspects of the process and asked the bailiff to coordinate all the actions related to the child \u2019s attendance at counselling sessions . On DATE the third applicant sent documents to the bailiff issued by the social services directing the child to attend psychological counselling and support with a view to reestablishing contact with his mother .

The first meeting was set for DATE but did not take place as Kh . P. did not take the child to it .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant subsequently received a letter from ORG for ORG , which directed her to seek counselling from the social services . The report drawn up in that connection indicated that the negative attitude displayed by the father towards the mother had been adopted by the child , who refused to meet his mother . It was necessary to work with the child for him to overcome his negative attitude to his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant wrote to the bailiff , copying in the social services , and expressed her concern about the child \u2019s well - being .

A report , dated DATE and drawn up by the municipal social services , stated that specialists had met with the third applicant on QUANTITY occasions . She was found to be cooperative and willing to do whatever was necessary in order to facilitate contact with her child . The report concluded that it was not in the child \u2019s interests to continue to live with his father given that he manipulated him emotionally . The child did not dare to oppose the father as he was entirely dependent on him . The child \u2019s alienation from the mother was damaging for him as he needed her close involvement in his life . It was necessary to impose mandatory psychological counselling on the father in order for him to cooperate , otherwise the child had to be taken out of his home and either entrusted to the third applicant or placed in a \u201c neutral environment \u201d . The placing of the child into a foster home had to be only considered as a last resort , if the father continued to obstruct contact with the mother .", "CARDINAL . NORP The bailiff scheduled another meeting , for DATE , to hand the child over to the third applicant but PERSON . P. again failed to appear . The bailiff postponed further enforcement to an unspecified date . The third applicant signed the report drawn up by the bailiff , expressing her discontent at the bailiff \u2019s inability to enforce the judicial decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant complained to the prosecutor under LAW of LAW about Kh . P. \u2019s active obstruction of the enforcement of the judicial decision granting custody to her . The prosecutor opened criminal proceedings and informed the third applicant of his decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A full psychological expert report on the child was drawn up on DATE in the context of those proceedings . The report \u2019s conclusion was that the child should not be forced to see his mother at that point in time . What was needed was systematic good - faith efforts by the father aimed at improving the child \u2019s attitude to his mother . Pressure from public institutions for the child to see his mother was likely to have a negative impact on him and so developing a relationship with his mother had to happen gradually . The report emphasised that if the child were to receive his father \u2019s support he would in all likelihood open up to his mother and develop a close relationship with her .", "CARDINAL . Kh . P. was acquitted at the end of the proceedings in a final judgment of DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the child , represented by Kh . P. , brought court proceedings against the third applicant , alleging acts of domestic violence by her . The child alleged , through his father , that he had been put under constant psychological pressure by his mother , which had led to sleep disturbances and restlessness and a fear that she could appear at any time in the street and kidnap him . He claimed that he had developed a headache , felt sick and had even vomited during the latest attempt to reunite him with his mother on DATE . Experts questioned in the proceedings found that the child tended to identify himself with the father and his active denial of his mother was damaging for him . The experts concluded that it was imperative for the child \u2019s well - being to provide him with urgent psychological therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court rejected an application for a restraining order on the third applicant . In particular , the court found the complaint about psychological violence ill - founded as it had been based on the mother \u2019s repeated attempts to have the bailiff hand the child over to her in accordance with the court \u2019s decision . The court held that the third applicant had been right to seek effective enforcement of the decision granting custody to her , just as Kh . P. had been obliged to comply with that decision . The court concluded that the child \u2019s well - being was at risk as a result of the ongoing , open animosity between the parents and ruled that a copy of the judgment should be sent to the social services with a view to them taking appropriate measures . There is no information on file about whether that court \u2019s decision was appealed against .", "CARDINAL . Kh . P. brought proceedings in DATE to be given custody of the child .

The fourth applicant turned to ORG a number of times and the agency urged the mother to allow contact between the child and the fourth applicant , as set out in the court decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding those efforts , the fourth applicant submitted that he was still unable to see the child owing to the obstacles created by the mother .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the fourth applicant complained to the prosecutor . In DATE the prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings , finding in particular that the child \u2019s mother had earlier been fined for impeding contact between the child and the fourth applicant , and that it would be unlawful to sanction her twice for the same offence . On appeal , the higher prosecutor returned the case for further examination . In DATE the district prosecutor opened criminal proceedings against the child \u2019s mother for obstructing the implementation of a judicial decision . The prosecutor terminated those proceedings on the basis of the fact that the child systematically refused to spend time alone with her father , but the firstinstance court later quashed that decision and returned the case for further consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a different district prosecutor again terminated the proceedings , a decision that was upheld by courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . The highest court involved , ORG , found more specifically that instead of pursuing a constructive dialogue with the child \u2019s mother with a view to seeing the child , the fourth applicant had resorted to forced enforcement proceedings , which had been unsuitable in the circumstances and had meant the child had been scared to go with him as he had always been accompanied by strangers .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant applied for a divorce on DATE . The court granted it on CARDINAL DATE , granting custody to the mother , PERSON , and giving contact rights to the applicant .

On DATE PERSON sought a change in the arrangements for contact between the fourth applicant and the child . She expressed serious concerns about the child \u2019s well - being and , in particular , voiced a fear that the father , having acted deceitfully in the past , might emigrate to GPE with his new wife , taking the child without PERSON \u2019s agreement or knowledge . She specified that the fourth applicant had proposed that she give up the child so that his new wife could adopt her . She also stated that he had not sought to have contact with the child since DATE and had arrived at her dwelling on DATE for the first time with several strangers ; that had scared the child and she had refused to go with her father .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant submitted during those proceedings that he had had a hernia operation in DATE and had been put on sick leave until DATE . As a result , he had been unwell and had not been in a position to collect the child , whom he had only seen at her kindergarten .

On DATE the fourth applicant complained to social services that PERSON had been preventing him from seeing his daughter since DATE and that the mother was not caring for the child appropriately . He stated that it was the latter \u2019s grandmother , who suffered from a psychiatric condition , who was the child \u2019s main care - giver . The social services carried out an inquiry and established in a report of CARDINAL September CARDINAL that the child was not being brought up by her grand - mother but enjoyed the DATE care and support of her mother .

The bailiff further fined ORG respectively on CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , referring to her continued failure to hand the child over to the father , beginning from CARDINAL DATE . PERSON brought judicial review proceedings in respect of the last fine , submitting that she had systematically prepared the child for her DATE stays with her father , but that the child had regularly refused to go with him after he had arrived at meetings in the company of strangers . On DATE ORG quashed the fine of DATE . The court held that the bailiff should have attempted different means for enforcing the judgment before resorting to repeated fines . It set out his prerogatives under the law and emphasised that the bailiff was expected to be present when the child was handed over and to draw up reports on the particular circumstances , instead of relying on declarations signed by the parties or by individuals selected by them .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the fourth applicant requested that further fines be imposed on PERSON for not being at home when he had gone to take the child .
