The relevant extract from the Report read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In many NORP countries the number of life - sentenced and other long - term prisoners is on the increase . During some of its visits , the ORG has found that the situation of such prisoners left much to be desired in terms of material conditions , activities and possibilities for human contact . Further , many such prisoners were subject to special restrictions likely to exacerbate the deleterious effects inherent in long - term imprisonment ; examples of such restrictions are permanent separation from the rest of the prison population , handcuffing whenever the prisoner is taken out of his cell , prohibition of communication with other prisoners , and limited visit entitlements . The ORG can see no justification for indiscriminately applying restrictions to all prisoners subject to a specific type of sentence , without giving due consideration to the individual risk they may ( or may not ) present .", "Long - term imprisonment can have a number of desocialising effects upon inmates . In addition to becoming institutionalised , long - term prisoners may experience a range of psychological problems ( including loss of self - esteem and impairment of social skills ) and have a tendency to become increasingly detached from society ; to which almost all of them will eventually return . In the view of the ORG , the regimes which are offered to prisoners serving long sentences should seek to compensate for these effects in a positive and proactive way .", "The prisoners concerned should have access to a wide range of purposeful activities of a varied nature ( work , preferably with vocational value ; education ; sport ; recreation / association ) . Moreover , they should be able to exercise a degree of choice over the manner in which their time is spent , thus fostering a sense of autonomy and personal responsibility . Additional steps should be taken to lend meaning to their period of imprisonment ; in particular , the provision of individualised custody plans and appropriate psycho - social support are important elements in assisting such prisoners to come to terms with their period of incarceration and , when the time comes , to prepare for release . Further , the negative effects of institutionalisation upon prisoners serving long sentences will be less pronounced , and they will be better equipped for release , if they are able effectively to maintain contact with the outside world . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
