The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s father , PERSON , who was a war veteran , killed the applicant \u2019s mother and her parents and then committed suicide .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , represented by his grandmother , sought family disability benefit in connection with the suicide of his father , arguing that the suicide was a consequence of mental derangement caused by his participation in the war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his request was dismissed by the competent ORG of ORG ( ORG obrane ) in charge of war veterans\u2019 affairs on the grounds that the war veteran status of his father had not been established . In DATE the applicant challenged that decision before ORG , which accepted his appeal and on DATE quashed the first - instance decision and remitted the case for re - examination on the grounds that the nature of the applicant \u2019s request had not been adequately established .", "CARDINAL . Following several procedural decisions of ORG with responsibility for war veterans\u2019 affairs ( hereinafter : the \u201c ORG \u201d ) and ORG in charge of war veterans\u2019 affairs ( ORG branitelja i me\u0111ugeneracijske solidarnosti ; hereinafter : the \u201c Ministry \u201d ) , on DATE ORG ( Upravni sud PERSON ) ordered ORG and ORG to examine the applicant \u2019s request for family disability benefit on the merits , which the applicant should have a possibility to challenge if he was not be satisfied with the outcome .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request on the grounds that nothing from the materials available in the case file suggested that the death of his father was a result of his participation in the war .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged this decision before the Ministry , and on DATE the Ministry found that the facts of the case connecting the suicide of the applicant \u2019s father to his participation in the war had never been clearly established . It thus ordered ORG to clarify the matter by commissioning an expert report from the competent medical institution and to obtain the relevant witness statements concerning the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s wartime service .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of ORG instructions , ORG commissioned an expert report concerning the question whether the suicide of the applicant \u2019s father was related to his participation in the war from ORG of ORG , ORG , ORG for GPE in GPE ( PERSON , PERSON za psihijatriju , PERSON centar GPE zdravstva i socijalne skrbi za poreme\u0107aje uzrokovane stresom , Regionalni centar za psihotraumu GPE ; hereinafter : the \u201c Centre \u201d ) , a public health care institution authorised by law to give expert opinions on matters related to war veterans\u2019 psychiatric disorders ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also questioned CARDINAL witnesses concerning the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s wartime service .", "CARDINAL . In an expert report dated DATE addressed to ORG , the ORG concluded , on the basis of the available medical reports and the statements of witnesses , that the applicant \u2019s father had not developed any symptoms resulting in a psychiatric diagnosis linked to his participation in the war and that his suicide could not be attributed to his wartime service . This expert report was not forwarded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the family disability benefit referring to the ORG expert report , which had not established any link between his father \u2019s suicide and his participation in the war .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the above decision before the ORG , seeking remittal of the case to ORG for further examination . He alleged that the ORG \u2019s report was superficial , since it had not been commissioned with regard to all aspects of the events , such as the triple murder committed by his father . The applicant also considered the report to be illogical , given that before the war his father had had no psychiatric problems whereas after his wartime activities he had committed a triple murder and suicide , which made it difficult to accept that he had not developed some mental condition . The applicant further contended that another expert report should be commissioned from CARDINAL of the permanent court experts in psychiatry , since the report produced by the ORG raised the issue of its independence . He also stressed that any expert opinion on the matter should necessarily be forwarded to him for comments before the adoption of a decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the grounds that the ORG \u2019s report was conclusive that the suicide of his father had not been related to his participation in the war .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an administrative action in ORG against the above decision , asking ORG to decide the case on the merits instead of remitting it to the administrative bodies . He pointed out that the proceedings had already lasted excessively long and that the administrative bodies had failed to comply effectively with the previous instructions of ORG . He therefore considered that ORG should itself decide the case on the merits , as provided under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant also contended that , if ORG did not decide the case on the merits , it should quash the ORG \u2019s decision and remit the case for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . In his administrative action the applicant in particular pointed out that the Ministry had failed to reply to the specific arguments set out in his appeal against the first - instance decision of ORG and had merely reiterated the findings of the first - instance decision . He also reiterated his appeal arguments that the ORG \u2019s expert report was superficial and illogical , since it had not been commissioned with regard to all aspects of the events , such as the triple murder committed by his father , and that it had failed to take into account that before the war his father had had no psychiatric problems whereas after his wartime activities he had committed a triple murder and suicide . In these circumstances , the applicant stressed that under LAW of LAW another expert report ought to be commissioned from the permanent court experts in psychiatry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action as ill - founded . In particular , it stressed :", "\u201c During the proceedings an expert report was commissioned , under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) of the [ GPE ] , from the [ Centre ] and the report was produced on DATE . The report concluded that based on the relevant documents from the case file it did not find that ORG had developed any symptoms resulting in a psychiatric diagnosis linked to his participation in the war ...", "Having these facts in mind , this court is of the opinion that the defendant acted lawfully when dismissing the appellant \u2019s appeal against the first - instance decision ... It should also be noted that this court already held that the formation of an expert team [ competent to determine ] a possible link [ between death and participation in the war ] , which [ provides for ] a decisive evidence within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) of the [ GPE ] , is a precondition for any further proceedings concerning the status of the family member of a deceased war veteran .", "The defendant therefore correctly dismissed the appeal against the first - instance decision and thereby it did not act contrary to the relevant law . This court did not find it necessary to act under LAW of LAW given that , as already noted above , the administrative body complied with the instruction from the judgement no . Us-CARDINAL/CARDINAL [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] concerning the appellant \u2019s request for family disability benefit , which is the subject matter of the proceedings at issue . Although the defendant did not expressly reply to the appeal arguments concerning the necessity to request a report with regard to [ ORG ] act of triple murder , [ the court finds ] that it could not be a decisive factor for a decision in the proceedings at hand . This is because such a criminal act can not be a basis for the establishment of a link between the death of the war veteran and his participation in [ the war ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) arguing that his right to a fair trial in the proceedings had been violated . He contended in particular that the administrative bodies and ORG had ignored his request for an expert report to be commissioned from the permanent court experts and that he had been offered neither the possibility of participating in the choice of experts nor the opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on the expert opinion before the adoption of a decision during the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded , noting that :", "\u201c In his constitutional complaint , the complainant was unable to show that ORG had acted contrary to the constitutional provisions concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms or had arbitrarily interpreted the relevant statutory provisions . ORG therefore finds that the present case does not raise an issue of the complainant \u2019s constitutional rights . Thus , there is no constitutional law issue in the case for ORG to decide on . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The decision of ORG was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
