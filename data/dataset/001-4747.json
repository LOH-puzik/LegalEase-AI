He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A. Particular circumstances of the present case", "On DATE , the applicant was placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion of having committed CARDINAL armed robberies . By summons of DATE , he was ordered to appear on DATE before ORG ( PERSON in PERSON ) of GPE . On DATE , ORG of GPE handed down its judgment . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( FAC ) of GPE and GPE . The applicant 's case - file was received at ORG on DATE .", "ORG of Justice started its examination of the applicant 's case on CARDINAL DATE , when it adjourned its examination , as the applicant wished to be represented by a new lawyer who had not studied the case - file . On DATE , a second hearing was held before ORG of Justice . It appeared that yet another lawyer had taken over the applicant 's case . The new lawyer sought an adjournment of the proceedings with a view to hearing a number of witnesses before the court , whose names the lawyer would communicate at some further point in time . ORG of Justice granted this request and adjourned its examination until DATE . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the defence submitted the names of CARDINAL witnesses , including PERSON , whom the defence wished to hear before ORG of Justice .", "On DATE , CARDINAL witnesses appeared and were heard before ORG of Justice . After these CARDINAL witnesses had given evidence , the defence sought a further adjournment in order to hear CARDINAL of the CARDINAL witnesses who had not appeared , namely GPE and GPE , and a further witness ORG granted the request and adjourned its further examination until DATE .", "On DATE , on the basis of an order of ORG , the witness GPE was heard before the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) . Although PERSON had also been summoned to give evidence before the investigating judge , this witness failed to appear before the investigating judge .", "At the hearing of DATE , the President of ORG stated that CARDINAL witnesses had been heard on DATE and that a further witness had been heard before the investigating judge . He further stated that it had been ordered that the witness GPE be forcibly brought ( medebrenging ) before ORG of Justice , but that this witness had not appeared . The defence persisted in its request that PERSON be heard . The prosecution objected to a further stay of the proceedings and argued that the applicant , who had been represented throughout the proceedings , had been provided with ample opportunity to have witnesses heard . After having deliberated , ORG of Justice decided to reject the request by the defence to hear GPE", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG of Justice convicted the applicant of theft involving threat to use violence and use of violence having caused death , extortion and unlawful possession of a fire - arm , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , including a complaint of the length of the proceedings . On DATE , the applicant 's case - file was transmitted by ORG to ORG , where it arrived on DATE . ORG examined the applicant 's case for the first time on DATE .", "In his conclusions , the Procurator General ( Procureur - Generaal ) to ORG advised ORG , inter alia , to reject the applicant 's complaint under LAW in respect of the delay between CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . He noted that the applicant , who had been represented by a lawyer in the proceedings on appeal , had not raised this complaint in the proceedings before ORG of Justice and considered that this complaint could not be raised for the first time in cassation proceedings before ORG . He further considered that the delay was not of such a nature that ORG of Justice should ex officio have examined the compatibility of this delay with LAW .", "Insofar as the applicant complained of the delay between DATE and the first examination of the applicant 's appeal in cassation , the Procurator General advised ORG to reject this complaint on the basis of a finding that this delay was not so long that the applicant 's right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated . The Procurator General further considered that the total length of the proceedings against the applicant , i.e. DATE , had also not exceeded a reasonable time .", "ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal in cassation by judgment of DATE . Referring to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) , ORG further rejected the applicant 's complaint of the length of proceedings as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and development .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , hereinafter referred to as \" former ORG \" ) , as in force at the relevant time , a judgment must contain reasons and express the punishable fact including the circumstances which may lead to a mitigated or aggravated sentence . It must further contain findings on what facts have been found proven or not , the legal qualification of the facts found proven , the question of the accused person 's guilt and the application of the statutory defined punishment . Pursuant to LAW former ORG , a judgment must be signed by the judge , who has decided the case , and the registrar within TIME after its delivery . Although the former ORG contains no explicit obligation that a judgment should contain the means of evidence on which a conviction is based , in practice such means were set out in judgments leading to a conviction .", "However , since DATE pursuant to LAW has to deliver the judgment within DATE following the closure of the trial , it was not unusual at the relevant time that initially an abridged judgment would be drafted in cases where the accused was convicted . Such a judgment does not account for the means of evidence on which the conviction is based . A complete version of the judgment was not prepared unless the convicted person or the public prosecutor lodged an appeal against the judgment . In that case the means of evidence were included in the judgment and the case - file , including the complete judgment , was transmitted to the appeal court .", "In a judgment of DATE ( nr . CARDINAL.CARDINAL A ) , concerning an appeal in cassation against a judgment of DATE of ORG of GPE and GPE in which a complaint was raised that the period of time which had elapsed DATE on which ORG had handed down its judgment and the first examination of the appeal in cassation constituted a delay contrary to the reasonable time requirement under LAW , ORG noted that the appeal in cassation had been filed on DATE , that the pertaining case - file had been received by ORG on DATE and that the appeal in cassation had been examined for the first time on DATE .", "ORG considered that no special circumstances had appeared which could justify DATE that had elapsed DATE and DATE . It concluded that , therefore , the reasonable time requirement under LAW had not been met and that , on this basis , the sentence imposed on the applicant should be mitigated . ORG quashed the determination of the applicant 's sentence and referred the case back to ORG of Justice of GPE and GPE for a new determination of the applicant 's sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
