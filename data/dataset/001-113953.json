In DATE he was extradited from GPE to GPE for a criminal prosecution . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of attempted murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He is serving his prison sentence in FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been trying to be transferred to a NORP prison so he can be closer to his family who , he states , are living in impoverished conditions and do not have means to travel to GPE . Also , his son \u2019s mental health has been damaged by his not being able to see his father .", "CARDINAL . He sent several requests in that regard to ORG . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE the Ministry replied by letter , giving negative responses . It firstly reasoned that the applicant was a NORP national and thus it would not be possible to transfer him to GPE . In another letter , on DATE , the ORG reasoned that NORP law allowed such a transfer only exceptionally and that the fact that the applicant \u2019s family was living in GPE was not such an exceptional circumstance .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that when ORG upholds a constitutional appeal it must either set aside the impugned decision by a public authority or , where the infringement of a right guaranteed by LAW is the result of an interference other than a decision , forbid the authority concerned to continue to infringe the right and order it to reestablish the status quo if that is possible .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE it defined an \u201c other action taken by a public authority \u201d in section DATE of the Act on ORG largely as a CARDINAL - off , illegal and unconstitutional attack by such an authority on constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights ( freedoms ) that , at the time of the attack , posed a continuous threat to an existing legal situation , while such an attack itself was not an expression ( result ) of a decision - making power of the authority , and as such fell outside the usual review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE it held that a primary feature of \u201c other action taken by a public authority \u201d in section CARDINAL of LAW must be that the interference was still going on at the time of the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
