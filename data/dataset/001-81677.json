Thus , as follows directly from the LAW and from ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the law does not associate criminal or quasi - criminal liability with the sole fact of past collaboration with the ORG 's security services ... The legislator 's intention is that persons who are exercising public functions or standing for election to posts involving the exercise of public functions shall submit a declaration regarding cooperation . The purpose of such regulation is to secure the open nature of public life , to eliminate [ the possibility of ] blackmail because of facts from the past which can be considered as compromising , and to submit those facts for public consideration . The collaboration itself does not prevent any citizen from exercising public functions , and lustration proceedings are designed only to scrutinise the truthfulness of those who exercise or wish to exercise public functions . It is therefore not the collaboration , but the submission of a false declaration which has negative consequences for those affected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the court examined the constitutionality of certain provisions of LAW as amended in DATE . These amendments concerned the provisions regulating the position of the Commissioner of Public Interest and , also , provisions to the effect that certain categories of persons , if found to have made a false lustration declaration , were to be regarded as having lost the moral qualifications necessary for the exercise of certain public functions .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K MONEY ) , ORG examined the compatibility with the LAW of certain provisions of LAW which created the obligation to publish a lustration declaration made by candidates to certain public functions insofar as they did not make any distinction between various categories of collaboration with the secret services .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the court examined the scope of the notion of secret collaboration as provided for by LAW as amended in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court also dealt with other problems concerning LAW in its judgments LAW , P CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The following are extracts from ORG of ORG DATE ) on measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former NORP totalitarian countries . It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine , upon their request , the files kept on them by the former secret services ...", "CARDINAL . Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them , the ORG notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures , such as lustration or ' decommunisation ' laws . The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they can not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles , as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses that , in general , these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met . Firstly , guilt , being individual , rather than collective , must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual , and not collective , application of lustration laws . Secondly , the right of defence , the presumption of innocence until proven guilty , and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed . Revenge may never be a goal of such measures , nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed . The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law , and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process .
