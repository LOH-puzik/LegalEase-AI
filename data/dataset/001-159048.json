The Government did not contest the essential facts underlying the application , but claimed that the applicant \u2019s submission was unsubstantiated and that there was no evidence proving \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d that ORG agents had been involved in the killing of the applicant \u2019s son and the disappearance of her husband . In particular , they stated that the applicant herself had not witnessed the incident and that her application had been based \u201c only on the suppositions of her relatives and neighbours \u201d as none of the alleged witnesses had been able to say for sure that the man taken away in the ORG by the abductors had been Mr PERSON .", "DATE . The applicant submitted that it had been established \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d that ORG agents had been involved in the attack on her house , which had resulted in the abduction of her husband and the killing of her son . In support of that assertion she referred to the ample evidence contained in her submissions and those of the Government , as well as the contents of the criminal investigation file . In particular , she pointed out that the perpetrators had arrived as a large group in APCs , which could only have been used by the federal forces , and that they had been able to move around freely during the curfew . The local military commander \u2019s office had not reacted to the intense gunfire in the middle of the town during the curfew and the attack had taken place close to the local police station and lasted for TIME . She submitted that she had made a prima facie case that ORG agents had killed her son and abducted her husband and that the Government had failed to provide a plausible explanation for the events . In view of the absence of any news of her husband for a long time and the life - threatening nature of unacknowledged detention in the region at the relevant time , she asked the ORG to consider him dead .", "CARDINAL . The ORG will examine the application at hand in the light of the general principles applicable in cases where the factual circumstances are in dispute between the parties ( see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has addressed a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances and deaths of applicants\u2019 relatives in GPE . Applying the above\u2011mentioned principles , it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction or killing by servicemen , this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities , and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof , either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred ( see , among many examples , GPE and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . If the Government fail to rebut that presumption , this will entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part . Conversely , where applicants fail to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof can not be reversed ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , and GPE and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has also found in many cases concerning disappearances that a missing person may be presumed dead . Having regard to the numerous cases of disappearances in GPE which have come before it , the ORG has found that in the particular context of the conflict in the region , when a person has been detained by unidentified ORG agents without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention , this could be regarded as life\u2011threatening ( see , among many others , GPE and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , DATE , and ORG and Others v. GPE , nos . GPE , CARDINAL , ORG and ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has made findings of presumptions of deaths in the absence of any reliable news about disappeared persons for periods ranging from DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the documents from the investigation file provided by the Government ( see , for example , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) demonstrate that the applicant \u2019s son Mr PERSON was shot dead on TIME by a group of armed servicemen who drove around in APCs and opened fire on the applicant \u2019s house during TIME . As a result of the TIME attack , which took place in proximity of the military commander \u2019s office and the police station , the applicant \u2019s husband , Mr PERSON , was taken away by the same group of servicemen and has been missing since . In their submissions to the authorities , the applicant , her relatives and neighbours , pointed out that the killing of Mr PERSON and the abduction of Mr PERSON had been carried out by the same group of perpetrators , who belonged to the federal forces ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The investigators considered this version of events and took steps to verify this assertion ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . In view of all the evidence in its possession , the ORG finds that the applicant has presented a prima facie case that ORG agents killed her son and abducted her husband , who subsequently disappeared .", "CARDINAL . The Government neither contested the essential facts underlying the application nor provided a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the events in question . Bearing in mind the general principles set out above , the ORG finds that Mr PERSON was killed on TIME in the applicant \u2019s house by a group of ORG agents and that her husband Mr PERSON was taken into custody on TIME by the same group of ORG agents . In view of the absence of any reliable news of the applicant \u2019s husband since DATE and the lifethreatening nature of such detention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG also finds that Mr PERSON may be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
