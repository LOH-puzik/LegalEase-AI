POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant was granted a tenancy , by way of an administrative decision , in respect of an apartment situated in a private house in FAC in GPE , subject at that time to the compulsory management of the ORG .", "DATE the applicant worked in GPE , apparently living in a hotel . During that period he was registered for a temporary stay in the local register of inhabitants . This temporary registration was only possible on a condition that he had a permanent address elsewhere . On DATE the applicant voluntarily terminated the registration of his permanent residence in ORG . On DATE and on DATE respectively , the municipal authorities cancelled the permanent registration of PERSON and ORG , the applicant 's daughters , in view of the fact that they had emigrated from GPE to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant 's tenancy was revoked by means of an administrative decision on the grounds that the applicant had ceased to satisfy the contractual requirements , as he had moved out of his apartment and was registered as a permanent inhabitant in GPE On DATE ORG of the FAC , acting as a second - instance administrative authority , upheld this decision . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG refused to register the applicant as having a permanent address in FAC . On DATE this decision was upheld by the higher administrative authority , which considered that it was beyond dispute that the applicant was not entitled to have a permanent residence at the apartment concerned . He had lost his entitlement following the final decision of CARDINAL DATE , by which the allocation of the apartment to him had ceased to be valid . The applicant had not been living there since DATE , when he had moved out and left it to his daughter . He had also requested that his name be struck off the register of persons having a permanent address there , and had moved into his brother 's apartment in L.", "In DATE ORG of the FAC allocated replacement accommodation to the applicant , consisting of a room QUANTITY in size , with the use of a toilet and water tap in a communal flat . The applicant appealed against this decision , alleging that the rescission of the previous tenancy in FAC had been unlawful . On CARDINAL DATE the second - instance administrative authority at the FAC dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG refused to lodge an extraordinary appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , finding that it was in conformity with the law , particularly as the applicant had moved out of his apartment and registered his permanent address elsewhere , thus clearly relinquishing his entitlement to that apartment .", "In DATE the applicant was summoned to vacate the apartment , but the eviction was subsequently stayed at the applicant 's request , and on the objection of the owner of the replacement accommodation .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , considering that the replacement accommodation met legal standards , and that the applicant 's appeal essentially sought to challenge the revocation of his entitlement to the previous apartment .", "In DATE the ORG informed the applicant that he could not be registered with a permanent address at FAC .", "On DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that he would not consider requesting the Minister of ORG to lodge an extraordinary appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , account being taken of the fact that the allocation of replacement accommodation was the natural consequence of the applicant 's loss of entitlement to the previous apartment .", "On DATE ORG of the ORG quashed the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE by virtue of which the applicant had been allocated replacement accommodation . ORG noted that the house in which this apartment was situated was owned by PERSON , who had objected to that accommodation being allocated to the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an action with the ORG for a declaration that the administrative decision of DATE remained valid . He submitted that he had lost the legal title to the apartment following the unlawful DATE decision in which the authorities had flagrantly breached the law , in particular by disregarding the fact that he had never permanently left the apartment . As a result of the decision depriving him of the tenancy contract , he could not be registered as an inhabitant , with all the adverse administrative consequences thereof . He referred to difficulties in obtaining his passport , and to the fact that he was regarded by the authorities as a homeless person . He had encountered difficulties in exercising his voting rights as it was only after persistent efforts that he was eventually registered on the electoral lists .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain his claim , apparently considering that it lacked jurisdiction to examine issues pertaining to the validity of administrative decisions .", "In reply to the applicant 's complaint that he had been deprived of his right to vote in the municipal elections in DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed him on DATE that the voters ' lists had been prepared on the basis of municipal electoral lists . These lists included ex officio persons with permanent addresses in the given municipality . Persons temporarily residing in the municipality , who were not so registered could be included in electoral lists , provided that they submitted a request for registration .", "In DATE the applicant complained to the FAC that , due to the fact that he did not have an officially registered permanent address , he could not obtain a certificate of entitlement to a share in a privatised ORG ( a ORG share certificate ) . Only those citizens who had a permanent abode were entitled to receive such certificates .", "In a reply dated DATE , the applicant was informed that under the applicable laws on privatisation he had not been classified as a person eligible to collect a ORG share certificate , in the absence of a permanent registered address . Nevertheless , as a consequence of a judgment of ORG , confirmed by ORG , the entitlement of persons without a registered permanent address to receive a ORG share certificate had been recognised and such persons would be granted their share certificates in the course of time .", "Apparently , the applicant is still living in the apartment in FAC . As he is regarded as staying in the apartment without any legal basis , he is obliged to pay double rent under applicable housing regulations .", "DATE on , housing matters were subject to a high degree of state control under successive acts of housing legislation . The most important characteristic of this system , a so called \u201c special lease scheme \u201d was that a tenancy was created by means of an administrative decision and not by a civil law contract between the landlord and the tenant . Under these protected tenancies , the tenants paid controlled rent and the owners could not terminate lease by giving notice on the tenant . Although \u201c the special lease scheme \u201d was abolished under LAW , the system of protected tenancy is still applicable to the tenants who had been allocated their apartments on the basis of previous administrative decisions .", "The obligation for NORP citizens residing in GPE to register their permanent address in a municipality 's register of inhabitants is stipulated in LAW ( LOC o ewidencji ludno\u015bci i dowodach osobistych z CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW , the notion of \u201c living permanently \u201d implies residing at a given address with the intention of making it the principal centre of one 's vital interests .", "Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act provided that : \u201c a person applying to have their permanent or temporary residence registered shall submit a certificate to the effect that they are entitled to stay in the apartment ( or other dwelling LOC ) concerned . \u201d On DATE the NORP Constitutional Court declared Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW unconstitutional and , subsequently , this provision was repealed with effect from DATE . As a result of the judgment of ORG , the certificate to the effect that a person is entitled to stay in an apartment is no longer a prerequisite for having his permanent or temporary residence registered .", "Under LAW of DATE and of LAW of DATE a person who has no fixed residence shall be registered , upon his own motion lodged DATE before the election at the latest , as a voter in the electoral list in a commune in which he is staying .", "Under LAW of DATE ( LOC o narodowych funduszach inwestycyjnych i ich prywatyzacji ) every citizen of GPE aged DATE or over and permanently residing in GPE was entitled to receive ORG ( ORG ) share certificate ( to be later converted into company stock ) . Under the amended version of this provision , which came into force on DATE , the Minister of ORG and Administration was responsible for drawing up the lists of persons , not having a permanent residence address in GPE , who were entitled to receive a ORG share certificate ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
