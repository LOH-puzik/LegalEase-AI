NORP On appeal , ORG in GPE ( GPE i PERSON ) upheld the refusal .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , pp . DATE ) , the decision on a request for the removal of remains or ashes shall be restrictive , having regard to the deceased \u2019s right to a peaceful rest . Determination [ of such a request ] should be guided by the wishes expressed by the deceased whilst alive . As a general rule , it must be assumed that such a wish , if expressed , was taken into account when the burial took place . The paramount condition for allowing a transfer is obviously that it would not contravene the wishes expressed by the deceased when alive . Moreover , some connection between the deceased and the intended destination would usually be required .", "In the present case [ the applicant \u2019s husband ] worked as a sales manager at the PERSON factory until DATE .

Domestic provisions of relevance to the present case are to be found in LAW DATE ( Begravningslagen \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which came into force on DATE . Previously , they were contained in LAW DATE ( NORP om jordf\u00e4stning m.m . ) .", "It is mainly the parishes of ORG which are responsible for burial grounds ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act ) and for decisions concerning , inter alia , graves and burials . It is also in the first instance for the church authorities to determine requests to move the remains or ashes of a deceased person ( Chapters CARDINAL , DATE and QUANTITY ) . A decision may be appealed to the county administrative board ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act ) . Further appeals lie with the competent administrative court of appeal and , subject to the granting of leave to appeal , with ORG ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW ) .", "When a person dies , his or her wishes concerning cremation and burial should , as far as possible , be followed ( LAW , LAW ) . This was also the rule under LAW DATE , the legislation applicable at the time of the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s death . If there is a dispute between the survivors about where the burial should take place , it is for the GPE administrative board to decide ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act ) .", "Once remains or ashes have been buried , moving them from CARDINAL place to another is in principle not allowed . However , permission to move remains or ashes may be granted if special reasons exist and if the place to which they will be moved has been clearly stated ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act ) . However , the grave must not be opened in such a way that the remains or ashes are damaged ( LAW , LAW , of the LAW ) .", "The provisions of LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Act are based on respect for the sanctity of the grave . This is also why the provisions regarding the removal of remains and ashes are restrictive ; a deceased \u2019s grave must be left in peace and may only be disturbed under special circumstances . According to the explanatory notes to LAW PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the removal of remains or ashes may be permitted if a mistake occurred at the time of burial , if the remains of a husband , wife , parent or young child are to be brought together or , in some cases , if a refugee or immigrant wishes to take the remains of a deceased relative back to his or her country of origin . The deceased \u2019s own wishes should serve as guidance for the transfer decision . When such wishes are not known , regard should be had to the deceased \u2019s attachment to the place where he or she is buried . As a rule , removal should not be permitted if the deceased is buried in a place where he or she was active for a large part of his or her life . If , however , the cemetery is situated in a place where the deceased lived only temporarily , removal may be permitted .", "In addition , the deceased should have had some connection with the place to which the remains are to be removed . According to the explanatory notes ( ibid . , pp . DATE ) , examples of such a connection could be that the deceased grew up in that place , had relatives or a family grave there , or perhaps had a holiday home there . As regards husbands and wives , it may be permitted to move CARDINAL of the deceased \u2019s remains to bring them together in a common grave , especially if the one who died last can not , for some reason , be buried in the same place as the first . Particular regard may be had to the wishes of the last survivor concerning the common burial place .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ruled on several cases concerning the interpretation of LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW ( PERSON DATE ref . CARDINAL I - IV ) . These judgments reveal a restrictive interpretation . For instance , the fact that the surviving relatives have moved , that there is a long distance between the burial place and their new home , or that public transport to a burial place may be lacking , are not considered to be sufficient grounds for a transfer . In CARDINAL cases ORG , referring to the explanatory notes to the LAW and the reasons stated in the requests , found that those reasons were not sufficient to permit removal of the deceased \u2019s remains or ashes . These cases concerned , respectively , a fianc\u00e9e who wanted to move her fianc\u00e9 \u2019s remains , a husband who wanted to move his wife \u2019s remains , and a daughter who wanted to move her father \u2019s remains . In another case , however , which concerned a mother \u2019s request to move her child \u2019s remains to her husband \u2019s burial place , ORG found that there were sufficient reasons to allow the transfer .", "In the case concerning a daughter \u2019s request to move her father \u2019s remains , the former wanted to bury the latter in the same cemetery as the one in which her recently deceased mother had chosen to be buried . ORG noted that the complainant \u2019s father had lived and worked in GPE , and was buried there in his grandfather \u2019s family grave . Having regard to the father \u2019s connection to GPE , ORG found no reason to presume that his burial there had been a mistake , and it held that there were no other sufficient reasons , after DATE , to permit the removal of the remains ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
