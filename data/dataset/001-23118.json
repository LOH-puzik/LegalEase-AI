DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "After an interview held in DATE the applicant got a job as a telephone operator in a taxi company . She started the job on DATE , but not until DATE was she provided with a written contract in which it was stated inter alia :", "\u201c The terms of the employment will be regulated by the LAW on salaried employees ( GPE ) and a collective agreement entered into with ORG ( Handels- og PERSON ) . \u201d", "The above collective agreement was entered into in DATE between , on the CARDINAL side , the employer and ORG ( ORG ) and , on the other side , ORG , henceforth called ORG and its local office in the area where the employer company is situated . According to the agreement the employer would only employ telephone operators and office workers who were members of GPE .", "At DATE the employer became aware that the applicant was not a member of ORG , but of another trade union , and on DATE the applicant was dismissed because she refused to become a member of ORG .", "The applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( ORG ) against the employer , ORG , ORG and its local office claiming compensation and requesting that they be ordered to recognise that her dismissal and the above closed shop agreement was unlawful . She alleged that since she was not aware of this agreement at the time of her employment the dismissal was a violation of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW against Dismissal due to ORG of DATE , as amended on CARDINAL DATE ( Lov om beskyttelse mod afskedigelse p\u00e5 grund af foreningsforhold ) . Moreover , she alleged that the closed shop agreement itself violated LAW as it allegedly allows an employer to require that an employee must be a member of an association or a specific association in order to obtain employment . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant compensation in the amount of MONEY ( DKK ) as it found it established that the applicant was not aware of the agreement at the time of her employment . Therefore , there had been an infringement of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW against Dismissal due to ORG of DATE . However , as to closed shop agreements in general the court stated inter alia as follows :", "\u201c LAW secures the classical freedom of assembly and association including the right to form and join trade unions . By the British Rail judgment ( the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment , Series A no . DATE ) it was established that in certain circumstances LAW also secures the negative right to freedom of association . This judgment resulted in the ORG \u2019s passing of LAW against Dismissal due to ORG .", "Following the passing of this Act the Court of Human Rights has pronounced other judgments concerning the extent of LAW . The applicant has submitted these judgments , notably the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE in support of her claim that section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL and subsection CARDINAL of GPE against Dismissal due to ORG are at variance with LAW .", "However , these last judgments have not resulted in any NORP Government Bills with a view to amend LAW against Dismissal due to ORG . On the contrary , PERSON recently ... declared in ORG that it was the ORG \u2019s view that closed shop agreements do not infringe human rights and that GPE does comply with its international obligations .", "LAW of DATE ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) incorporated ORG into NORP law . According to the preparatory notes the incorporation did not intend to change the existing balance between ORG and the NORP courts . Therefore , the ORG still has a considerable discretion when laying down NORP law .", "Thus , since LAW against Dismissal due to ORG was passed in order to comply with LAW , and since the exceptions mentioned in LAW , subsection CARDINAL of the Act are formulated very precisely , and since a decision that sets aside or limits the existing possibility to enter into closed shop agreements would have far - reaching consequences for the NORP labour market , the High Court finds it appropriate to leave it to the legislature to decide whether the previous case - law from ORG does require an amendment of LAW against Dismissal due to ORG . \u201d", "On appeal , ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) on DATE upheld ORG judgment . In its reasoning ORG stated inter alia as follows :", "\u201c Act no . CARDINAL of DATE on Protection against Dismissal due to ORG was passed , notably in order to comply with the negative right to freedom of association to the extent an obligation thereto could be established according to the interpretation of LAW given by ORG , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment Series A no . CARDINAL ( ORG ) .", "As stated in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( concerning application no . PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ) and of DATE ( concerning application no . CARDINAL GPE v. GPE ) the latest judgments from ORG give no reason to asses the lawfulness of closed shop agreements and their consequences any differently than what appears from the ORG judgment . In ORG view neither does the PERSON and others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-III ) . \u201d", "Thus , as mentioned above , in CARDINAL other cases , ORG decided by judgments of DATE and DATE , respectively , on the lawfulness of closed shop agreements in relation to LAW against Dismissal due to ORG of DATE and in relation to LAW and found that closed shop agreements as such are not contrary to LAW as the provision has been interpreted by the ORG .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) provides :", "CARDINAL .

By tradition the NORP legislature plays a minor role as regards governing wages , salaries and employment conditions . Therefore , only to a limited extent does the NORP labour marked have legislation , which does not emanate from ORG , e.g. LAW ( GPE ) and LAW ( Ferieloven ) . Accordingly , rights imposed by statute in other countries have in GPE been obtained by agreements between the labour market partners . It is thus characteristic of NORP law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements ( collective and individuals ) , labour law principles and general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes . CARDINAL per cent of all employees in GPE are union members .", "From figures provided by ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG ( Besk\u00e6ftigelsesministeriet ) , in DATE the NORP workforce consisted of CARDINAL persons ( inclusive unemployed ) .

The applicant disagrees with this estimation .", "The institution of closed shop agreements is of long standing in GPE . Typically a closed shop agreement states that an employer has undertaken only to hire and employ members of the trade union that is party to the collective agreement concluded by the employer . Closed shop agreements are unlawful in the public sector labour market and they are not concluded in the part of the private sector labour market , which is comprised by the general agreement between the DA and the LOC , because ORG considers the use of closed shop provisions as an interference with the ORG managerial right . Thus , closed shop agreements are mainly of importance in collective agreements concluded with unorganised employers .", "The precise number of employees covered by closed shop agreements is unknown . However , from figures provided by ORG and ORG the Government estimate that CARDINAL wages earners are affected in some way by closed shop agreements , thereby affecting CARDINAL per cent of all NORP employees on the labour market . The applicant submits that this estimation probably is somewhat below the actual figure .", "After the election in GPE on DATE the new Government decided to procure a report on closed shop agreements .
