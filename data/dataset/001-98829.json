She invited ORG to measure the noise . On DATE the applicant urged action on her request .", "CARDINAL . Measurements were carried out on DATE at TIME by an independent expert firm . The expert found that the level of noise at TIME had exceeded the permitted level . In a room situated in the western part of the applicant 's flat the noise level at TIME reached CARDINAL,CARDINAL dB ( decibels ) which exceeded the permitted level by CARDINAL dB. In a room situated in the eastern part of the applicant 's flat the noise at TIME reached FAC dB which exceeded the permitted level by CARDINAL dB.", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG ordered the company L. , the owner of the bar F. , to reduce the level of noise from their equipment for reproduction of music . The decision relied on the measurements carried out on DATE for the purposes of these proceedings which had established that the noise from F. exceeded the prescribed limit . The decision was however quashed on DATE by ORG , upon an appeal lodged by the respondent and the case was remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Measurements carried out on DATE at night again showed that noise from F. exceeded the permitted level by PERCENT to CARDINAL dB depending on the exact place of measurements .

By decision of DATE ORG ordered the owner of the bar to add sound insulation to the walls and the inter - floor construction according to the NORP standards in that respect .", "CARDINAL . An inspection carried out on DATE established that the above decision had not been complied with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the enforcement of the above decision if the owner did not comply with it by DATE . On the latter date an inspection established that the bar F. had been closed and that the owner had lodged a request with the local ORG to allow the bar to be closed in order to install the required sound insulation .", "CARDINAL . A further inspection in the bar F. , carried out on DATE showed that sound insulation had been installed . Measurements were not carried out because the applicant sought the replacement of ORG assigned to the case . On DATE the request was denied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further measurement showed that the level of noise insulation on the first floor was insufficient . The owner of the bar objected to these findings and on DATE a fresh expert report was ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again sought the replacement of ORG assigned to the case . Her request was declared inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The measurements carried out on DATE again showed that noise from F. exceeded the permitted level . On DATE the firm L. informed the authorities that it no longer ran the bar F. An on - site inspection of CARDINAL DATE showed that the first floor of the house was no longer used as a bar , but only the ground floor . On DATE the proceedings were terminated on the grounds that the measurements previously carried out had shown that the level of noise on the ground floor was not excessive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE . On DATE the applicant brought a claim before ORG ( Upravni sud PERSON ) , challenging the findings of the administrative bodies .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG about the length of the proceedings before ORG .

On DATE the second - instance administrative body annulled the decision of DATE on the grounds that the measurements of noise in the applicant 's flat and in the common yard in front of the house showed that the noise coming from F. was excessive and that the noise insulation between F. and the applicant 's flat was insufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered expert noise measurements to be carried out on DATE . These measurements showed that the insulation was sufficient . On DATE the applicant requested new measurements in TIME and without prior notification . This request was accepted on DATE and the applicant was invited to indicate the date for measurement . She submitted her answer on DATE and the measurement was carried out on DATE . They showed that the level of noise was again excessive . The maximum level of noise measured inside the applicant 's flat was PERCENT and the external level of noise CARDINAL.CARDINAL dB.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the owner of the bar to reduce the noise . Measurements carried out on DATE showed that the level of noise had not exceeded the set standards .", "CARDINAL .

The limit for external noise - reception level was set at DATE during day and PERCENT at night .", "CARDINAL . NORP Most environmental noises can be approximately described by one of several simple measures . The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing . Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels , they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels ( dB ) . If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called \u201c A - weighting \u201d ( abbreviated dBA ) whereas , if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span , this is called the \u201c equivalent continuous sound pressure level \u201d ( abbreviated GPE ) . Such average levels are usually based on integration of A - weighted levels . A simple PERSON type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise .", "CARDINAL . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has published \u201c Guidelines for Community Noise \u201d ( DATE ) and \u201c Fact Sheet No . CARDINAL , on ORG \u201d ( revised DATE ) which give guideline values for various environments and situations ( LAW ) . These guideline values are set at the level of the lowest adverse health effect , meaning any temporary or long - term deterioration in physical , psychological or social functioning that is associated with noise exposure , and represent the sound pressure level which affects the most exposed receiver in a given environment .", "CARDINAL . In relation to noise levels in homes , the guidelines state that to protect the majority of people from being seriously annoyed during the daytime , the sound pressure level on balconies , terraces and in outdoor living areas should not exceed PERCENT PERSON for steady continuous noise and should not exceed CARDINAL dB PERSON to protect people from being moderately annoyed . These values are based on annoyance studies but most NORP countries have adopted a CARDINAL dB GPE as the maximum allowable for new developments .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , sound pressure levels at the outside fa\u00e7ades of living spaces should not exceed CARDINAL dB GPE , so that people may sleep with bedroom windows open . This value has been obtained by assuming that the noise reduction from outside to inside with the window partly open is CARDINAL dB and , where noise is continuous , the equivalent sound pressure level should not exceed PERCENT indoors , if negative effects on sleep , such as a reduction in the proportion of ORG sleep , are to be avoided ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
