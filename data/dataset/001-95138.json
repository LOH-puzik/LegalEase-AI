NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , near GPE . He is represented before ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant married PERSON , a national of GPE ( GPE ) who was born in DATE . Together the couple got CARDINAL sons , A. and T. , who were born respectively in DATE and DATE . Since the couple separated in DATE the relation between the applicant and S.M.L. has been characterised by tense conflict , lack of cooperation and mutual distrust which they had sought to have solved by GPE and NORP courts . This involved disputes about such matters as parental responsibilities , DATE care and access with respect to the children and prohibition on the parents to travel with the children abroad .", "In DATE ORG concluded that , in view of the high level of conflict , S.M.L. should be the sole holder of parental responsibilities . It decided that the children should live permanently with her and granted the applicant certain access rights . In DATE , while an appeal was pending before ORG , the parties concluded a judicial settlement agreement according to which the parents should share the parental responsibilities , the mother should continue to assume the DATE care and the father should have certain access rights .", "Both the applicant and S.M.L. had a difficult upbringing . At DATE the applicant moved from his mother to live with his father . S.M.L. started abusing drugs at DATE .", "In DATE the applicant met and started cohabiting with PERSON and together they got CARDINAL children , born respectively in DATE and DATE . He has access to them DATE . In DATE the applicant married PERSON , a marriage that was turbulent and lasted only for DATE . Since DATE he has been living with PERSON and her QUANTITY boys from CARDINAL earlier relationships . The boys have had access to their respective fathers .", "Since DATE the applicant has been occupied full time at home , except for periods when he worked in a support home for mentally disabled persons . He has also worked with computer programming .", "In DATE S.M.L. met PERSON and they married DATE . They got CARDINAL children , PERSON ( born in DATE ) and C. ( born in DATE ) . PERSON was educated as engineer and was formerly employed in the off shore oil industry . Because of his back problems and S.M.L. \u2019s drugs abuse , he stayed at home as from DATE . They lived together with their CARDINAL common children and with the applicant \u2019s and S.M.L. \u2019s CARDINAL children .", "S.M.L. \u2019s drugs abuse had involved most types of narcotic substances from hashish to heroin . She had been off drugs for shorter and longer periods , notably for DATE before PERSON was born in DATE . As from DATE her drugs abuse resumed , involving injections of heroin . In DATE S.M.L. was hospitalised for detoxification but left after DATE . After DATE she continued to intoxicate herself . In DATE she was again hospitalised for detoxification , for a period of DATE . From DATE S.M.L. was again hospitalised for the same reason . In DATE the police caught S.M.L. in possessing drugs and she was imposed a fine . When she was absent from home it was PERSON who looked after the children , including PERSON and NORP when they were not with the applicant .", "At some time during the DATE or DATE S.M.L. found it necessary because of her drugs abuse problem and pregnancy with C. to transfer the DATE care of T. and A. to the applicant . The boys then moved to the home of the applicant and PERSON and her CARDINAL children . According to the applicant this happened in DATE ; according to S.M.L. it occurred in DATE .", "S.M.L. had several relapses with drugs abuse , the latest in DATE . In DATE she was compulsorily committed to a detoxification centre for DATE until she gave birth to C. so that she should avoid taking drugs during the last part of her pregnancy . Thereafter she stayed at home under supervision by the child welfare services , involving CARDINAL home DATE by those services and her giving several urine samples per week to them for monitoring .", "Both A. and ORG had special care needs . A. was alert , somewhat serious and pensive , and had over DATE experienced difficulties at school in terms of adaptation and social relations with other children . He had been seriously burdened by the parental conflict , disruption in contacts with key persons , his mother \u2019s drugs abuse problem and the negative focusing by CARDINAL parent on the other . He was struggling with concentration and performance at school . He had a need for security , stability and freedom from involvement in the parental conflict . As from DATE received regular counselling from a psychologist .", "ORG was a multi handicapped child , who had a brain damage and was diagnosed as suffering from the Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome ( one of the most serious forms of epilepsy ) and who since DATE had had epileptic fits . He also suffered from serious mental disability , had great deficiencies in his functional and cognitive development and his mental faculties corresponded to those of a child DATE . He was totally unable to assess the consequences of his acts and therefore had to be followed constantly . At times ORG had been attached or tied and equipped with a helmet in order not to cause injury to himself or to others . The support apparatus had provided S.M.L. \u2019s home with a sprinkle bed so that T. needed not be secured or attached . He went to a specialised school and spent DATE and DATE at a support centre with specialised personnel .", "In DATE S.M.L. wished to resume the DATE care for T. and A. A returned to S.M.L. but T. continued to live with the applicant . On DATE the applicant collected PERSON at his school and objected to them moving back to NORP .. From the same date until DATE , respectively , the applicant kept PERSON and ORG from going to school and refused S.M.L. to have access to them .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant made a request to ORG for an interlocutory injunction to the effect that A. and ORG should live permanently with him and that S.M.L. should be granted a right of access under supervision . On DATE S.M.L. requested an interim decision for the daily care and the parental responsibilities in respect of the children to be granted solely to her and for the applicant to be accorded access rights . On DATE ORG held a preparatory meeting without the parties succeeding in reaching an agreement on temporary arrangements . On DATE the applicant claimed the DATE care and joint parental responsibilities and suggested that S.M.L. be granted access rights . After several writs had been submitted , S.M.L. filed a new request for an interim decision on DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued an interim order that S.M.L. should assume the DATE care until a decision had been taken in the main proceedings and that , until such time , the applicant should not have access to GPE and T.", "ORG held an oral hearing from DATE , during which both parties represented by a lawyer and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting with one professional judge and CARDINAL expert lay judges ( both psychologists ) ordered that S.M.L. should be the sole holder of parental responsibilities and should assume the DATE care in respect of GPE and T. It granted the applicant access rights at the ordinary level .", "By way of introductory note , ORG remarked that both parties appeared genuinely fond of their children and wishing them well . As a starting point , both parents seemed able to care for the children in a satisfactory manner .", "ORG further found it established that on the whole both children had had regular contacts with both parents after their separation except for certain periods when the mother and the father had denied CARDINAL another access to the children . The children were also well attached to the applicant even though it was mainly the mother who , except for a period in DATE , had assumed the DATE care for them since the break - up of the GPE relationship in DATE . The children were familiar with both GPE housing environment , their new partners and step brothers and step sisters . A risk of change of environment could therefore not be a decisive consideration .", "It was difficult to predict who of the parents would contribute to giving the children the greatest possibility to have contact with both parents . Each of them had at periods refused the other to have access to the children . The level of conflict between the parents had made it difficult for them to communicate and cooperate . The conflict , which could be attributed to both parties , had had damaging effects on A. , for which they both were responsible , according to Psychologist PERSON \u2019s witness statement . Both parents were responsible for reducing the level of conflict .", "ORG considered that S.M.L. was just as able as the applicant to take care of ORG \u2019s special needs resulting from his brain damage and epilepsy . It attached weight to the fact that the children for most of their lives had lived with their mother , expect for a longer period in DATE when they had lived with their father according to an agreement between the parents .", "ORG observed inter alia that witnesses of the child welfare services and ORG had stated that there was no suspicion that S.M.L. currently abused drugs and that it was considered that she was able to assume the care in a satisfactory manner . ORG found established that her urine samples had proven negative and she had not abused drugs for DATE . At present it did not appear that S.M.L. had a drug abuse problem that could have a decisive effect on her ability to assume the care . There was however uncertainty as to whether she in future would manage to refrain from taking drugs . Until DATE the child welfare services would continue to supervise the conditions in her home .", "ORG noted that A. had clearly stated to the presiding judge a wish to live with his mother together with T. Since A. was DATE his opinion should carry great weight . T. , on the other hand , had a brain damage and it had therefore not been possible to hear his views .", "ORG further noted that from DATE the applicant had kept the children back from school and their mother for DATE . It found it particularly unfortunate that he in this way had interfered with their right and duty to receive education . ORG did not accept his explanation that he did not want the children to be used as a weapon in the parental conflict ; his conduct suggested that he was unable to put his children \u2019s interests before his own interests .", "Considering the case as a whole , and having regard to the best interests of the children , ORG held that they should live permanently with S.M.L. In addition to the applicant \u2019s above - mentioned conduct in DATE , ORG attached decisive weight to A. \u2019s wish to live with his mother and to the fact that , with the exception of DATE , for most of the time since the couple \u2019s separation in DATE she had assumed the care for the children .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s access to the children , ORG found no special reasons pertaining to the applicant suggesting that he should not have access to them . After conversations with A. , witness expert , PERSON had stated that access to the other parent would not be negative for him provided that he had a foreseeable and secure care environment . A. had also said to the presiding judge that he wished to have access to his father .", "Against this background , ORG granted the applicant access to GPE and ORG at the ordinary level from DATE TIME to DATE TIME DATE , DATE every summer , every other DATE and GPE , every other DATE and DATE . It found no grounds for making supervision a condition for access .", "Finally , ORG held that it would be in the children \u2019s best interests that S.M.L. be the sole holder of parental responsibilities . In this connection it placed weight on the GPE inability to communicate and cooperate due to the very tense and deadlocked conflict between them . Such cooperation was absolutely necessary especially in relation to the medical treatment and school education of T. , who suffered from severe brain damage . It also had regard to the fact that the applicant as late as DATE had changed ORG school without the mother \u2019s agreement and had kept both children away from school for a longer period in DATE .", "Following ORG judgment , the applicant \u2019s access to GPE and ORG was implemented accordingly until DATE . In view of CARDINAL reports of concern , one made by A. \u2019s school on DATE and another by ORG \u2019s school on DATE , S.M.L. and her lawyer asked for a meeting with the applicant and requested an explanation . The applicant responded that he did not wish to have any such meeting before the appeal hearing , whereupon S.M.L. denied him access . No access took place until ORG judgment . The precise contents of these reports of concern have not been disclosed to ORG . According to the applicant \u2019s appeal submissions to ORG , S.M.L. \u2019s refusal to let him have access to GPE and NORP after DATE was essentially due to his alleged failure to follow - up adequately an episode concerning damage to CARDINAL of A. \u2019s teeth during his stay at the applicant \u2019s home . A little corner of the tooth had broken off and this the applicant had incidentally mentioned to S.M.L. once he met her in the local grocery .", "The applicant appealed against the above judgment to ORG . After holding an oral hearing from DATE , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL expert lay judges ( CARDINAL psychologist and CARDINAL psychologist specialist ) , by a judgment of DATE upheld ORG judgment with regard to daily care and parental responsibilities and reduced the applicant \u2019s access rights ( applying the relevant provisions of LAW DATE ( barneloven ) ) . ORG saw no reason to hear anew ORG \u2019s views on where he should live and on access while noting that neither of the parties had wished it to do so .", "In its reasoning , ORG pointed out that an assessment ought to be made of the best interests of the children in light of the case as a whole . This assessment ought to take into account such factors as who of the parents would be most able to provide the best physical and psychological care for the children , including their following - up in the short term and long term , draw limits , shield them against the parental conflict and contribute to the best possible parental contact . Regard should also be had to any risk of change of environment and the need to ensure stable conditions of upbringing . Since both children had special care needs , especially ORG who would need public support measures , it would be of particular importance who of the parties was able to understand the children \u2019s needs , to cover those needs and to do so in cooperation with the public services .", "Since in the present there was a judicial settlement agreement of DATE , whereby S.M.L. should assume the DATE care , the parents would jointly assume parental responsibilities and the applicant would have access rights basically at an ordinary level , the question was whether concrete and demonstrable reasons for departing from this arrangement .", "Since they were born , the children had mainly lived with S.M.L. , apart from a period in DATE .", "ORG found that there were no decisive reasons for altering the children \u2019s place of residence . Since S.M.L. had got her drugs abuse problem under control , her willingness and ability to provide the children with the best possible care and follow - up did not leave much to be desired . She had cooperated well with the social support apparatus and did all she could in order to provide the best possible conditions for the children \u2019s upbringing . An additional positive factor was her husband .", "As regards the applicant , ORG had doubts about his abilities to assume the care for the children . There was no doubt that he was very fond of his children and wished to give them the best he could , both emotionally and materially . But it was clear that his cooperation with public institutions had not been of the best and that this had led him to act in a somewhat rash manner . In this connection ORG referred to the fact that , without having conferred with S.M.L. and without having sought professional advice , he had changed school for T. because of his disagreement with the school . This had been especially unfortunate for ORG , who due to his handicap had special needs for stability and security . Thereafter , he had kept both children away from school .", "The applicant \u2019s cohabitation with PERSON and her children was a positive factor . PERSON appeared to be a caring person both able and willing to contribute positively to the applicant \u2019s children . However , in view of the historical background , it would be premature to say anything about how stable this relationship was .", "Both parties had refused CARDINAL another access to the children and were in this respect on an equal footing . In conferring the DATE care of the children to S.M.L. , ORG presupposed that she would actively contribute to the access arrangements being implemented in the best possible manner for the children . In the interest of the children she ought to comment on their access with the applicant in a positive manner in their presence . The level of access fixed below would make it difficult for her to refuse access at her own whim . This was so especially for as long as the applicant was cohabiting with PERSON , who in the worst case scenario would represent a safety valve for the children \u2019s welfare .", "What militated particularly against S.M.L. being a care person for the children was her very negative attitude towards the applicant , both in her conduct vis - \u00e0 - vis him and the way she had commented on him vis - \u00e0 - vis the children . She had in addition contacted persons closely related to the applicant and had made very derogatory remarks about him . Her conduct in this regard could not be justified by her negative experiences of the applicant .", "ORG further had regard to A. \u2019s wishes and found no reason for separating the brothers who had a close contact . As regards housing conditions , family and social network , there was no information permitting to distinguish between the parents .", "In light of the above considerations , ORG upheld ORG conclusion that the children should live permanently with their mother .", "As regards parental responsibilities ORG observed that it seemed unlikely that the GPE ability and willingness to cooperate would improve . Both children , especially T. , had particular needs and the parent assuming the daily care would to a large extent have to cooperate with different instances of support .", "As to the further question regarding the applicant \u2019s access to the children , the High Court unanimously agreed that the arrangement under the DATE judicial settlement agreement and ORG judgment ought to be amended .", "With respect to T. , the High Court observed that support measures by the child welfare services had been granted involving him spending DATE in a support centre . In view of his need for stability and foreseeability , it would be a burden to him if he were to have access to the applicant at the ordinary level . Because of T. \u2019s mental condition , it could be questioned to what extent he was able to understand and enjoy this . Moreover , the parents were unable to cooperate about T. and to agree on how he should be treated . When staying with the applicant , T. would experience a different regime from that of S.M.L. and the support centre . This he would perceive as being very negative . Therefore the High Court considered that the applicant \u2019s access should be reduced to CARDINAL DATE from TIME every four DATE . Since he would stay DATE at the support centre , the applicant \u2019s access should take place on DATE after so that he would spend DATE at S.M.L. \u2019s home .", "With respect to A. , ORG was divided ( CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ) . The majority considered that in view of PERSON \u2019s particular need for stability and foreseeability after the long standing parental conflict , his access to the applicant would be so damaging that it ought to be restricted . In this connection ORG referred to the applicant \u2019s having been unable to care for DATE needs in an adequate manner . It decided that he should have access to A. from DATE TIME to Sunday TIME DATE .", "The minority ( one of the professional judges ) did not consider ORG \u2019s access to the applicant as being negative for A. S.M.L. \u2019s negative focussing on the applicant made it necessary to enable NORP to get the opportunity to know his own father . That the applicant currently lived with M and her CARDINAL children would also be an asset for A. , who in addition would get the opportunity to know his CARDINAL - siblings whom the applicant had got with PERSON and to whom the applicant had access every other DATE . As to the argument that ORG had been tired after spending DATE - ends with the applicant , the minority considered that access should end on DATE at TIME but should continue to start on DATE after school and otherwise follow the ordinary arrangement provided for by law .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal . In so far as the appeal concerned the application of the law on the issue of daily care , the ORG found it obvious that the appeal had no prospects of success . As for the remainder , the ORG did not consider that a different conclusion could be reached without hearing oral evidence anew on a potentially decisive point or that hearing the appeal was warranted by the general interest or other special reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
