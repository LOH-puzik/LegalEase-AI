He kept these monies inter alia in his mother \u2019s bank box and safe .", "On DATE ORG ( byrett ) convicted the applicant of embezzlement ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code ( straffeloven ) ) , fraud of ORG CARDINAL vis - \u00e0 - vis Shell ( Article CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , and also false accounting ( Article CARDINAL of LAW and LAW regnskapsloven ) ) , evasion of value added tax ( section DATE of LAW DATE ( merverdiavgiftsloven ) and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and , in his capacity as DATE manager and chairman of the board of the limited liability company LOC og CARDINAL of tax evasion to the benefit of the company ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( ligningsloven ) ) in respect of the embezzled amounts .

ORG further ordered the seizure of ORG CARDINAL .", "In DATE ORG ( likningsnemnda ) imposed on the applicant in his personal capacity a tax surcharge of PERCENT concerning DATE . Under the relevant provision the surcharge should normally have amounted to PERCENT but , in the event of intent or gross negligence , the rate was PERCENT .
