The ninth , tenth , twelfth and thirteenth applicants live in GPE , the eleventh applicant lives in GPE and all the other applicants live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants or their ancestors ( hereinafter \u201c the applicants \u201d ) were owners of CARDINAL an undivided share of several properties in PERSON , namely , CARDINAL apartments on the ground floor and an adjacent entrance giving access to another CARDINAL apartments above . At the time when the property was acquired , for the price of QUANTITY ( MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) ) , it was leased and occupied by various third parties .", "CARDINAL . This property was damaged during the Second World War and war - damage compensation was due to the owners under LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a declaration of CARDINAL DATE the ORG took possession of this property under title of \u201c possession and use \u201d in accordance with ORG ) Ordinance ( see relevant domestic law ) . Under this title the owners were paid a DATE acquisition rent of MONEY ( \u201c MTL \u201d ) \u2212 approximately LAW for the entire property . This rent was calculated on the rental value declared by the owners to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , without requesting prior consent from the owners and without having the plans of the property as it stood , the Government demolished the property and built a new set of apartments on wholly different plans , using part of the property to widen a road . The Government noted that permission for demolition was not necessary since they had legal possession of the property . At the time since the city of PERSON had been totally bombarded and consisted of a pile of rubble , the Government were engaged in an intensive restructuring and construction exercise , taking possession of properties and rebuilding the area with residences for social accommodation . In doing this the applicants alleged that the Government had also appropriated to themselves the war - damage compensation due to them . The Government considered this allegation to be unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the owners wrote to the Commissioner of Lands ( \u201c COL \u201d ) requesting compensation for their property . They suggested the sum of ORG DATE approximately EUR CARDINAL . Receipt of their request was acknowledged but the claim remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . By a declaration of CARDINAL DATE the ORG acquired the said property under the title of \u201c public tenure \u201d according to ORG ( see relevant domestic law ) . Under this title the owners continued to be paid ORG DATE for the entire property .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , this property was allocated as housing to third parties and included a shop .", "CARDINAL . The applicants pointed out that in DATE the ORG had declared that it would no longer be resorting to takings under titles of \u201c possession and use \u201d or \u201c public tenure \u201d . During political debate , the Deputy Prime Minister had in fact referred to such takings as a nefarious method of acquisition . Indeed , in DATE the Government had converted takings under title of \u201c possession and use \u201d or \u201c public tenure \u201d to takings under \u201c outright purchase \u201d . The latter provided for a more favourable form of compensation , namely the market value of the property at the time of taking . The applicants submitted a number of examples reflecting this allegation ( for example , LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE converting previous takings to outright purchases , and declaration no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE substituting a declaration of taking under possession and use of DATE with an outright purchase , following complaints by the owners . In the latter case the property had also been demolished and rebuilt and was being used for social housing ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted an expert report valuing the entire property in PERSON at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Thus , their share as owners of CARDINAL an undivided share was worth EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought constitutional redress proceedings . Invoking LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and Article CARDINAL they requested that the court find a violation of their rights as a consequence of the actions taken by the ORG and to grant adequate compensation . Given the way the application was presented the Government did not plead non - exhaustion in respect of the failure of the applicants to institute proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The case was set down for hearing on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the court - appointed architect was requested to conduct an on - site inspection to determine whether the property built by the Government was indeed built on the applicants\u2019 property and what use was being made of the ground floor . The report was submitted on DATE ; however , the court - appointed expert failed to draw up an estimate of the value of the property in issue and the ORG request for additional terms of reference to be given to the expert was rejected on DATE on the basis that the value of the property was irrelevant to the merits of the claim . Subsequently , on DATE the case was adjourned pending negotiations regarding the possibility of reaching an amicable solution to the case . This having failed , the proceedings continued on DATE at the ORG request . On DATE the applicants requested the court to make written submissions . On DATE the applicants requested that the case be suspended pending the determination of another constitutional case that could have affected the merits of their case . The hearing of submissions recommenced on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG filed their written submissions on CARDINAL DATE and the case was scheduled for judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) , acting in its constitutional jurisdiction , rejected their claims . It held that , since the applicants were still owners of the said property , the taking under both titles could not be considered a deprivation of property but a control of the use of such property . This control had been necessary in view of the fact that the property had been ruined in the war and that there had been a need to provide social housing in DATE . For the same reasons , even assuming that the taking under title of public tenure had been a deprivation of possessions , it would have been in the public interest . In respect of the fair balance required , the court observed that , when the ORG was pursuing economic reform or social justice , less reimbursement was due than the full market value . While it was true that the recognition rent payable to the applicants was not high and there were no prospects for it to be increased in DATE , it was comparable to the rents applicable under the controlled rents regime in force in respect of other old properties . Moreover , in the present case the owners had not been required to incur expenses for the building of the new apartments or for their maintenance and when the property had been originally purchased by the ORG ancestors it was already rented to third parties to which such regulated rents applied . In consequence , it could not be said that the applicants had borne an excessive burden . The court found that their related complaint under the same provision in respect of the unauthorised demolition could not be examined ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as to the complaint regarding the difference in treatment as a result of the taking under title of public tenure as opposed to an outright purchase , the court held that the choice was specifically available to the Government . However , according to the policy in force , takings under titles of possession and use were converted to outright purchases in cases where the properties were used for commercial purposes . Other properties , where the Government wished to keep control of the expropriated property , were taken under title of public tenure . While this choice allowed for a large margin of appreciation , the applicants had not proved that other people in an analogous position had been treated more favourably and it did not appear that the policy had been applied arbitrarily or in a discriminatory fashion in the applicants\u2019 case .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . Primarily , it noted that the applicants had been acquiescent for DATE before they ever solicited any action from the authorities or the relevant courts . On the merits , it confirmed that the interference did not amount to a deprivation since quite apart from retaining the title of ownership , the applicants had continued to receive rent in respect of the said property and to have standing to institute proceedings in respect of complaints relating to the property . Thus , not all the legal rights of the owners had been extinguished .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that the legality of the interference and the public interest involved were not disputed . Indeed , the law ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) Ordinance , prior to its amendment ) allowed the ORG to carry out works on property taken under possession and use , without any specific limitation . Moreover , the property which had been demolished and rebuilt had been taken in a damaged state , and any complaints about the entitlement to war - damage compensation remained unsubstantiated and were irrelevant to the main complaint in issue .", "CARDINAL . The decision as to under which title the property could be taken fell within the margin of appreciation of the ORG . As to the fair balance and the relevant amount of compensation , while it was true that a rent of LAW was by DATE \u2019s standards low for the property in issue , the value of the property had to reflect the values applicable in DATE and not DATE . It noted that the applicants had not even contested the amount of rent due before ORG ( \u201c LAB \u201d ) and that their acquiescence had led to a situation where even if they had wanted to do so , they could not prove the boundaries of the property . However , it was also true that the authorities had failed in their duty to draft a report as to the state and the boundaries of the property before they demolished it and created new plans for it . Thus , at this stage it was impossible to determine the actual boundaries of the property and in this state of uncertainty it was not surprising that the applicants had not taken up the procedure before the LAB . In any event , the court was of the view that the complaint was manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint under LAW , it noted the witness testimony from ORG to the effect that takings under absolute purchase had occurred , although they generally related to commercial properties ; that there had been cases were the Government had acted differently and acquired property by outright purchase following a taking by title of possession and use ; that there was no hard policy regulating what type of taking was required in each case ; and that to the witness \u2019s knowledge there had been no political or other specific reasons motivating such an action . The court concluded that the fact that it had been established that other property had been taken by absolute purchase was not enough to prove discriminatory treatment and therefore there could not be a violation of the said provision .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further criticised the delay of DATE which the first - instance court had taken to decide on the case even though a good part of the delay had been attributable to the applicants who , inter alia , had taken DATE to make submissions .", "CARDINAL . Following the introduction of the application with ORG ( DATE ) , on DATE the ORG issued a declaration that the property was being taken under title of absolute purchase . The property was valued in terms of section CARDINAL of the GPE and the compensation offered was that of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG ) Ordinance ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , LAW of the Laws of Malta provides for CARDINAL methods of acquisition by the Government of private property . It reads as follows :", "\u201c The competent authority may acquire any land required for any public purpose , either -", "( a ) by the absolute purchase thereof ; or", "( b ) for the possession and use thereof for a stated time , or during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require ; or", "( c ) on public tenure :", "Provided that after a competent authority has acquired any land for possession and use or on public tenure the conversion into public tenure or into absolute ownership of the terms upon which such land is held shall always be deemed to be an acquisition of land required for a public purpose and to be in the public interest :", "Provided also that , subject to the provisions of articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , a competent authority may acquire land partly by one and partly by another or others of the methods in paragraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) :", "Provided further that where the land is to be acquired on behalf and for the use of a third party for a purpose connected with or ancillary to the public interest or utility , the acquisition shall , in every case , be by the absolute purchase of the land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL regarding compensation reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The amount of compensation to be paid for any land required by a competent authority may be determined at any time by agreement between the competent authority and the owner , saving the provisions contained in subarticle ( CARDINAL ) .", "( CARDINAL ) The compensation shall in the case of acquisition of land for temporary possession and use be an acquisition rent and in the case of acquisition of land on public tenure be a recognition rent determined in either case in accordance with the relevant provisions contained in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The LAW provides that compensation in respect of absolute purchase is calculated in accordance with the applicable \u201c fair rent \u201d , as agreed by the parties following the Government \u2019s offer or as established by the LAB . In respect of public tenure , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c The compensation in respect of the acquisition of any land on public tenure shall be equal to the acquisition rent assessable in respect thereof in accordance with the provisions contained in subarticles ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) , inclusive , of this article , increased ( a ) by DATE ( PERCENT ) in the case of an old urban tenement and ( b ) by DATE ( PERCENT ) in the case of agricultural land .", "CARDINAL . In so far as relevant , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) reads as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) When land has been acquired by a competent authority for use and possession during such time as the exigencies of the public purpose shall require , the owner may , after the lapse of DATE from the date when possession was taken by the competent authority , apply to ORG for an order that the land be purchased or acquired on public tenure or vacated within DATE from DATE of the order , and the land shall either be vacated or acquired on public tenure or purchased upon compensation to be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or of any GPE amending or substituted for this Ordinance .", "( CARDINAL ) Public tenure shall of its nature endure in perpetuity , without prejudice to any consolidation by mutual consent or otherwise according to law of that tenure with the residual ownership of the land ; and the recognition rent payable in respect thereof shall in every case be unalterable , without prejudice to the effects of any consolidation , total or partial . The residual ownership of land held on public tenure with the inherent right to receive recognition rent , shall , for all purposes of law , be deemed to be an immovable right by reason of the object to which it refers and shall be transferable according to law at the option of the owner , from time to time , of that right .", "CARDINAL . Thus , while a taking under title of \u201c possession and use \u201d is intended for a determinate period of time , a taking under title of \u201c public tenure \u201d is for an indeterminate period of time , possibly forever , and the relevant recognition rent is to remain unaltered for its duration ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
