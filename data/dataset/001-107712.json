In all of its decisions extending the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG reasoning justifying his continued detention was the same as or similar to that cited in paragraph CARDINAL above . In his appeals against those decisions , the applicant complained that there was no reliable evidence giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence , that in any event the investigation for the rather simple charge against him was proving unreasonably long and he should already have been committed for trial , that the extension orders were based only on the submissions of the prosecuting authority and without an independent review by the court of the evidentiary material , that there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond or influence the investigation , and that his personal circumstances had not been taken into account when assessing the necessity of his continued detention .

The prosecution also claimed that they had discovered evidence of tax evasion committed by ORG , a company \u201c actually controlled \u201d by the applicant , as well as of embezzlement of CARDINAL property in large amounts . By the time of this request by ORG , no formal charges had been brought against the applicant in connection with any of the above incidents involving the alleged criminal offences of petroleum smuggling , tax evasion or embezzlement .", "CARDINAL .

The court noted that the illegal activities described in the prosecution \u2019s request for attachment of property constituted criminal offences for which the relevant provisions of LAW prescribed inter alia a sanction of confiscation of property . The court further noted that the prosecution possessed information that the applicant had acquired the shares in ORG using the funds obtained from these illegal activities . Therefore , there was a basis for attaching the applicant \u2019s assets under ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG in order to guarantee the sanction of confiscation of property that might subsequently be imposed by the trial court .", "CARDINAL .

Later , on an unspecified date , the investigator lodged a request with ORG for the extension of the period of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention .

On DATE , based on the new criminal charges against the applicant and the investigator \u2019s extension request , ORG extended the period of the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE ( until DATE ) . The court \u2019s reasoning justifying the applicant \u2019s continued detention was similar to that given in previous extension orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued a new decision bringing formal criminal charges against the applicant . Under this decision , the applicant was now charged with criminal offences under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( preparation to organise public disorder ) , CARDINAL ( actions aimed at usurping ORG power ) and CARDINAL of LAW .
