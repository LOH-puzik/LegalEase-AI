The new PERSON caused some concern , both as regards its content and its implementation . Some of these concerns have been addressed , notably through the judgments of ORG of GPE of DATE , DATE and DATE , and the religious communities\u2019 re - registration exercise at federal level successfully completed by ORG on DATE . However , other concerns remain .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON itself , while posing an acceptable basis of operation for most religious communities , could still be ameliorated . Although ORG has already restricted the application of the so - called \u2018 DATE rule\u2019 , which initially severely limited the rights of religious groups that could not prove their existence on NORP territory for DATE before the new PERSON entered into force , the total abolition of this rule would be considered as an important improvement of the legislative basis by several of these groups . ... \u201d", "DATE . The report \u201c Freedom of Religion or Belief : Laws Affecting the Structuring of Religious Communities \u201d , prepared under the auspices of ORG in LOC ( ORG ) for the benefit of participants in the DATE OSCE Review Conference , states , inter alia :", "\u201c The most controversial duration requirement in DATE is that adopted in the CARDINAL Russian Law on Freedom of Conscience and on ORG . Unless affiliated with a centralised religious organisation , a religious group under this PERSON can not acquire full religious entity status unless it has been in the country for DATE . What is strikingly unusual about this requirement is that to the best of our knowledge , at the time of its adoption , there were no other LOC participating GPE that imposed a waiting requirement ( other than document processing periods ) with respect to base - level entities ... GPE has taken some steps to mitigate the discriminatory impact on smaller groups by minimising the evidentiary burden required to demonstrate presence in the country for the required period , and by creating a limited entity status for religious groups waiting out their DATE period . But problems remain for smaller groups or for congregations that have split off from FAC , and while limited entity status is better than nothing , it imposes significant constraints on a religious group \u2019s ability to expand .", "Duration requirements of this type are clearly inconsistent with the ORG commitment to grant religious groups at least base - level entity status . The wording of this commitment in LAW of ORG recognises that the precise form of legal personality varies from legal system to legal system , but access to some form of legal entity is vital to LOC compliance . This is clearly violated by the refusal to register religious groups that do not satisfy the DATE rule . The drafters of the NORP legislation apparently attempted to remedy this defect by creating limited entity status , but this also fails to satisfy the ORG commitment , because the limited status does not confer rights to carry out important religious functions . Failure to grant such status constitutes a limitation on manifestation of religion that violates LAW ] . It can hardly be said that denial of entity status , simply due to an organisation \u2019s failure to \u2018 exist\u2019 under a preceding , anti - religious , communist government , \u2018 is necessary in a democratic society\u2019 or a proportionate response to a legitimate ORG interest ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
