The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG published a book entitled \u201c The NORP of GPE \u201d , written by Associate Professor PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a petition with ORG on behalf of the NORP Gypsy associations . In his petition , he stated that in CARDINAL pages of the book , the author had stated that NORP were engaged in illegitimate activities , lived as \u201c thieves , pickpockets , swindlers , robbers , usurers , beggars , drug dealers , prostitutes and brothel keepers \u201d and were polygamist and aggressive . Furthermore , Gypsy women were presented as being unfaithful to their husbands . The applicant also submitted that the book contained several other expressions that humiliated and debased NORP . Claiming that the expressions constituted criminal offences , he requested that the sale of the book be stopped and all copies seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the head of the publication unit at ORG ordered that all copies of the book be returned to the publication unit as there were corrections to be made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to ORG enquiring whether the copies of the book had been seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the publication unit at ORG informed the applicant that the publications advisory board of ORG , composed of CARDINAL professors , had decided that the book was scientific research and that the expressions in the book did not contain any insults or similar expressions . The applicant was also informed that the author of the book would not permit any amendments to the text and that , in accordance with the author \u2019s request , ORG had transferred the copyright of the book to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent letters to ORG and to Associate Professor PERSON and repeated his initial request . He received no reply .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant brought proceedings before ORG against ORG and the author of the book , and requested compensation for the non - pecuniary damage he had suffered on account of the expressions contained in the book . He alleged that the expressions constituted an attack on his identity as a Gypsy and were insulting . The applicant also asked for the copies of the book to be confiscated and for its publication and distribution to be banned .", "CARDINAL . The author of the book submitted , in reply , that he had used the records of the GPE police headquarters and books written by other authors on NORP when writing the book and that he had not had any intention to insult or humiliate LANGUAGE . The author further stated that the passages referred to by the applicant should not be considered in isolation , but in the context of the whole book .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests in so far as they concerned the author of the book . It considered that the book was the result of academic research , was based on scientific data and examined the social structures of NORP in GPE . The first - instance court therefore held that the expressions in question did not insult the applicant . As to the applicant \u2019s case against the ORG , the firstinstance court decided that it lacked jurisdiction as the administrative courts had jurisdiction over the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . In his petition , he submitted that the book could not be considered as scientific research and that therefore ORG should not have published it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . In its decision it noted that the expressions in question were of a general nature .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case . It held that before its publication , the book in question had been examined by a ORG appointed by the publications advisory board . Following his approval , the advisory board had agreed to publish the book . In the wake of the applicant \u2019s allegations the advisory board , composed of CARDINAL professors , had examined the book again on DATE and had decided that it was an academic study based on scientific research and that no inconvenience would be caused by continuing its distribution and sale . ORG therefore concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated . It is not clear from the documents in the case file whether or not the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . The last paragraphs of the conclusion to \u201c The NORP of GPE \u201d read as follows :", "\u201c The most important links connecting the NORP to each other are their familial and social structures as well as their traditions . Despite the fact that they have been leading a nomadic life for DATE , they have managed to protect their traditional way of living thanks to their endogamous character . Their attachment to these traditions begins at birth and continues till death . Doubtless , tradition is the most significant factor in the way of life of the NORP . The elderly members of the Gypsy society bear the heaviest responsibility in protecting and sustaining the traditions . However , due to ever - changing circumstances and needs , the social structure of the GPE has become difficult to preserve . In particular \u201c GPE \u201d , CARDINAL of these social structures , can no longer be sustained in DATE \u2019s GPE .", "The liveliest characteristic of NORP is their way of living . Hence , all branches of socio - cultural activity , consisting of migration and settlement , dance , music , language , eating and drinking , fortune telling , sorcery and professions , constitute the true nature of Gypsy life . That is to say , these elements form the visible part of the iceberg . Other persons usually recognise Gypsies through these phenomena . Nevertheless , the way to truly know GPE is to mingle with their society and to fully analyse their traditions and beliefs . The secret world of the NORP reveals itself through their beliefs , in particular through their superstitions and taboos .", "NORP , like everyone , feel the need to have faith and to worship . In addition to adopting the religion of the country they live in , they also perpetuate the traditional beliefs specific to their culture . Consequently , it is observed that NORP have genuine feasts and celebrations stemming from their beliefs which can be partly traced to NORP .", "In our opinion , these people , who suffer from humiliation and rejection everywhere , could be transformed into citizens who are an asset to our ORG and our nation once their educational , social , cultural and medical problems are solved . The only thing that needs to be done is to focus on this issue with patience and determination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG , a non - governmental organisation , published a dictionary entitled \u201c Turkish Dictionary for Pupils \u201d . The publication of the dictionary was financed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to ORG of ORG on behalf of ORG . In his letter , the applicant submitted that certain entries in the dictionary were insulting to and discriminatory against NORP . In this connection , he referred to the descriptions and idioms below :", "\u201c Gypsy \u201d ( \u00e7ingene ) : ( metaphorically ) stingy .", "\u201c PERSON ( \u00e7ingenelik ) ( metaphorically ) : stinginess , greediness .", "\u201c Becoming a Gypsy \u201d ( ORG ) : \u201c displaying stingy behaviour \u201d .", "\u201c ORG debt \u201d ( PERSON borcu ) : an unimportant debt .", "\u201c Gypsy plays NORP dances \u201d ( PERSON \u00e7alar ORG oynar ) : a place where there is a lot of commotion and noise .", "\u201c Gypsy tent \u201d ( PERSON \u00e7ergesi ) ( metaphorically ) : a dirty and poor place .", "\u201c Gypsy wedding \u201d ( PERSON d\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn\u00fc ) : a crowded and noisy meeting .", "\u201c Gypsy fight \u201d ( PERSON kavgas\u0131 ) : verbal fight in which vulgar language is used .", "\u201c Gypsy money \u201d ( PERSON paras\u0131 ) : coins .", "\u201c Gypsy pink \u201d ( PERSON pembesi ) : pink .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , these descriptions had negative , discriminatory and prejudiced meanings . The applicant further submitted that ORG and ORG had amended their dictionaries at his request and asked ORG to correct the definitions of the aforementioned words and to remove the discriminatory expressions from the dictionary . He received no reply to his letter .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant sent a further letter to ORG , repeating his request . He added that he would bring a case against the ORG if his request was not granted by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought proceedings in ORG against ORG , requesting that the aforementioned definitions and expressions be removed from the dictionary . The applicant also requested compensation for the nonpecuniary damage he had suffered on account of the expressions contained in the dictionary . He alleged in that connection that the dictionary definitions constituted an attack on his identity as a Gypsy and an insult to his personality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the representative of ORG made submissions to the firstinstance court . He maintained , inter alia , that the definitions and expressions contained in the dictionary were based on historical and sociological reality and that there had been no intention to humiliate or debase an ethnic group . He further submitted that the dictionary contained expressions and definitions that were commonly used in society and that there were other similar expressions in NORP which concerned NORP , NORP and NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case . It held that the definitions and expressions in the dictionary were based on historical and sociological reality and that there had been no intention to humiliate or debase an ethnic group . It further noted that there were other similar expressions in NORP concerning other ethnic groups , which existed in dictionaries and encyclopaedias .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .
