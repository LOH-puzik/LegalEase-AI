The applicant , who was born in DATE , is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE N. and C. were arrested by carabinieri from PERSON ( GPE di GPE ) and found to be in possession of cocaine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG was questioned , initially by the carabinieri , and subsequently by the PERSON public prosecutor ( PERSON ) . He said that he had obtained part of the drugs from C. for his own use ; the remainder belonged solely to C. He added that on DATE of their arrest , C. had accompanied him to certain people \u2019s homes to try to buy drugs . After TIME meal they had gone to the applicant \u2019s home . The applicant had said that he was prepared to supply them with QUANTITY of cocaine to be delivered DATE , as he was not willing to accept deferred payment and could not go out after TIME to get the drugs .", "CARDINAL . N. was questioned by the carabinieri as someone who was helping them with their inquiries ( \u201c persona che pu\u00f3 riferire circostanze utili ai fini delle indagini \u201d ) , not as an accused . For that reason , he was not assisted by a lawyer . However , the PERSON public prosecutor subsequently decided that ORG should be regarded as a \u201c suspect \u201d ( \u201c indagato \u201d ) , and therefore questioned him in that capacity .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON investigating judge committed the applicant , PERSON and CARDINAL other suspects , PERSON and PERSON , for trial before ORG for drug trafficking . A. was also accused of unlawful possession of an offensive weapon . Separate proceedings were instituted against ORG for possession of drugs .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , ORG was called to give evidence as a person accused in connected proceedings ( \u201c imputato in procedimento connesso \u201d ) . However , he chose to remain silent as he was entitled to do by virtue of LAW of LAW ( hereafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyers acting for the accused argued that LAW ORG was unconstitutional since it was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 which guaranteed the equality of citizens before the law", "and the right to defend oneself at all stages of the proceedings DATE and LAW . They observed in particular that , as construed by ORG , LAW ORG laid down that if a person accused in connected proceedings exercised his right to remain silent , the court could read and use any statements made by him to the public prosecutor or to the investigating judge during the investigation . As a result , the accused was deprived of any opportunity of examining that person or of having him examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as manifestly unfounded the objection that the provision was unconstitutional and ordered that the record of the statements made by ORG to the public prosecutor should be read out . It noted that the statutory right to remain silent was intended to protect an accused , who could not be required to make statements that could be used in evidence against him . Further , the rule that statements made during preliminary investigations could be read and used had been established by ORG itself in its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( MONEY ) . C. , A. and ORG were also given prison sentences ranging DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted at the outset that the main evidence against the accused was the statements which ORG had made to the public prosecutor , since the statements made to the carabinieri were inadmissible under LAW ORG . It also observed that having regard to ORG \u2019s personality and the spontaneity and precision with which his statements had been made , his depositions should be regarded as credible . ORG noted that ORG had recognised a photograph of the applicant and had given an accurate description of his home and the route followed to get there . In addition , the applicant already had previous convictions under the drug - trafficking legislation and was under judicial supervision ( sorveglianza speciale ) . He was prohibited from leaving his home after TIME , and that was a possible explanation for his unwillingness to go out after TIME Furthermore , the amount of cocaine found in ORG \u2019s possession showed that ORG had contacts with drug dealers and meant that ORG account of his visit to the applicant \u2019s home was probably true . It also confirmed that the negotiations that had started were genuine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to GPE di ORG . He contested , inter alia , the reliability of ORG \u2019s statements and complained that they had been made in breach of the adversarial principle and in the absence of a judge or of the defendants\u2019 lawyers .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , PERSON ORG followed in substance the arguments set out in the order of DATE . It upheld the decision of the court below concerning the applicant , while reducing ORG \u2019s sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his co - accused appealed to ORG . T. relied , inter alia , on LAW ( d ) of the LAW contending that ORG statements should have been declared inadmissible in evidence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeals of the applicant and his co - accused , holding that the grounds given by ORG for its decision on all the disputed issues relating to the drug - trafficking count had been reasonable and correct . It overruled the impugned decision with regard to A. \u2019s conviction for being unlawfully in possession of an offensive weapon and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation observed among other things that LAW ( d ) of the LAW concerned \u201c the examination of witnesses , who ... are required to tell the truth , not the examination of the accused , who are entitled to defend themselves by remaining silent or even by lying \u201d . Further , since all GPE that were party to the LAW had an obligation by relevant domestic legislation to regulate the examination of witnesses , it was \u201c obvious that ... when a witness refused to give evidence , statements made to the public prosecutor ... had to be produced for the court \u2019s file \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances in which statements made by an accused or co - accused before trial may be admitted in evidence are set out in LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . As initially worded , the first paragraph LAW ORG provided that statements made by an accused before trial could by admitted in evidence by the trial court if the accused failed to appear or refused to repeat the statement .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , the second paragraph of LAW concerned statements made before trial by persons accused in connected proceedings . Unlike the position under the first paragraph , the second paragraph did not permit the trial court to admit such statements in evidence if the accused exercised his right to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared the second paragraph of LAW on the ground that , as the statements referred to therein could not be admitted in evidence at trial if the accused in connected proceedings remained silent , there was an unjustified difference in treatment between those statements and statements of the type referred to in the first paragraph . ORG thereby enabled trial courts to admit statements made by a co - accused in connected proceedings , irrespective of whether the person against whom they were being used had been given the opportunity of examining the maker of the statement or of having him examined at any stage in the proceedings . Furthermore , ORG made no reference to the procedural safeguards embodied in LAW or to the criteria established by the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . By PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG amended LAW with a view to making it consistent with the adversarial principle . In substance , statements made by a co - accused or by an accused in connected proceedings could no longer be used against another person without his consent if the maker of the statement exercised his right to remain silent .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in its judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG again declared LAW , this time in its entirety . It held that precluding the trial court from admitting such statements in evidence if the maker remained silent entailed a risk that the court would be deprived of evidence that could assist it in reaching its decision , a risk that was dependent solely on the decision of the maker of the statements .", "CARDINAL . Following that decision ORG adopted LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE whereby the principle of a fair trial was embodied in the LAW itself . LAW , as now worded , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Jurisdiction shall be exercised through fair proceedings , conducted in accordance with rules of procedure .", "CARDINAL . All proceedings shall be conducted in compliance with the principles of adversarial process and equality of arms before a neutral and impartial court . The right to be tried within a reasonable time shall be guaranteed by law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In criminal proceedings , the law shall guarantee that the person accused of an offence shall be informed promptly and in confidence of the nature and grounds of the charge against him ; that he shall have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence ; that he shall be given an opportunity before the court to examine or to have examined anyone giving evidence against him , to obtain the attendance and examination of any defence witnesses on the same conditions as witnesses called by the prosecution and to obtain the production of any other evidence in his favour ; and that he will have the assistance of an interpreter if he can not understand or speak the language used at the trial .", "CARDINAL . The principle of adversarial process shall be observed during criminal proceedings with regard to the examination of evidence . An accused \u2019s guilt can not be established on the basis of statements made by a person who has freely and wilfully eluded examination by the accused or his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Rules shall be made governing the circumstances in which adversarial examination of the evidence shall be dispensed with either because the accused has consented , or because there is due evidence that such examination is objectively impossible or that there has been unlawful conduct . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , the NORP parliament clarified how the amended LAW would apply to trials under way . In particular , the former rules continue to apply in certain circumstances .", "Further , a consolidating bill implementing that constitutional amendment was adopted by ORG on DATE . Among other things , this implementing legislation amends LAW by providing that if the maker of statements made before the trial exercises his right not to answer questions , his statements will , as a general rule , be admissible in evidence if the parties agree . However , the former rules will continue to apply in at least some circumstances to trials that are under way ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
