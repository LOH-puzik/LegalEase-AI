The applicant and her husband have always lived in the GPE . By a decision of DATE , the applicant 's husband was granted a married man 's old - age pension under LAW ( PERSON ) commencing on DATE . However , pursuant to the then section CARDINAL of the Act , his pension was reduced by PERCENT as neither he nor the applicant had been insured under LAW during CARDINAL periods DATE and DATE when he had worked in GPE and had an old - age insurance under the NORP social - security legislation . These CARDINAL periods amounted in total to DATE . No appeal was filed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant reached DATE , ORG ) , by a decision of DATE , granted the applicant an old - age pension under LAW commencing on DATE . As had occurred with her husband 's pension , her pension was also reduced by PERCENT . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) , as it was then known , complaining that this reduction in her old - age pension constituted discriminatory treatment .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that , under sections DATE CARDINAL of the General Old Age Pensions Act , a married person DATE like the applicant \u2013 who had been insured under this LAW and had reached DATE was entitled to an old - age pension amounting to PERCENT of the net minimum wage per month .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , under the terms of CARDINAL of the LAW , this amount could be reduced by PERCENT for DATE in which the person concerned had not been insured DATE . ORG further noted that , according to section DATE ) of the LAW , those insured were persons DATE who were either resident in the GPE or , if not , were liable to payment of salaries tax ( loonbelasting ) in respect of work carried out in the GPE under a contract of employment . Under the present subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the LAW , it was possible , by way of an Order in Council ( Algemene Maatregel van Bestuur ) , to extend or limit the group of insured persons as an exception to the general rule contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) to the effect that the question whether or not a person was insured under LAW fell to be determined on the basis of the rules in force at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that , by virtue of CARDINAL consecutive royal decrees on the extension and limitation of the group of insured persons ( Koninklijke Besluiten Uitbreiding en Beperking van de kring der verzekerden ) that had been issued under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW and had remained in force until DATE , persons residing in the GPE but working abroad under a contract of employment and insured under a foreign social - security scheme by virtue of that employment were not insured under LAW . That limitation also applied to a woman married to a person who , pursuant to those royal decrees , was not insured under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it was not in dispute that , during the relevant periods , the applicant 's husband had been working in GPE and had been subject to NORP social - security legislation in accordance with Ordinance no . CARDINAL of ORG ( until DATE ) and subsequently LAW .", "CARDINAL . It found that , in these circumstances , ORG had correctly concluded that the applicant was not insured under LAW for the period her husband had worked in GPE .", "CARDINAL . However , as regards the question whether that situation was compatible with the principle of equality , in particular the prohibition on discrimination between men and women , ORG noted that there was a provision in the royal decrees which rendered the insurance of married women under LAW dependent on their husbands being insured , whereas the decrees did not contain a comparable provision in respect of married men .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the applicant 's situation in the light of LAW ( ORG ) . It referred to the case - law of ORG according to which , from DATE , this provision was also directly applicable in the GPE legal order in the field of social security . ORG found that this implied that rights could be derived directly from this provision in so far as an application , after DATE , of statutory rules created a difference in treatment between men and women without any objective and reasonable justification , and led to a more unfavourable result than would have existed had there not been such a difference . It considered that the applicant had found herself in that situation as she had been awarded an old - age pension on DATE from which PERCENT was deducted on the basis of rules which made an unjustified distinction between married men and women .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , from DATE , the principle of equal treatment between men and women had been incorporated in ORG , and that this had resulted in the introduction of a system in which the entitlement to full benefits was made solely dependent on the question whether or not the person concerned had personally completed DATE under the Act . It concluded , therefore , that married women , like the applicant , who had fully complied with the conditions for insurance under the LAW , could not be regarded as having been uninsured during a certain period solely on grounds of marital status .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG quashed the decision of DATE , in so far as the applicant 's pension was reduced by PERCENT , upheld the remainder of the decision and ruled that the applicant was entitled to a full pension under LAW . ORG filed an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG quashed the decision of DATE and dismissed the applicant 's appeal as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted at the outset that it was not in dispute between the parties that the applicant did not belong to the group of persons as defined in LAW on the gradual implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the field of social security . It considered that view to be correct and , consequently , held that the question of the reduction in the applicant 's pension could not be examined in the light of the prohibition on discrimination set out in LAW of this directive .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question whether the reduction in the applicant 's pension was compatible with LAW ORG , ORG considered that , from DATE , that provision could also be directly relied on in the field of social security . It also referred to the case - law according to which this implied that ORG to the ORG were obliged to ensure that their statutory rules were free of any form of discrimination prohibited by that provision . However , it said that a difference in treatment was not contrary to that provision where there were objective and reasonable grounds for the difference .", "CARDINAL . In the light of those considerations , ORG held that LAW ORG could not deprive a national statutory rule of its effect , according to which the level of benefits under a statutory insurance scheme \u2013 like ORG \u2013 was made dependent on the question of whether the periods of insurance had been completed . It held that this was no different where it could be established that the disqualification of certain periods of insurance before DATE was based on a domestic rule which made a difference in treatment on the basis of sex , as that rule had been in operation during a period in which LAW ORG was not yet directly applicable and could not , therefore , deprive the domestic rule of its earlier effect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's subsequent appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) was dismissed on DATE . As to the applicant 's argument that ORG had failed to examine whether or not there was an objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment , ORG held that ORG had correctly found that , as regards the periods in which the applicant had not been insured under LAW , she could not rely on LAW ORG , as those periods predated the entry into force of that international instrument .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant complained that ORG had unjustly failed to deprive the discriminatory rule at issue of its effect on grounds of incompatibility with the prohibition on discrimination contained in LAW ( PERSON ) , ORG held that the periods during which the applicant had not been insured under LAW predated the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant relied on unwritten general principles of law ( algemene rechtsbeginselen ) , in particular the principle of equality , ORG considered that , according to the explanatory memorandum ( Nota van Toelichting ) to the first royal decree on the extension and limitation of the group of insured persons of DATE , the exclusion was aimed at preventing an undesirable accumulation of benefits . According to the explanatory memorandum , the pension rights accrued by the man abroad were also considered to be intended to benefit his spouse .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that in view of the social attitudes prevailing at the relevant time , that is to say the periods during which the applicant had not been insured under the General Old Age Pensions Act , the government of the time could have taken the view that in practically all cases it was the man who was the \u201c breadwinner \u201d so that it could , accordingly , exclude married women and did not have to make a separate provision for cases where the woman was the \u201c breadwinner \u201d . ORG held , therefore , that there was an objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment on grounds of sex which the exclusion entailed .", "CARDINAL . ORG further rejected the applicant 's argument based on the principle of equality contained in LAW on the gradual implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the field of social security , as the applicant fell outside the scope of LAW directive , which defined the group of persons to whom the directive applied .", "CARDINAL . The General Old Age Pensions Act establishes a general old - age pension scheme for persons who have attained DATE . Under this scheme , all persons DATE who reside in the GPE are insured . Contributions to the scheme are paid by all persons who are gainfully employed in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Entitlement to benefits under LAW is not dependent on the level of contributions paid as , contrary to a social - security scheme based on employment ( werknemersverzekering ) , it is a general social - security scheme ( volksverzekering ) . The level of benefits is , however , linked to the period of insurance under LAW . Pursuant to LAW before DATE ) of the LAW , the pension entitlement is reduced by PERCENT for DATE , DATE , that the person concerned was not insured under LAW on grounds of , inter alia , residence abroad . A person who has been insured under LAW for DATE is entitled to a full pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC on the gradual implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women in the field of social security , allowing member GPE a period of DATE until DATE within which to make any amendments to legislation which might be necessary in order to bring it into conformity with the directive .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE a married man was entitled to a pension under LAW for a married couple equal to PERCENT of the minimum wage in force in the GPE . Unmarried persons of either sex were entitled to PERCENT of the minimum wage . A married woman had no entitlement in her own right . According to the royal decree on the extension and limitation of the group of insured persons , as amended on several occasions , a married woman residing in the GPE DATE whose husband was employed abroad and insured under the social - security system in the foreign country of employment \u2013 was not insured under the General Old Age Pensions Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE married women became entitled in their own right to a pension under LAW . Each spouse became entitled to a pension equal to PERCENT of the minimum wage . The position for unmarried persons remained unchanged . As a result of this change , married women are no longer excluded from insurance under LAW for periods when their husbands were employed abroad , provided that they themselves have continuously resided in the GPE or have paid contributions on the basis of gainful employment in the GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
