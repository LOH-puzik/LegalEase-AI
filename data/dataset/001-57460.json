It held that the revocation of the order made on DATE for the applicant \u2019s release was \" unlawful \" because it had not been included in the judgment whereby the applicant had been convicted and sentenced . As for the new warrant , it was \" bad for lack of reasons \" as neither the severity of the penalty imposed nor the fact that co - defendants had absconded amounted to a relevant and sufficient justification .
