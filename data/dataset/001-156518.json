NORP The applicant raised the issue with the Chancellor of Justice ( \u00d5iguskantsler ) who , having analysed the matter and sought additional information from ORG , addressed the PERSON with a report , dated DATE , where he concluded that LAW was unconstitutional in so far as all employees of the security and intelligence organisations were made public with no exception made in respect of the personnel who merely performed technical tasks not related to the main functions of the organisations . He further found that LAW was unconstitutional in that the person \u2019s place of employment at the time of the publication of the announcement was also made public .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Law Committee of the PERSON disagreed with the assessment of the Chancellor of Justice .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had again addressed the Chancellor of ORG , the latter replied by a letter of DATE that he had not deemed necessary to initiate constitutional review proceedings in respect of LAW . The Chancellor of Justice had in the meantime been briefed by ORG about the practice according to which the persons who had performed merely technical tasks were not being made public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He asked that the court declare the text published in PERSON Lisa unlawful and oblige ORG delete the word okupant ( occupier , invader ) and add the word endine ( former ) . In that way the information that he had been a foreign invader occupying GPE from DATE could be disproved . He noted that he had never been accused of or provided with any evidence showing that he had participated in the forceful occupation of the NORP territory as a member of the armed forces of a foreign country or participated in the exercise of the occupation powers . He disagreed having been associated with the crimes committed by the employees of security organisations of the NORP GPE and the NORP regime and argued that a person could only be held individually accountable for his own acts but that principle was ignored by LAW . He asserted that he had only worked for ORG as a driver and knew nothing about gathering information . As a result of the publication of the announcement the applicant had lost his work and he had been a victim of groundless accusations by third parties . He was being called an occupier ( okupant ) and an informant ( koputaja ) and it was being said that \u201c he [ was ] not a proper man \u201d if ORG dealt with him .", "CARDINAL . At ORG hearing on DATE the applicant submitted , inter alia , that he had in the meantime changed his employment but was , at the time of the court hearing , back in the bus company where he had previously worked .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that the applicant had failed to contest the notice which he had been presented with by ORG on DATE . Accordingly , the notice had been made public pursuant to LAW . ORG concluded that the publication of the announcement had become possible because of the applicant \u2019s inaction as he had failed to contest the notice and disprove the information it contained . The information contained in the published announcement corresponded to the information which the applicant had previously been presented with .", "CARDINAL . ORG further verified that in the Internet version of PERSON Lisa the announcements of ORG were published under the section title \u201c Copies of announcements of ORG about persons who have served in intelligence or counterintelligence organisations of the former GPE to be published in PERSON Lisa \u201d and , thus , the notion \u201c former \u201d ( endine ) also applied to the announcement concerning the applicant . Furthermore , the word \u201c occupier \u201d ( okupant ) had not been used in respect of the applicant . ORG did not establish that the publication of the announcement was unlawful or violated the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s request for the review of the constitutionality of LAW would have been pertinent in case he would have contested the notice issued on DATE . The applicant had been informed that pursuant to LAW he had the right , within DATE , to familiarise himself with the documents and contest the information contained in the notice before ORG or a court . Thus , the law had given him a possibility to immediately counter the information gathered . If a court then would have reviewed the issue of the constitutionality of LAW , ORG would have been obliged to proceed with the publishing or to refrain from it , depending on the results of the review . In the circumstances at hand , however , the announcement had been published and the notice no . CARDINAL of DATE , which it had been based on , was lawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the applicant had not produced any evidence to disprove the information published . The applicant himself had confirmed that he had worked as a driver of the former ORG of the NORP SSR .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed arguing that after the publication of the announcement he had become a victim of groundless mocking and had to quit his work . He had sustained substantial pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . He pointed out that the notice of CARDINAL DATE had not caused him any negative results . Rather , what had been of importance was the publication of the announcement in PERSON on DATE . He maintained that in the published announcement he had been depicted as an occupier of ORG . It remained unclear , however , which acts he had committed against GPE and in what way these acts had been criminal . His work as a driver of ORG had been of a merely technical nature and had in fact not been directed against ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . ORG considered that the fact that a person did not contest the initial notice before its publication did not deprive him of a right to lodge a complaint against the publication of the announcement in PERSON . It also considered that the implementation of LAW could in some circumstances involve indirect interference with a person \u2019s fundamental rights caused by the acts of third parties as the person \u2019s reputation could be damaged as a result of the disclosure of his relations with the NORP security organisations . However , in the case in question the interference was in conformity with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The Chancellor of ORG established in his proceedings that according to the defendant \u2019s administrative practice information about the merely technical employees was not , by way of exception , disclosed . According to the assessment of ORG , the [ applicant ] can not demand an exception to be made in respect of him . According to the assessment of the defendant , drivers of the security and intelligence organisations were related to the performance of the NORP substantial tasks ... The court has no ground to take a different position in this question relating to the security risks . ORG can not establish decades later with absolute certainty whether a specific driver performed merely technical or also substantial tasks . Thus , one has to proceed from the possibility that a ORG driver may also pose a potential security risk and the disclosure of the information about him may be in the public interests . Therefore , it is proportionate to apply the [ LAW ] in respect of the persons who worked as drivers in the security or intelligence organisations . Thereby account must be taken of the fact that the publication of the announcement and the indirect interferences caused by that were not inevitably foreseen by law ; the [ applicant ] could have prevented these consequences by making a confession pursuant to ... the [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint about the use of the language in the text of the announcement ORG noted that the word \u201c to occupy \u201d had not referred to the applicant but rather to a ORG ( former GPE ) . Nor had the applicant been treated as a person co - operating with ORG ( an informant or a sneak ) but rather as its staff member . In the announcement the period of the applicant \u2019s employment had also been indicated . There was nothing to imply that he was accused of continuous contact with an intelligence or security organisation of a foreign country . The defendant was not responsible for arbitrary conclusions that third parties may have drawn from the announcement . Lastly , ORG considered that it was proportionate to publish the current places of work of the persons concerned , inter alia , in order to avoid confusion in the public that might otherwise arise in respect of persons with identical or similar names .", "CARDINAL .
