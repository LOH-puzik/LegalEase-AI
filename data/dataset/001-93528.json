The applicant was born in DATE . At the date the application was lodged , he was living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered his detention on remand after hearing representations from him . The applicant was assisted from this point on by counsel . In a detention order running to CARDINAL pages , ORG found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded taxes on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE , an offence punishable under various provisions ( which were specified in detail ) of LAW , LAW , LAW and ORG Taxes . He had been working as a self - employed commercial agent for CARDINAL different firms in GPE ( whose names were listed in detail in the order ) since DATE . He had also been running a telephone service since DATE ; in DATE a company , TMA GPE , had paid him commission amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) . The court found on the basis of the documents before it that there were grounds for suspecting the applicant of having evaded turnover taxes of MONEY ( ORG ) , income taxes of ORG CARDINAL and trade taxes of EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the applicant , who had availed himself of the right to remain silent , was strongly suspected of tax evasion on the basis of business records that had been seized when his home was searched , ORG decided that he had to be placed in pre - trial detention because of the danger of collusion ( GPE \u2013 see LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW , cited in paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also noted that the documents seized were incomplete , so that there was a risk that the applicant , if released , might destroy the missing documents or conceal further business transactions and accounts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an application for review of his detention order ( GPE ) with ORG . His counsel also requested access to the case file , which he argued he had a right to inspect in order to apprise himself of all the facts and evidence on which the detention order and , in particular , the strong suspicion that an offence had been committed were based . He also pointed out that domestic law prohibited ORG from considering facts and evidence to which defence counsel had been refused access pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant 's counsel that he was being refused access to the case file pursuant to LAW as it would jeopardise the purpose of the investigation . It added , however , that the public prosecutor in charge of the case was prepared to inform counsel orally about the facts and evidence at issue . The applicant 's counsel did not take up that offer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard representations from the applicant and his defence counsel . The applicant argued that there was no risk of collusion or of his absconding . Should the court nevertheless consider that he might abscond if released he was ready to comply with any conditions imposed by the court , such as handing over his identity papers . The applicant 's counsel complained that he had still not had access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG , which had before it the case file of the proceedings , upheld the detention order . It found that there was still a risk that , if released , the applicant would tamper with factual evidence or interfere with witnesses . The applicant had consistently sought .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant 's appeal , which was lodged on DATE and was followed up by detailed reasons on DATE , ORG informed the applicant in a letter dated DATE that it considered that the risk of his absconding could serve as a ground for his continued detention . As to his counsel 's request for access to the case file , it stated that he should be informed orally about the content of the file in the first instance .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the applicant contested that view . He claimed , in particular , that in his case mere oral information about the content of the case file would not be sufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing representations from ORG and considering the case file , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision dated DATE . It found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded income , turnover and trade taxes . Furthermore , there was a danger of his absconding within the meaning of LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as the applicant had connections in foreign countries and faced a heavy sentence .", "CARDINAL . In view of defence counsel 's refusal to accept the offer made by ORG to explain the content of the case file orally , ORG found that it was impossible to assess whether the information given in this manner would be sufficient . At that stage of the proceedings , however , counsel for the defence could not claim to be entitled to unlimited access to the complete case file .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a further appeal against the detention order . He again claimed that he had a constitutional right to be given access to the facts and evidence on which the detention order was based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , without giving further reasons , not to vary its decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG , which was in possession of the case file , drafted a report which was sent to ORG with the file DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in its submissions to ORG , stated that it was not prepared to give the applicant access to the case file as it was sufficient for the applicant to be notified of ORG overview of the amount of his income and amount of the taxes evaded in DATE in question . The submissions and the case file reached ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent further observations to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had been sent the submissions of ORG on DATE , contested its arguments . He stated that the overview in question was merely a conclusion of ORG the merits of which he could not examine without having access to the documents and records on which it was based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the applicant 's further appeal , quashed ORG decision dated CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision dated DATE upholding the applicant 's detention and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , which had the investigation file before it , found that the detention order issued by ORG on DATE did not comply with the statutory requirements and that the decisions taken in the judicial review proceedings by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE ( but not the detention order of DATE itself ) therefore had to be quashed . It noted that LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) required the facts that established strong suspicion that the accused had committed an offence and that formed the basis for his detention to be set out in the detention order . Moreover , in order to comply with the constitutional rights to be heard and to a fair trial , the facts and evidence on which the suspicion and the reasons for the defendant 's detention on remand were based had to be described in sufficient detail to enable the accused to comment on them and defend himself effectively . The facts and evidence had to be set out in greater detail in the detention order in cases in which defence counsel had been denied access to the case file under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , however , that in its decisions on the applicant 's detention ORG had confined itself to noting that the applicant was strongly suspected of tax evasion \u201c on the basis of the business records seized when his home was searched \u201d when it should , at minimum , have summarised the results of the evaluation of those records in order to enable the accused to oppose the decision on detention by making his own submissions or presenting evidence . This defect had not been remedied in the course of the subsequent decisions on the applicant 's continued detention . As counsel for the defence had also been refused access to the case file under LAW , these defects amounted to a denial of the right of the accused to be heard .", "CARDINAL . ORG declined to take its own decision on the applicant 's detention under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or to quash the detention order of ORG . Referring to the civil courts ' case - law on that issue ( namely , CARDINAL decisions of ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and to a decision of ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ) it considered that ORG detention order was defective in law ( rechtsfehlerhaft ) , but not void ( unwirksam ) . The defect could be remedied in the course of the judicial review proceedings ( see ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE DATE , and ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL DATE paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated that it would only quash a detention order if it was obvious that there was either no strong suspicion that the accused had committed an offence or that there were no reasons for the arrest , but that that was not the position in the applicant 's case . It was for ORG to inform the accused of the grounds on which he was suspected of having committed an offence and to hear representations from him on that issue ( see also ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cited at paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Should ORG persist , in the interest of its investigations , in not informing the accused of the reasons for his detention , the detention order would have to be quashed .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence , the applicant remained in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to issue a fresh , amended detention order against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again heard representations from the applicant , his defence counsel , ORG and an official in charge of investigations at ORG on the applicant 's application for judicial review of the detention order . The applicant 's counsel was given copies of CARDINAL pages of the voluminous case file containing the overview by ORG of the amount of the applicant 's income and of the taxes he was alleged to have evaded DATE . Relying on the applicant 's rights to be heard and to a fair trial , the applicant 's counsel complained that he had not been granted access to the case file before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG then issued a fresh order , running to CARDINAL pages , for the applicant 's detention . It stated that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded taxes on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE . Listing in detail the applicant 's income from his various activities as a self - employed commercial agent for CARDINAL different firms and as marketing director of the TMA GPE company and the amounts of tax payable in DATE in question , ORG found that there was a strong suspicion that he had evaded turnover taxes of ORG , income taxes of ORG , solidarity taxes of ORG and trade taxes of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It based its suspicion on documents whose content was explained by a tax official present at the hearing , witness statements of the owners of the firms the applicant was working for , the applicant 's contracts of employment and wage slips and commission statements that had been issued by the firms .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that there was a risk of the applicant 's absconding ( a ground for detention under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW ) as he faced a lengthy prison sentence which could possibly no longer be suspended on probation , had not notified the authorities of his place of residence for DATE and had claimed that he was living in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG decided to suspend the execution of the detention order on condition that the applicant ( who in the meantime had complied with his duty to inform the authorities of his address ) informed the court of every change of address , complied with all summonses issued by the court , ORG and the police , and reported to the police CARDINAL times a week . However , the district court did not order the applicant 's immediate release as ORG had immediately lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing representations from the applicant and ORG , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the detention order . It likewise dismissed the appeal lodged by ORG against the decision to suspend the execution of the detention order on the additional conditions that the applicant hand over his identity papers to ORG and deposit ORG CARDINAL as security .", "CARDINAL . Having deposited the security , the applicant was released from prison on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further appeal against ORG decision , complaining that his counsel had still not been granted access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , ORG granted the applicant 's counsel access to the case file . It stated that it had intended to send the file to him at an earlier date , but that this had not been possible as the file had been at ORG and had only recently been returned to ORG . The applicant 's counsel received the file for inspection on LAW November CARDINAL . The applicant withdrew his further appeal on LAW December CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the decision of ORG dated DATE and the detention order issued by ORG on DATE . In his submission , his rights to liberty , to be heard in court and to be informed promptly by a judge of the reasons for his detention on remand as well as his rights to be heard within a reasonable time and to a fair trial as guaranteed by LAW had been violated . He argued in particular that his right to liberty , the deprivation of which was only constitutional if it was in accordance with the law , had been breached by his illegal detention on the basis of a void detention order . The complete refusal to allow his defence counsel access to the case file pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW had violated his right to be heard in court , as guaranteed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and his right to liberty under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The impugned decisions disregarded both the case - law of ORG and the ORG 's case - law as laid down in its judgments of CARDINAL DATE in the cases of PERSON , PERSON v. GPE and GPE . ORG refusal to quash the detention order and its decision to remit the case to ORG instead had also breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant extended his constitutional complaint to include the decisions of ORG dated DATE and the decision of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint against the detention orders issued by ORG on DATE and DATE , the decision of ORG dated DATE and the decision of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of tax evasion and sentenced him to a total of DATE and DATE imprisonment suspended on probation . It found that the applicant , who had confessed to the offences , had evaded turnover taxes of DEM CARDINAL , income taxes of ORG and trade taxes of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) concern detention on remand . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code , a defendant may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he has committed a criminal offence and if there are grounds for arresting him . Grounds for arrest will exist where certain facts warrant the conclusion that there is a risk of his absconding ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) or of collusion ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , detention on remand is ordered by a judge in a written detention order . The detention order identifies the accused , the offence of which he is strongly suspected , including the time and place of its commission , and the grounds for the arrest ( nos . CARDINAL of LAW ) . Moreover , the facts establishing the grounds for the strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest must be set out in the detention order unless national security would thereby be endangered ( LAW no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , remand prisoners may at any time seek judicial review ( GPE ) of a decision to issue a detention order or ask for the order to be suspended . They may lodge an appeal under LAW ) against a decision ordering their ( continued ) detention and a further appeal ( PERSON ) against ORG decision on the appeal ( LAW ) . Decisions on a person 's pre - trial detention have to be taken speedily ( compare , among many others , ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , PERSON ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . As a rule , pre - trial detention must not continue for DATE ( see LAW ; compare ORG , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The consequences of a court 's finding in the course of judicial review proceedings that a detention order is flawed will depend on the nature of the defect found . Certain formal defects , in particular a failure to set out in sufficient detail in the order the facts establishing the grounds for strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest , as required by LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW , will make the order defective in law ( rechtsfehlerhaft ) , but not void ( unwirksam / nichtig ) ( see , inter alia , ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG f\u00fcr ORG ( ORG ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL ; and ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , StV DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Such defects may therefore be remedied by the appeal courts in the course of the judicial review proceedings by either quashing the defective order or replacing it with a fresh , duly reasoned order ( compare , inter alia , ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , NStZ DATE , pp . CARDINAL with further references ; ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE DATE , decision of DATE , ORG f\u00fcr PERSON ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , StV DATE , pp . CARDINAL ; and ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , StV DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . A defective detention order thus remains a valid basis for detention until the defect is remedied . On the contrary , detention on the basis of a detention order which is void owing to a serious and obvious defect is unlawful ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave the following reasons for the distinction between void and defective court decisions :", "\u201c Only in rare , exceptional cases can a court decision be considered void in its entirety , with the consequence that it is legally irrelevant ( see ... ) . This is a consequence of the requirements of legal certainty and its corollary , the authority of court decisions , as well as of the overall structure of criminal proceedings with its system of legal remedies designed to correct defective decisions . Considering a court decision ... as legally irrelevant means that anyone may claim that it is null and void at any stage of the proceedings , even after it has become final ... In the case of decisions which can be challenged by an appeal , the statutory rules \u2013 formalities and time - limits \u2013 become inoperative if the decisions are deemed legally irrelevant . Such consequences , which run counter to the overall order of the law of criminal procedure , may be drawn from the defectiveness of a court decision only , if at all , where it would be unthinkable for the legal community to recognise ( at least provisionally ) its validity . This will occur if the extent and gravity of the defect are such that the decision blatantly contradicts the spirit of LAW and key principles of our legal order ( see ... ) . From the perspective of legal certainty , the assumption that a decision is null and void presupposes , in addition , that the serious defect is obvious \u201d ( see ORG , no . CARDINAL BJs CARDINAL , decision of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL with further references ; compare also ORG , no . TIME , decision of CARDINAL DATE , NStZ DATE , p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . As regards the consequences of a finding by a court of appeal , on a further appeal by the detainee , that a detention order is flawed , LAW lays down that if the appeal court considers the appeal against the ( continued ) detention well - founded , it must take the necessary decision in the case at the same time . The court of appeal thus decides the merits of the case in the lower courts ' stead ( see , for instance , ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . However , the courts of appeal have developed exceptions to the rule laid down in LAW . In certain limited circumstances , a case may exceptionally be remitted to the court of first instance if there has been a procedural defect which the court of appeal can not properly remedy itself ( see ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , NStZ DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and ORG , no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , ORG , pp . DATE ) . In particular , a court of appeal may remit the case to the district court instead of taking its own decision on the merits if a detention order does not comply with the duty to set out the grounds for suspecting the accused of an offence and if , in addition , the prosecution refused access to the case file . The explanation for this is that , in such cases , the defective reasoning effectively amounts to a breach of the duty to hear representations from the defendant . It was the district court which had jurisdiction to inform the accused for the first time of the grounds for suspecting him of an offence and to hear representations from him ( see ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , StV DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The duty to expedite proceedings in which the suspect is in detention does not warrant a different conclusion as only a remittal of the case will enable him to avail himself effectively of his right to be heard ( see ORG , no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL , StV DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that defence counsel is entitled to consult the file which has been or will be presented to the trial court , and to inspect the exhibits . Paragraph CARDINAL of this provision allows access to part or all of the file or to the exhibits to be refused until the preliminary investigation has ended if the investigation might otherwise be at risk . At no stage of the proceedings may defence counsel be refused access to records concerning the examination of the accused , acts in the judicial investigation at which defence counsel was or should have been allowed to be present or expert reports ( LAW of the said LAW Pending the termination of the preliminary investigation , it is for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the file or not ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ( LAW ) . An accused who is in detention is entitled by virtue of LAW of LAW to seek judicial review of a decision of ORG to refuse access to the file . Pursuant to that provision , the regional court for the district where ORG is located has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review ; its decisions are not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW every person involved in proceedings before a court is entitled to be heard by that court ( PERSON auf rechtliches PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that every person provisionally detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence must be brought before a judge DATE following his arrest ; the judge must inform him of the reasons for the arrest , hear representations from him and give him an opportunity to raise objections . The judge must then , without delay , either issue a written detention order setting out the grounds therefor or order the detainee 's release ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
