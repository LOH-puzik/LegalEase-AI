The applicants are NORP nationals of GPE origin . They used to live in the village of GPE , in the NORP district , and are agricultural workers .

On TIME DATE broke out in a bar in the centre of the village of GPE ( NORP district ) . PERSON and PERSON , CARDINAL GPE brothers , along with another Rom , PERSON , began to argue with a non - Rom , PERSON . The verbal confrontation developed into a physical one which ended with the death of PERSON , who had come to the aid of his father . The CARDINAL GPE then fled the scene and sought refuge in a neighbour 's house .", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards , news of the incident spread and a large number of villagers learned of PERSON death . Enraged , they gathered together to find the GPE . The angry mob arrived at the house where the CARDINAL were hiding and demanded that they come out . Among the crowd were members of the local police force in GPE , including the Chief of Police PERSON , and PERSON , who had heard of the incident . When the brothers refused to come out , the crowd set fire to the house . As the fire engulfed the house , the brothers tried to flee but were caught by the mob who beat and kicked them with vineyard stakes and clubs . The CARDINAL brothers died TIME . PERSON remained in the house , where he died in the fire . It appears that the police officers present did nothing to stop these attacks . The applicants alleged that , on the contrary , the police also called for and allowed the destruction of all GPE property in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Later that evening the villagers decided to vent their anger on all the GPE living in the village and proceeded to burn the GPE homes and property in GPE , including stables , cars and goods .

The mob had then proceeded to set fire to her home and she had watched as the flames destroyed it . The next day , when she had returned home with her husband and daughter , she had been met by an enraged mob of villagers who had prevented her from entering the house . Police officers PERSON , PERSON and ORG had taken hold of her , sprayed pepper in her face and then proceeded to beat her badly . Costic\u0103 Moldovan had witnessed these events . Colonel ORG had also fired at Costic\u0103 Moldovan and his family as they tried to return home to fetch their pigs . The applicant declared that her house had been damaged and that she had lost valuables and other possessions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that on TIME DATE she had learned from her DATE daughter what was happening in GPE . Her daughter had told her that a neighbour had said that the non - GPE villagers wanted to kill all the NORP in retaliation for the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Fearing for the safety of her children , the applicant had taken them to her mother 's house . TIME , when she returned , she witnessed several people gathered in front of the courtyard throwing stones and pieces of wood and eventually setting her house on fire . As she ran back to her mother 's house , she saw CARDINAL people armed with clubs , urging the mob to set fire to it . Within TIME , her mother 's home was in flames .", "CARDINAL . The following day the applicant had attempted to return to what was left of her home to assess the damage . As she approached her property , she had been threatened verbally and physically by an angry mob of non - Roma villagers and police officers . CARDINAL villager had threatened her with a shovel and others had violently thrown rocks at her . The villagers , including the police officers present , had prevented her from entering what remained of her home . Fearing for her safety , the applicant and her children had left GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE she had once again attempted to return to her home along with other GPE villagers . This time the applicant had found the road to her house entirely blocked by an even larger crowd of villagers , all of whom had been carrying clubs . Police officers had also been among the crowd . Among the enraged mob of villagers , the applicant had recognised Officer PERSON , who was holding a truncheon . A police car had even pursued the applicant and other GPE trying to return to their homes , firing shots at them and shouting at them to leave the village . The applicant alleged that her house had been destroyed and that she had lost valuable goods .", "CARDINAL . Petru ( Gruia ) L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f alleged that his house had been destroyed , as had the CARDINAL cars he had had in the courtyard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that , on TIME DATE , her husband , PERSON , and her CARDINAL brothers , PERSON and PERSON , had been brutally murdered in the PERSON pogrom . She alleged that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL GPE houses set on fire TIME had belonged to her late mother , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that his house had been destroyed and that he had lost valuable goods . His wife had been pregnant at the time of the incident and , because she had been beaten and had experienced severe fear , the baby had been born with brain damage .", "CARDINAL . In the aftermath of the incident the GPE residents of GPE lodged a criminal complaint with ORG . The complainants identified a number of individuals responsible for what had occurred on DATE . Among those identified were several police officers : Chief of Police PERSON , his assistant PERSON , Colonel PERSON , a certain FAC , and Lieutenant Colonel PERSON , the GPE Chief of Police .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , an investigation was initiated which identified the offenders who had actively participated in the killing of the PERSON brothers and PERSON , and the destruction of GPE houses and other property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL civilians PERSON , GPE and GPE - were remanded in custody . They were charged with extremely serious murder ( under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and arson ( under LAW ) . However , TIME they were released and all warrants for their arrest were set aside by order of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , on the basis of ample evidence that suggested police involvement in the incident , the case was sent to the NORP - Mure\u015f Military ORG , which had jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed by police officers . According to the order of ORG of the T\u00e2rgu - ORG , Lieutenant Colonel PERSON had organised a small meeting with non - GPE villagers after the incident , advising them \u201c not to tell anyone what the police had done if they wanted the incident to be forgotten and not have any consequences for themselves . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a resolution dated DATE , the T\u00e2rgu - ORG ordered an extension of the investigation and the initiation of a criminal investigation in respect of Chief of Police Moga and PERSON . According to the military prosecutor , the evidence produced so far indicated that these persons had incited the villagers to commit acts of violence against the PERSON brothers and had even directly participated in setting fire to certain houses . On the basis of oral evidence , the prosecutor found that officers PERSON and PERSON had participated in the events and \u201c repeatedly \u201d incited the villagers to take action against the men barricaded in the house , telling them to \u201c set them on fire , because we can not do anything to them \u201d . Moreover , he found that Lieutenant Colonel PERSON had required the inhabitants of ORG \u201c not to tell anyone anything about the actions of the police officers , and everything will be forgotten and you shall bear no consequences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having regard to the involvement of Colonel Palade , the T\u00e2rgu - ORG declined jurisdiction to investigate the case and referred it to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Colonel Magistrate PERSON , the military prosecutor at ORG , decided not to open a criminal investigation , stating that the evidence produced in the case had not confirmed the participation of Chief of Police Moga , Lieutenant Colonel PERSON or Sergeant \u015eu\u015fc\u0103 in the crimes committed during the riots . As to the statements made by various witnesses confirming the involvement of these police officers , the prosecutor found that CARDINAL of them had been made by the sister of CARDINAL of the victims and , given the fact that the officers had punished the victims several times , her evidence was obviously tendentious . The prosecutor found the other oral evidence confused . He concluded that the police officers could not be accused of having committed crimes , \u201c even though one should accept that during the events they had used words such as ' do what you want , I have a family to take care of ' or ' they will come out immediately if you set the house on fire ' . Moreover , we can not consider the lack of initiative and the inability of the CARDINAL policemen to influence the behaviour of the furious villagers as a form of participation \u2013 either in the form of instigation or as possible moral complicity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Head of ORG upheld the decision , refusing to open an investigation , and all charges against the police officers were dropped . An appeal lodged by the injured parties was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of the T\u00e2rgu - ORG issued an indictment charging CARDINAL civilians suspected of having committed crimes on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Certain testimonies confirmed that the police had promised the villagers involved in the riot that they would help to cover up the entire incident . Several defendants testified that CARDINAL police cars driving to the scene of the incident that night had ordered , over their loudspeakers , that the house where the CARDINAL GPE victims were hiding be set on fire .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal trial , in conjunction with a civil case for damages , began against the civilian defendants in the T\u00e2rgu - ORG . During these proceedings , the applicants learned of the overwhelming extent of the evidence against the police . Various witnesses testified that police officers had not only been present that TIME but had actually instigated the incident and then stood idly by as the CARDINAL PERSON brothers and PERSON were killed and GPE houses destroyed . In this connection , witnesses cited the names of Chief of Police Moga , Colonel PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In the light of numerous testimonies implicating additional individuals \u2013 both civilians and police officers \u2013 the applicants ' lawyer asked the court to extend the indictment of CARDINAL DATE . As a result , the civilian prosecutor sent the relevant military prosecutor the information on which to base proceedings before a military court against the officers concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicants PERSON and PERSON asked the court in writing to extend the criminal charges . According to them , the prosecutor refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the T\u00e2rgu - ORG severed the civil and the criminal case because the criminal investigation had already lasted DATE and the determination of the civil aspect would take even longer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the T\u00e2rgu - ORG delivered its judgment in the criminal case . It noted the following :", "\u201c The village of GPE , belonging to the commune of PERSON , is situated in the south - west LOC on the main road between NORP - Mure\u015f and GPE and has a population of CARDINAL inhabitants , of which CARDINAL are NORP , CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL Roma .", "The GPE community represents PERCENT of the total population and the marginal lifestyle of some categories of GPE , especially the ones who settled in the village after DATE , has often generated serious conflicts with the majority of the population .", "Due to their lifestyle and their rejection of the moral values accepted by the rest of the population , the GPE community has marginalised itself , shown aggressive behaviour and deliberately denied and violated the legal norms acknowledged by society .", "Most of the GPE have no occupation and earn their living by doing odd jobs , stealing and engaging in all kinds of illicit activities . As the old form of common property that gave them equal rights with the other members of the community was terminated , the GPE population were allocated plots of land . However , they did not work the land and continued to steal , to commit acts of violence and to carry out attacks , mainly against private property , which has generated even more rejection than before .", "ORG have started arguments with the young people in the village , attacked them or stolen their goods and money .", "Moreover , they ostentatiously use insults , profanities and vulgar words in public places . ...", "The records of the criminal - investigation authorities and of the courts of law in GPE disclose that CARDINAL criminal cases were registered DATE , having as their object acts of violence ranging from simple blows to murder .", "In fact , the real number of the crimes committed by the GPE was much higher , but many of them were not judged in court because the injured parties did not file complaints , withdrew them or made peace with the perpetrators , for fear of vindictive threats by the GPE .", "The community feels that most of the disputes were solved in an unfair , unsatisfactory manner in favour of GPE and this has caused an increase in the number of personal or collective vindictive actions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court went on to establish that , on TIME DATE , the PERSON brothers and PERSON had been waiting at the village bus station and had quarrelled with PERSON about the attempts made by the CARDINAL GPE to attract the attention of a girl . Answering the GPE 's mockery and insults addressed to him and to his cow , PERSON started to threaten the GPE with his whip and even hit PERSON . A fight followed , during which PERSON , who had intervened to defend his father , was stabbed in the chest by PERSON . The GPE ran away , while PERSON was brought to the hospital , where he died TIME . During that time the GPE took refuge in the house of the applicants Lucre\u0163ia and PERSON , while villagers gathered around the yard of the house . QUANTITY police officers , Chief of Police Moga and PERSON , arrived at the scene of TIME , having been called by some villagers . The policemen were allegedly under the influence of alcohol . Before and after the arrival of the police , the villagers threw stones , pieces of wood and clods of earth at the house and shouted things like \u201c Set fire to the house ! Let them burn like rats ! \u201d A villager started to throw flammable materials at the house and was soon followed by others , including children . When the fire spread , CARDINAL of the GPE men came out of the house . PERSON was immediately immobilised by PERSON , while PERSON managed to run away . PERSON was stopped from coming out of the house by a villager and was hit by another 's fist and a shovel , which finally led to his dying in the fire . His carbonized body was found the following day in the burned - down house . The autopsy report established that he had died from respiratory failure , PERCENT carbonized .", "CARDINAL . To escape the fury of the villagers , Chief of Police PERSON took PERSON to the cemetery , after trying in vain to enter several courtyards in the village , which were all locked . The court noted that \u201c the policeman [ Moga ] , realising his presence was useless , abandoned his prisoner to the infuriated crowd \u201d . According to the autopsy report , PERSON died a violent death from shock and internal bleeding , with multiple traumatic injuries affecting his liver , a hemiperitoneum and peripheral haematoma on PERCENT of his body .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was caught by the crowd near the cultural centre , where he was beaten to death . The autopsy report found that he had died as a result of direct blows from blunt objects causing CARDINAL lesions on his body ( multiple fractures of his arms , ribs and thorax , and multiple traumatic injuries and contusions ) .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , all the civilian defendants stated that , in addition to officers ORG and GPE , CARDINAL other policemen had arrived from the city of Ludu\u015f and encouraged the crowd to set fire to the houses . CARDINAL police cars had also arrived at GPE , from which it was announced over loudspeakers that only the detached houses of the NORP should be set on fire in order not to cause accidents . At a meeting held DATE in the village square , Lieutenant Colonel PERSON stated that the case would be covered up and a scapegoat found .", "CARDINAL . All the accused stated that they had been arrested for the first time in DATE , but only for TIME , after which they had been released in order to allow them to harvest the crops , a reason they found strange , since most of them were not farmers . They also stated that very few questions were put to them and that the prosecutor even tried to put pressure on them . They were not questioned further until DATE , when they were arrested again .", "CARDINAL . The court further established that the villagers had declared that , on TIME in question , the village was to be \u201c purged of the NORP \u201d , an intention clearly put into action , and found that ,", "\u201c The majority of the population of GPE was directly or indirectly supported by the representatives of the authorities who came to the village and not only did nothing to stop the houses being set on fire , but also surrounded the area with groups of gendarmes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found that the action was not premeditated , but that all those present had acted jointly , in different ways ( assault , murder , fire , destruction , etc . ) , to reach their declared goal of eliminating the GPE community from the village .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the preliminary investigation had been inadequate :", "\u201c We deem that the inadequate manner in which the acts and ... procedures related to the investigation were performed reflect a negative attitude ... The same can be noted regarding the delayed submission of the autopsy reports on the victims ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON died on DATE and the forensic reports were drafted in DATE ; mention should be made of the fact that none of the CARDINAL forensic reports gave specific dates , but only an indication of DATE when they were drafted ) ... [ Moreover , ] the electoral meeting organised at the village stadium , attended by politicians , representatives of the police and the law , ... asked the population not to tell the truth and to delay the resolution of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that the prosecution had not agreed to an extension of the criminal investigation or to the initiation of criminal proceedings against \u201c other persons \u201d . Therefore , the court could only rule in respect of those perpetrators prosecuted in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court convicted CARDINAL civilians of extremely serious murder under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and CARDINAL civilians , including the former CARDINAL , of destroying property , outraging public decency and disturbing public order . Among those convicted of destruction of property and disturbance was GPE , the Deputy Mayor of GPE . The court pronounced prison sentences ranging from DATE , and noted that those given terms of DATE had CARDINAL the sentence pardoned under PERSON no . ORG . The court justified the sentences as follows :", "\u201c Taking into consideration the characteristics of this particular case , the punishments applied to the defendants might seem too mild compared to the gravity of the crimes . We consider that , as long as persons who contributed to a greater extent to the criminal actions were not prosecuted and were not even the subject of an investigation , although there was enough evidence to prove their guilt , the defendants who were prosecuted should not be held responsible for all the crimes committed , but only for that part for which they are liable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG appealed against this judgment , asking , inter alia , for heavier sentences . On DATE , the T\u00e2rgu - ORG of Appeal convicted a sixth civilian , PERSON , of extremely serious murder under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , sentencing him to DATE imprisonment . It also increased the sentence under LAW in respect of GPE to DATE imprisonment . However , it reduced the other sentences under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL : in respect of GPE and S.I.P. from DATE imprisonment , in respect of ORG and GPE from DATE imprisonment , and in respect of GPE , GPE and GPE from DATE imprisonment . Finally , it discontinued the criminal proceedings against the Deputy Mayor PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG also reduced the sentences of those convicted of destruction of property under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the lower courts ' convictions for destruction , but reduced the charges of extremely serious murder to a lesser charge of serious murder with extenuating circumstances for GPE , ORG and S.I.P. , sentencing them to DATE imprisonment . It acquitted PERSON and GPE", "CARDINAL . By a decree of DATE , the President of GPE issued individual pardons to PERSON and ORG , convicted of serious murder , whereupon they were released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following new evidence brought to light in the criminal trial , the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG of ORG against the decision of DATE not to open an investigation against the police officers involved in the incidents of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Military Prosecutor of ORG upheld the military prosecutor at ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG allocated CARDINAL NORP lei ( ROL ) for the reconstruction of the QUANTITY houses destroyed by fire on DATE . The Government decided , moreover , that this amount could also be used as financial assistance for the families affected in order to help them replace items of strict necessity destroyed during the fire . However , CARDINAL houses were rebuilt with this money and none of the families received financial assistance .", "CARDINAL . By a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE , a commission for the co - ordination of the reconstruction of the houses was created . Members of this commission included the mayor of PERSON , PERSON , and his Deputy , PERSON", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE addressed to the Government , the ORG indicated that an additional amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL was needed to rebuild the remaining QUANTITY houses .", "CARDINAL . By decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , the ORG granted an additional sum of ORG in funds , which had been earmarked for natural disasters occurring DATE . CARDINAL other houses were rebuilt . As shown in photographs submitted by the applicants , these constructions were defective , as there appear to be huge gaps between the window frames and the walls , and the roofs only partially cover the houses .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE addressed to the Prefect of Mure\u015f , PERSON , the father - in - law of the applicant PERSON , requested that her house be rebuilt as a priority because , since the events , she had been living with her CARDINAL children in a hen - house .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG , a human - rights association based in GPE , informed the ORG that QUANTITY houses had still not been rebuilt , which meant that CARDINAL families had to spend DATE without a dwelling . Moreover , according to the association , most of the victims had complained about the bad quality of the rebuilt houses and alleged that the money allocated for this purpose had been improperly used .", "In a letter addressed to the ORG in DATE , the mayor of PERSON ( of which ORG is a part ) , PERSON , a member of the reconstruction commission , reported that , of the QUANTITY houses destroyed by the fire , QUANTITY had been rebuilt or almost rebuilt . Concerning the remaining QUANTITY houses , he reported that CARDINAL of them posed \u201c special problems \u201d based in part on \u201c the behaviour of the CARDINAL families \u201d , \u201c the seriousness of the acts committed and the attitude of the population of GPE towards these families \u201d . In particular , one of the houses to be rebuilt was on land near the non - Rom victim 's family ( PERSON ) , who refused to have Gypsy families living close by . Another problem mentioned by the mayor was the house of the late mother of CARDINAL of the GPE \u201c criminals \u201d who had died during the DATE events . It appeared that , after the events , the PERSON family had started living in the city of GPE , so the mayor had proposed that a house be built for them at a place of their choice .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant PERSON wrote a letter to the President of GPE , informing him that QUANTITY houses , including his , had still not been rebuilt . He urged the President to grant the necessary funds for the reconstruction of the houses , since he and his family were living in very difficult conditions in the home of the PERSON family : CARDINAL people , including QUANTITY children , were living in CARDINAL rooms and sleeping on the floor , which resulted in the children being continually ill .", "CARDINAL .

The court further noted that , during the events of DATE , QUANTITY houses belonging to the GPE population in GPE had been totally or partially destroyed and CARDINAL GPE had been killed , a criminal court having found CARDINAL villagers guilty of these acts . Basing its decision on an expert report , the court awarded pecuniary damages for those houses which had not been rebuilt in the meantime , and maintenance allowances for the children of the GPE killed during the riots . On the basis of an expert report , the court awarded pecuniary damages in respect of the partial or total destruction of the houses of CARDINAL GPE , including those of the third and fifth applicants . The court rejected the other applicants ' request for pecuniary damages in respect of the rebuilt houses , finding , on the basis of the same expert report , that their value was either the same or even higher than the original buildings .

Neither civil party adduced proof of having an income such as to allow them to acquire so many goods . As noted previously , the parties had no income at all . Moreover , the shape of the houses , the materials used for their construction and the number of rooms show an evident lack of financial resources . It should be stressed in this context that only work can be the source of revenue , and not events such as the present one ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court finally rejected all the applicants ' requests for non - pecuniary damages on the ground that they had not substantiated their claim , and that the crimes committed were not of a nature to produce moral damage .", "CARDINAL .
