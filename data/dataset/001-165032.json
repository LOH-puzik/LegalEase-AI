As to the ill - treatment to which the applicant was allegedly subjected in police custody and the effectiveness of the investigations carried out , although the ORG has not to date found a violation of LAW by the NORP police in that specific context , it nevertheless points to its clear and very extensive case - law in this regard ( see , among many other authorities , PERSON v.

In their declaration in the present case the Government have recognised that the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by the police officers while in police custody , the manner in which the investigations were carried out in that regard , the handling of the applicant \u2019s claims for compensation and in particular the refusal of his applications for legal aid in order to gain access to the compensation procedure , as well as the length of the criminal proceedings against him , infringed Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .

In view of the nature of the undertakings contained in the ORG \u2019s declaration , the ORG considers that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the complaints in question . That decision is without prejudice to the possibility for the applicant to exercise any other available remedies in order to obtain redress . The same applies to the complaint under LAW No . CARDINAL , which is identical in substance to the complaint under LAW concerning the length of the criminal proceedings in question ( paragraph CARDINAL in fine ) . The ORG is further satisfied that respect for human rights as defined in the LAW and the Protocols thereto does not require it to continue its examination of this part of the application ( LAW in fine ) .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the case should be struck out of the list in so far as it concerns the complaints referred to in DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of this decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the same decision , the ORG declared admissible the complaints concerning the applicant \u2019s conditions of detention ( Article CARDINAL ) and the refusal to grant him leave to attend ORG hearing ( Article CARDINAL ) , and dismissed all the other complaints , including the complaint that the criminal proceedings had been unfair owing to the admission of evidence obtained under duress ( Article CARDINAL ) . On the latter point the ORG found as follows :", "\u201c DATE . Relying on Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant complained of the overall unfairness of his conviction for the armed robbery allegedly committed in DATE . He maintained in that connection that a confession had been obtained from him under duress and that the courts had refused several requests made by him for a confrontation . Lastly , the applicant contended that he had been convicted solely on account of his ethnic and social origin and his previous convictions .", "...", "CARDINAL . The Court , having regard to all the evidence in its possession and in so far as it has jurisdiction to examine the allegations made , finds no appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the provisions on which the applicant relies . In particular , it reiterates that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the ORG , which is not the case here ( see , among many other authorities , PERSON GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALV ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows that these complaints are manifestly ill - founded and must be rejected pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a prosecutor attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , finding that none of the grounds for the reopening of criminal proceedings set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW applied . The prosecutor also found as follows :", "\u201c ... The case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) contains the Government \u2019s unilateral declaration , the conclusions of which are applicable only to the circumstances and the events examined within the scope of that case . It can not be concluded from the judgment of DATE adopted by ORG that the ORG examined and assessed any activities carried out by the law - enforcement officers during the pre - trial investigation in the criminal proceedings ... Accordingly , the conclusions reached in [ the ORG \u2019s ] judgment of DATE and the ORG \u2019s unilateral declaration of DATE can not be applied or connected to the criminal proceedings ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an appeal lodged on DATE the applicant reiterated that there was a legal basis for reopening the criminal proceedings concerning his ill - treatment , on account of the fact that the ORG \u2019s unilateral declaration had expressly recognised the violation of LAW , a circumstance which had led the ORG to strike out that complaint . He further argued that at the time his criminal case was examined by the domestic courts , the judicial authorities had been unaware that the investigation into his allegations of ill - treatment was in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE a higher - ranking prosecutor upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The prosecutor noted that , under section ORG ) of LAW , only criminal proceedings that had ended with a valid court judgment or decision could be reopened , and only provided that the ground for requesting such reopening was among those listed in that provision . The prosecutor further found as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the foregoing , I find that the conclusion of the prosecutor in her decision of CARDINAL DATE is valid and well - founded , to the effect that your application dated DATE requesting the reopening of the criminal proceedings in cases nos . DATE on the basis of new circumstances does not comply with any of the conditions prescribed by section PERSON ) of LAW which could serve as grounds for reopening the above - mentioned criminal proceedings . The prosecutor did not establish the existence of any such conditions during the examination of your application , which is why I regard as reasonable her decision to refuse the reopening of the criminal proceedings in cases LAW CARDINAL and DATE on the basis of newly disclosed circumstances .", "As already mentioned , LAW prescribes in detail all the circumstances which shall be recognised as newly disclosed and on the basis of which criminal proceedings ending in a valid court judgment or decision may be reopened . LAW does not make any provision for these circumstances to be expanded . In examining your complaint I did not find established any of the newly disclosed circumstances prescribed by section GPE ) of LAW . Likewise , I did not find any opinion by an international judicial authority relating to the decision of the NORP court in case no . DATE and finding that the judgment of ORG which came into force on DATE did not comply with international law and regulations binding on GPE . ORG did not express such an opinion in its judgment of DATE or in the decision of CARDINAL DATE in which that international court examined your application . I would also like to point out that , contrary to your allegations , ORG in its decision of DATE stated that in the adoption of its decision concerning inhuman treatment by police officers during the criminal investigation it did not find any violation of international laws or regulations .", "In your application you emphasised that the criminal proceedings in cases nos . CARDINAL and DATE should be reopened in connection with the unilateral declaration of ORG mentioned by ORG on DATE , in which ORG recognised that the physical treatment of PERSON by police officers , the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant \u2019s complaints , his access to legal aid and to effective remedies by which to apply for compensation for damage , the length of the criminal proceedings , and the lack of an effective remedy , did not meet the standards enshrined in ORG , CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG . I would like to make clear that , according to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the above - mentioned unilateral declaration by ORG is not recognised as a newly disclosed circumstance and can not therefore be regarded as a basis for reopening the criminal proceedings in cases nos . ORG and DATE .", "In view of the above - mentioned considerations , there is no reason to quash the decision [ ... ] dated DATE concerning the refusal to reopen the criminal proceedings in the light of newly disclosed circumstances ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
