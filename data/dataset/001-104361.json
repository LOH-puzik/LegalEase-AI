In DATE the applicant 's wife informed him that she would not allow further visits , but the applicant continued to go to her flat , sometimes with other members of his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , during one of the visits , took his son A away with him , without his wife 's consent and apparently by force . Afterwards A lived with the applicant in PERSON until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that A had been neglected and that he had acted in the best interests of his son . A subsequently received dental treatment , psychological support and speech therapy , and started going to school .", "The Government submitted that the child 's psychological problems had been caused by the trauma of being kidnapped by his father , which had also led to the aggravation of his stutter . They relied on the reasoning of ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's wife informed the prosecutor that her son had been kidnapped by the applicant .", "The applicant 's wife also applied to the court for sole residence of A ; however , on DATE ORG decided to make a temporary residence order for A with the applicant .

In DATE the parties and A were examined by experts from the RODK ( Regional Family Consultation Centre ) . Their opinion was that A should live with his mother , although the applicant should enjoy extensive contact rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court changed its decision of DATE and made a residence order for A with the applicant 's wife . The applicant was granted contact rights and was ordered to return the child to his wife . An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant failed to comply with this decision and refused to return A.", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , the applicant attempted to visit B ; however , his wife apparently hindered his contact with his younger son .", "CARDINAL .

The court further decided to limit the applicant 's parental responsibility for A and to deprive him altogether of parental responsibility for PERSON of both children was ordered to be with the applicant 's former wife . The court also allowed the applicant contact rights in respect of both his sons .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against the judgment was dismissed on DATE by ORG . The reasoned judgment was notified to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's former wife made contact with B impossible for the applicant . However , he failed to institute enforcement proceedings against his former wife or to apply to the court for a fine to be imposed on her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had kidnapped A and kept him , in spite of the final judgment of DATE and the previous order of CARDINAL DATE . He remained in pre - trial detention for DATE and was released in DATE . On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG . Subsequently , the applicant and his mother were found guilty of keeping A with them , in breach of domestic decisions . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment . It appears that the proceedings are pending before the trial court .", "CARDINAL . A was only returned to residence with his mother DATE after the applicant 's arrest , because DATE and DATE he had been living with the applicant 's mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE A was heard by the prosecutor in the criminal proceedings against the applicant . The child stated that he preferred to live with his father and that his mother had been threatening him and had forbidden him to call his father .", "CARDINAL . In DATE A ran away from his mother 's and went to his father 's house , located QUANTITY away . The applicant took him to the police station and A was returned to his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE A ran away again and joined his father in GPE . They have been living together since then .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to FAC for a new decision regarding parental responsibility and for an order for A 's residence with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court guardian visited the applicant and A. According to her opinion , A did not want to live with his mother , had good living conditions with his father and paternal grandmother in PERSON and preferred to stay with his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant 's request for an interim order changing the child 's place of residence ( o zabezpieczenie wniosku ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an interim order suspending contact between the applicant and B , which had been ordered in the divorce judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the D\u0105browa Tarnowska ORG heard , inter alia , the director of A 's former school , which he had been attending while living at his mother 's . She testified that A had very often spoken to her complaining about his situation at home , in particular that his mother had prohibited him from visiting his father as well as from calling the applicant or using a computer for the purpose of contacting him . During the stay at his mother 's the child apparently felt that he had been treated differently from his brother B and that his mother had threatened that he would be taken to a children 's home and that his father would be arrested again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court again dismissed the applicant 's request for an interim order allowing A 's place of residence to be with him . The court established that A had had de facto residence with the applicant DATE and since DATE . The child obviously had a stronger attachment to his father . However , the court did not consider that there was enough evidence to issue an interim order changing the earlier decision of ORG 's place of residence before the case was ready for a decision on the merits .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the court heard A , who was then DATE , for the first time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant 's request for the interim residence of A to be with him . The court again considered that without a thorough examination of the case it would not be possible to assess whether the best interests of the child required him to stay with his mother or with his father . Therefore the court decided to first hear experts and to obtain their opinion in order to establish the reasons for A 's hostility towards his mother . An appeal by the applicant against this decision was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the D\u0105browa Gornicza District Court ordered an opinion to be prepared by the RODK . The opinion was finally submitted to the court on DATE . According to the experts the best interests of A required that the residence order be changed to allow A to live with the applicant . The experts took into account the feelings and choices made by A and the family situation characterised by a prolonged conflict between his parents , with A caught in the middle of that conflict . Nevertheless the experts noticed that A had been influenced by the applicant , who had enlisted him in a coalition against his mother and expected absolute loyalty from him . Such behaviour worked against the applicant 's ability to be a good parent and violated the child 's right to express his feelings freely and to form views about the family and the world on the basis of his own experience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's request of DATE , granted him full parental responsibility and ordered A 's residence with him . It limited the parental responsibility of the applicant 's former wife in respect of A.", "The court considered that A 's negative attitude towards his mother , which manifested itself during the period when he was under her care in DATE , had been caused by the lengthy period of total deprivation of any contact between them and during which the applicant had isolated A from his mother . Moreover , for a prolonged period of time the applicant had the undisturbed opportunity to influence his child and create a very strong bond between them .", "Nevertheless , the court considered that the situation of the child had substantially changed since the divorce judgment of DATE . A had been living with the applicant , who has been securing his emotional and material needs . The court also took into account the wish of the child as to his preferred place of residence , given his age and level of maturity . Regard being had to the above , the court decided that the best interests of the child required the previous decisions to be modified and an order made for ORG 's place of residence to be with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's former wife appealed against the decision , but on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the D\u0105browa Tarnowska ORG modified the judgment of DATE and banned any contact between the applicant and his younger son PERSON The court found that the applicant had never wanted his second child , contested his paternity of him and had seen B only twice : once after B 's birth in DATE and once in connection with the preparation of a psychological opinion at the RODK . In consequence B , DATE , had not developed any emotional ties with the applicant , and in fact was afraid of him and perceived him as a threat to the stability of his family . The court concluded that the best interests of the child required all contact between him and the applicant to cease .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision , but on DATE the Dabrowa ORG rejected the appeal for failure to lodge it in accordance with formal requirements , namely by lodging it out of time . A further appeal against the latter decision was dismissed on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a final court decision as to parental responsibility and contact arrangements can be modified at any time if the interests of the child so require , either upon an application by either parent or by the court acting of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW request the court to issue an interim order in order to secure a claim concerning , for instance , contact arrangements .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law concerning the enforcement of a parent 's contact rights is set out in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no .
