NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before ORG Lo\u0144czyk - Colin , a lawyer practising in Ruda \u015al\u0105ska .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter , ORG , was born out of his informal relationship with GPE , a NORP national . The family lived together in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the couple split up and GPE and GPE moved to GPE with the applicant \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . Since then , the applicant has maintained his contact with his daughter through frequent phone calls , regular meetings in GPE and several meetings in GPE . During these visits , the child was always accompanied by her mother , who would not allow the child to make unaccompanied visits to GPE or to travel to GPE without her .", "CARDINAL . The child does not speak NORP . Her mother occasionally teaches her NORP and reads to her in this language . The applicant communicates with his child in basic NORP or through the child \u2019s mother . He pays child support and tuition for the child \u2019s private school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for contact with his daughter . He did not ask for an interim order to be issued to secure his contact rights during the proceedings . He wished to take his daughter to GPE DATE in DATE , for the All Saints\u2019 holiday , and for the DATE or GPE holidays in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a report from ORG ( Rodzinny O\u015brodek PERSON , \u201c the RODK \u201d ) to establish what kind of bond existed between the applicant and his child , the quality of the direct communication between the applicant and the child , and whether the child \u2019s travel to GPE without the mother and contact between the applicant and the child without the presence of the mother or an interpreter would be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE \u2012 following interviews with both parents and the child , which took place in the presence of a NORP interpreter \u2012 the RODK produced an expert report . It was found that the child had a strong bond with both parents and that both of them were considerate , emotionally balanced and loving . It was also concluded that the quality of the linguistic communication between the applicant and his daughter was good and sufficient for the applicant to understand the needs of his child and for their mutual communication and that it was in the child \u2019s best interests that contact arrangements be made . It was also recommended that before the applicant travelled with his daughter to GPE , they should have several unaccompanied meetings in GPE and that the child \u2019s mother should accompany the child on a trip abroad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application . The domestic court heard both parents and a witness . The domestic court also relied on the RODK report which was considered to be full and thorough , although it led the domestic court to draw partly different conclusions . In particular , it was held that the quality of the independent communication between the applicant and his child was not sufficient for carrying out long - term unaccompanied visits to GPE . Even though the lack of adequate linguistic exchange might not have significantly impeded the applicant \u2019s play - time with his child as tested by the RODK , the lack of a common language between a father and a fouryear - old constitutes a serious obstacle to their contact in the longer term . In particular , the child would not be able to inform the applicant about her feelings or possible health disorders , and she would therefore not feel secure in the new environment . In this respect , the domestic court considered the RODK report to be inconsistent because , on the one hand , the experts had found that the quality of the communication between the father and the daughter was sufficient whilst , on the other , they recommended a transitional period during which the child would be accompanied by her mother on trips to GPE and the father could meet her without any linguistic assistance in GPE . In view of these considerations and the child \u2019s young age , the domestic court held that ensuring her feeling of security \u2012 which would in turn guarantee her adequate development and the proper course of the meetings \u2012 was more important than her independent contact with her father . The domestic court had no doubt that the applicant had a right to unaccompanied contact with his daughter and that he had adequate parenting skills for such contact . But the language barrier between him and his child was an obstacle . The district court upheld the recommendation of the RODK experts that the child should be prepared for future independent contact by means of unaccompanied meetings in GPE and visits to GPE in her mother \u2019s company . Eliminating such a transitional period would deprive the child of the possibility of a gradual adaptation to such a new and important event as unaccompanied travel with her father to GPE . The domestic court decided not to rule on any contact arrangements during the transitional period because the applicant had not requested it in his application .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on the merits , including the grounds that a family court was duty - bound to rule on contact arrangements when the parties were in disagreement . The applicant also applied for an interim order for the duration of the appellate proceedings by virtue of which he would be authorised to have his daughter \u2019s passport and to spend DATE and DATE with the child without the mother \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued an interim order authorising the applicant to visit his daughter DATE in her home in GPE from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. without the presence of any third parties , and to take his daughter out for no longer than TIME ( with the mother having a right to one phone call during this time ) . A copy of this decision has not been submitted . It appears that the applicant did not lodge an interlocutory appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met his daughter in compliance with the above interim decision . He spoke with her mainly in NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later modified his application for contact , wishing to spend his time with the child in GPE , DATE \u2012 from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE \u2012 in the period up until DATE , and from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE , with the right to take her to his home . In the later phase , he wished to have extended contact rights as set out in his DATE application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the first - instance decision by authorising the applicant to visit his child DATE , on DATE between TIME , on DATE from TIME and on DATE from TIME , and DATE from TIME in the period from DATE . The meetings were to take place at the child \u2019s home without the presence of the mother or any third parties . The applicant was also authorised to take the child out for a maximum of TIME , with the mother being entitled to one phone call . Additionally in DATE , the applicant was authorised to take the child out for a maximum of TIME and , DATE , to take the child to his place of residence in GPE and to travel alone with the child within a radius of QUANTITY for a maximum of TIME , with the mother being entitled to CARDINAL phone calls .", "In the domestic court \u2019s view , such a schedule would deepen the bond between the father and the child and would help them improve their communication without the risk of the child feeling insecure . It was observed that the schedule was a temporary solution of indeterminate duration until the child reached a certain level of maturity and learned to speak NORP , which would be necessary in order for her to make unaccompanied visits to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant regularly travels to GPE to exercise his contact right in line with the above schedule .", "CARDINAL . He has recently submitted to the ORG , however , that since DATE GPE had been interfering with the course of his visits by remaining present in the room designated for the applicant \u2019s visits and not letting him take the child out . Out of CARDINAL recent visits , the applicant had been allowed to take his daughter out CARDINAL times , including twice after police intervention . The time out had often been shorter than TIME and GPE had telephoned her daughter more frequently than was authorised by the family court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for GPE \u2019s custody to be restricted on the grounds that she had been hindering his contact with the child .", "CARDINAL . In the course of these proceedings , GPE made the following submissions to the family court .", "The applicant is not being impeded from having contact with his daughter in line with the court \u2019s decision of DATE . In particular , a room with toys is at his disposal in GPE \u2019s house and his visits are undisturbed by the child \u2019s mother . The applicant is in principle allowed to take his child out for TIME , with the mother telephoning only once . Out of CARDINAL recent meetings between the applicant and his daughter , the child did not go out with the applicant on only ten occasions . On these occasions , either the child was ill or the weather was bad or the child did not want to go out . To substantiate this , GPE presented a medical certificate confirming that the child had bronchitis in DATE . She also submitted that on DATE she had called the police after the applicant had used physical force to carry his crying and struggling daughter outside . DATE the police had told the applicant to leave .", "GPE also informed the family court that the applicant provoked disputes and threatened her with child abduction . Moreover , the applicant filmed GPE during each visit , following her inside the house . The applicant \u2019s visits were becoming more and more unpleasant for the child because he never brought books or toys to play with and was unable to entertain the child due to the language barrier . He sometimes gets angry with his daughter and makes her cry . He has also used firm grips to stop her from leaving the room . On CARDINAL occasion he had left bruises on the girl \u2019s arms . If the child does not want to go out with the applicant , the latter calls the police . On CARDINAL occasion , he did so when the child was in bed with fever . The child associates his visits with violence and police intervention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interim decision ordering the visits to the child to be supervised by a court bailiff who was to report to the family court once DATE . The aim behind this decision was to verify ORG parenting attitude and to enable the applicant to exercise his contact right . It was emphasised that the decision had a temporary character and was susceptible to change in the event of new circumstances and if the best interests of the child so required ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
