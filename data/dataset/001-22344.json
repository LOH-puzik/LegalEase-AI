AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and living in PERSON ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant has lived in GPE since DATE and obtained NORP citizenship in DATE . On DATE he filed a request with ORG ( Pensionsversicherngsanstalt der Angestellten ) to pay contributions under LAW of ORG ( Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz - \u201c LAW \u201d ) for the time he had been at school and had studied in GPE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request . It found that the applicant had not shown that he had undergone a period of training as specified by Section CARDINAL ASVG .", "On DATE the Regional Governor of ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . He noted that periods of training in foreign countries were not mentioned in PERSON . Therefore it was not possible to pay contributions for these periods .", "On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG claiming that the above decision violated the principle of equality ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospect of success . It referred to its previous case - law on LAW \u00a7 PERSON , according to which territorial restraints ( territoriale ORG ) of the social security system were in accordance with LAW : Just as being employed in GPE was a legitimate requirement for participation in the social pensions scheme , the substitute requirement of having undergone training in GPE - and not abroad - was the same . Upon the applicant \u2019s request it transferred the case to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant supplemented his complaint to ORG . He argued that although the wording of Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) PERSON explicitly mentioned attending a school in GPE as a condition this criterion should rather be construed as to mean training for a diploma which is subsequently recognised by GPE authorities .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument and found that the wording of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) PERSON was clear and unambiguous and required that such training be attended in GPE . It was reasonable to enable backpayments into the pension scheme for periods of pre - professional training only in cases when , without such training , the person concerned would have been employed in GPE and would have contributed to the NORP social pension system .", "The NORP social pension scheme is based on the principle that pension rights are acquired by contributions during a person \u2019s employment ( Beitragszeiten ) . Section CARDINAL of ORG also provides for the possibility to pay pension contributions for certain periods during which a person was not gainfully employed . By paying such contributions a person acquires pension rights and \u2013 when he or she retires \u2013 receives a higher pension .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW defines these latter periods ( ORG ) . As to periods of training , the provision only includes periods during which a person has attended an NORP secondary school or university ( inl\u00e4ndische mittlere PERSON oder Hochschule ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
