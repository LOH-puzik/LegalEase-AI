On DATE the DATE newspaper ORG published a number of articles written by the applicants .", "On the cover page the newspaper published a title , covering CARDINAL of the page . It read \u201c The GPE prosecuting authorities confirm : the Minister took \u201d ( \u201c Warszawska prokuratura ustali\u0142a : Minister wzi\u0105\u0142 \u201d ) , and underneath there was a photograph of a ORG with information that the price of the most expensive version was over CARDINAL United States dollars ( ORG ) and then a paragraph stating that Minister PERSON , who was at that time the head of ORG , had accepted such a car as a gift from the businessman PERSON", "The paragraph read :", "Minister PERSON , the Head of ORG , received from businessman PERSON a luxury car . The case came to light because the ORG , worth over CARDINAL ORG , was [ subsequently ] stolen . The head of the LOC prosecutor \u2019s office , Z \u017b. , has confirmed that PERSON had been \u201c using \u201d that car . Minister [ M.]S. did not want to talk to us about the car from the businessman . \u201d", "On the same front page the editor published a note , accompanied by a photograph of GPE :", "\u201c Sir , as you have refused to give us an interview about the car which you received from PERSON , you are requested , in accordance with LAW , to answer the following questions : CARDINAL . Why did you accept a gift from PERSON in the form of a luxury car ? CARDINAL . For how long did you use it ? CARDINAL . Do you think it is correct for a ORG agent to accept for use a car owned by a businessman ? CARDINAL . Were you not afraid that accepting that gift amounted to contracting a debt towards him which you would be obliged to pay back in the future ? \u201d", "On the third page an article signed by both applicants was published , entitled \u201c S. used \u201d ( \u201c S. u\u017cywa\u0142 \u201d ) . Its leading paragraph read :", "\u201c The presidential minister and Head of ORG does not want , at least for the time being , to explain why he has accepted an expensive car from a NORP businessman with a NORP passport .", "The article went on :", "\u201c W.W. , a well - to - do businessman with a NORP passport , is the official owner of a car which was stolen from S. ... He has extensive contacts with politicians . He emphasises his close relationship with the President , PERSON . ...", "On DATE the Minister \u2019s driver was driving the car to have it washed . When he stopped at traffic lights at FAC in GPE , the car door was opened by a masked man who hit the driver in the face with a pistol he was holding and threw him out of the car onto the tarmac . Then he drove away , the tyres screeching .", "The GPE prosecuting office started an investigation .", "Witnesses have stated that PERSON had used the ORG \u2013 prosecutor PERSON has told us : \u2018 We discontinued the investigation in DATE as we could not identify the perpetrator.\u2019", "When ORG spoke with him , PERSON lied . He tried to explain that he could not remember events which had taken place DATE and told us that PERSON had never so much as sat in that car .", "\u2018 It was the driver who was my friend . And I did not know that he worked as [ ORG \u2019s PERSON , he said . \u2018 [ M.]S. himself never set foot in that car . ... \u2018 I do n\u2019t remember what the car \u2019s documents PERSON , he added , \u2018 I have no more time to talk\u2019 .", "PERSON told us , via his secretary , that he did not have anything to say about the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE brought a civil action in ORG requesting legal protection of his personal rights . He requested that the defendants be ordered to cease publishing allegations that the plaintiff had accepted an expensive car as a gift , that the newspaper publish an apology , and that damages of ORG CARDINAL be awarded to him , which he undertook to pay to a charity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the plaintiff \u2019s claim . It ordered the applicants and the editorinchief to publish an apology on the cover page of their newspaper for having published the untrue information that the plaintiff had accepted an expensive gift , which was to be worded as follows :", "\u201c The editors and authors of the articles entitled \u201c [ ORG Minister took \u201d and \u201c [ ORG remains silent \u201d apologise for publishing the untrue information that he had accepted an expensive car as a gift \u201d .", "It further determined the exact size of the apology . The court also ordered the applicants to pay , jointly with the newspaper \u2019s publisher and the editor in chief , MONEY ( ORG ) as compensation for the nonpecuniary damage he had suffered . The defendants were also ordered to pay , jointly , ORG CARDINAL in court fees .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the court questioned the applicants and the plaintiff . The court heard W.W. and PERSON , who had been driving the car on DATE of the theft , as witnesses . The court had regard to the case file of the investigation into the theft of the car which had been conducted by the GPE - FAC ; to an authorisation to use the car from DATE until DATE which W.W. had drawn up for the plaintiff ; and to a car insurance policy which he had had taken out in the plaintiff \u2019s name for that period .", "CARDINAL . The court found that PERSON and the plaintiff had planned to go to GPE together for DATE . As PERSON had had to fly to the GPE for business purposes shortly before the holiday , it had been agreed that the plaintiff would take his car and drive it to GPE where they would meet . PERSON had arranged for insurance for the plaintiff and prepared a document to the effect that he was authorised to use the car from DATE . The plaintiff had taken the car from PERSON at DATE . Subsequently , on DATE , when the plaintiff \u2019s driver had been driving the car to have it washed , he had been attacked at traffic lights and the car had been stolen from him . An investigation concerning the theft was subsequently instituted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court noted the steps which the applicants had taken when gathering the material for the article . The first applicant had become aware of the theft of the car in DATE . On DATE she had published a short article about it . Later on she had contacted the prosecuting authorities requesting information about the progress of the investigation . She had also contacted the President \u2019s Chancellery , where the plaintiff was working at that time , and requested to be given an interview concerning the theft . She was informed that the plaintiff would not give an interview on that subject .", "In DATE the second applicant had started working on the case . He had interviewed PERSON and PERSON The court noted that PERSON had given very evasive answers to the questions .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , the court was of the view that the available evidence indicated that the car had indeed been given to the plaintiff for use for a limited period of time . There was no indication that the car had been accepted as a gift . The relevant evidence given by the plaintiff , PERSON and PERSON was fully coherent .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court therefore accepted that there was nothing to suggest that the circumstances in which the plaintiff had come into the possession of the car indicated corruption . The court emphasised that he should not have avoided the journalists as it was his responsibility as a public official to ensure that his acts were transparent . It also noted that the newspaper had published the articles only after he had refused to provide information concerning the car .", "The court accepted the GPE assertion that they had been acting in the general interest and had wished to elucidate the circumstances surrounding the use of the car by the plaintiff . However , this motivation did not exempt them from the legal obligation to respect personal rights . They were obliged to act with diligence when gathering and publishing information .", "The court accepted that the defendants had complied with this obligation when gathering material and information concerning the use of the car . They had had recourse to all the relevant sources .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court could not endorse the GPE conduct , having regard , firstly , to the titles of the articles . The title on the cover page , taking up CARDINAL of it , insinuated that the plaintiff had taken a bribe and that the GPE prosecuting authorities had conducted an investigation in this regard . The suggestion , obvious to any reader , was not borne out by the facts and was not compatible with the information which the newspaper had received from the prosecuting authorities or from any other source . Secondly , the same suggestion was made in the questions published on the first page . Neither the title nor the questions corresponded to the actual content of the article concerning the car published on the third page . This allegation , which had not been based on any facts , had breached the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights .", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that the amount of damages sought by the plaintiff was clearly excessive . However , as his personal rights had been breached , it considered that an amount of PLN MONEY was appropriate in the circumstances as it was more than merely symbolic .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They submitted that the court had wrongly found that the contested articles had suggested that PERSON had accepted a bribe and that the prosecuting authorities had conducted an investigation into the matter . They further argued that the first - instance judgment had breached ORG DATE of the LAW and LAW . They averred that the court had failed to take into consideration the standards set in the ORG \u2019s case - law . They referred to the judgments given in the cases of GPE v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL . As to the scope of the protection afforded to the private lives of politicians , they invoked the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL .", "They were further of the view that the court had erred in finding that they had failed to act with diligence when formulating the title for the article . It had clearly been formulated in a manner compatible with journalistic freedom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It agreed with the first - instance court that the text published on the cover page , including its title , had clearly suggested that the plaintiff had been suspected of corruption , that the prosecuting authorities had conducted an investigation concerning charges of corruption , and that the charges had proved well - founded . The court \u2019s findings in this respect were correct : this was indeed an impression which any reasonable reader might form , while it was clearly not borne out by the facts as established by the applicants . Likewise , the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the text on the third page did not balance the impact of the text on the front page was correct .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court accepted the applicants\u2019 argument that they had been motivated by the protection of the general interest and by their obligation to inform the public of issues of such interest . It held that they had exercised their freedom of expression protected by LAW . Under this provision , politicians had to take into account that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider in respect of their acts . However , this freedom was not unlimited ; it went hand - in - hand with certain obligations and restrictions . It was for the purpose of the effective protection of such rights that journalists were obliged to act with particular diligence ; journalistic freedom could not be seen as conferring on journalists a right to act recklessly or arbitrarily . They had to check the veracity of the information which they intended to publish .", "CARDINAL . In the present case the information on the front page insinuated not only that the plaintiff had accepted the expensive car as a gift from W.W. , but also that the plaintiff had been suspected of taking bribes , and that the prosecuting authorities had conducted an investigation into the matter and found that suspicion well - founded . That was not true . The conclusions of the lower court concerning the possible assessment of the information published on the cover page and the text on the third page by the readers were well - founded and logical and had to be upheld .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , essentially reiterating their arguments and indicating that LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law should be used as the frame of reference for the legal assessment of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed their cassation appeal , essentially sharing the conclusions of the appellate court .", "In so far as the applicants complained that the appellate court had failed to address their arguments based on the ORG \u2019s case - law concerning LAW , ORG acknowledged that they were right to emphasise the importance of the right to the freedom of expression in a democratic society as interpreted by the ORG . Any restrictions imposed on the exercise of that right had to be closely scrutinised . It referred to the case - law of the ORG and reiterated that criticism in respect of politicians and their views and actions was acceptable in the context of a NORP society , even where it took the form of violent attacks , exaggeration or even provocation . However , these principles had always to be applied and fine - tuned in the context of concrete factual circumstances . In the present case , the ORG interest the public character of the plaintiff \u2019s function , was fully justified . Their diligence in gathering relevant information was not open to any criticism . It was only at the stage where they wrote and published the articles concerned that they had demonstrated negligence . Nothing in the material which they had gathered justified a conclusion that the plaintiff had received the car as a gift . This insinuation , placed on the first page of the newspaper , had clearly overstepped the limits of acceptable journalistic exaggeration .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that the newspaper \u2019s editor - in - chief could not be held responsible as at the time when the articles had been published she had not been carrying out this function , and it dismissed the claim in so far as it had been directed against her .", "CARDINAL .

The right to obtain information shall encompass the right of access to documents and entry to sittings of collective organs of public authority formed by universal suffrage , with the opportunity to make sound and visual recordings .", "CARDINAL .
