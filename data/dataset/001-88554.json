The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was stopped and searched by a police officer at the main bus station in GPE and a packet containing QUANTITY of cannabis was found on his person .", "CARDINAL . He was then taken to a police station but was released after a short period of time . Whilst in custody , an on - duty police officer issued a receipt confirming seizure of the cannabis in question ( potvrda o privremeno oduzetim predmetima ) . This receipt was signed by the applicant and the officer and contained the applicant \u2019s registered home address \u2013 FAC no . CARDINAL , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent incident report of DATE , however , the officer appears to have made a mistake by stating that the applicant \u2019s address was FAC no . CARDINAL rather than no . CARDINAL . This report was neither seen nor signed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Having found his number in a telephone directory , on DATE the police contacted the applicant \u2019s father by telephone . He in turn informed the applicant that the police were looking for him . The applicant subsequently called the police and was told that he needed to come to the station in order to pick up the court summons . Upon arrival at the station , he was arrested and placed in detention .", "CARDINAL . It subsequently became clear that a detention order had been issued by ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in GPE on DATE , as part of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant regarding the cannabis seizure of DATE . In its reasoning , the court first explained that the applicant had not appeared at the hearing scheduled for DATE and noted that the return receipt attached to its summons had stated that he \u201c was unknown at FAC no . CARDINAL \u201d . Secondly , the applicant had failed to appear at the following hearing scheduled for DATE and the police , who had been ordered to serve the summons , had reported on DATE that a neighbour had confirmed that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since DATE . Thirdly , on DATE the police had also run a search in their database and had made additional inquiries , confirming that , as of DATE , the applicant \u2019s registered residence was indeed FAC no . CARDINAL , but could not discover any information concerning his current whereabouts . Finally , the court concluded that there was a sufficient factual basis to indicate that the applicant was hiding and/or in flight and had therefore ordered his detention . ( It must , however , be noted that the neighbour \u2019s statement and the original police report of DATE were cited erroneously by ORG and that in fact both had referred to FAC no . CARDINAL only , as the applicant \u2019s registered residence , there being no mention of FAC no . CARDINAL . )", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had also adopted a separate decision requesting the police to issue a wanted notice ( poternica ) and arrest the applicant . Therein the applicant \u2019s address had again been stated as FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Various other documents successively referred to both addresses . Thus ORG letter sent to the police on DATE referred to FAC no . CARDINAL while all court summonses , the criminal complaint of DATE ( krivi\u010dna prijava ) and the indictment ( optu\u017eni predlog ) of DATE consistently stated the applicant \u2019s address as FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout this time the applicant \u2019s identity card , issued by the police on DATE , and his residence registration remained unchanged , stating his address as FAC no . CARDINAL , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an appeal by telegram against the ORG detention order of DATE . Therein he stated that the applicant had never lived at FAC no . CARDINAL and pointed out that his registered residence was in fact FAC no . CARDINAL . The applicant consequently had no knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him ; nor could he have deliberately avoided receiving the court summons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer supplemented this appeal with additional written arguments requesting that the impugned detention order be revoked and his client released . In particular , he noted that the applicant had gone to the police station \u201c of his own free will \u201d as soon as he had found out that they were looking for him . Upon arrival at the police station , he had been arrested and it was then that he had first found out about the criminal charges against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the appeal . It did so without an oral hearing . In its ruling ORG affirmed the reasons for detention given by ORG and further held that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant \u2019s correct address was indeed FAC no . CARDINAL . On the contrary , police reports suggested that \u201c the applicant \u2019s residence throughout the proceedings had remained unknown \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this decision was received by the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he filed a motion with ORG , seeking the applicant \u2019s release on bail or , alternatively , that his detention be replaced with a prohibition on leaving his place of residence until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings . The lawyer further noted that the applicant \u2019s detention had been ordered due to the court \u2019s error in the establishment of his true home address and concluded by requesting that a hearing in the case be scheduled urgently .", "CARDINAL . ORG appears not to have considered this motion .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of illicit possession of narcotics and fined him in the amount of MONEY ( at the time MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . In a separate decision of the same date the ORG released the applicant from detention . It held , inter alia , that \u201c the current phase of the criminal proceedings had been completed \u201d and that \u201c the defendant had provided correct information about his present address \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG and GPE ( Sud Srbije i PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the communication of the present application to the respondent ORG , the Government produced CARDINAL signed witness statements , taken by the police on DATE , wherein the applicant \u2019s neighbours , both residing at FAC no . CARDINAL , confirmed that the applicant had indeed not been living there for DATE . CARDINAL of them further specified that he had already told the police as much in DATE , while the other recalled that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since DATE .", "CARDINAL .
