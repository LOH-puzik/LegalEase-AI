FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 6-3-b;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In the course of a judicial investigation concerning the applicant , his wife , his former brother - in - law and CARDINAL of his nephews , the applicant was remanded in custody on DATE and charged with rape of a child under CARDINAL ( his niece ) , sexual assaults on children DATE ( his nephews ) and a number of further counts of sexual assault .", "On DATE the investigating judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance ordered medico - psychological examinations of the applicant \u2019s niece and all the persons under investigation . He appointed CARDINAL doctors , named PERSON and PERSON , for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL doctors were informed of the applicant \u2019s criminal record . In addition to a number of prison sentences , this included an investigation opened in DATE into charges against the applicant of sexual interference with the daughter of his brother - in - law \u2019s sister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts filed their report on the applicant . They stated , among other things , that although the applicant , by his own admission , did have fantasist and even mythomaniac tendencies , these were not obviously pathological in nature , as had been shown DATE previously by his statements regarding the relations between PERSON and GPE , CARDINAL of the victims .", "CARDINAL . The doctors concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Our examination of PERSON has revealed psychopathic traits and signs of sexual perversion for which objective evidence is provided by his statements regarding PERSON and GPE", "CARDINAL . The offence of which he stands accused with respect to GPE and PERSON is linked to a state of sexual perversion . It is difficult to assess the extent or the nature of this state in so far as the accused presents the facts as isolated incidents . He denies raping PERSON and so it is not possible to address that issue from a clinical viewpoint .", "CARDINAL . The subject is not in a dangerous state in the psychiatric sense .", "CARDINAL . It would not be inappropriate to impose a criminal penalty on him .", "CARDINAL . Rehabilitation will not pose a problem , but a cure will depend on clearer identification of the subject \u2019s underlying sexual problem .", "CARDINAL . The subject was not insane within the meaning of ( former ) LAW when committing the offences of which he stands accused .", "CARDINAL . His state is not such as to require confinement or psychotherapeutic assistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the experts\u2019 conclusions were served on the applicant . The applicant \u2019s detention pending trial was extended several times during the investigation of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his co - defendants ( ORG , GPE and GPE , the applicant \u2019s wife ) were committed for trial at ORG by a judgment delivered by ORG of ORG . ORG pointed out , in particular , that the applicant had initially denied any sexual abuse of his niece and nephews and then admitted to the conduct of which he was accused only to retract that admission . It related what had been said during the examination of the applicant \u2019s niece on the one hand and his nephews on the other , the latter having also been accused of rape and sexual abuse by the niece . ORG also mentioned the previous convictions on the applicant \u2019s criminal record , namely driving under the influence of alcohol , insulting a member of the police force in the performance of his duties , a hit - and - run offence and a further conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against the decision to commit him for trial , drawing attention to the vagueness of the terms used in the operative provisions of that decision . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected that appeal .", "CARDINAL . The trial at ORG began on DATE . The registrar read out the decision of ORG committing the applicant for trial . At that point the advocate - general stated that he wished to file certain documents regarding the personality of the defendants , including the applicant , and relating primarily to offences reported in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The documents in question were records of evidence taken from witnesses , a procedural report by a police superintendent , a psychiatric report on the applicant at DATE and a judgment relating to educational assistance . They comprised mainly a description of the applicant \u2019s sexual conduct when he was a minor and information about his family background . They related firstly to a charge of indecent assault on a girl under CARDINAL brought against him in DATE in proceedings during which the applicant had said that he had done the same thing \u201c CARDINAL times both with little girls and with little boys aged DATE CARDINAL \u201d and , secondly , to several counts of indecent assault without violence on CARDINAL children DATE . The proceedings concerning these offences , brought in DATE , and those mentioned above were discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer objected to the filing of those documents and requested an adjournment to prepare a pleading to that effect . The hearing was adjourned for TIME . The applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged an application for all the documents to be rejected on the ground that they related to offences that were subject to limitation and had occurred prior to various amnesty laws which could apply to them . According to the defence , the documents were so old that they contravened the principle that a defendant \u2019s antecedents were inadmissible in evidence against him .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment delivered on DATE ORG rejected that application on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... The prosecution , like every other party to a criminal trial , is entitled to produce at the hearing any documents that appear to be helpful in establishing the truth provided that they relate to the offences of which the defendants stand accused and shed light on their personality .", "Provided that they are communicated to all the parties and can thus be examined adversarially , the production of such documents can not have any adverse effect on the rights of the defence . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Copies of the documents filed by the prosecution were distributed to each of the civil parties\u2019 lawyers and the defence lawyers but the case was not adjourned .", "CARDINAL . When the examination of the defendants began as to their backgrounds , the applicant \u2019s hearing was deliberately put back until TIME . Exercising his discretionary powers , the President of ORG called a teacher of children with special needs as a witness to be heard for information purposes only . Following that hearing , the respective lawyers of GPE , who stood accused along with the applicant , and of PERSON declared that they were bringing civil - party proceedings on their GPE behalf and made a written application .", "The trial was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . At DATE afternoon the lawyer representing the applicant \u2019s wife in turn applied for the investigation to be reopened to take account of the documents relating to her that had been filed by the prosecution . Those documents included a judgment delivered by the GPE tribunal de grande instance in DATE , records of the hearing by that court \u2019s registrar and written statements by GPE The applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s lawyer requested that in the course of the reopened investigation the statements on the proceedings made by PERSON and PERSON in the documents filed by the prosecution be added to the file . Failing that , the trial would have to be adjourned to a subsequent session . In support of his requests , the lawyer relied on the requirement of a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment ORG deferred its decision on the above application pending completion of the hearing of evidence . The President continued his examination of the defendants until TIME with CARDINAL short adjournment of TIME . At TIME the examination of the defendants resumed and thereafter a witness was heard .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , on TIME of the trial , that is on DATE , the ORG heard one of the experts who had been appointed to prepare an opinion during the pre - trial investigation . He made an oral presentation of the report he had submitted on DATE during the investigation proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President then adjourned the proceedings for TIME during which the expert studied the new documents produced by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . As soon as the hearing of the expert resumed , the latter allegedly changed his opinion , stating , among other things , that the applicant was a \u201c paedophile \u201d and that \u201c psychotherapy [ was ] necessary , but would be ineffective for the time being \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The examination of the expert lasted TIME , at the end of which the President authorised him to withdraw permanently , a decision on which he had consulted the parties and to which none of them had raised any objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer disputed the expert \u2019s oral submissions and applied for a second opinion , on the following grounds :", "\u201c After ... CARDINAL of the CARDINAL experts appointed by the investigating judge had made his statement before ORG , he was informed of the CARDINAL discontinued sets of proceedings that had been brought against PERSON , who is now DATE , when he was DATE . The depositions made by PERSON at that time were read out to the expert . Immediately after being informed of those facts , of which he had been unaware when preparing his expert opinion , the expert radically altered his submissions , stating that :", "\u2013 in his view PERSON is unquestionably a paedophile ;", "\u2013 psychotherapeutic treatment is necessary , but , given PERSON \u2019s current state of mind , would be totally ineffective because he has no feelings of guilt ;", "\u2013 the length of a prison sentence has no effect on an individual of that type as the potential to be cured depends solely on a feeling of guilt , which PERSON lacks ;", "\u2013 in the absence of a feeling of guilt , there is a major risk that ORG will reoffend even after a long sentence , meaning that imprisonment can only serve as a means of protecting society . ...", "PERSON formally disputes the expert \u2019s oral submissions . A second opinion is indispensable . If it had considered it necessary , it was during the investigation that the prosecution should have filed the documents it produced at the beginning of the trial relating to proceedings brought over DATE . In that case the expert would have drawn up his report in the light of the evidence contained therein and PERSON would undoubtedly have requested a second opinion , prepared by CARDINAL experts .", "ORG therefore heard an oral report that differed radically from the written report by the CARDINAL experts .", "Respect for the rights of the defence requires that a new expert opinion be ordered in the context of an application for the investigation to be reopened . Everyone has the right to a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The lawyer also applied for the applicant \u2019s release on the ground that his client should not have to suffer the consequences of the prosecution \u2019s having taken DATE and DATE to file documents that it considered indispensable .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG deferred its decision on the application for further investigative measures pending completion of the hearing of evidence and rejected the application for release on the ground that detention was \u201c necessary to ensure that the defendant remain[ed ] at the disposal of the judicial authorities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The President continued to examine the defendants and obtained their statements . After that he took evidence from the applicant \u2019s mother , from a person sentenced for a serious crime and from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer then reiterated his previous submissions while his wife \u2019s lawyer withdrew the interlocutory application he had lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took formal note of the withdrawal by GPE \u2019s lawyer . On DATE , after a procedural defect vitiating the interlocutory application made by the applicant \u2019s lawyer had in the meantime been cured , ORG nevertheless refused it . It made the following points regarding the complaint of an infringement of the rights of the defence :", "\u201c Firstly , the new documents produced by the prosecution and duly communicated to each of the parties to the proceedings could have been contested , particularly by PERSON , whether directly or through the intermediary of his counsel .", "Secondly , once the above documents had been brought to the notice of the expert ... and he had completed the presentation of his report , PERSON and his counsel were in a position to request any further information or explanations from him that they required .", "Thus it can not legitimately be argued that the production of new documents and their consideration by the psychiatric expert were capable of infringing the rights of the defence .", "At all events , in view of the outcome of the oral examination at the hearing , it does not seem essential for the establishment of the truth to seek a second psychiatric opinion .", "Consequently , there is no cause for the proceedings to be adjourned ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s application for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment for a number of counts of raping his niece , a child under CARDINAL , sexually assaulting a girl under QUANTITY and sexually assaulting his nephews . The sentences imposed on the CARDINAL other co - defendants were less severe ( CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , a fully suspended DATE prison sentence with probation , and a DATE prison sentence , DATE of which was suspended with probation ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . In his first ground of appeal he argued that ORG consenting to file the documents produced by the prosecution amounted to a violation of his right to a fair trial , particularly the principle of equality of arms , since his lawyer had only had CARDINAL a day to study the documents in issue whereas the prosecution had had them for some time . Relying also on LAW , the applicant submitted another plea regarding ORG refusal to order a second opinion . He argued that the examination by the expert of the new documents that had been produced at the hearing , which had made him radically change his initial submissions , required an effective second opinion for the sentence imposed to satisfy the legal requirement that it must be suited to the personality of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal in its entirety . Regarding the grounds of appeal based on an infringement of the right to a fair trial , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c When , after the decision committing the defendant for trial had been read out , the advocate - general produced various documents including the records of a number of discontinued proceedings relating to the defendant , the defence objected and requested that those documents should not be filed .", "As justification for its rejection of that request , ORG stated that the prosecution , like every other party to criminal proceedings , is entitled to produce at the trial any documents that appear to afford assistance in establishing the truth in so far as they relate to the offences of which the defendants stand accused and shed light on their personality . If they have been communicated to all the parties so that there has been an opportunity for adversarial argument about them , the production of such documents can not legitimately be said to have any adverse effect on the rights of the defence .", "In ruling to that effect , ORG provided a legal basis for its decision without laying itself open to the objection raised in the ground of appeal because , the adversarial principle having been respected , no statutory or treaty provision prevented documents relating to offences subject to limitation but not covered by an amnesty being filed in that way . ...", "As justification for its refusal to order the second expert opinion sought by the defence , the ORG , having deferred its decision on the examination of that application , held , after taking evidence , that the requested measure was not indispensable for the establishment of the truth .", "In ruling to that effect , ORG , which was not obliged to respond to mere arguments in submissions , determined a matter over which it alone had jurisdiction , deciding that there was no reason to allow the application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW on hearings before assize courts provide as follows :", "\u201c If the investigation appears to him to be incomplete or if new evidence has emerged since its closure , the president may order any further inquiries he deems necessary . ... \u201d", "\u201c The president may , of his own motion or on an application by the public prosecutor , order cases which do not seem to him to be ready to be tried during the session in which they have been listed for hearing to be adjourned to a subsequent session . \u201d", "\u201c The president shall be responsible for the proper management of the trial and shall direct the proceedings .", "He shall reject anything that is calculated to undermine their dignity or prolong them without creating the hope of more certain results . \u201d", "\u201c The president is vested with a discretionary power under which he may , on his honour and according to his conscience , take any steps that he believes may assist in establishing the truth .
