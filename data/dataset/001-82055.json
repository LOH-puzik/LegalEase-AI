GEORGIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant worked as an officer at a regional branch of ORG ( hereafter \u201c the old customs office \u201d of \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , an agency of ORG . Due to the structural reorganisation of ORG on DATE , he was released by an administrative order of CARDINAL DATE , together with some other people . This order noted that the discharged officers were to be transferred to another , newly established regional customs office ( \u201c the new customs office \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG 's authorisation to take up his duties at the new customs office . No reply was forthcoming . For DATE , he complained on numerous occasions before various governmental agencies about the inability to continue his service .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that , after its reorganisation on DATE , staff had been significantly reduced and , in so far as he had continuously been absent from the old customs office without authorisation , the administration had decided not to employ him any longer . The lawfulness of such a decision , the letter noted , was assured by the provisions of LAW ( \u201c the LC \u201d ) , the sole legislative act which regulated civil servants ' labour disputes at that time . The applicant was invited to visit the GPE 's human resources office , in order to obtain the order for his dismissal and the work log .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sued the ORG for unfair dismissal , requesting reinstatement to his position and compensation for loss of salary .", "CARDINAL . In a first instance judgment of DATE , LOC in GPE found in the applicant 's favour . However , in an appellate decision of DATE , ORG rejected his action as time - barred . The appellate court first noted that , in so far as LAW of DATE had not been enacted at the time of the applicant 's dismissal , only the provisions of the ORG had been applicable to the dispute . Given the fact that the applicant had continuously been complaining before various authorities , except for the courts , about his inability to pursue his duties as a customs officer , the appellate court found that he had been well aware of the alleged breach of his rights since his dismissal took effect in DATE . In such circumstances , it concluded that the applicant had failed to comply with the DATE time - limit for lodging an employment action , as required by LAW of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant lodged a cassation claim , in which he called into question the appellate court 's assessment of the and certain evidence . It appears from the case file that the respondent ORG did not submit any reply to that claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Chamber \u201d ) at an oral hearing attended by the applicant , started the examination of the case but , due to the absence of the ORG 's representative , adjourned it . The ORG also decided to dispense with an oral hearing in the further proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , complaining about the absence of an oral hearing , requested the President of ORG to change the ORG 's composition . In a decision of DATE , the ORG dismissed this request as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , adopted under the written procedure , the ORG dismissed the applicant 's cassation claim . Having confirmed the appellate court 's interpretation of the ORG , it stated that it lacked jurisdiction to inquire into matters of fact , in so far as the applicant had not raised any \u201c additional and well - founded cassation argument \u201d ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , only the lawfulness of an appellate judgment could be challenged in a cassation claim . The disputed judgment could be found to be unlawful if the appellate court had wrongly applied or interpreted legislative provisions .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( f ) required the appellant to mention in his or her cassation claim those facts which supported the alleged breaches of procedural law if the cassation claim was calling into question not only substantive but also procedural legal provisions .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c The cassation court shall review the [ disputed ] judgment only in so far as challenged in the cassation claim . The cassation court can not go beyond the facts referred to under LAW ( f ) and inquire of its own motion into other procedural breaches . \u201d", "\u201c The cassation court shall take into account the party 's submissions only in so far as disclosed by the case file or the appellate judgment ; only the facts submitted under LAW ( f ) can be taken into account .", "The establishment of the facts [ by the appellate court ] is binding on the [ cassation ] court , unless an additional and well - founded cassation argument has been raised . \u201d", "\u201c In the event the cassation court finds it appropriate ... , it can decide the case without an oral hearing . The parties shall be notified of such a decision . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The cassation court shall take a [ final ] decision itselfby the appellate court without procedural breaches and there is no need for additional fact finding . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL", "\u201d If it is not possible for the cassation court to decide the case in accordance with LAW , it shall quash the appellate judgment and remit the case for a retrial .", "If the cassation court quashes the disputed judgment because of the legal assessment , it shallhas to be collected further and what other procedural acts are to be conducted . \u201d", "ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint challenging LAW of the ORG , which provided for the possibility to dispense with an oral hearing in cassation proceedings .", "ORG noted that , unlike an appellate court which established facts , the cassation court could only review the application of legal provisions . It could however examine , on the basis of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( f ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , the facts which have been explicitly raised by the appellant in relation to the alleged violations of procedural law .", "Consequently , whilst the scope of the review was mostly limited to the assessment of the application of procedural and substantive law , ORG concluded that the right to an oral hearing in cassation proceedings was not absolute .", "In its judgment of DATE in the case of \u201c NORP \u201d v. \u201c NORP \u201d ORG , ORG defined the notion of an \u201c additional and well - founded cassation argument \u201d ( LAW ORG ) , as follows :", "\u201c ... ' An additional and well - founded cassation argument ' is ... a reference to those procedural breaches which , having been committed by the appellate court during the examination of the case , have resulted in an erroneous assessment of the matters of fact and/or the incorrect interpretation and application of substantive legal provisions . \u201d", "The ORG regulated all types of private labour relations between employers , employees and labour unions . Pursuant to LAW , pending the adoption of LAW , the ORG was fully applicable to the civil service .", "Pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , the dismissed employee had the right to apply to a court with a reinstatement claim . Under LAW of the ORG , the limitation period for lodging such a claim was DATE and it started to run from the moment the employee concerned received the relevant order of dismissal .", "LAW was enacted on DATE and became the lex specialis with regard to civil servants ' relations with the ORG , including labour disputes .
