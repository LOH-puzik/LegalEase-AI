Each applicant failed to pay sums due in respect of either local taxes ( community charge or council tax ) , or court - imposed fines . In respect of the failure to pay local taxes , the GPE court had in each case determined that the applicant was liable to pay ( issuing a \u201c liability order \u201d ) ; in fines cases , the GPE court had imposed the fine as the sentence following a criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . Each applicant fell into arrears with the payments due from them . These cases involve the enforcement proceedings in respect of their arrears in the GPE court .

At that hearing the magistrates found that the non - payment was due to the applicant \u2019s wilful refusal or culpable neglect . As a result each applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment , suspended on terms that the applicant make periodic payments towards the outstanding sum . The applicants failed to comply with the terms imposed . A further hearing was thereafter held in the GPE court at which the suspended term of imprisonment was activated .
