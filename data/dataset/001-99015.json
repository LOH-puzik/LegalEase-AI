The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . J. was the youngest son of a banking family in GPE am Main . He got to know the applicant , a law student , as an acquaintance of his sister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lured PERSON , aged DATE , into his flat in GPE am GPE by pretending that the child \u2019s sister had left a jacket there . He then killed the boy by suffocating him .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant deposited a ransom note at ORG GPE place of residence stating that J. had been kidnapped and demanding MONEY . The note further stated that if the kidnappers received the ransom and managed to leave the country , then the child \u2019s parents would see their son again . The applicant then drove to a pond located on a private property near GPE , TIME drive from GPE , and hid J. \u2019s corpse under a jetty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant picked up the ransom at a tram station . From then on he was under police surveillance . He paid part of the ransom money into his bank accounts and hid the remainder of the money in his flat . TIME , he was arrested at GPE am GPE airport with the police pinning him face down on the ground .", "CARDINAL . After having been examined by a doctor at the airport \u2019s hospital on account of shock and skin lesions , the applicant was taken to the GPE am GPE police headquarters . He was informed by detective officer PERSON that he was suspected of having kidnapped PERSON and was instructed about his rights as a defendant , notably the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer . He was then questioned by PERSON with a view to finding ORG , the police , having searched the applicant \u2019s flat , found CARDINAL of the ransom money and a note concerning the planning of the crime . The applicant intimated that the child was being held by another kidnapper . At TIME he was allowed to consult a lawyer , PERSON , for TIME at his request . He subsequently indicated that GPE and GPE had kidnapped the boy and had hidden him in a hut by a lake .", "CARDINAL . Early in the morning of DATE , before PERSON came to work , PERSON PERSON ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) , deputy chief of the GPE police , ordered another officer , PERSON ( \u201c E. \u201d ) , to threaten the applicant with considerable physical pain , and , if necessary , to subject him to such pain in order to make him reveal the boy \u2019s whereabouts . ORG \u2019s subordinate heads of department had previously and repeatedly opposed such a measure ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Detective officer PERSON thereupon threatened the applicant with subjection to considerable pain at the hands of a person specially trained for such purposes if he did not disclose the child \u2019s whereabouts . According to the applicant , the officer further threatened to lock him in a cell with CARDINAL huge black men who would sexually abuse him . The officer also hit him several times on the chest with his hand and shook him so that , on CARDINAL occasion , his head hit the wall . The Government disputed that the applicant had been threatened with sexual abuse or had been physically assaulted during the questioning .", "CARDINAL . NORP For fear of being exposed to the measures he was threatened with , the applicant disclosed the whereabouts of J. \u2019s body after TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was then driven with LOC and numerous other police officers to PERSON . He had refused to go with detective officer PERSON The police waited for a video camera to be brought to the scene . Then , the applicant , on the communicated order of the police officer in command and while being filmed , pointed out the precise location of the body . The police found PERSON \u2019s corpse under the jetty at the pond near PERSON as indicated by the applicant . The applicant claimed that he had been obliged to walk without shoes through woods to where he had left the corpse and , on the orders of the police , he had had to point out its precise location . The Government disputed that the applicant had had to walk without shoes .", "CARDINAL . Upon forensic examination of the scene , the police discovered tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car near the pond near PERSON . Under questioning by detective officer PERSON on the return journey from PERSON the applicant confessed to having kidnapped and killed PERSON He was then taken by the police to various other locations indicated by him where they secured ORG school exercise books , a backpack , J. \u2019s clothes and a typewriter used for the blackmail letter in containers . An autopsy carried out on ORG \u2019s corpse on DATE confirmed that J. had died of suffocation .", "CARDINAL . Having returned to the police station , the applicant was then permitted to consult his lawyer , En . , who had been instructed to act on his behalf by his mother and who had tried , in vain , to contact and advise the applicant TIME .", "CARDINAL . In a note for the police file dated DATE , the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , stated that he believed that that morning J. \u2019s life had been in great danger , if he was still alive at all , given his lack of food and the temperature outside . In order to save the child \u2019s life , he had therefore ordered the applicant to be threatened by detective officer PERSON with considerable pain which would not leave any trace of injury . He confirmed that the treatment itself was to be carried out under medical supervision . NORP further admitted that he had ordered another police officer to obtain a \u201c truth serum \u201d to be administered to the applicant . According to the note , the threat to the applicant was exclusively aimed at saving the child \u2019s life rather than furthering the criminal proceedings concerning the kidnapping . As the applicant had disclosed the whereabouts of J. \u2019s body , having been threatened with pain , no measures had in fact been carried out .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate issued by a police doctor on DATE confirmed that the applicant had a haematoma ( QUANTITY ) below his left collarbone , skin lesions and blood scabs on his left arm and his knees and swellings on his feet .

According to the certificate , these discreet traces of injuries indicated that the injuries had been caused DATE before the examination . The precise cause of the injuries could not be diagnosed .", "CARDINAL . During subsequent questioning by the police on DATE , by a public prosecutor on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , and by a district court judge on DATE the applicant confirmed the confession he had made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE am Main public prosecutor \u2019s office opened criminal investigation proceedings against the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , and detective officer PERSON on the basis of the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been threatened on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE of the hearing , the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a preliminary application for the proceedings to be discontinued . The basis of his claim was that during interrogation and prior to confessing he had been threatened by detective officer PERSON with being subjected to severe pain and sexual abuse . He argued that this treatment had been in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW and warranted the discontinuation of the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also lodged an alternative preliminary application seeking a declaration that , owing to the continuous effect ( GPE ) of the threat of violence against him on DATE , all statements which he had made to the investigation authorities should not be relied upon in the criminal proceedings . Moreover , the applicant sought a declaration that on account of the violation of LAW , the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the confession extracted \u2013 the so - called \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d \u2013 was prohibited ( Fernwirkung ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the first preliminary application , the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings . The court noted that in the applicant \u2019s submission , detective officer PERSON had threatened that a specialist was on his way to the police station by helicopter who , without leaving any traces , would inflict on him intolerable pain the likes of which he had never before experienced , if he continued to refuse to disclose ORG whereabouts . To underpin the threat , PERSON had imitated the sound of the rotating blades of a helicopter . PERSON had further threatened that the applicant would be locked up in a cell with CARDINAL big \u201c Negroes \u201d who would anally assault him . He would wish that he had never been born . The court found as a fact that the applicant had been threatened with the infliction of considerable pain if he refused to disclose the victim \u2019s whereabouts . However , the court did not find it established that the applicant had also been threatened with sexual abuse or had been otherwise influenced . The threat to inflict pain upon the applicant had been illegal pursuant to LAW , and also pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , notwithstanding this breach of the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights , the court found that the criminal proceedings were not , in consequence , barred and could proceed . It found that the use of the investigation methods in question , though prohibited in law , had not so restricted the rights of the defence that the criminal proceedings could not be pursued . In view of the seriousness of the charges against the applicant on the one hand , and the severity of the unlawful conduct during investigation on the other , there had not been such an exceptional and intolerable violation of the rule of law as to bar the continuation of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s second preliminary application , the GPE am ORG found that , in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , all confessions and statements hitherto made by the applicant before the police , a public prosecutor and a district court judge were inadmissible as evidence in the criminal proceedings because they had been obtained through the use of prohibited methods of interrogation .", "CARDINAL . The court found that on DATE detective officer PERSON had used prohibited methods of interrogation within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW by threatening the applicant with intolerable pain if he did not disclose the child \u2019s whereabouts . Therefore , any statements which the applicant had made as a consequence of this forbidden investigative measure were inadmissible as evidence . This exclusion of evidence ( Beweisverwertungsverbot ) did not only comprise the statements made immediately after the unlawful threat . It covered all further statements which the applicant had made to the investigation authorities since that date in view of the continuous effect of the violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The procedural irregularity caused by the use of a prohibited method of investigation could only have been remedied if the applicant had been informed before his subsequent questioning that his earlier statements made as a consequence of the threat of pain could not be used as evidence against him . However , the applicant had only been instructed about his right not to testify , without having been informed about the inadmissibility of the evidence that had been improperly obtained . He had therefore not been given the necessary \u201c qualified instruction \u201d ( qualifizierte GPE ) before making further statements .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court limited the inadmissible evidence to the above - mentioned statements . It went on to dismiss the applicant \u2019s application for a declaration that , on account of the prohibited investigation methods , the use in the criminal proceedings of all items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities as a consequence of the statements extracted from the applicant ought to be excluded from trial ( Fernwirkung ) . The court found as follows :", "\u201c ... there is no long - range effect of the breach of LAW meaning that the items of evidence which have become known as a result of the statement may likewise not be used [ as evidence ] . The ORG agrees in this respect with the conciliatory view ( GPE \u2019s fundamental rights \u2013 in the present case the threat of physical violence \u2013 and the seriousness of the offence he was charged with and which had to be investigated \u2013 the completed murder of a child \u2013 makes the exclusion of evidence which has become known as a result of the defendant \u2019s statement \u2013 in particular the discovery of the dead child and the results of the autopsy \u2013 appear disproportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the above ruling on the applicant \u2019s preliminary applications lodged on DATE of the trial , the proceedings continued . DATE , in his statement on the charges , the applicant admitted having killed J. , but stated that he had not initially intended to do so . His defence counsel submitted that by confessing , the applicant wanted to take responsibility for his offence notwithstanding the interrogation methods used on DATE . As the trial proceeded , all further items of evidence found as a consequence of the applicant \u2019s original statement and which the applicant sought to have excluded were adduced . At the close of the trial on DATE the applicant admitted that he had also intended from the outset to kill the child . He described his second confession as \u201c the only way to accept his deep guilt \u201d and as the \u201c greatest possible apology for the murder of the child \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant , inter alia , of murder and kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim . It sentenced him to life imprisonment and declared that his guilt was of particular gravity , warranting a maximum sentence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found that at the hearing the applicant had been instructed anew about his right to remain silent and about the fact that none of his earlier statements could be used as evidence against him and had thereby been given the necessary qualified instruction . However , the applicant had , following the qualified instruction , confessed that he had kidnapped and killed J. His statements at the trial concerning the planning of his offence formed the essential , if not the only , basis for the court \u2019s findings of fact . They were corroborated by the testimony of ORG sister , the blackmail letter and the note concerning the planning of the crime found in the applicant \u2019s flat . The findings of fact concerning the execution of the crime were exclusively based on the applicant \u2019s confession at the trial . Further items of evidence showed that he had told the truth also in this respect . These included the findings of the autopsy as to the cause of the child \u2019s death , the tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car near the pond where the child \u2019s corpse had been found , and the discovery of money from the ransom which had been found in his flat or paid into his accounts .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the gravity of the applicant \u2019s guilt , the court observed that he had killed his DATE victim and demanded MONEY in ransom in order to preserve his self - created image of a rich and successful young lawyer . It did not share the views expressed by the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the private accessory prosecutors that the applicant \u2019s confession \u201c was worth nothing \u201d as the applicant had only confessed to what had in any event already been proven . The fact that the applicant had volunteered a full confession at the trial , even though all his earlier confessions could not be used as evidence pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , was a mitigating factor . However , even without his confession , the applicant would have been found guilty of kidnapping with extortion causing the death of the victim . The applicant had been kept under police surveillance after he had collected the ransom , which had later been found in his flat or paid into his accounts . Furthermore , it had been proved by the autopsy on ORG \u2019s corpse that the boy had been suffocated , and tyre tracks left by the applicant \u2019s car had been detected at the place where ORG body had been found .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that in questioning the applicant , methods of interrogation prohibited under LAW had been employed . Whether and to what extent detective officer PERSON and the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , were guilty of an offence because of these threats had to be determined in the criminal investigations then pending against them . However , their allegedly illegal acts did not mitigate the applicant \u2019s own guilt . The misconduct of police officers , belonging to the executive power , could not prevent the judiciary from assessing findings of fact in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE following his conviction , the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . He complained that ORG , in its decision of DATE , had refused his preliminary application to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him . It had further refused to declare that the use in the criminal proceedings of all other items of evidence , such as the child \u2019s corpse , which had become known to the investigation authorities because of the statements unlawfully extracted was prohibited . The applicant included a full copy of these applications of DATE , including the grounds given for them . He further included a copy of ORG decision of DATE dismissing his application for the proceedings to be discontinued and argued in respect of the police \u2019s threats of torture against him that , developing the case - law of ORG , such conduct \u201c leapt beyond \u201d the exclusion of evidence and led to an impediment to the proceedings ( dass ein derartiges Verhalten das PERSON \u201c \u00fcberspringt \u201d und ein NORP begr\u00fcndet ) .", "CARDINAL . In his observations dated DATE ORG objected that the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law was manifestly ill - founded . He argued that the use of prohibited methods of interrogation did not lead to an impediment to the criminal proceedings . LAW expressly provided that the use of any of the prohibited methods enumerated entailed only the exclusion of evidence . The applicant had not complained of a breach of LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . In any event , there would be no grounds for such a complaint as ORG had only used the applicant \u2019s confession at the trial , which he had made after having been informed that his previous statements had not been admitted as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . PERSON the facts underlying the case and the content of the impugned decisions , he complained under LAW and LAW , second sentence , of LAW about the way in which he had been questioned by the police on TIME . He argued that he had been threatened with being subjected to torture and sexual abuse if he did not disclose the child\u2019 CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . It also violated his absolute right to human dignity under LAW , which lay at the heart of the provisions in question . These unjustifiable human rights violations ought to have been a bar to the criminal proceedings for murder and a prohibition on using the evidence obtained as a consequence of the confession extracted from him by means of prohibited measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , held that the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , in so far as the applicant complained of the failure of the criminal courts to discontinue the proceedings against him , the court found that he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint . It observed that ORG had already stated that the police \u2019s threat to inflict pain on the applicant had violated LAW and that the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and LAW , second sentence , of LAW had been disregarded .", "CARDINAL . However , the violation of fundamental rights outside the trial did not necessarily warrant the conclusion that the judgment delivered by a criminal court , which was based on the findings made during the trial , breached constitutional law . In the present case , the criminal courts had found that the methods of investigation used by the police had been prohibited , but had differed from the applicant as to the legal consequences that flowed from that finding . They had taken the view that the statements obtained as a result of the measures in question could not be used but that there was no bar to the specific criminal proceedings being pursued .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the procedural flaw of having used prohibited investigation measures could be regarded as having been remedied by the criminal courts , because they had prohibited the admission of the statements obtained thereby . Such a prohibition was prescribed by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in order to compensate for a prior infringement of the rights of the person concerned . However , the circumstances in which substantial procedural irregularities might entail a bar to criminal proceedings were not laid down in law . In these circumstances , the applicant had failed to explain why the contested methods of investigation had not only required a prohibition on using the statements obtained thereby as evidence , but should also lead to a bar to criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , ORG found that , in so far as the applicant complained that ORG had refused to exclude the use in the proceedings of all items of evidence obtained as a result of the confession extracted under duress , his constitutional complaint was likewise inadmissible . It held that the applicant had failed to raise this issue in the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG delivered judgments against the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , and detective officer PERSON court found that on TIME DATE NORP had ordered that the applicant was to be questioned while being subjected to pain in the manner set out in his subsequent note for the police file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . By doing so , he had acted against the advice of all his subordinate heads of department entrusted with the investigation into ORG kidnapping . The heads of department had opposed this measure , which NORP had previously ordered on TIME DATE and then twice on TIME . The heads of department had resisted the orders , proposing instead further questioning and confrontation of the applicant with PERSON \u2019s family . NORP had then issued an order to detective officer PERSON directing him to comply with his instructions that the applicant should be threatened with torture and , if necessary , subjected thereto . The subjection to pain was to be carried out under medical supervision , without any traces being left , by another specially trained police officer , who would be brought to the police station by helicopter . A police doctor had agreed to supervise the execution of NORP \u2019s order . The court noted that the measure had been aimed at finding out where the applicant had hidden J. , whose life NORP believed was at great risk . Therefore , PERSON had threatened the applicant in the manner ordered by NORP and had also informed him that a \u201c truth serum \u201d would be administered . After TIME , the applicant confessed that he had hidden J. \u2019s body under a jetty at a pond near PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the method of investigation had not been justified . It rejected the defence of \u201c necessity \u201d because the method in question violated human dignity , as codified in LAW . Respect for human dignity also lay at the heart of LAW , second sentence , of LAW . The protection of human dignity was absolute , allowing of no exceptions or any balancing of interests .", "CARDINAL . The GPE am ORG convicted detective officer PERSON of coercion committed by an official in the course of his duties . However , in terms of penalty , it cautioned the defendant and imposed a suspended fine of MONEY ( ORG ) per diem for DATE , which the defendant would be required to pay if he committed another offence during the probation period . Furthermore , the court convicted the deputy chief of the GPE police , NORP , of having incited PERSON , a subordinate , to commit coercion in the course of his duties . It also cautioned NORP and imposed on him a suspended fine of ORG CARDINAL per diem for DATE . The applicant had given evidence as a witness in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In determining the sentences , ORG considered that there were significant mitigating factors to be taken into account . It took into consideration that the GPE sole concern had been to save PERSON \u2019s life and that they had been under extreme pressure because of their respective responsibilities vis - \u00e0 - vis the superior authority and the public . They had been exhausted at the relevant time and had acted in a very tense and hectic situation . They did not have any previous convictions . Moreover , NORP had taken responsibility for his acts by admitting and explaining them in a note for the police file on DATE . The proceedings had lasted a long time and had attracted immense media attention . The defendants had suffered prejudice in their professional career : NORP had been transferred to ORG of the Interior , and PERSON had been prohibited from acting in the prosecution of criminal offences . Furthermore , it was the first time that a conflict situation such as the one in the GPE case had been assessed by a NORP criminal court . The court took into consideration as aggravating factors that NORP had not acted spontaneously as he had already directed the use of force on TIME before he had given the order to E. Moreover , by their acts , the defendants had risked compromising the applicant \u2019s conviction for murder . The court further found that the preservation of the legal order did not warrant the enforcement of the fines imposed . Through the GPE criminal conviction it had been made clear that an order by a ORG agent to use force to obtain information was illegal .", "CARDINAL . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , NORP was appointed chief of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the GPE am ORG for legal aid for bringing official liability proceedings against ORG for the payment of compensation . He claimed that he had been traumatised and in need of psychological treatment because of the methods deployed during the police investigation .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions dated DATE the GPE am GPE police headquarters contested that PERSON \u2019s conduct when questioning the applicant in TIME of DATE was to be legally classified as coercion and amounted to a breach of official duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid and the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it confirmed , in particular , that police officers NORP and PERSON , when threatening the applicant , had infringed human dignity , which was inviolable , and had thus breached their official duties . However , the applicant would face difficulties establishing causation between the threats of torture and alleged mental damage allegedly necessitating psychological treatment . The ORG threat was negligible compared to the traumatisation caused by the fact of having killed a child . Moreover , even assuming that the applicant would be able to prove that detective officer PERSON had shaken him , causing him to hit his head against a wall , or had once hit him on the chest , allegedly causing a haematoma , such physical damage would be too minor to necessitate the payment of compensation . Furthermore , the violation of his human dignity by the threat of torture did not warrant the payment of compensation since the applicant had obtained sufficient satisfaction for this by the exclusion of his statements as evidence and the criminal conviction of the police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing a constitutional complaint by the applicant , quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to that court . It found that in refusing to grant the applicant legal aid , ORG had violated the principle of equal access to court . In particular , that court had speculated that the applicant would not be able to prove that the threat to torture him had led to mental damage . In addition to that , it was not obvious that the physical injuries the applicant claimed to have suffered in the course of the interrogation , during which he had been handcuffed , could be considered to be of minor importance . Moreover , the question whether the violation of the applicant \u2019s human dignity necessitated the payment of damages despite the satisfaction he had already obtained was a difficult legal question on which no precedent existed in a judgment of a court of final instance . It should , therefore , not be determined in an application for legal - aid proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The remitted proceedings are still pending before the GPE am ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , on the protection of human dignity , reads as follows :", "\u201c Human dignity shall be inviolable .

The prohibition on using , in any manner prejudicial to the accused , information derived from facts learned as a result of the unlawful acts of ORG agents ( the so - called doctrine of the \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d ) is firmly rooted in the legal tradition of GPE ( see , for instance , ORG , no .

In other words , evidence will be excluded if it can be shown that \u201c but for \u201d the illegal conduct it would not have been found . The exclusionary rule does not apply where the connection between the illegal police conduct and the discovery of the evidence is so remote as to dissipate the taint . This is the case , for example , where the police relied on an independent source to find the evidence ( see PERSON , cited above , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and PERSON , cited above , pp .

The ORG and the metal box were real evidence critical to the ORG \u2019s case against the appellant on the robbery counts .
