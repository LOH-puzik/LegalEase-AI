As it emerges from the plaintiffs\u2019 declarations of means , the second applicant is a sole owner of the farm of CARDINAL ha ... The annual anticipated income from the farm amounts to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and constitutes the only source of the plaintiffs\u2019 income . Moreover , the plaintiffs are the owners of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in cash , CARDINAL shares in ORG and CARDINAL shares in ORG . It is true that their cash and shares have been attached by the decision of ORG , but the GPE real financial situation does not seem to be as bad as they present it . Taking into consideration their assets and income derived from the farm , the plaintiffs are able to pay the full amount of the court fees without any reduction in their family \u2019s standard of living . When deciding to bring the present claim , the plaintiffs should have taken into account the fact that it would involve the necessity of paying court fees . They should therefore have secured financial means in anticipation of the litigation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an interlocutory appeal ( za\u017calenie ) against that decision .

On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) dismissed the appeal . The relevant part of that decision read :", "\u201c ... The plaintiffs\u2019 assets are of a considerable value and they several times exceed the average level of means . This conclusion can not be changed by the fact that part of their property is attached in other civil proceedings . The plaintiffs still remain the owners of their property and , consequently , should be able to take necessary measures to gather sufficient means to pay the court fees . The plaintiffs are involved in a number of proceedings concerning pecuniary and non - pecuniary rights to their shares in commercial companies and , in the past , they made a large number of transactions on the stock exchange market . These facts indicate that the plaintiffs ... can not be regarded as indigent and that the court fees for lodging their claim should not be borne by the ORG .", "Their declaration of means is dubious because it is not complete . The plaintiffs did not indicate precisely whether they had title to their apartment . They did not reveal the real income derived from the farm . Nor did they produce any information concerning the type of activities in which they are engaged on their farm . Moreover , [ the first applicant ] failed to indicate his place of employment ; his being his wife \u2019s dependant seems doubtful .... Lastly , the plaintiffs did not supply any information concerning their house or the farm equipment . That information would have enabled the court to ascertain their real standard of living .", "Assessing all the circumstances , the following conclusion can be drawn : the plaintiffs , who have failed to show their current financial situation and to reveal their income , can not successfully challenge the first - instance decision which rejected their application for an exemption from court fees . They can not therefore complain that they are deprived of access to a court .", "In addition , it should be pointed out that the amount of the court fee is based on the value of the claim in question and that [ that value ] depended on the plaintiffs .... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
