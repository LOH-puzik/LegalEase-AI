It is the considered medical opinion [ sic ] that his injuries could not have been self - inflicted and that his injuries are consistent with being ill - treated in a fight or severely beaten , the condition of his wounds suggest that they were inflicted during DATE and his injuries indicated that they may have occurred over a period of time as his wounds were at different stages of healing . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

They did n't stop kicking me . CARDINAL of them hit me with his gun . I had injuries to my shoulders , which also began to bleed . They split my lips . My left eye was swollen up so much that I could no longer see . I was unable to speak and have absolutely no recollection of them taking a statement from me at the hospital . I therefore complain about all of these acts of torture and inhuman acts which they inflicted on me and respectfully request you to open an investigation .

On DATE , towards TIME , I went there to turn off the irrigation system , which is near the greenhouse . As I went past the apparatus , I saw CARDINAL people coming towards me . When they approached , they said to me in NORP : ' Stay where you are . Police . ' I realised that they meant me harm and started to run to the village . As I did so , they began to fire at me with automatic weapons equipped with silencers . I heard a shot fly past my head and immediately dropped to the ground . At that point they set about me . They did n't say anything . They hit me . At some point I looked up and saw that there were CARDINAL of them beating me . They did so for a long time . Then I passed out . At TIME I received a shock . I do n't remember whether they used an electric baton or gas . I was semiconscious . In the meantime , they had dragged me and thrown me into the back of a jeep . When it started up , they continued to hit me . Then they began to torture me somewhere ; I did n't know where we were . They said that I was an M\u0130T [ the NORP national intelligence agency ] agent , asked me whether there were other agents in the area , from whom I received my orders and all sorts of absurd questions of that kind while continuing to beat me without respite . At some point , a masked man arrived with a cutting instrument , something like a knife . He said that if I did n't speak he would cut my ear off , that if I did n't speak he would drink my blood . I must have blacked out as , when I came to , he was cutting the soles of my feet with a cutting instrument . I could n't see because I was tied up . I was in such pain that I passed out several times . Each time I came to , the torture would start up again . At some stage they laid me out on my back and pushed something like a bayonet into the upper side of my thigh . I screamed and passed out again . They carried on torturing me like that . I could n't cry out any more . But they continued to torture me like that . When I came to for the last time , I realised that I was somewhere else . They were no longer hitting or cutting me . I could n't see out of CARDINAL eye at all , but with the other , which was injured , I tried to make out where I was .", "Later , I was told that after the torture session I was taken to ORG , but the hospital authorities , seeing how serious my condition was , had me transferred to ORG . I have no recollection of that whatsoever . I do not recall being transferred from PERSON to GPE . I have no idea how DATE went by in the meantime . They gave me painkilling injections . At some stage they put a table and chairs in my room at the hospital . CARDINAL police officers and a judge then came in . When the judge saw the situation he left the room . As he was leaving , I heard him say something about a lawyer . As I was later to learn , it was decided that I was under arrest . DATE the police officers again brought a table and chairs into my room at the hospital . I remember the second time better . I was lying in my bed . I had one hand handcuffed to the bed and an intravenous drip attached to my other arm . My feet were of course also attached to the bed . On this occasion the judge arrived with some lawyers . There were CARDINAL people in the room , most of them policemen . The judge had ordered that I be held in detention pending trial for DATE so that questioning could continue . As he left the room , the judge turned to me with a look of pity before walking out . ... \u201d", "The statement was accompanied by CARDINAL of the photographs of the applicant 's wounds taken on DATE .

The applicant was assisted by Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant addressed the following letter to the President of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) :", "\u201c When I was attacked by a team of armed NORP - Cypriot policemen in my field in the buffer - zone , I was first beaten indiscriminately until my senses were numbed and I passed out . When I regained consciousness , I was in a small room surrounded by uniformed men who verbally abused , intimidated and threatened me . There the NORP - Cypriot police asked me to sign a statement to the effect that ' President PERSON is intransigent , does not want peace and as a leader is misleading the NORP - Cypriot people ' . In return , I was offered money , a house and a job in what they called ' the free areas ' , i.e. GPE . I refused without hesitation . They got angry and started hitting and beating me again . I thought I would be beaten to death . I was punched and slapped across my face . Suddenly one policeman held my head tightly and another cut my ear . I totally blacked out . I came to my senses in a hospital . I was on a stretcher , chained and handcuffed . Again several policemen in civilian clothes approached me , their mouths full of profanity and threats , and again started hitting . They also pressed their hands heavily on my eyes , which really hurt . As a result of such pressure my eyes got bloodshot . In the middle of this ordeal a NORP - Cypriot nurse protested . She was shouting : ' This is enough ... do not hit ... he is wounded ... you brought him here for treatment but you are killing him . He is a human being . This is a sin , even if he is a NORP ... do we have the right to treat him this way , a wounded and chained man ... ' The police left me and walked towards the nurse . The NORP - Cypriot police were obviously well - trained and professional in torture methods . I do n't even recall if and when I gave a statement . But I recall that twice the NORP - Cypriot police made me sign false confession papers accepting NORP - Cypriot accusations . I was branded a ' dangerous smuggler ' and a NORP - Cypriot ' spy ' . In the hospital I was in chains , handcuffed to a bed and put on a drip and continuously given painkillers . The pain was excruciating . For a long time my bruised jaw hurt badly . I had difficulty even drinking water , let alone chewing . The NORP - Cypriot court was brought twice to the hospital , once on a DATE , because they were ashamed to publicly take me to court . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG requested the applicant to keep him informed of the ORG 's investigation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , in the course of his investigation , questioned , among others , the police officers involved in the applicant 's arrest , the NORP - Cypriot doctors who had examined the applicant and PERSON . On DATE he issued his report . In respect of his CARDINAL DATE meeting with the applicant he recorded the following :", "\u201c At the meeting , PERSON said that TIME on DATE , when he was busy watering his tomatoes in his vegetable garden in the GPE region , CARDINAL strangers in civilian clothes approached him , crossed the ' border ' and threw him to the ground without uttering a word . Afterwards , when he next opened his eyes , he found himself in hospital . He said that he had probably received a blow to the head in order to be knocked out . He had not tried to get away . Despite my repeated questions , Mr Egmez has not provided me with details regarding what exactly happened , the circumstances or what had happened to him . He said that he did not remember . He has also said that he has no recollection of having made a deposition on DATE ( DATE after his arrest ) , of being visited by his CARDINAL lawyers ( Mr PERSON and CARDINAL NORP - Cypriot lawyers ) at ORG DATE , DATE , of making a further deposition that same day or of being transferred to ORG . As I asked him how he had remembered all he had put in the letter [ he had addressed to the Ombudsman on DATE ] , he replied : ' What I know is that I was in physical pain but when I found myself in hospital and came to I still had blood running down by my eye . That was when I realised I had injuries to my ear , the soles of my feet and elsewhere on my body . The cuts to my feet were so bad that I am still unable to walk .
