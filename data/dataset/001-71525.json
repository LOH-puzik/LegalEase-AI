ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in the same town .", "On DATE the newspaper NORP published an article amidst a heated public debate in the wake of the acquisition of a large part of the shares of ORG by a group , ORG in GPE , and strong criticism of leaders of ORG , of which the applicant was the Secretary General . The author of the article , an Advocate named PERSON , had advanced the view that members of the general public were not treated equally when at the hands of ORG leaders . He recounted events that had occurred in DATE when he , PERSON and several others , had purchased shares in the ORG \u00fatvarpsf\u00e9lagid ( ORG , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The acquisition created a new shareholder majority in the ORG . Following a change in the ORG \u2019s ORG , the ORG had withdrawn a loan offer to , and had in fact broken off with , the ORG . The article further stated that the ORG \u2019s Managing Director and the former Chairperson of its ORG had close family ties and that the Chairperson was a member of ORG . The article then went on ( the CARDINAL passages in italics were the subject of defamation proceedings brought by the applicant ) :", "\u201c At this point , we approached PERSON . The Chairperson of ORG at the time was [ the applicant ] , Secretary General of ORG and Chairperson of ORG , which is concerned with the affairs of independent Broadcasting stations . On DATE , the ORG received a letter from ORG , notifying that it declined to do any business with the ORG . No explanations were given , but those of us [ the respondent and other shareholders ] who represented the ORG in the negotiations with the ORG were told that [ the applicant ] was opposed to ORG doing business with a company where Mr J. O. was involved . No formal negotiations took place with the other ORG owned bank , ORG , as we were told in informal discussions that it could not take up business with the ORG as some of its shareholders who had lost their majority holdings in the ORG at the share ORG meeting in DATE were customers of the bank and might be offended if the bank were to assist the ORG or take up business relations with the ORG . Fortunately there were savings banks in GPE at the time who regarded business with the ORG as being a positive and lucrative option . Here , decisions regarding business of ORG were made on the basis of interests of the saving banks , not on the basis of what was best for ORG and acceptable to the leaders of ORG . \u201d", "The applicant subsequently brought defamation proceedings against the author of the article , requesting - in addition to compensation - that the following CARDINAL statements be declared null and void :", "( CARDINAL ) \u201c No explanations were given , but those of us [ the respondent and other shareholders ] who represented the ORG in the negotiations with the ORG were told that [ the applicant ] was opposed to ORG doing business with a company where PERSON was involved . \u201d", "( CARDINAL ) \u201c Here , decisions regarding business of ORG were made on the basis of interests of the saving banks , not on the basis of what was best for ORG and acceptable to the leaders of ORG \u201d .", "The applicant categorically denied as false the allegation that he had played any part in the decision by ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and this was supported by CARDINAL managing directors . The applicant pointed out that members of ORG normally did not involve themselves in the ORG \u2019s lending activities . He considered the allegations as defamatory in that they accused him of allowing interests other than those of the ORG determine his position regarding the ORG \u2019s business with individual companies and of unlawful conduct , in breach of general business rules and ethics and administrative practice .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the respondent and against the applicant . The latter appealed but by a judgment of DATE ORG rejected his appeal .", "ORG observed that the author of the disputed article had made no attempt to prove that the applicant had been involved in the decision in question . However , he had submitted that the employees of the ORG who had been responsible for assessing the ORG \u2019s credit rating had told him and his associates about the applicant \u2019s involvement . The documentary evidence provided no indication that the refusal of credit could not have been based on legitimate business reasons . The take over by the new majority shareholders had given rise to considerable struggle resulting in some uncertainty about the ORG \u2019s future but everything indicated that things had worked out well .", "Turning to the impugned statements , ORG noted that allegation ( CARDINAL ) did not specifically address the applicant . As to allegation ( CARDINAL ) , it observed that the remark did not refer to the ORG \u2019s decision - making process but only to informal explanations offered by its employees \u2013 no formal explanation had actually been provided for its withdrawal of the offer of credit . The respondent could only be required to prove what the representatives of the company had been told , by providing statements from the bank \u2019s employees . It would not be sufficient for him merely to provide statements by his associates ; he would have to summon the relevant bank employees to give oral evidence before the court . The respondent had refused to do so in order to avoid embarrassing the employees concerned , which was understandable in view of the statutory confidentiality rules in LAW applicable to bank employees and the fact that they might be reluctant to give evidence about conduct regarded as embarrassing or even illicit by a member of ORG . Having regard in particular to the context in which the impugned remarks had been made , the applicant \u2019s interest in having them declared null and void could hardly be regarded as sufficient to require the ORG \u2019s employees to give evidence . In the view of ORG , the respondent could not be required to prove the truth of the disputed remarks as this would be unreasonably difficult for him to do . Considering the applicant\u2019 prominent position within ORG and that he served on ORG and as Chairperson of ORG , nominated by ORG and elected by ORG , as well as the requirement that his work in these areas be independent from his role as Secretary General of the ORG , he ought to accept public discussion on these connections . Cautiousness should be observed in any attempts to limit such discussion .", "In a dissenting opinion ORG Justice Mr PERSON stated inter alia that it could hardly have been difficult for the respondent author to summon the bank employees to give evidence . Not only had the plaintiff asked him to do so but it could also not be maintained that the bankers would thereby act in breach of confidence contrary to section CARDINAL of GPE . It had not been shown that requiring proof from the respondent would amount to an unreasonable burden being placed on him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
