CARDINAL [ to the Convention ] . The general - interest grounds which ORG took into consideration when framing the rules set out in the first CARDINAL paragraphs of CARDINAL justify their application to situations which arose prior to the commencement of pending proceedings . It follows that those provisions are applicable to the present action , brought on DATE ;", "The administrative courts do not have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of legislation ; [ the applicants\u2019 ] request that this court review the constitutionality of LAW must therefore be refused ;", "It appears from the investigation that in DATE of PERSON pregnancy , after an ultrasound scan had shown a manifest problem affecting the growth of the foetus , she and PERSON were advised to consider the option of an abortion if karyotype analysis after an amniocentesis revealed a chromosomal abnormality . Mr and PERSON then decided to have that test performed at FAC . They were informed by the hospital on DATE that no anomaly of the foetus \u2019s male chromosomal pattern had been detected . However , very soon after the baby \u2019s birth on DATE magnetic resonance imaging revealed a serious malformation of the brain due to a karyotypic anomaly ;", "The report of the expert appointed by the court states that this anomaly was entirely detectable ; failure to detect it therefore constituted gross negligence on ORG part which deprived PERSON and PERSON of the possibility of seeking an abortion on therapeutic grounds and entitles them to compensation under LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court then assessed the damage sustained by the applicants as follows :", "\u201c ... firstly , ... the amounts requested in respect of non - specialist care , the specific costs not borne by social security , the costs of building a house suited to the child \u2019s needs with a number of modifications to the home and the purchase of a specially adapted vehicle relate to special burdens arising throughout the life of the child from his disability and can not therefore be sums for which [ AP - HP ] is liable ;", "... secondly , ...

The court concluded by ordering ORG - HP to pay the applicants the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , less the amount of the interim awards , interest being payable on the resulting sum at the statutory rate from the date of receipt of the claim on DATE , the interest due being capitalised on DATE and subsequently on each anniversary from DATE . AP - HP was also ordered to pay the applicants the sum of ORG CARDINAL in respect of costs not included in the expenses and to bear the cost of the expert opinion ordered by the president of the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the judgment . Their appeal is currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before enactment of GPE DATE the legal position was established by the relevant case - law .", "CARDINAL . An action for damages brought by the parents of a child born disabled and by the child itself may come within the jurisdiction of either the administrative courts or the ordinary courts , depending on the identity of the defendant . If the defendant is a private doctor or a private medical laboratory , the dispute is referred to the ordinary courts . Where , on the other hand , as in the instant case , a public hospital service is involved , the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat gave judgment on DATE ( CARDINAL , Sect . , DATE , ORG hospitalier de Nice v. ORG . p.CARDINAL ) . PERSON PERSON , then aged DATE , had undergone an amniocentesis at her own request in order to verify the health of the foetus she was carrying . Although the result of that examination revealed no anomaly , she gave birth to a child suffering from trisomy CARDINAL , a condition detectable through the chromosome test carried out . The PERSON d\u2019Etat held in the first place that the hospital which had carried out the examination had been guilty of negligence , since PERSON had not been informed that the results of the amniocentesis might be subject to a higher margin of error than usual on account of the conditions under which the examination had taken place .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , a distinction was drawn between the disabled child \u2019s entitlement to compensation and that of its parents .", "With regard to the disabled child \u2019s right to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat ruled : \u201c In deciding that a direct causal link existed between the negligence of the hospital centre ... and the damage incurred by the child PERSON from the trisomy from which he suffers , when it is not established by the documents in the file submitted to the court which determined the merits that the infirmity from which the child suffers and which is inherent in his genetic make - up was the consequence of an amniocentesis , ORG made an error of law \u201d .", "On the other hand , with regard to the GPE right to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat noted : \u201c By asking for an amniocentesis , PERSON had clearly indicated that she wished to avoid the risk of a genetic accident to the child she had conceived , whose probability , given her age at the time , was relatively high . \u201d It went on to say that in those conditions the hospital \u2019s negligence had \u201c wrongly led PERSON and PERSON to the certainty that the child conceived was not trisomic and that PERSON pregnancy could be taken normally to term \u201d and that \u201c this negligence , as a result of which PERSON had no reason to ask for a second amniocentesis with a view to abortion on therapeutic grounds under LAW of LAW , [ should ] be regarded as the direct cause of the prejudice caused to PERSON and PERSON by their child \u2019s infirmity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to compensation , the ORG d\u2019Etat took into account , under the head of pecuniary damage , the \u201c special burdens , particularly in terms of specialist treatment and education \u201d made necessary by the child \u2019s infirmity , and awarded the parents an annuity to be paid throughout the child \u2019s life . It also ordered the hospital to pay compensation for their nonpecuniary damage and the disruption to their lives .", "CARDINAL . Thus the ORG d\u2019Etat did not accept that a disabled child was entitled to compensation on the sole ground that the disability had not been detected during the mother \u2019s pregnancy . It did accept on the other hand that the parents of the child born with a disability were entitled to compensation and made an award not only in respect of their non - pecuniary damage but also in respect of the prejudice caused by the disruption to their lives and of pecuniary damage , specifying that the latter included the special burdens which would arise for the parents from their child \u2019s infirmity ( expenditure linked to specialist treatment and education , assistance from a helper , removal to a suitable home or conversion of their present home , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment did not attract particular comment and led to a line of case - law followed thereafter by the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The case - law of the ordinary courts was laid down by ORG on DATE ( PERSON , Ass . PERSON . , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . Ass . PERSON . , no . CARDINAL ) in a judgment which was widely commented on ( the PERSON judgment ) . In the PERSON case a woman had been taken ill with rubella at the start of her pregnancy . Having decided to terminate the pregnancy if the foetus was affected , she took tests to establish whether she was immunised against the disease . Because of negligence on the part of both her doctor and the laboratory , she was wrongly informed that she was immunised . She therefore decided not to terminate the pregnancy and gave birth to a child which suffered from grave disabilities resulting from infection with rubella in the womb . ORG held : \u201c Since the negligence on the part of the doctor and the laboratory in performing the services for which they had contracted with PERSON prevented her from exercising her choice of terminating her pregnancy in order not to give birth to a disabled child , the child may claim compensation for the damage resulting from that disability and caused by the negligence found . \u201d", "Thus , contrary to the ORG d\u2019Etat , ORG accepted that a child born disabled could himself claim compensation for the prejudice resulting from his disability .", "In this case therefore account was taken of the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage suffered by both the child and the parents , including the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life .", "CARDINAL . It thus appears that in the same circumstances both ORG and the ORG d\u2019Etat base their approach on a system of liability for negligence . However , ORG recognises a direct causal link between the medical negligence and the child \u2019s disability , and the prejudice resulting from that disability for the child itself . The ORG d\u2019Etat does not recognise that link but considers that the negligence makes the hospital liable vis - \u00e0 - vis the parents on account of the existence of a direct causal link between that negligence and the damage they have sustained .", "Both lines of case - law allow compensation to be paid in respect of the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life . However , since the ORG d\u2019Etat considers that damage to have been sustained by the parents , whereas ORG considers that it is sustained by the child , there may be significant differences in the nature and amount of such compensation , depending on whether the case - law of the former or the latter court is being followed .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE was upheld several times by ORG , which reaffirmed the principle of compensation for the child born disabled , subject to proof , where appropriate , that the medical conditions for a voluntary termination of pregnancy on therapeutic grounds were satisfied ( PERSON . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , CARDINAL judgments of DATE , PERSON , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; see also PERSON . , Ass . pl\u00e9n . , CARDINAL judgments of DATE , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON judgment drew numerous reactions from legal theorists , but also from politicians and from associations of disabled persons and practitioners ( doctors , obstetrical gynaecologists and echographers ) . The last - mentioned group interpreted the judgment as obliging them to provide a guarantee , and the insurance companies raised medical insurance premiums .", "CARDINAL . Both the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG took as their starting point a system of liability for negligence . In NORP law , under the general rules on the question , the right to compensation for damage can be upheld only if the conditions for liability are first satisfied . That means that there must be prejudice ( or damage ) , negligence and a causal link between the damage and the negligence .", "More particularly , with regard to the liability of a public authority , for compensation to be payable the prejudice , which it is for the victim to prove , must be certain . Loss of opportunity constitutes certain prejudice , provided that the opportunity was a serious one .", "In the present case the prejudice resulted from a lack of information , or inadequate or incorrect information , about the results of an examination or analysis . In such a case , before LAW was enacted , negligence falling short of gross negligence was sufficient . As to the relation between cause and effect , a direct causal link was established between the hospital \u2019s negligence and the GPE prejudice ( see the abovementioned PERSON judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . Still in the sphere of administrative law , the amount of compensation is governed by the general principle of full compensation for damage ( neither impoverishment nor enrichment of the victim ) . Compensation may take the form of a capital sum or an annuity . According to the principle of the equal validity of claims for all heads of damage , both pecuniary damage and non - pecuniary damage confer entitlement to compensation .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE put an end to the position established by the case - law mentioned above , of both the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG alike . Its relevant parts provide as follows :", "\u201c I. No one may claim to have suffered damage by the mere fact of his or her birth .", "A person born with a disability on account of medical negligence may obtain compensation for damage where the negligent act directly caused the disability or aggravated it or prevented steps from being taken to attenuate it .", "Where the liability of a health - care professional or establishment is established vis - \u00e0 - vis the parents of a child born with a disability not detected during the pregnancy by reason of gross negligence ( faute caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e ) , the parents may claim compensation in respect of their damage only . That damage can not include the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the life of the child . Compensation for the latter is a matter for national solidarity .", "The provisions of the present sub - section I shall be applicable to proceedings in progress , except for those in which an irrevocable decision has been taken on the principle of compensation .", "II . Every disabled person shall be entitled , whatever the cause of his or her disability , to the solidarity of the national community as a whole .", "III . ORG for Disabled Persons shall be charged , in a manner laid down by decree , with assessing the material , financial and non - material situation of disabled persons in GPE , and of disabled persons of NORP nationality living outside GPE and receiving assistance by virtue of national solidarity , and with presenting all proposals deemed necessary to ORG , with the aim of ensuring , through an ongoing pluri - DATE programme , that assistance is provided to such persons ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . These provisions entered into force \u201c under the conditions of ordinary law following publication of the PERSON in ORG of the NORP Republic \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . PERSON no . DATE was published in ORG on DATE and it therefore came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat observed in particular :", "\u201c ... II . The date of the PERSON \u2019s entry into force :", "The liability criteria set out in the second sub - paragraph of paragraph I of section CARDINAL were enacted in favour of persons born with disabilities resulting from medical negligence whether that negligence directly caused the disability , aggravated it or made it impossible to take steps to attenuate it . They were laid down with sufficient precision to be applied by the relevant courts without the need for further legislation to clarify their scope .", "The different liability criteria defined in the third sub - paragraph of paragraph I of section CARDINAL were enacted in favour of the parents of children born with a disability which , on account of gross negligence on the part of a medical practitioner or healthcare establishment , was not detected during pregnancy . They are sufficiently precise to be applied without the need for further legislative provisions or regulations . Admittedly , they bar inclusion of the damage consisting in the special burdens arising from the disability throughout the child \u2019s life in the damage for which the parents can obtain compensation , and provide that such damage is to be made good through reliance on national solidarity . But the very terms of the PERSON , interpreted with the aid of its drafting history , show that ORG intended to exclude compensation for that head of damage on the ground that , although there was a causal link between negligence and damage , that link was not such as to justify making the person who committed the negligent act liable for the resulting damage . In providing that this type of damage should be made good by reliance on national solidarity , ORG did not therefore make implementation of the rules on liability for negligence which it had introduced subject to the enactment of subsequent legislation laying down the conditions under which national solidarity would be mobilised to assist disabled persons .", "It follows that , since the PERSON does not contain provisions for the deferred entry into force of section CARDINAL , and since in addition ORG \u2019s intention , as revealed by the PERSON \u2019s drafting history , was to make it applicable immediately , the provisions of LAW came into force under the conditions of ordinary law following the PERSON \u2019s publication in ORG of GPE .", "III . Law no . DATE - CARDINAL \u2019s compatibility with international law", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "The object of LAW is to lay down a new system of compensation for the damage suffered by children born with disabilities and by their parents , differing from the system which had emerged from the case - law of the administrative and ordinary courts . The new system provides for compensation , by means of an award to be assessed by the courts alone , for the damage directly caused to the person born disabled on account of medical negligence and the damage directly caused to the parents of the child born with a disability which , on account of gross medical negligence , was not detected during pregnancy . It prevents children born with a disability which , on account of medical negligence , was not detected during pregnancy from obtaining from the person responsible for the negligent act compensation for the damage consisting in the special burdens arising from the disability throughout their lives , whereas such compensation had previously been possible under the case - law of the ordinary courts . It also prevents the parents from obtaining from the person responsible for the negligent act compensation for the damage consisting in the special burdens arising from their child \u2019s disability throughout its life , whereas such compensation had previously been possible under the case - law of the administrative courts . Lastly , it makes compensation for other heads of damage suffered by the child \u2019s parents subject to the existence of gross negligence , whereas the case - law of the administrative and ordinary courts had formerly been based on the existence of negligence falling short of gross negligence .", "This new system , which was put in place by ORG on general - interest grounds relating to ethical considerations , the proper organisation of the health service and the equitable treatment of all disabled persons , is not incompatible with the requirements of LAW of [ LAW ] , with those of ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of [ the Convention ] , with those of LAW No .

NORP legislation ( see PERSON no . DATE of DATE on orientation in favour of disabled persons , which set up the basic framework , and later legislation ) provides compensatory advantages to disabled persons based on national solidarity in a number of fields ( such as the right to education for disabled children and adults , technical and human assistance , financial assistance , etc . ) .", "In particular , the families of disabled persons are entitled to a special education allowance ( Allocation d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . This is a family benefit paid from the family allowance funds , provided both the child and its parents are resident in GPE . The ORG is granted by decision of ORG of the d\u00e9partement in which the claimant lives , after the file has been studied by a multidisciplinary technical team . First the Special Education Board takes formal note of the child \u2019s disability and assesses it . For entitlement to the ORG , the level of disability found must at least exceed PERCENT . Where the disability exceeds PERCENT , entitlement to the ORG is automatic ; if the disability is assessed at PERCENT , payment of the allowance is not automatic . It is subject to the child \u2019s need for pedagogical , psychological , medical , paramedical and other forms of assistance .", "The ORG is a CARDINAL - level benefit : the basic allowance plus top - up payments . The first level is automatically payable where the conditions mentioned above are satisfied . The basic rate of ORG is ORG DATE ( the figure supplied by the Government on DATE ) . Where the child \u2019s state of health requires substantial expenditure or the assistance of a third person , this may then confer entitlement to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL levels of ORG top - up payments , which are added to the basic rate .", "The first CARDINAL top - up payments depend on the level of expenditure required by the child \u2019s state of health , the time for which the assistance of a third person is necessary , or a combination of both .

The PERSON of DATE emerged from a legislative process launched as far back as DATE with the intention of reforming the system of disability compensation in GPE .
