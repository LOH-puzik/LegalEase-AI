He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The PERSON are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a new concept called \u201c tax asset stripping cases \u201d ( selskabst\u00f8mmersager ) came into existence in GPE . It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravating debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous private limited companies within a short period , and for the sake of their own profit , \u201c stripping \u201d the companies for assets , including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax . The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated about their economic criminal activities , which concerned very large amounts .", "I.", "On DATE ORG reported to ORG ( Statsadvokaten for ORG PERSON ) that allegedly , a person henceforth called ORG , and CARDINAL other persons had participated in the acquisition and stripping of CARDINAL private limited companies ( the ORG case ) . ORG made a reservation to increase the number of persons involved and submitted at the same time a note in which the applicant 's name figured and his role as vendor of private limited companies was described .", "In DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued a warrant of arrest against ORG , who was staying abroad .", "On DATE ORG issued a search warrant for the premises of the applicant , who was neither provisionally charged ( sigtet ) nor charged ( tiltalt ) .

He was arrested in GPE in DATE , and served a sentence there before he was surrendered to the NORP police on DATE .", "In the meantime ORG had questioned the applicant on DATE . An order for surrender of details on bank accounts in GPE was issued on DATE . Another search warrant against the applicant was issued by ORG on DATE . It was carried out on DATE , and the applicant was formally charged with tax asset stripping allegedly having been committed in CARDINAL cases during DATE with a risk of loss to the ORG of CARDINAL NORP kroner ( DKK ) . PERSON was charged with tax asset stripping in CARDINAL cases . The police also investigated other persons in connection with the case , but their criminal cases were conducted separately . In DATE the applicant gave permission that the police obtain details from his accounts with his bank in GPE . The latter and account details from the bank in GPE were submitted to the police in DATE .", "On the prosecutions ' request a hearing was held before ORG on DATE in order to plan the course of the proceedings . Dates for the trial were agreed on . It appears from the court records that the judge asked counsel whether shorter interval between the dates of the hearings could be fixed so that the trial could be concluded faster . Counsel stated that this was not possible since they were occupied by other matters , including hearings already scheduled in other proceedings .", "An indictment was issued by the prosecution on DATE and the trial before ORG commenced on DATE . CARDINAL hearings were held altogether . The applicant , ORG and CARDINAL witnesses were heard , including a state - authorised public accountant , who gave evidence over DATE in which he elaborated the audit reports , etc . In addition , a considerable amount of other documentary evidence was presented e.g. about questions such as constructions with NORP and foreign companies and money transaction in NORP and foreign banks ( in GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Each set of exhibits for the case took up CARDINAL ACARDINAL binders , which included CARDINAL audit reports , CARDINAL supplementary reports and CARDINAL statements of transaction prepared for the case by the state - authorised public accountant .", "The closing speech of the applicant 's counsel took CARDINAL day , that of the ORG 's counsel a little more than two days , and that of the prosecutor DATE .", "ORG , sitting with CARDINAL lay judges , met CARDINAL times and deliberated for altogether DATE .

ORG was convicted by the same judgment .", "ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint that the length of the proceeding had exceeded a reasonable time , stating among other things :", "\u201c ... on the material before it the court can not find it established that the investigation laid unnecessary idle during the periods , on which [ the applicant ] specifically has relied [ i.e. de facto from DATE until DATE ] .", "Furthermore , the court notes that the nature and scope of the offences must be taken into account when assessing the total length of the proceedings ... In this connection it should be taken into consideration that the proceedings ... have shown , inter alia , that it has been time - consuming and difficult to procure various details for the case from foreign authorities and banks in general , i.e. also during the investigation , not least concerning [ the applicant ] . The length of the proceedings is not due only to the affairs of [ ORG ] , but also due to the need [ during the investigation and the trial ] of illuminating the role of [ the applicant ] Moreover , the investigation concerning both [ ORG and the applicant ] was rendered difficult by the fact that [ ORG ] had left GPE and stayed abroad without notifying the NORP authorities of his residence in the period from DATE until DATE escaped from custody and fled abroad in the period from DATE until DATE , whereupon he was furthermore remanded in custody and served a sentence in GPE from DATE until DATE . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment to ORG ( PERSON ) , before which QUANTITY hearings were held . By judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . The appeal court also rejected the applicant 's complaint that the length of the proceeding had exceeded a reasonable time . It stated inter alia :", "\u201c The High Court finds that there are no major periods of time during the proceedings with the police , the prosecutor , ORG or ORG when the case has not been duly expedited . It should be noted that it is solely due to the circumstances of [ the applicant ] and his counsel that the case could not be tried by ORG in DATE . Accordingly , and in view of the nature and the scope of the crime , which has necessitated comprehensive investigation , the total length of the proceedings does not involve any violation of LAW . \u201d ORG", "On DATE the applicant requested leave to appeal against the High Court judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . His request was refused by the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) on DATE .", "II .", "In DATE the Police in ORG with the assistance from a special crime squad carried out investigation of several tax assets stripping cases , which resulted inter alia in CARDINAL persons being indicted in DATE . As part of the investigations accountants had been asked to draw up statements of accounts . Those were submitted on DATE and led the police 's attention to other persons involved . On DATE the applicant was provisionally charged with participation in tax assets stripping having been committed in DATE and by indictment of CARDINAL DATE prosecution was initiated against him and DATE coaccused ( the NORP case ) . On DATE the indictment was forwarded to ORG ) although the investigation had not been completed .", "It emerges from the court records of DATE that the parties discussed the scheduling of the trial . The applicant 's counsel was not able to attend the trial until after DATE and some of the other counsel were unable to appear until after DATE .", "By request of counsel for CARDINAL co - accused , on CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to transfer the case to ORG being the proper venue .

From the court records of CARDINAL DATE it emerges that the trial was to take place in another building rented for the purpose of trying a number of major cases before ORG , and that therefore the trial could not start until DATE . CARDINAL hearings already scheduled for DATE were maintained and reserved for various requests made by counsel . It appears , however , that the said CARDINAL hearings were subsequently cancelled . A supplementary indictment was issued on DATE .", "In the period DATE and DATE altogether CARDINAL court sessions were held before ORG . The applicant , the co - accused , and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . In addition , the above \u201c liquidity statement \u201d and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were presented , thus CARDINAL ACARDINAL binders were read out during the trial .", "On DATE the case was set down for judgment , which was pronounced on DATE and ran to CARDINAL pages , and by which the applicant and the co - accused were convicted . As to the metering out the applicant 's sentence , the court found that the sentence previously imposed on the applicant , upheld by ORG on DATE ( see under PERSON ) , would not have been increased , had the CARDINAL trials against him been joined . Thus , no additional sentence was imposed on the applicant . He was , however , deprived of his right to establish or to become manager and/or member of a director 's board in a private limited company , or in a company or an association which would require public approval .", "ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint that the length of the proceeding had exceeded a reasonable time , stating among other things :", "\u201c The [ crimes ] were committed in the period from DATE until DATE . Prosecution was initiated by the indictment of DATE and the supplementary indictment of DATE . The defendants were originally indicted before ORG , but the case was referred to ORG by order of CARDINAL DATE passed by ORG . This order was appealed against to ORG , which dismissed the appeal by order of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the Leave to ORG refused to grant the prosecutor leave to appeal to ORG . ORG received the case on DATE , and during a court session held on DATE dates were fixed for the trial . [ The court sessions scheduled to take place in DATE ] were later cancelled , and the trial took place as from CARDINAL DATE and onwards .", "According to the information available , the time spent on investigation and initiation of prosecution by the prosecutor can not be blamed the latter . In this connection , importance has been attached to the not uncomplicated nature of the case and to the need for investigation abroad . Accordingly , LAW has not been breached \u201d", "The applicant did not appeal against the judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
