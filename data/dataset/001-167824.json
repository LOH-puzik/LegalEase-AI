On DATE ORG gave judgment dismissing PERSON \u2019s claims . It held that since the portrait image was appropriate to the newspaper article and had been published in a television documentary in which ORG had cooperated of his own volition , there was no unlawful interference with GPE \u2019s rights . PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( gerechtshof ) overturned the judgment of ORG and held in favour of ORG recognised that the case raised questions under both LAW , in that it concerned ORG right to respect for his private life , and LAW , in that it concerned the applicants\u2019 freedom of journalistic expression . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL NORP Although it can be conceded to [ the applicants ] that the image does not contain details of [ GPE \u2019s ] private life [ LANGUAGE in the original ] , strengthens the expressive power of the article and is relevant in itself , ORG considers that publication of the image of his face with the article constitutes an interference with ORG \u2019s private life . It should be remembered in this connection that it appears from the article that GPE is suspected of a ( very serious ) crime . The next question that needs an answer is whether , taking into account [ the applicants\u2019 ] freedom of expression , this interference constitutes an unlawful act vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE", "CARDINAL ORG takes the view that this is the case . It takes the view that GPE is not required to suffer publication of the recognisable portrait with the article . It would have been possible for [ the applicants ] to publish a less recognisable portrait of GPE without significantly detracting from the expressiveness of the article , for example by placing a black rectangle over the eyes . [ The applicants ] have argued in this connection that it has been held in other cases that this measure has an even more criminalising effect , but that does not apply in this case , because the article concerned the suspicion of a crime of violence and the impending trial thereof by a criminal court . ORG takes the view that in publishing portraits of persons suspected of criminal acts reticence is , in principle , appropriate .", "CARDINAL NORP The circumstance that in DATE PERSON gave his active cooperation to a documentary that was broadcast on television in DATE and DATE and could be viewed on the internet until DATE does not justify publishing a recognisable portrait together with the article about that documentary and the impending trial . GPE has not , by cooperating in that documentary ( and the rap clip published on GPE ) , become a public figure to the extent that he must for that reason suffer his recognisable portrait to be published in the newspaper with nationwide coverage ORG and on the website www.hetparool.nl , the less so because he is thereby recognisably connected to a ( very serious ) crime . As held above , a less recognisable portrait could have limited the interference with his private life without doing any real harm to the expressiveness of the article . It makes no difference that portraits of GPE ( derived from the documentary and the rap clip ) can still be found in the internet . What is important is that [ the applicants ] at the time published an image in the newspaper , which DATE unlike in the case of use of the internet \u2013 can be seen in CARDINAL glance and without any further manipulations . The freedom [ the applicants ] have , in principle , to determine in accordance with their own views in what way they will inform the public of a newsworthy fact does not go so far that in the specific circumstances of the present case they were at liberty to publish a recognisable portrait of GPE with the article .", "CARDINAL Taking all circumstances into account , ORG therefore finds that GPE \u2019s right to respect of his privacy outweighs [ the applicants\u2019 ] freedom of expression . The wrongful nature of [ the applicants\u2019 ] acts vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE is therefore established . ... \u201d", "The applicants were held jointly and severally liable and ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to GPE in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing , as relevant to the case , that ORG had overlooked PERSON \u2019s own responsibility through having cooperated with the documentary and the rap clip , combined with his having stabbed CARDINAL staff member of the homeless shelter to death and severely wounded CARDINAL others , from which it followed , in their submission , that GPE could not claim the same protection of his private life to which he would otherwise have been entitled . They submitted in addition that ORG position was tantamount to an absolute prohibition of publication of a recognisable photograph of any criminal suspect who was not a public figure .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE dismissing the appeal . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ... ORG has rightly taken as its starting point that the question whether PERSON \u2019s right to respect for his private life should weigh more heavily in the balance than [ the applicants\u2019 \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG : NL : GPE , GPE Law Reports ( PERSON ) CARDINAL/CARDINAL).In the light of this standard , it does not reflect an incorrect understanding of the law that ORG has held that publication of a recognisable portrait , taken from [ the DATE documentary ] , is not justified by the circumstance that GPE has cooperated with the documentary about his person and the rap clip . Nor is the finding of ORG that publication was wrongful vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE based on incomprehensible reasoning . As is shown by paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment , ORG has in so finding taken into account the nature and content of that documentary and the circumstance that it was made before the crimes were committed of which ORG was suspected at the time the portrait was published . ORG has , furthermore , taken into account that [ the applicants ] had other means at their disposal than complete recognisable publication of the image , which would not have harmed the expressiveness of the publication and would have constituted a lesser interference with PERSON \u2019s right to respect for his private life . ORG has thus expressed the view that publishing the unmodified image was neithernor proportionate to the aim pursued , namely informing the public . This finding does not amount to an absolute prohibition as suggested in the ground of appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c If a portrait has been made without having been commissioned by the person portrayed or for that person \u2019s benefit , then the person to whom the copyright to that portrait belongs shall not be allowed to publish it in so far as a reasonable interest of the person portrayed , or after that person \u2019s death , CARDINAL of that person \u2019s surviving kin weighs against publication . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
