From CARDINAL DATE onwards the applicant repeatedly fell ill and was sometimes unable to work . CARDINAL medical certificate stated that this was the result of overworking .", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , restructuring took place .", "CARDINAL . Following a number of further notifications to her superiors explaining the situation , in particular in DATE , the applicant again fell ill and finally consulted a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s legal counsel wrote to the ORG management .

On DATE the management rejected the applicant \u2019s accusations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a criminal complaint against ORG for aggravated fraud and its relevant legal aspects . He specified that the complaint also served the purpose of avoiding criminal responsibility for the applicant herself following her numerous complaints to ORG which had not brought any improvements in the care provided . It was argued that , owing to the lack of staff and the inadequate standards , her employer knowingly failed to provide the high - quality care announced in its advertisements and hence did not provide the services paid for and was putting the patients at risk . He also alleged that ORG had systematically tried to cover up the existing problems and urged staff to falsify records of services rendered . The applicant \u2019s complaint referred to the report produced by the MDK following their visit in DATE , and stated that she would be willing to attest to the bad conditions at the nursing home . It further included statements by the applicant concerning overworking and referred to TIME of a team meeting advising ORG staff , in order to avoid disciplinary consequences , not to disclose staff shortages and time pressures to patients and their relatives . The criminal complaint included the following passage :", "\u201c The company ORG , which has financial difficulties and is aware of this , has deceived family members , because the care provided does not in any way correspond to or justify the fees paid . PERSON is therefore enriching itself and accepts the inadequacy of the medical and hygienic care . ... This demonstrates how it systematically \u2013 including by intimidating staff \u2013 tries to cover up existing problems .

Similar problems exist in other institutions ; therefore considerable damage is at issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was heard as a witness by the public prosecution in preliminary investigation proceedings against ORG . The preliminary proceedings were again discontinued on DATE pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( file No . DATE Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal of DATE since this could not be justified under LAW ( ORG ) or section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE - see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . In this connection it found that the leaflet \u2013 the content of which was attributable to the applicant , since she had transmitted it to her employer without any further declaration DATE was covered by her right to freedom of expression and did not amount to a breach of her duties under the employment contract . Although it was polemical , it had been based on objective grounds and had not upset the \u201c working climate \u201d in the nursing home .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) , by a judgment of the same date , quashed the judgment of ORG and found that the dismissal of CARDINAL DATE had been lawful as the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint had provided a \u201c compelling reason \u201d for the termination of the employment relationship without notice under LAW and had made continuation of the employment relationship unacceptable . It found that the applicant had frivolously based the criminal complaint on facts that she could not prove in the course of the proceedings since , in particular , merely referring to the shortage of staff was not sufficient to enable her to allege fraud , and since she had failed to further specify the alleged instruction to falsify records , which was also evidenced by the fact that the public prosecutor had not opened an investigation . ORG further held that the criminal complaint amounted to a disproportionate reaction to the denial by ORG of any staff shortages , since the applicant had never attempted to have her allegation of fraud examined internally and since , moreover , she had intended to put undue pressure on her employer by provoking a public discussion of the issue . It also pointed out that the nursing home was under the supervision of the MDK , which had carried out a further inspection there on DATE , shortly before the applicant had lodged her complaint . She could have awaited the outcome of that visit and therefore her criminal complaint had been unnecessary . The court , referring also to the principles established by ORG in its relevant case - law ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , concluded that the applicant had not been acting within her constitutional rights and had breached her duty of loyalty towards her employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the decision refusing her leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , which was served on the applicant on DATE , ORG refused , without stating further reasons , to accept her constitutional complaint for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . Apart from specific legislation with respect to civil servants exposing suspected cases of corruption , NORP law does not contain general provisions governing the disclosure of deficiencies in enterprises or institutions , such as illegal conduct on the part of the employer , by an employee ( \u201c whistle - blowing \u201d ) and discussions on related draft legislation have for the time being not produced any results .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of such specific legislation , an extraordinary dismissal of an employee for having lodged a criminal complaint against his or her employer may be based on LAW , which provides that an employment relationship may be terminated by either party to the contract without complying with a notice period for a \u201c compelling reason \u201d ( wichtiger PERSON ) . Facts must be present on the basis of which the party giving notice can not reasonably be expected to continue the employment until DATE to the agreed end of that relationship , taking all circumstances of the individual case into account and weighing up the interests of both parties to the contract .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that termination of an employment relationship by the employer is unlawful if it is socially unjustified . Under LAW ) of the LAW , termination is socially unjustified unless it is , inter alia , based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct or continuation of the employment relationship would conflict with compelling requirements for the operation of the enterprise .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( file No . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ruled in a case where , at the request of the public prosecutor , an employee had given evidence and handed over documents in preliminary criminal investigations that had been instituted against his employer by the public prosecutor ex officio . ORG held that , in accordance with the rule of law , the discharge of a citizen \u2019s duty to give evidence in criminal investigations could not in itself entail disadvantages under civil law . ORG further pointed out in an obiter dictum that even in the event that an employee reported the employer to the public prosecution authorities on his or her own initiative , the rule of law required that such exercise of a citizen \u2019s right would , as a rule , not justify dismissal without notice , unless the employee had knowingly or frivolously reported incorrect information .", "CARDINAL . In the light of ORG case - law , ORG , in a judgment of DATE ( file No . CARDINAL AZR CARDINAL ) , further elaborated on the relation between an employee \u2019s duty of loyalty towards the employer and the exercise of his or her constitutionally guaranteed rights . It reiterated that in reporting a criminal offence an employee had recourse to a means of implementing the law that was not only sanctioned by the legal order but also called for under LAW . An employee who exercised that right in good faith could not therefore incur a disadvantage in the event that the underlying allegations proved wrong or could not be clarified in the course of the ensuing proceedings . It held , however , that , taking into consideration the employee \u2019s duty of loyalty , a [ criminal ] complaint lodged by an employee must not constitute a disproportionate reaction in response to the employer \u2019s conduct . Indications of a disproportionate reaction by the complainant employee could be the justification of the complaint , the motivation of the person lodging the complaint or the failure to have previously drawn attention to the impugned deficiencies internally within the enterprise . In this context the employee \u2019s motives for lodging the complaint were of particular significance . A complaint that was lodged solely to cause damage to the employer or to \u201c wear him or her down \u201d could constitute a disproportionate reaction depending on the charges underlying the complaint . As regards the possibility of previous internal clarification of the allegations , the court stated that it had to be determined in each individual case whether such an approach could reasonably have been expected of the employee . It would not be expected if the latter had obtained knowledge of an offence which , if he or she failed to report it , would render him or her liable to criminal prosecution or in the event of a serious criminal offence or an offence committed by the employer himself . In addition , previous internal clarification of the matter was not required if redress could not legitimately be expected . If the employer failed to remedy an unlawful practice even though the employee had previously drawn his attention to that practice , the latter was no longer bound by a duty of loyalty towards his employer .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the following outcomes of investigation proceedings :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the investigations offer sufficient reason for bringing public charges , the public prosecution office shall submit a bill of indictment to the competent court .", "( CARDINAL ) In all other cases the public prosecution office shall terminate the proceedings . The public prosecutor shall notify the accused accordingly if he was examined as such or a warrant of arrest was issued against him ; the same shall apply if he has requested such notice or if there is a particular interest in notifying him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its LAW ( DATE ) on the protection of \u201c whistle - blowers \u201d ORG of ORG stressed the importance of \u201c whistle - blowing \u201d \u2013 concerned individuals sounding the alarm in order to stop wrongdoings that place fellow human beings at risk \u2013 as an opportunity to strengthen accountability , and bolster the fight against corruption and mismanagement , both in the public and private sectors . It invited all member GPE to review their legislation concerning the protection of \u201c whistle - blowers \u201d , keeping in mind the following guiding principles :", "ORG . the definition of protected disclosures shall include all bona fide warnings against various types of unlawful acts , including all serious human rights violations which affect or threaten the life , health , liberty and any other legitimate interests of individuals as subjects of public administration or taxpayers , or as shareholders , employees or customers of private companies ;", "GPE . the legislation should therefore cover both public and private sector whistle - blowers ... , and", "ORG . it should codify relevant issues in the following areas of law :", "CARDINAL . employment law \u2013 in particular protection against unfair dismissals and other forms of employment - related retaliation ; ...", "CARDINAL . This legislation should protect anyone who , in good faith , makes use of existing internal whistle - blowing channels from any form of retaliation ( unfair dismissal , harassment or any other punitive or discriminatory treatment ) .", "CARDINAL . Where internal channels either do not exist , have not functioned properly or could reasonably be expected not to function properly given the nature of the problem raised by the whistle - blower , external whistle - blowing , including through the media , should likewise be protected .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL .
