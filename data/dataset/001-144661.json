The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the time of the facts of the case , the applicant was in private legal practice and was a senator .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG attached to ORG and ORG ( referred to herein as \u201c the prosecutor \u201d and \u201c the DNA \u201d ) started criminal proceedings against the applicant ( urm\u0103rirea penal\u0103 ) on suspicion of trading in influence ( traffic de influen\u0163\u0103 ) . In particular , the prosecutor alleged that : ( i ) the applicant had accepted MONEY ( ORG ) from a businessman , ORG , in return for using his connection to Judge PERSON of ORG and ORG in order to influence the outcome of a case pending before that court which concerned a dispute between ORG \u2019s company and a state agency ; and ( ii ) that he had accepted money from GPE , under the pretext of providing legal services through his law firm , in order to facilitate GPE \u2019s access to the head of the police with the aim of discussing criminal investigations that were being conducted against GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was returning home during DATE in a car belonging to the ORG . Close to his home , his route was blocked by another car . Several armed individuals jumped out , dragged the applicant from his car and , in front of his neighbours and a crowd of passers - by , handcuffed him and put him in their car . He was then taken to the DNA \u2019s headquarters , where he was informed of the criminal proceedings against him . The applicant gave a statement to the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . At the DNA \u2019s headquarters , the applicant found out that he had been under investigation for a crime against national security . However , the prosecutor had decided on DATE not to prosecute that offence . The evidence gathered in that investigation , in particular through intercepting the applicant \u2019s telephone , had led the investigators to suspect the commission by the applicant of the crimes of corruption for which he was currently under investigation by the DNA .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor issued an order prohibiting the applicant from leaving town for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s request , on DATE the prosecutor sent him a copy of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor sought , through the Minister of ORG , ORG \u2019s approval to arrest the applicant . On DATE , the DNA issued a press release informing the public that it had sought authorisation for the arrest .", "CARDINAL . From the moment the DNA informed the public about the proceedings against the applicant , the media took great interest in the case . Numerous panel discussions were broadcast and journalists and politicians commented publicly on the events .", "CARDINAL . Excerpts from conversations between the defendants which had been obtained through telephone tapping during a criminal surveillance operation conducted prior to the criminal prosecution made it into the newspapers before the applicant and his co - accused had been committed for trial . Those excerpts gave the impression that the applicant and Judge PERSON had tried to manipulate some of the judges from the panel ruling in a commercial case involving ORG , and had reported back to the latter on the progress of those alleged manoeuvres . In the conversations among them , the applicant and the codefendants expressed in strong terms their disappointment that the outcome had not been favourable to ORG , and made assumptions as to whether the remaining judges on the panel had been influenced by someone else .", "CARDINAL . The transcripts of telephone conversations intercepted during the surveillance operation first appeared in the press DATE .", "CARDINAL . Other pieces of evidence from the prosecution file were likewise published and commented on in the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG met to discuss the prosecutor \u2019s request . The applicant was unable to take part in the session , as he was in the hospital at the time . The ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . Upon obtaining the ORG \u2019s approval , the prosecutor submitted a detention order to ORG and ORG , which examined it in private on DATE and endorsed it . The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court then took a statement from the applicant and proceeded to examine the prosecutor \u2019s application for the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention . It heard arguments from the parties , reviewed the evidence presented by the prosecutor and concluded that there were serious indications and evidence in the file that the applicant had committed the crimes of which he was accused and that he had abused his important official position , thereby damaging the reputation of the legislature and the judiciary , as well as undermining the public \u2019s trust in the judicial system . It therefore considered that the specific danger that the applicant posed to the public order was serious enough to justify his detention .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , by a final decision of DATE ORG , sitting as a ninejudge bench , upheld the previous decision . At the applicant \u2019s request , this hearing was held in secret and journalists and the public were removed from the courtroom . ORG found that the evidence lawfully included in the file justified a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crimes under investigation . It also dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument as to procedural flaws , in so far as it found that the prosecutor had heard the applicant on DATE and considered that his right to mount a defence had not been disregarded because of the mere fact that a certain lapse of time had passed between the date of his statement and that of the arrest order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought his conditional release . On DATE ORG dismissed his application , on the grounds that the evidence in the file indicated that he had tried to influence one of the witnesses and to create false evidence in his defence . It also considered that the reasons underlying the court decision to place him in pre - trial detention were still valid , given that , in particular , such a short time had passed since that decision .", "This decision became final on DATE , when ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The High Court examined the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on CARDINAL more occasions and the applicant repeatedly applied for release pending trial conditioned on the obligation not to leave town ( decisions of DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) .", "ORG considered that the evidence in the file offered a reasonable indication that the applicant had committed the crimes he was accused of and that his continued detention was needed given the difficulty involved in investigating such crimes . It also referred to his attempt to influence witnesses , to his personal situation ( first time on trial , family situation ) , his personality , his office during the alleged commission of the offences , and the nature and severity of the crimes under investigation . ORG also took into account the fact that the proceedings on the merits had only recently started , on DATE .", "It referred to ORG case - law and the relevant ORG texts , and considered that the grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention were still valid and the time spent in pre - trial detention was not excessive within the meaning of LAW .", "For these reasons , it did not consider it opportune to substitute the preventive measure that had been applied with a less strict measure .", "CARDINAL . The appeals lodged by the applicant against each of these court orders were dismissed by a different panel of ORG on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined a new application for release on probation lodged by the applicant and decided that he could be released . It held that the vast majority of the evidence for the prosecution had already been heard in court , thus the risk of the applicant trying to influence witnesses was no longer acute . The court ordered him not to leave town and not to contact his co - accused .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the decision was quashed and a fivejudge panel of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for release . ORG examined the suitability of releasing \u2019s case - law on the subject . It considered that the severity of the crimes allegedly committed and the particular circumstances in which they had occurred , coupled with the applicant \u2019s attempts to influence a witness , were sufficient factors to justify extending the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial , which remained the only adequate preventive measure . It also considered that the overall length of the measure remained reasonable in the applicant \u2019s particular situation .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL more occasions ( DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE and DATE ) ORG was called to examine the necessity of keeping the applicant in detention and each time it decided to release him pending trial for the same reasons as those advanced on DATE . ORG replaced the measure with the obligation not to leave town .", "However , each order , save for DATE , was quashed by a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG and the applicant \u2019s detention was extended ( on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the prosecutor against the court order of CARDINAL DATE .", "As a consequence , the applicant was released from detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE and remained in pretrial detention until DATE . He described the overall conditions of his detention as follows : it was very cold in the cell , hot water was only available for TIME a week and basic hygiene was lacking . He had to share a QUANTITY . m cell with CARDINAL other inmates and the lack of space triggered violent clashes within the cell .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted a full record of the applicant \u2019s stay in prison , giving details of the cells the applicant was kept in , their occupancy and the facilities offered . According to this information , the applicant was held in FAC . CARDINAL ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) on DATE and again from CARDINAL DATE to DATE . He was held in CARDINAL separate cells , CARDINAL of QUANTITY m with CARDINAL beds and another of QUANTITY m with CARDINAL beds . The cells were at full occupancy at that time . Each cell was equipped with beds , a table , chairs , a squat toilet , a sink with cold and hot water and a shower separated from the living space by a curtain . The inmates cleaned the cell themselves with products provided by the administration or purchased by them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant described these cells as badly lit and ventilated , humid and foul smelling . He further explained that because the toilet was not partitioned off from the beds , the inmates lacked privacy when using it . The tap for washing dishes and clothes and for showering was placed above the toilet and the water ran straight into the toilet . There was frequently no running water at all , which rendered it impossible to flush the toilet . The hot water was never sufficient for all of the inmates to take showers .", "CARDINAL . The records show that from DATE to DATE the applicant was held in ORG in a hospital room measuring CARDINAL sq . m which was equipped with CARDINAL beds and had access to hot water DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant spent the remainder of his pre - trial detention in LOC , where he was held , at his request and because of his position as a senator , in a cell for vulnerable individuals . The cell measured QUANTITY . m , had CARDINAL bunk beds and was at full occupancy at that time . The cell had a window which allowed in natural light and ventilation . The detainees had at their disposal a table , benches , shelves and a TV set . Adjacent to the cell there was a bathroom equipped with a toilet , sinks and a shower . Cold water was continually available and hot water was available twice a week . The cell was heated to CARDINALoC during the DATE . The applicant explained that it was very hot in DATE and very cold in DATE ; the heating system was old and broke down frequently , leaving the cells brutally cold . Hot water was scarce and there was never enough for all of the inmates to take showers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transported from ORG to the prosecutor \u2019s office in PERSON and back , a trip of TIME each way . According to the applicant , they left in the TIME from LOC . He was transported in the back of a prison van . Although the outside temperature was CARDINAL , there was no heating in the van ; in addition cold air from outside was able to enter the van through CARDINAL hatches in the roof which could not be closed completely . There was insufficient light in the van because there were no windows in the detainee \u2019s compartment , the only source of light being a small window separating the detainee \u2019s compartment from the driver \u2019s cabin . The applicant , who was alone in the back of the van , had nothing to sit on or lean against , thus having to stand up during the entire journey with nothing to hold on to .", "When the van arrived in PERSON and returned to GPE , he was allowed to stretch , warm up and do some physical exercise .", "CARDINAL . ORG informed the Government that the applicant had been transported in a van designed for transporting QUANTITY people , as follows : CARDINAL people in the forward cabin , QUANTITY detainees on chairs in a separate compartment , and CARDINAL guards in another separate compartment in the back of the van . The van had natural and artificial ventilation , a heating system , and artificial light , which was kept on throughout each journey in order to allow the guards to keep watch over the detainees . The applicant had been transported alone , thus having CARDINAL chairs at his disposal .", "The journey had started at TIME and ended at TIME .", "CARDINAL . In his observations in reply to the official information supplied by ORG , the applicant explained that the back of the van where he had been held had been completely opaque without any natural light and that the artificial lighting and the heating system had not been working . He reiterated that the CARDINAL hatches on the roof had remained open during the journey , resulting in freezing temperatures inside the van . The guards had had blankets to cover themselves during the journey , but he had not been given CARDINAL . In addition , the seats in the detainees\u2019 compartment had not been fitted with safety belts , which had made it difficult to keep his balance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
