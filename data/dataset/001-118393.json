The aim of the demonstration was to draw attention to the issue of corruption in the prosecution service . The number of possible participants was declared as CARDINAL persons . There is no information as to whether any such demonstration was held prior to DATE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG lodged a claim with ORG seeking to restrict the demonstration announced by the applicant . On DATE the court left the above claim without consideration as being submitted too late . ORG resubmitted its claim on DATE with a request for renewal of the time - limit for lodging the claim . DATE the court allowed the request and accepted the claim for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , further to his previous announcement of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant informed ORG about the demonstration to be held on DATE . He thus organised a peaceful demonstration near ORG DATE between TIME and TIME About CARDINAL persons took part . They were standing on the pavement in front of the building of ORG when the police told them that they should remain at a distance of QUANTITY from the building . That would have forced the demonstrators to stand in the road and obstruct the traffic . After some discussion with the police , they crossed the road and stood on a lawn on the opposite side . The police , however , told the demonstrators that they could not stand on the lawn and should move away , which meant standing in the road again and obstructing the traffic , causing temporary traffic - jams .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately afterwards , the applicant was called aside by QUANTITY police officers . They grabbed his arms and took him in the direction of the nearby police station . Some of the demonstrators requested the officers to show them their identification and started filming the incident ; the officers then let the applicant go .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a request by ORG of ORG to prohibit the holding of the pre - announced demonstrations by the applicant \u2019s NGO as from DATE . The decision was appealed against .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he was invited to the police station on the pretext that he had failed to appear at a court hearing to which he had been summoned . Upon his arrival at FAC at TIME , the police accused the applicant of having committed the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration on DATE . TIME the police drew up reports on those administrative offences . The applicant telephoned his lawyer , but the latter was not allowed onto the LOC of the police station . At TIME the applicant was placed in a cell , where he remained without food until TIME on DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before taking him to the court , the police drew up anew the reports on the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration . In their reports they referred to provisions of ORG and to the procedure for organising and holding meetings , rallies , street marches and demonstrations in the city of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE to CARDINAL below ) . The reports were signed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was taken to ORG . He had no opportunity to study the case - file materials before the court hearing . During the hearing , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request to be represented by the lawyer of his choosing on the ground that the applicant was a human - rights defender and could defend himself . The applicant \u2019s request to summon and question witnesses and examine a video made during the events of CARDINAL DATE was also rejected by the court .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the court found the applicant guilty of committing the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police , and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration . The court noted that the applicant had held a street march without the permission of ORG and had ignored the lawful demands of the police to stop breaching the peace . He also refused to follow the police to their station but instead called the participants in the demonstration , who shouted and threatened the officers . The applicant denied all accusations . Having heard the applicant and examined the case - file materials , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s testimony was refuted by the written reports of the police officers and the traffic police officers . The court noted that the said reports had been drawn up correctly and therefore had to be taken into account . It sentenced the applicant to DATE of administrative detention starting from TIME on DATE with reference to the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . In his appeal , he complained that he had been found guilty even though he had not committed the alleged offences . He noted that under LAW a demonstration could be held subject to notifying the authorities and any restrictions on holding one could be imposed only by a court ; no permission had therefore been required . He also noted that he had notified ORG twice about the gathering in question and at the time it was held there had been no court decision prohibiting it . Therefore , he considered that he had organised the gathering of DATE lawfully and the conclusions of the first - instance court that he had \u201c held a meeting without permission of the ORG \u201d had not been based on law as no such permission was required by domestic law . He further challenged the conclusion of the police that he had notified the authorities about the event TIME in advance , claiming that he had already done so on DATE . Furthermore , in his opinion , even the requirement of notification DATE in advance , which had been established by the procedure for organising and holding meetings , rallies , street marches and demonstrations in the city of GPE and to which the police referred in their reports on administrative offences , was not based on law , as ORG in its decision of DATE had decided that the procedure for such notification had to be a matter for legislative regulation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further maintained in his appeal that , in the absence of any lawful restrictions on holding a demonstration , demands by the police to stop such an event could not be considered lawful and the law did not provide for liability for disobeying unlawful demands of police officers . He finally complained that the first - instance court had violated his right to defend himself as it had refused to allow his lawyer to appear in the case on the ground that the applicant was a human - rights defender and therefore able to defend his rights himself .", "CARDINAL . In a supplement to his appeal of DATE , the applicant complained that his punishment violated LAW . Referring to provisions of LAW and CARDINAL ( b - d ) of the LAW , he further complained that his right to defend himself had been violated , and that the first - instance court had refused to question the witnesses and to examine a video record of the peaceful demonstration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer and rejected it . It summarised the findings of the first - instance court and the arguments of the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court noted that the findings of the first - instance court as to the applicant\u2019 \u2019s opinion , were confirmed by the police reports and other explanations and evidence . In reply to the applicant \u2019s arguments to the effect that there had been no corpus delicti in his actions , ORG noted that they should be disregarded , because they were refuted by the body of evidence in the case , without elaborating further on that point .

The judicial practice contains instances of cases restricting the right to peaceful assembly being decided on the basis of the procedure for organising and holding meetings , rallies , street marches and demonstrations laid down by LAW of the GPE of DATE No .

In another case ORG , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , restricted the right of several NGOs and private persons to hold a demonstration on account , in particular , of their failure to notify ORG of their intention DATE in advance . The court referred to LAW . The participants appealed against that judgment . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of the first - instance court . In its decision ORG noted that the CARDINAL Decree conflicted with the LAW as it required the organisers to seek permission to hold a demonstration and authorised the executive authorities to ban such an event , whereas Article CARDINAL of the LAW provided that the authorities should be notified that a demonstration was being planned , and empowered only the judicial authorities to place restrictions on the organisation thereof . It also noted that in its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ORG had not referred to LAW as a normative act which should apply in GPE to the legal relations under consideration . The court also noted that the file contained no documents proving that notification about the demonstration DATE in advance had not allowed the police to ensure public order during the demonstration and that the holding of such an event could create a real risk of riots or crimes or endanger the health of the population and imperil the rights and freedoms of others . It concluded that the judgment of the first - instance court was incompatible with Article CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In another case ORG , in a decision of DATE , quashed the judgment of ORG , which had restricted the freedom of peaceful assembly in respect of a number of political and non - governmental organisations upon an application by ORG . In its decision ORG noted that , in deciding the case , the first - instance court had had regard to the provisions of the CARDINAL Decree , whereas since DATE the question of holding peaceful gatherings had been regulated by LAW . The court further stated that LAW conflicted with the LAW as it provided for a procedure for seeking permission to hold a demonstration and that the Decree concerned the holding of such events in a non - existent country ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , regulated relations between the citizens of the GPE and the executive committees of the NORP of ORG , and considered demonstrations on the basis of their compatibility with LAW GPE , the constitutions of the union and the autonomous GPE , that is , non - existent constitutions of non - existent subjects .
