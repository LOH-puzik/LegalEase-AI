On DATE the ORG confirmed that the proceedings in question had indeed been lengthy . The court stated , inter alia , that on CARDINAL occasions ORG had adjourned hearings without giving reasons for its decision . It further stated that on eight occasions the hearings had lasted TIME , which taking into account the number of co - accused and difficulties in scheduling a date convenient to all the participants , was proof of bad organisation of the proceedings on the part of ORG . Furthermore , the court held that on numerous occasions hearings had been adjourned as some of the co \u2013 accused had participated on these dates in another set of proceedings or because prison authorities had been given too short notice to organise transport of the accused from a remand centre to the courtroom .

Finally , ORG stated that the intervals between the hearings had been too significant ; in particular on CARDINAL occasion ORG had adjourned a hearing for DATE without submitting exceptional reasons for its decision as required by the code of criminal procedure .
