AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a non - profit - making association with its seat in GPE .", "It is represented before the ORG by Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant association has the aims of , inter alia , creating accommodation for socially disadvantaged persons , of speaking out for the concerns of socially disadvantaged persons , refugees and foreign workers , and of creating possibilities of encounter and exchange with these persons . In order to achieve these objectives it runs a house in GPE , which offers accommodation for socially disadvantaged persons in particular for young people and foreigners . The chairman of the applicant association is also living there .", "On DATE , in the late evening , police officers carried out a control in this house .", "On DATE the applicant association lodged a complaint with ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) alleging violations of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and of ORG zum PERSON des Hausrechts ) .", "ORG held hearings on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . It heard the chairman of the applicant association , the police officers who had carried out the control and the mayor of GPE as witnesses .", "On DATE ORG partly rejected the applicant association \u2019s complaint as being inadmissible and party dismissed it as being unfounded .", "Having regard to the evidence taken , it found the following facts established . Following a number of complaints from neighbours about illegally resident foreigners , the mayor of GPE requested ORG ( Bezirkshaupt - mannschaft ) to carry out a control under ORG ( Meldegesetz ) . The control was carried out in TIME of CARDINAL DATE . The police officers were let into the house by some of the inhabitants . The chairman of the applicant association criticised TIME of the control but did not otherwise object . He contributed to the smooth carrying out of the control in that he went around with the police officers , gave general information about the inhabitants ( e.g. about their country of origin ) , acted as a translator and helped to produce the required documents . The rooms within the house were opened upon request . The police examined whether the foreigners were legally resident by controlling their identity documents and residence permits , or by checking the status of their asylum proceedings . A search of the rooms was not carried out . The control was terminated within DATE .", "ORG found that the applicant association , being a legal person , did not have a private and family life . Thus it could not rely on LAW . Moreover , it had not claimed , and there was no indication , of any interference with its right to respect for its correspondence . Accordingly this complaint had to be rejected as being inadmissible .", "As regards the control , ORG noted that also a legal person could rely on ORG . However , the said LAW only applied where a search had been carried out . As the police officers were voluntarily granted access to the house as well as to each of the rooms within the house and , assisted by the applicant association \u2019s chairman , only controlled the documents of the inhabitants , the contested action could not be qualified as a search . ORG added that the protection afforded by LAW went further , in that it covered not only a search of LOC but any interference with the right to respect for one \u2019s home . In the present case the control was in conformity with LAW , in particular it had its legal basis in ORG ) and LAW ( Fremdenpolizeigesetz ) . Consequently , the complaint had to be dismissed as being unfounded .", "Further , ORG found that the applicant association , as a legal person , could not rely on LAW and , therefore , rejected this complaint as being inadmissible .", "Finally , as to the complaint under LAW , ORG found that the control at issue was not aimed at the applicant association but at the inhabitants of the housing project , who were not even necessarily members of the applicant association . Moreover , the control did not prevent the applicant association from pursuing its objectives . Even assuming that there had been an interference with the applicant association \u2019s freedom of association , it had to be regarded as necessary in the interests of public safety . Having regard to the short duration of the control , it was also proportionate . Thus , this complaint was also unfounded .", "On DATE the applicant association lodged a complaint with ORG ) . It relied on LAW . It argued that the control carried out in its premises had to be qualified as a search and that it lacked a legal basis . Further , it relied on LAW , claiming that the search prevented it from pursuing its objectives .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant association \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success . It noted that the case was not excluded from the jurisdiction of ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) . Subsequently the Constitutional Court , upon the applicant association \u2019s request , referred the case to ORG .", "On DATE the applicant association , upon ORG request , supplemented its complaint . It repeated its argument that the control had to be qualified as a search which lacked a legal basis , and added that there had not been any reasonable suspicion that foreigners were illegally resident on the LOC .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant association \u2019s complaint as being inadmissible . It noted that the association relied on the right to respect for its home . This was a constitutionally guaranteed right which ORG was not called upon to review . The decision was served on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
