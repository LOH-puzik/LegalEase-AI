The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . The first CARDINAL applicants are the parents , the third applicant is the brother and the fourth applicant is the fianc\u00e9e of PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was born in DATE and started doing his compulsory military service on CARDINAL DATE in the city of GPE . At that time he had no known health problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was examined by a doctor at his regiment and the doctor decided to refer him to a hospital specialising in infectious diseases . On DATE a doctor who examined him at his regiment \u2019s infirmary referred him to ORG ( \u201c The University Hospital \u201d ) for suspected hepatitis or meningoencephalitis . The following day PERSON was sent to the hospital in GPE where , after a number of examinations were conducted , he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis ( acute liver failure ) . A decision was taken on DATE to send him to PERSON in GPE for a liver transplant operation . On arrival at the hospital in GPE TIME he was put in the intensive care unit .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE he died at FAC . No autopsy was performed .", "CARDINAL . An investigation was carried out at the military unit where GPE G\u00fcltekin had been doing his military service . On DATE a total of CARDINAL military personnel who knew or had had dealings with PERSON were questioned by their superiors .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY military personnel all stated that PERSON had spoken to his commanding officer on DATE and told him that a friend of his had hepatitis and that he had suspected that he might also have contracted the same disease . His superior had then transferred him to the regiment \u2019s infirmary where tests had been conducted , establishing that he did not have hepatitis .", "CARDINAL . One of the QUANTITY military personnel was the doctor who had examined PERSON in the regiment \u2019s infirmary on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The doctor stated that on DATE To\u011fay ORG had come to see him because he had been feeling unwell and the colour of his urine had been darker than usual . He had then sent PERSON for a urine examination and when he had got the results back he had noticed a problem . DATE he had asked for PERSON to be referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The military officers who carried out the investigation concluded , on the basis of the statements referred to above , that the military authorities had acted in accordance with their duties when providing medical assistance to PERSON and that there had been no fault attributable to them in his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants initiated compensation proceedings against ORG before ORG ( \u201c the Military Administrative Court \u201d ) . They argued , in particular , that PERSON had not received prompt or adequate medical care in his regiment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted in their petition that , according to the official documents in their possession , PERSON had been examined by a doctor attached to his regiment on DATE and that the doctor had recommended his transfer to a hospital specialising in infectious diseases . Nevertheless , the military authorities had not followed that recommendation . When his condition had deteriorated he had been examined by another doctor at the regiment on DATE . However , that doctor had not sought to obtain blood or urine tests and had sent him back to his military unit . When PERSON condition had deteriorated even further on DATE , he had been examined once again and this time a urine test had been carried out . The doctor who had evaluated the results of the test had considered that PERSON might have hepatitis or meningoencephalitis and had asked for him to be referred to hospital . Nevertheless , PERSON had still not been transferred to the hospital promptly and only the following day had he been put on a bus and sent to the hospital . The applicants argued that it had been these inordinate delays that had caused PERSON death . They pointed out that GPE G\u00fcltekin had been performing his military service and had thus not had the opportunity to leave his military unit and seek medical assistance of his own volition . Therefore , the authorities had been under an obligation to protect his well - being and to ensure timely medical treatment for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted its observations to ORG . Based on the testimonies of the soldiers from the same regiment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , it argued that on DATE PERSON had seen his superior and told his commanding officer that his friend had contracted hepatitis and that he suspected that he himself might have been infected as well . A blood test had been conducted , but the results had not revealed any abnormalities .", "CARDINAL . ORG alleged that PERSON had not gone to the infirmary DATE and DATE , but accepted that he had been examined by a doctor at the regiment \u2019s infirmary on DATE and then sent back to his military unit . It maintained that the military authorities had not acted in a negligent fashion when dealing with PERSON medical problems .", "CARDINAL . In their replies to ORG the applicants submitted that there was no evidence to show that a blood test had been carried out on DATE . They also referred to the medical reports and stated that it had been clearly indicated in the records that PERSON had seen the doctor at the infirmary on DATE and that his referral to an infectious diseases clinic had been decided by that doctor .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings ORG appointed CARDINAL medical experts , namely CARDINAL professors and an associate professor from the infectious diseases department of ORG , in order to clarify whether the military authorities had acted negligently . The medical experts reached the following conclusion in their report of DATE :", "\u201c ... An examination of the documents and other information in the file shows that PERSON started his military service on DATE . On DATE he was treated for a retractile testicle at ORG . On DATE he was prescribed medication at the regiment \u2019s infirmary for an upper respiratory tract infection . On DATE the regimental infirmary doctor decided to refer him to ORG infectious diseases department , but that was not done . On DATE he was diagnosed with and treated for an infection of the upper respiratory tract . On DATE he was referred to ORG with suspected hepatitis and he was sent there . On DATE he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis . On DATE he was transferred to ORG in Haydarpa\u015fa where he died on DATE as a result of fulminant hepatitis .", "CARDINAL of the causes of fulminant hepatitis are hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus . Hepatitis A may be contracted by drinking contaminated water and by eating raw vegetables and fruits . Hepatitis B spreads through sexual contact , or by coming into contact with infected blood by sharing personal items such as toothbrushes , razors , or needles . Military service , in itself , does not pose a special risk for hepatitis contamination .", "Having examined the medical reports in the file , we consider it very likely that the first symptoms regarding PERSON disease became obvious on DATE and his condition then deteriorated for DATE until his death . The first symptoms of the liver disease ( acute liver failure ) which is caused by hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses include tiredness and general complaints which are not specific to any of the organs . They can be similar to the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection . Only after developing typical symptoms , such as jaundice , does it become easier to diagnose .", "The disease caused by these CARDINAL viruses ( hepatitis ) can be more serious in adults . According to the medical reports in the file , PERSON was contaminated with both hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses within a short period of time and his liver was infected with both viruses at the same time . This is a condition which worsens the damage to the liver and increases the risk of fulminant hepatitis ( fast - deteriorating acute liver failure ) . The mortality rate of fulminant hepatitis is PERCENT within DATE ; a liver transplant is the sole method of ensuring patient survival . Normally , the patient would be kept in hospital under close observation .", "Having taken cognisance of the documents in the file , we have not established any delays , fault or negligence in the medical treatment provided to PERSON at the infirmary of his regiment , at ORG or at FAC in Haydarpa\u015fa . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an objection to this report . They maintained that the authorities had acted negligently as they had delayed PERSON ORG \u2019s transfer to hospital . Referring to the medical reports in the file , the applicants stated that although the doctor at the regiment had decided to refer PERSON to an infectious diseases clinic on DATE , the military authorities had failed to comply with the doctor \u2019s decision until DATE . The applicants also asked ORG to obtain an additional medical expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . In its decision the court relied on the medical expert report summarised above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , and concluded that no fault could be attributed to the authorities for PERSON death . No mention was made in the decision of the ORG complaint regarding the failure to transfer PERSON to hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a request for rectification of ORG decision and argued , inter alia , that if , as alleged , PERSON had told his commanding officer on DATE that he might have been infected with hepatitis ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , his superior should have taken it seriously and referred him to hospital . However , there were no records showing that any action had been taken . They also pointed out that their complaints did not relate to the period following PERSON transfer to the hospital , but to the authorities\u2019 negligence in failing to refer PERSON to hospital DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the rectification request lodged by the applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
