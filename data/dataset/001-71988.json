The applicant 's husband also moved out after the separation and returned to his parents ' house .", "CARDINAL . Ever since the spouses ' separation in DATE , the applicant 's daughter lived with her father and his parents who looked after her but she also spent short periods of time with the applicant . In particular , during DATE she spent DATE in PERSON , where the applicant , her boyfriend and his parents looked after her . The child visited the applicant again , in PERSON and in her apartment in PERSON . The frequency of those meetings is unknown .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant 's husband brought an action against her seeking alimony payments for the upbringing of their daughter . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay alimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG pronounced the couple 's divorce . The court approved the parties ' agreement according to which the applicant would have custody of their daughter but the child would remain with her father until DATE since she attended an elementary school in the area of the father 's home . The agreement further stated that the child would move in with the applicant at TIME on DATE . Thereafter , the father would take the child to his home DATE and also for DATE during CARDINAL or DATE periods . The father undertook to pay alimony .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant saw her child often and spent time with her , including in the village PERSON According to PERSON , a psychiatrist who held therapeutic sessions with the child in DATE and DATE , the father 's report that the child had returned tense and worried from some of those meetings was plausible since the child had been frustrated from the fact that her wish to be with both parents and to have all her mother 's attention and affection had not realised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an argument erupted when the applicant , accompanied by her boyfriend and her lawyer , came to collect her daughter . The child was terrorised and refused to leave . It appears that from that moment on , all meetings between the applicant and her daughter were very short and often in the presence of other persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted enforcement proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge sent a summons to the applicant 's former husband inviting him to appear on DATE . The summons was not served for reasons which are unclear . In a statement made later , the enforcement judge stated that the father was hiding .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the enforcement judge appointed medical experts to examine the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the inactivity of the enforcement judge . On DATE ORG examined the applicant 's appeal against delays in the enforcement proceedings and found that there had been unjustified delays . In particular , insufficient efforts had been made to summon the father . Apparently implying that the failure to serve the summons was difficult to understand , ORG remarked that the mother of the applicant 's former husband , in whose house the child lived with her father , worked as clerical staff of ORG . The court ordered the enforcement judge to speed up the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge invited a representative of the social services in PERSON to attend the hearings in the enforcement proceedings . On DATE the applicant wrote to the social services seeking their assistance and asking them to establish the circumstances in which her daughter lived with her father . That prompted an inquiry by Mr PERSON , an employee of the social services , which were also in charge of matters of protection of children . PERSON conducted an inquiry into the conditions in which the applicant 's daughter lived and the social circumstances of the applicant and on DATE drew up a report . PERSON stated in his report that , inter alia , the applicant lived with her sister and their father in PERSON in a CARDINAL - room apartment in good conditions . At that time the applicant had been a student in a school for medical personnel . During DATE she worked in her boyfriend 's restaurant in the village PERSON also described as good the conditions in the father 's home , where the child lived .

She did not want to live in the village Z.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge attempted again to summon the father for DATE . The officer responsible for serving the summons was given CARDINAL addresses for the respondent father . However , the officer noted that the father could not be located at either address and , according to a neighbour , had left on holidays .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant filed another appeal against the delays in the enforcement proceedings which was examined on DATE by ORG . The court found that insufficient efforts had been made to locate the respondent and that attempts should be made to summon him at his place of work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an attempt was made to serve a summons on the respondent father ordering him to appear on DATE . For that purpose , CARDINAL court officers and a police officer visited CARDINAL addresses indicated by the applicant including her former husband 's workplace . It was established that he was on holidays until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the father was eventually found at his address and summoned to appear before the enforcement judge to transfer the custody of the child on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the applicant sent several complaints to the local prosecutor , to the police and other institutions seeking assistance and police protection for her daughter . The police replied that the case did not fall within the scope of the regulations on police protection of children as there was no indication that the child had disappeared or was in danger . On DATE the applicant 's former husband received a police warning to comply with his obligation to transfer the custody of the child . In DATE and DATE , upon the applicant 's complaints that the father was hiding , the local prosecuting office conducted an inquiry . The father , his parents and the applicant were questioned and visits were made to their homes . On DATE the prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings . On an unspecified date the mother of the applicant 's former husband complained to the local prosecutor that the applicant 's lawyer had repeatedly disturbed them in their home and had used offensive language . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer received a police warning to abstain from threatening the family of the applicant 's former husband . According to statements made later by persons involved in the proceedings , offensive remarks and groundless allegations were not uncommon in the complaints submitted by the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's former husband submitted to the enforcement judge a request that PERSON , a psychiatrist who had monitored his daughter 's health , be present during the transfer of custody on DATE . He enclosed a certificate dated DATE issued by the psychiatrist . PERSON had seen the child in DATE and DATE as the father had noted that his daughter had become nervous , had no appetite , could not sleep well , tended to remain alone and cried . That was apparently caused by the changes in the child 's life as a result of her separation from \u201c part of her family circle \u201d . Having held therapeutic sessions with the child , the psychiatrist stated that an improvement was noted . However , the psychiatrist considered that it was essential to avoid future situations which could cause psychological trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested further psychiatric examinations of the child . She also stated that a paediatrician and Mr. PERSON , the employee of the local social service who had previously seen her daughter , should also be present during the transfer of custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge heard the applicant , her former husband , the child , PERSON , PERSON and the parties ' lawyers .

According to the minutes , the child stated that she wanted to be with her mother , but also wanted to be with her father and preferred to stay with her father and to pay visits to her mother .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , the psychiatrist , stated that the child needed to spend more time with her mother and that favourable conditions had to be created so as to avoid any traumatic incidents for the child , who was suffering as a result of the conflict between her parents . The child needed to receive more affectionate attention from her mother . Changes in the child 's home and school environment could be dangerous . PERSON also expressed the view that the child was not sufficiently prepared for the transfer of custody and should not be forced .", "CARDINAL . Mr K , the social services employee , stated that the child was not at risk with her father . She enjoyed a good social environment and her situation would continue to be monitored by the social services .", "CARDINAL . The father 's lawyer stated that an assessment should be made of the applicant 's ability to provide satisfactory conditions for her daughter .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement judge instructed PERSON and PERSON to provide additional information in writing before DATE and adjourned the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant complained to the health authorities about PERSON , to the social services about Mr PERSON , to the police about her former husband and to ORG about the enforcement judge . The applicant alleged that her daughter 's expressed reluctance to come with her had been the result of psychological manipulation and the administration of drugs on her by the enforcement judge and other persons . In her view , the enforcement judge should have immediately proceeded to handing the child to her . The applicant also filed a formal appeal against the adjournment of the proceedings and requested the recusal of the enforcement judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON submitted a written opinion in which he stated that in his view the child , despite her low age , had grown to understand that her parents had separated and had formed a clear opinion in favour of staying with her father . She also wanted to see her mother more often . PERSON also confirmed that the child lived in good conditions with her father and grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the psychiatrist , filed additional assessments . She stated , inter alia , that the child 's condition improved as she gradually adjusted to the circumstances . However , it was of utmost importance that the parents maintained better relations , which would allow a possibility for the child to see her mother more often . The child needed her mother 's care and affection . At the same time any changes in the child 's environment must be very carefully prepared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the delay in the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that there were no undue delays in the proceedings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period the applicant made several visits to her daughter 's elementary school . In her submission , she could not see her daughter at the home of her former husband as he had threatening behaviour and did not allow normal contacts . His parents allegedly used offensive language against her . According to statements made by the applicant 's former husband before the relevant authorities , the applicant seldom sought contact with her daughter , was unable to demonstrate affection for her and tried to achieve the enforcement of the court order through legal means only , as a result of which the child was repeatedly confronted with representatives of the authorities and with the applicant 's lawyer and thus suffered stressful situations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her lawyer visited the elementary school attended by the applicant 's daughter , with the apparent intention to collect her . The applicant 's daughter started crying and explained to the teacher that she did not want to go . The applicant was upset by her daughter 's reaction . On DATE the applicant 's former husband complained to the prosecution authorities and to the local Bar against the behaviour of the applicant 's lawyer , who had allegedly made repeated visits to his daughter 's school and had insisted that the child be given to the applicant . In his written opinion given later , PERSON , the social service employee who worked on the applicant 's case , stated that the presence of the applicant 's lawyer and the applicant 's boyfriend had negative effect on the meetings between the applicant and her daughter .", "CARDINAL . It appears that an attempt to summon the applicant 's former husband at DATE or DATE was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a hearing in the enforcement proceedings was scheduled for DATE . The applicant complained , stating that this long delay was unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , her former husband , their daughter , their lawyers , CARDINAL employees of the child protection service and a police officer appeared before the enforcement judge . Apparently with the aim to put pressure to bear on the authorities , the applicant invited journalists from the local television station and the press who came with their cameras .", "CARDINAL . The judge spoke to the child and told her that she would live with her mother . The child stated that she did not want to go with her mother and , according to testimony given later by PERSON , one of the social service employees , uttered rude words at her . Thereupon , the judge decided that the applicant should be left alone with her daughter for TIME . When the hearing resumed the child still refused to go . The social service employees expressed the view that there was no valid reason why the applicant should not have the custody of her daughter . The enforcement judge decided that the applicant could take her daughter home in execution of the custody agreement . The hearing was closed .", "CARDINAL . As the parties walked out of the courtroom , the applicant 's former husband grabbed the child and ran away . A police officer who was present did not intervene .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to the prosecution authorities about the enforcement judge and the police . By decisions of CARDINAL and DATE they refused to open criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the father had taken the child away .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant 's request , the enforcement judge renewed the efforts to transfer the custody of the applicant 's daughter to her . On DATE ORG issued directions regarding the enforcement proceedings . On an unspecified date the applicant 's former husband appealed against the acts of the enforcement judge , arguing that the proceedings should be terminated as the custody of the child had already been transferred on DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , considering that the enforcement proceedings could continue as the father had unlawfully taken his daughter away from her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's former husband instituted proceedings before ORG for a revision of the custody and contact measures , seeking the custody of his daughter ( see the chronology of those proceedings in paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . He also requested a stay in the enforcement proceedings . On DATE that request was refused on grounds that a stay of execution would constitute a de facto partial revision of the custody measures while any decision on the matter had to cover all relevant aspects , including contact arrangements . The court also stated that the execution of the DATE custody agreement would not prejudge the matter or otherwise impede the execution of any custody order that may be issued in the revision proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Apparently in reaction to the applicant 's complaints against several judges , on an unspecified date all of the enforcement judges at ORG withdrew from the case , which was then transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant 's complaints to ORG and in reaction to other complaints concerning other persons , on DATE , the ORG appointed a CARDINAL - member commission to examine the work of the local agencies in GPE and ORG . The commission conducted meetings with several persons and examined documentary material . On an unspecified date in DATE it delivered a report in which it stated , inter alia , that in the applicant 's case PERSON , the local social service employee , had only had CARDINAL meetings with the child , that his conversations with the parents had not been documented , that a psychologist had never met the child and that more could be done to facilitate the enforcement of the judicial order on the custody of the child . The commission further stated that the delays in the enforcement proceedings had complicated and exacerbated the situation . The commission recommended , inter alia , the elaboration of a plan for meetings between the child and the parents in the presence of a social service employee and more active involvement of the agency employees in the efforts to facilitate the enforcement of the judicial order , including issuing directions to the father in case of non - compliance on his part .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained that the custody agreement had not been enforced and that the recommendations of ORG had not been followed .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the enforcement proceedings were transferred to ORG . A hearing was listed for DATE . The applicant was busy with her studies and was unable to attend . The case was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her former husband appeared before the enforcement judge . As the father had not brought the child , the parties and the enforcement judge went to the father 's home . The judge , the applicant and the child had a conversation . The child refused to follow her mother . On DATE the judge imposed a fine of MONEY ( \u201c BGN \u201d ) on the father on the ground that he had failed to abide by his obligation to prepare the child for the transfer of custody . The father was instructed to do so before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the enforcement judge imposed additional fines on the applicant 's former husband for failure to abide by a final judgment . The total amount of the fines was ORG CARDINAL ( MONEY ) . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the fine had not been enforced . On an unspecified date the applicant 's former husband appealed against the fine stating , inter alia , that the applicant had been unavailable for DATE which had impeded the preparation of the child for the transfer .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement judge listed a hearing for DATE , with the purpose to effect the transfer of custody . The father and the child did not appear . The judge adjourned the matter . On DATE the applicant complained of delays in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement judge scheduled the transfer of custody for DATE . The applicant 's former husband did not comply . On DATE he was ordered to pay another fine of BGN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's former husband reported to the local social services that his daughter did not want to live with her mother and stated that he would not force her . On DATE the social service conducted an inquiry and recommended that it was in the interest of the child to see her mother more often .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period the applicant saw her daughter several times when she visited her at her elementary school . In the applicant 's submission , since DATE she has been prevented from seeing her daughter or speaking to her on the telephone . In his submissions to the relevant authorities , the applicant 's former husband repeatedly stated that the applicant was calling seldom and did not come to see her daughter . In its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ORG , having heard several witnesses and examined documentary material , including all complaints submitted by the parties to various authorities and the files opened by the prosecuting authorities , found that the applicant had sought contacts with her daughter , but that her allegation that her former husband had prevented those contacts was groundless . The tense relations between the parents had been the main obstacle to normal contacts between the applicant and her daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG stating that on DATE she had visited her daughter at her school , whereupon her former husband had appeared , shouting offensive expressions . He had hit her and threatened to batter her if she continued seeing their daughter . On DATE the applicant 's former husband was summoned by the police and was ordered to cease obstructing the exercise of the applicant 's parental rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the assistance of the social services for securing her right to meet her daughter . A meeting was organised on DATE between the applicant and her daughter in the presence of PERSON , employee of the social service , at the LOC of the social service . The meeting ended at the request of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's former husband instituted proceedings under LAW before ORG for a revision of the custody and contact measures , seeking the custody of his daughter . A judge at ORG in PERSON examined the file on DATE and scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearings listed for DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE could not proceed as the applicant had not been summoned properly . She had not been found at her address in PERSON . The attempts to notify the summons to her at the address of her boyfriend in the village PERSON , where she apparently moved in DATE , were also unsuccessful . The lawyer of the applicant 's former husband alleged that the mayor of the village obstructed the efforts to summon the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was held on DATE . The applicant sought a stay of the proceedings pending the outcome of her application to ORG . That was refused . The court commissioned a report on the child 's living conditions at his father 's place and the applicant 's living conditions . The next hearing was listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the social services in PERSON submitted to ORG their report on the parents ' living conditions . At the hearing on DATE the court admitted the report and other evidence . The hearing was adjourned until DATE to allow the examination of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard several witnesses and decided to commission a report on the child 's psychological state , sensitivities and attitude towards her parents . The report was submitted to the court in DATE . The court held a hearing on DATE . The psychologists who had drawn up the report and an employee of the social services were heard . The last hearing in the case was held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG revised the custody measures as agreed upon by the parties in DATE and granted the custody of the child to the applicant 's former husband . The applicant was granted the right to take her daughter home DATE and for DATE during DATE periods .", "DATE . The judgment contained detailed reasoning . The court noted that in accordance with LAW a change of circumstances could justify a revision of the custody and contact measures and examined all events since DATE . The court stated that the custody dispute had to be decided primarily on the basis of the best interest of the child . It noted that according to the report of the psychologists , the child had suffered distress as a result of her separation from her mother but had stabilised with the passage of time . She loved her mother , did not express negative attitudes towards her and it was in her interest to see her more often and to restore normal contacts with her . However , the child felt safe and well in her current environment , where her father and her grandparents looked after her . She developed well and was offered good living conditions . A new change of environment would have a negative effect on the child 's development . The court further took into consideration that the child had repeatedly expressed her preference for staying with her father . The court rejected as unproven the applicant 's allegation that the father had been aggressive and had prevented the applicant from seeing her daughter . The main obstacle to the contacts between the applicant and her daughter had been the extremely tense relations between the parents who had filed numerous complaints against each other . That atmosphere was harmful for the child .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on an unspecified date in DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . The applicant filed an appeal on points of law . As of DATE the case was pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Civil Procedure DATE , which governs , inter alia , execution of final judgments , does not contain provisions setting out rules specifically applicable to transfer of custody of children .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG set out several guiding principles in its interpretative decree No . CARDINAL ( CARDINALPPVS ) . According to these principles , the enforcement judge should organise the physical transfer of custody without delay but should act with care and seek where necessary the assistance of local social services . The interests of the child are paramount . The child should not be coerced but should be prepared for the change so as to avoid psychological trauma . Each case must be treated on an individual basis , with due regard to the child 's age , personal circumstances and emotional links with his or her parents . All possible methods of persuasion must be exhausted . Parents should be warned that refusal to co - operate may result in a modification of custody and contact orders . Police assistance should be used as a last resort , and only where the interests of the child require immediate execution . In exceptional cases , where the custody order has not been enforced for a long time and the relevant circumstances have changed , the enforcement judge may adjourn the case and propose to the competent court to re - examine the custody order . In cases where a parent 's refusal to comply constitutes a criminal offence , the matter should be referred to the prosecution authorities .", "CARDINAL . An enforcement judge has no power to order preparatory meetings , provisional contact arrangements or other measures with a view to achieve transfer of child custody if they are not provided for expressly in the judicial decision to be enforced . A parent considering that a change of circumstances requires a revision of the custody and contact measures fixed in a judicial decision may bring proceedings under LAW for revision of custody and contact measures . In such proceedings all relevant matters may be decided , including the use of the family home ( Decision No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an amendment to LAW ( new Article CARDINALa ) provided that in child custody cases the enforcement judge should apply the provisions concerning execution of orders to fulfil a particular act ( LAW seq . ) . According to those provisions , the only possible method of coercion is the imposition of fines on the debtor . It appears that in practice the guiding principles set out in LAW DATE are considered still valid after DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW , in force since DATE , empowers ORG and local social services to act in situations of children whose wellbeing is under threat or whose rights are violated . The ORG has supervisory functions , whereas the local social services are in charge of concrete cases . In cases of children at risk , the social services may seek police protection for the child and initiate proceedings with a view to placing the child with a foster family or into public care . Social service employees take part in all judicial proceedings affecting children 's rights , in defence of the child 's interest . In all cases where the child 's rights are at stake , the social services may intervene through measures such as counselling and assistance and may also issue binding directions ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) . It appears , however , that there is no practice of issuing binding directions by the social services on questions relating to the enforcement of child custody judgments . It is considered that in such matters the judicial authorities are in charge . The social services have no power to order preparatory meetings or provisional contact arrangements that are not provided for expressly in a judicial decision .", "CARDINAL .
