NORP The applicant company is a limited liability company which at the material time carried on a business of buying debts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company instituted civil proceedings before ORG ( PERSON ) against ORG ( ORG ) . The applicant company had agreed to buy from CARDINAL hospitals the debts owed by ORG to the hospitals in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) provided that the company won its case against the ORG . The applicant company sought payment of the above - mentioned sum together with interest , which amounted to ORG ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The hospitals claimed that the ORG should be liable for paying the cost of medical treatment that had exceeded the contract that every hospital had negotiated with the ORG but which had been necessarily sustained by them in providing medical services to insured persons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company also asked for exemption from court fees , submitting that it had been involved in several court disputes in order to claim debts for medical services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly allowed the claim and exempted the company from court fees in excess of PLN MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The court examined the profit generated by the company and found that the assets deposited in its bank account amounted to ORG CARDINAL . Moreover , in DATE the president of the board had received ORG CARDINAL as payment for an unknown service . The court thus concluded that the company had been able to pay this amount of court fees without damaging its operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action . The court agreed with the arguments of the defendant , who had refused liability for costs in excess of the amounts agreed in the contracts between the ORG and the hospitals . The court established that the contracts had not been renegotiated and had remained valid , which excluded the ORG \u2019s liability for expenses sustained by the hospitals that exceeded the contracts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to pay a further PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL in court fees for pursuing its appeal . On DATE the applicant company applied for an exemption from those fees , claiming that the company had already been exempted from fees and should not be ordered to pay any more at the appeal stage . In its supplementary documents the applicant company submitted that the company did not have the required sum of money in its bank account and that previously it had had to borrow from a private individual . The company was small and new on the market , thus it would not be able to obtain a bank loan . In sum it had not been possible for it to pay a further ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the refusal to exempt it from court fees would amount to a violation of its right to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for exemption from the court fees . The court established that the DATE turnover of the company had reached ORG ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) although in its bank account it only had CARDINAL . The court , in CARDINAL point of its reasoned decision , found that the company had generated over ORG CARDINAL gross income ( przych\u00f3d ) , but it had then taken this amount to be net profit ( doch\u00f3d ) . The court also acknowledged that the applicant company had declared costs and expenses in the amount of MONEY , and thus generated a net loss . In sum , the court concluded that the company must have had other sources of revenue which would make it possible to pay the court fees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against the decision , pointing to the difference between gross and net income . The applicant company maintained that it had been generating no profits but high net losses . The sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL was gross income , from which costs and expenses should be subtracted to yield the net loss . It had been a mistake on the part of the court to take this sum to be the net profit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . The court considered that the applicant company had been conducting its business activity and producing gross income . The fact that the company declared high costs for its activity had not justified exemption from court fees as it had freedom to spend its gross income as it chose . The court fees should be considered as one of the costs of its business activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant company on grounds of inability to pay the court fees . An appeal by the applicant company against this decision was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a constitutional complaint against the provisions governing the imposition of court fees and exemptions from them .", "CARDINAL .
