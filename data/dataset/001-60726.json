He alleged that the acquisition of the house by the first applicant and her husband had been vitiated by a breach of the regulations in force at the time and that they had enjoyed an unlawful advantage in that the price they had been required to pay had been lower than the property \u2019s real value . He argued that the valuation of the house had been neither objective nor compatible with the legislation then in force .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their defence , filed with ORG on DATE , the applicants submitted that the purchase price had been properly calculated in accordance with the provisions applicable at the material time , and pointed out that the contract of sale had been adjudged valid by the P\u0159\u00edbram branch of the ORG notary service ( st\u00e1tn\u00ed not\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed ) , which had registered it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG commissioned an expert opinion to establish whether the DATE valuation had complied with the regulations then in force . The expert \u2019s report was filed with the court on DATE . In it the expert stated that after studying the file and the DATE valuation he had found that \u201c this valuation was not entirely compatible with the legislation in force at the time \u201d and that he had \u201c in addition noted instances of underestimation of area \u201d . He had therefore decided to \u201c carry out a complete revaluation , applying the legislation formerly applicable and taking as [ his ] basis the state of affairs as described in the course of the proceedings \u201d in order to be able to compare the CARDINAL valuations and quantify the difference between them . The expert report assessed ( a ) the inhabitable parts of the property and ( b ) the non - inhabitable parts , namely the barn and cowshed . With regard to the latter , the expert reported :", "\u201c ... the small barn and the adjoining cowshed were classified as \u2018 small constructions\u2019 , as they served only for the use of the occupier , not for any agricultural activity . That led to an essential difference between the valuation produced ... in DATE and the present one . My valuation is justified by a written instruction of DATE relating to LAW , which provides : \u2018 The purchase price may also be applied to small constructions used for animal husbandry , provided that this activity does not go beyond the personal needs of the owner and the members of his family.\u2019 The barn is currently used as a toolshed . ... My classification of the CARDINAL buildings complied with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... I took the barn and cowshed to be possessions in personal ownership , as they were not used for agricultural activities but only for the needs of the owner . If they had been private property the legislation then in force would not have permitted their transfer . Public establishments could sell to individuals only buildings classifiable as properties in personal ownership ... The difference in price for these CARDINAL buildings , in relation to the DATE valuation , is nearly FAC ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants pointed out that the expert \u2019s valuation of the inhabitable parts of the LOC was practically identical to the DATE valuation , the difference of FAC being solely due to the valuation of the barn and cowshed . They challenged the valuation procedure because it had been based on Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which did not specify the prices applicable in practice to buildings belonging to socialist organisations , and whose LAW , they argued , excluded its application to their case . They further submitted that the price difference that had been noted was due in large part to a different assessment of the depreciation to be taken into account for the CARDINAL buildings in question .", "CARDINAL . After the death of the first applicant \u2019s husband , her son , the second applicant , became the co - owner of the forester \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the application by the son of the former owners and decided to transfer title to the disputed property to him , ruling as follows :", "\u201c After assessing the evidence , particularly the depositions of the parties and the witnesses , the contract of sale registered by the ORG notary service on CARDINAL DATE , the agreement of CARDINAL DATE conferring the right to make personal use of the land , ... , the valuation of the house ... made on DATE ... , the expert report of DATE , drawn up in accordance with instructions from [ the first applicant ] and admitted by the court in evidence , ... , and the expert report on the price of the buildings , drawn up by the court - appointed expert ... , the ORG notes that ...

The members of the defendants\u2019 family were not leading figures of the former communist regime but simple forestry workers who moved into the house as employees of the enterprise . They agreed to buy it when their employer gave them the opportunity to do so because they had no alternative accommodation . As for the purchase price , they accepted the amount fixed by [ the surveyor ] , which they had no reason to challenge .", "Nevertheless , it is incontestable that whereas the purchase price of the house should have been fixed at ORG , it cost them only ORG . Consequently , the conditions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW are satisfied in the instant case because , in DATE , the defendants acquired the property at a price lower than the true value . The difference amounted to CARDINAL of the true value . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the above judgment to ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) . They submitted that at the time when the proposal that they should purchase the house had been made to them they were under threat of eviction . They pointed out that both the surveyor \u2019s report and the contract of sale had been drawn up by the vendor , and that the transaction had been effected in accordance with the legislation then in force \u2013 indeed the ORG notary service had verified the purchase price before registering the contract . They alleged that the court expert \u2019s report did not constitute sufficient proof that the purchase price had been lower than the price required by the regulations at that time . They accordingly asked ORG to order a new expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment , ruling as follows :", "\u201c It emerges from the [ DATE ] expert report ... that the valuation made [ in DATE ] did not comply with the rules in force at the time . ... The barn and the cowshed should have been valued as buildings in personal ownership , since they were not used for agricultural purposes but had been placed at the disposal of the owners of the house . ... According to LAW of ORG ... only buildings in personal ownership could be sold to citizens by a socialist organisation . If the regulation then in force and Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had been applied , the purchase price would have been fixed at ORG .", "Consequently , ORG upholds ORG finding that the question of the transfer of title must be considered under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... It has been established that the purchase price was determined by the vendor without the benefit of any expert report ... and that it was lower than the price required by the rules on prices then in force , which is apparent from the [ court ] expert \u2019s report .", "As to the appellants\u2019 objection that the contract of sale was registered by the ORG notary service ... which deemed the barn and cowshed to be buildings in private ownership , it should be noted that this classification was the result of a legal opinion which is not a binding precedent for adjudication of the case ... Moreover , regard being had to the fact that the claimant has already obtained the restitution of QUANTITY of woodland , it is desirable , in accordance with PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , for the forester \u2019s house to be used for its original purpose . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( \u00dastavni soud ) , submitting that they had purchased the house in accordance with the rules then in force and without any unlawful advantage . They also relied on LAW , under which a contract of sale could be declared void only when the purchase price was too high . They argued that ORG had deprived them of their property and that accordingly their right to protection of their property under LAW ( Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod ) had been infringed . They further complained that they had been deprived of fair and appropriate compensation , contending that although by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW a natural person was entitled to reimbursement of the purchase price and the costs reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the property , the sum of CARDINAL NORP korunas ( CZK ) for the purchase price and reimbursement of their costs could never make good the loss of the house . They had been deprived of their title to the property on account of the difference noted CARDINAL prices calculated according to CARDINAL different methods . Moreover , in the judicial proceedings they had not been on an equal footing with the other party , particularly in view of the possibility the claimant enjoyed of consulting the relevant documents . In that connection they relied on LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also asked ORG to stay execution of ORG judgment and declare null and void part of section TIME ) of LAW . They argued that in so far as the provision in question permitted restitution in the event of \u201c the purchase of immovable property at a price lower than the price required by the regulations on prices then in force \u201d , thus threatening title acquired in accordance with the legislation applicable at the time of purchase , it gave former owners the possibility of challenging the valuation of properties made at the time of their transfer . They asserted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW thus caused them prejudice identical to that caused DATE , which the LAW was supposed to attenuate . They submitted that it was inadmissible to make natural persons who had acquired property in good faith and in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time bear responsibility for unlawful decisions or incorrect procedures adopted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants asked ORG to stay execution of ORG judgment , to exempt them from payment of the costs of the proceedings and to reopen the case . In the latter application they based their arguments on an opinion on the question of methodology delivered by the author of an exegesis of the relevant legislation published by ORG ( ORG cenov\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad ) , which in their submission proved unequivocally that the court expert had made a mistake . They also submitted to ORG documents from the ORG archives capable of proving what use the disputed property had been put to in the past .", "CARDINAL . On DATE people living in the municipality of H\u0159\u00edm\u011b\u017edice and other villages sent a petition to the President of the Republic and to ORG expressing their belief that the human rights guaranteed by the LAW had been infringed in the applicants\u2019 case . They pointed out that the son of the former owners had recovered possession of a large estate ( QUANTITY of woodland and QUANTITY of other land ) , whereas the applicants had lost nearly all their possessions , although they had acquired them in good faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the petition , an MP sent a written question to the Deputy Prime Minister , the Minister of Agriculture and the Director of ORG , saying that he wondered whether section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provided for the possibility of restitution in the event of \u201c the purchase of immovable property at a price lower than the price required by the regulations on prices then in force \u201d , was not contrary to the principle of legal certainty , in so far as it made it possible to transfer the responsibility for unlawful acts by the ORG to individuals who had acted in good faith . He also considered problematical , from the point of view of equality between litigants , legal provisions such as section ORG ) of LAW , which guaranteed persons who could claim restitution the right to various forms of assistance or exemption from costs in the judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Prime Minister replied on DATE . He said the doubts expressed were unfounded and pointed out that LAW had been framed in such a way as to pose , in addition to the general conditions , CARDINAL additional tests each designed to exclude the purchasers\u2019 good faith . The fact that LAW referred to the legislation in force at the time of purchase could not be considered to impair legal certainty on account of some retrospective effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined at a public hearing the applicants\u2019 application for the proceedings to be reopened . Despite a new expert report submitted by them and drawn up on their own initiative , it refused the application , noting , inter alia , that in the original proceedings neither party had called as a witness the expert appointed by the court and that it was only on appeal that the applicants had asked for the expert evidence to be reviewed . Consequently , the statutory conditions for a retrial had not been met in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the above decision , asserting that they had submitted evidence which it would have been objectively impossible for them to present during the original proceedings . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE , holding that there were no facts , decisions or evidence which it would have been impossible for the defendants to rely on in the initial proceedings . However , it gave leave for an appeal on points of law against its ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , therefore , the applicants appealed on a point of law to ORG ( PERSON ) . They argued that in the proceedings on their appeal against the judgment which had transferred title they had proposed in vain the commissioning of a second expert report and that ORG attitude had prompted them to have a new expert report drawn up on their own initiative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 constitutional appeal as manifestly ill - founded , ruling as follows :", "\u201c The alleged violation of LAW of LAW must be examined not just from the NORP point of view but also from that of the person claiming restitution ... ORG refers in that connection to its judgment published under file no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , in which it noted that the purpose of restitution was to attenuate infringements of the rights of real - property owners by making reparation for the unlawful act committed at the time of the transfer of the property and by giving priority to the restitution of properties in their original condition . Consequently , the ORG can not find a violation of LAW unless the statutory conditions for restitution are satisfied . ...", "The annulment sought by the applicants , of part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , would have limited the right to restitution and would have harmed the interests of a large number of restitution claimants ... The laws on restitution must establish the conditions for redressing wrongs , it being understood that it is for the national courts to examine all the circumstances in the light of the purport and general object of those laws .", "The reporting judge has established , in the light of all the documents submitted , that the ordinary courts correctly applied the law to the case in allowing the claim for restitution and in deciding that title should be transferred to the claimant ... , as the appellant and her husband had bought the house at a price lower than the price resulting from application of the rules on prices then in force .", "As regards violation of LAW , which enshrines the principle of equality between litigants , the ORG notes that during the judicial proceedings the courts scrupulously examined both the evidence adduced by the person claiming restitution and the evidence adduced by the defendants . ...", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted further grounds for their appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) , observing that all the courts dealing with their case , including ORG , had proceeded on the assumption that the report of the court - appointed expert was correct , whereas , among other defects , it had been established on the basis of a directive from ORG which had no legal validity , and that Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not applicable to the case . They also drew attention to the fact that , according to the second expert report drawn up at their request , the purchase price they had paid in DATE was not lower but higher than the price required by the legislation in force at the time of the sale .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law inadmissible , pointing out that it could have been admitted in the initial proceedings but could not be in proceedings brought by means of an application for a retrial .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were reimbursed by ORG the purchase price they had paid in DATE and the sum they had paid for the right to make personal use of the land . They thus received altogether CZK CARDINAL . On the other hand , reimbursement of the costs they had reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the house was put off on account of a disagreement between the applicants and the ORG over the applicable rate . According to the applicants , the ORG had announced that it was prepared to pay them CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL but had never made the slightest payment , in spite of their request that it do so . The amount must therefore be fixed by ORG , the applicants having brought an action against ORG in DATE seeking payment in the sum of CZK CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . According to the information supplied by the parties , the new owner of the property has not to date offered the applicants alternative accommodation and they still live in the house . They contended that the new owner had refused to sign a tenancy agreement with them in order to regularise the situation but had brought an action in the ORG seeking payment of arrears of rent in the sum of CZK MONEY ( corresponding to more than CZK CARDINAL per month ) , plus default interest . Apparently this action led on DATE to an order to pay being made against them . When they appealed , CARDINAL hearings were seemingly held on DATE and DATE , and the owner , it would appear , is now seeking a still higher sum , corresponding to a rent of CZK CARDINAL per month . The applicants observe that the proceedings they brought in DATE in order to determine how much they should be reimbursed for the costs they incurred for the upkeep of the property are still pending . They therefore consider that their position vis - \u00e0 - vis the public authorities is less favourable than that of the new owner .", "CARDINAL .
