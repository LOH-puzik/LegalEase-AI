The applicant was born in DATE . He was detained in a penal colony in GPE , GPE , and he is currently detained in GPE in connection with another criminal case pending against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before his arrest in DATE the applicant was a businessmen and CARDINAL of the richest persons in GPE . Thus , he was a board member and the major shareholder of GPE , a large oil company ( hereinafter \u201c the company \u201d , liquidated in DATE ) . He also controlled several other mining , industrial and financial companies affiliated with ORG hereinafter referred to as \u201c the GPE group \u201d ) . Most of those companies were created as a result of the privatisation of ORG - controlled enterprises in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE group was pursuing a number of large - scale business projects . Thus , PERSON was engaged in merger talks with GPE , another large NORP oil company , and with the GPE - based company ORG . PERSON was also planning to build a pipeline to LOC in order to export natural gas to the western part of LOC . Lastly , PERSON and the ORG company ORG were involved in a public struggle for control of certain oilfields .", "CARDINAL . At the same time the applicant became involved in politics . At DATE he announced that he would allocate significant funds to support the opposition parties GPE and ORG ( PERSON ) He also made certain public declarations criticising alleged anti - democratic trends in NORP internal policy . The applicant funded a non - profit NGO , \u201c Open GPE Foundation \u201d in order to promote certain political values in NORP society .", "CARDINAL . One of the companies affiliated with ORG , a large mining enterprise , producing apatite concentrate . PERSON controlled a CARDINAL % shareholding in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Apatit was privatised in DATE . In DATE the authorities made several attempts to return ORG to ORG control , claiming that the money due under the privatisation contract had not been paid by the buyers . In DATE Mr GPE , CARDINAL of the top managers in the GPE group and the applicant \u2019s personal friend , proposed a friendly settlement of the dispute on behalf of the buyers . The ORG privatisation authority having accepted that offer , on DATE a friendly settlement was reached . It was approved by a commercial court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the governors of GPE , GPE and LOC wrote a letter to the then ORG of GPE , PERSON ORG . In that letter they complained that ORG was abusing its dominant position on the apatite concentrate market and boosting prices of phosphate fertilisers , which , in turn , increased food prices . They also alleged that ORG was using various schemes to evade or minimise taxes . They urged General Prosecutor PERSON to return PERSON to ORG control and to apply anti - trust measures in order to make ORG reduce prices .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the governor of GPE wrote to the then President of GPE , PERSON . He drew the President \u2019s attention to the friendly settlement in respect of the ORG shares and claimed that its terms were contrary to the interests of the ORG , since the amount received by the ORG in pursuance to that settlement was significantly lower than the market price of the shares .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then President PERSON issued Directive No . NORP requiring reports to be obtained in relation to the acquisition of the ORG shares . In particular , he inquired whether there had been \u201c violations of the existing legislation committed during the sale of shares in ORG plc \u201d and whether the ORG had suffered any loss as a consequence of the friendly settlement that had been approved by ORG of GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A wide ranging investigation then took place involving the Prime Minister , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , and ORG . In DATE ORG wrote to the President that the privatisation of ORG and its business activities had been suspicious , and that further inquiry was needed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the President informing him that ORG ( ORG ) had concluded that there was no need to take further action . The inquiry had not established that ORG had been abusing its position on the market or that the amount of the friendly settlement reached with the ORG privatisation agency had been unfair . The terms of the friendly settlement had been approved by the Prime Minister , PERSON . PERSON \u2019s tax payments had been constantly monitored by ORG ; although ORG and its affiliates had been subjected to various penalties and financial sanctions in the past , and a new audit was underway , ORG did not see any reason to start criminal proceedings in this respect .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , on DATE a criminal case was opened against ORG ; the situation concerning the acquisition of the ORG shares later formed CARDINAL of the main charges against the applicant . In DATE the scope of the investigation was broadened : the investigative team discovered evidence of tax evasion and business fraud in the business activities of the companies affiliated with GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was arrested in connection with the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to ORG and interviewed as a witness in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the prosecution carried out several searches of the premises of GPE and the offices of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , and also searched the headquarters of the political party GPE . Further , several leading executives of ORG and affiliated companies were arrested ; several others left GPE . Some of those who had left then settled in GPE . The prosecution authorities sought their extradition to GPE , but the NORP courts refused on the grounds that their prosecution was politically motivated and they would not receive a fair trial in GPE . The applicant produced copies of the decisions of the NORP courts in those extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the same time senior officials in ORG publicly declared that charges might be brought against other senior managers of ORG and affiliated companies . The applicant did not leave the country and continued his activities , including business trips in GPE and abroad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst the applicant was away from GPE on a business trip to eastern GPE , an investigator summoned him to appear in GPE as a witness on DATE at TIME . The summons was delivered to the applicant \u2019s office on DATE at TIME by investigators Mr F. and Mr Sh . The applicant \u2019s staff told them that the applicant was away from GPE until DATE . Yukos staff also sent ORG a telegram explaining the reasons for the applicant \u2019s absence from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr F. and Mr Sh . wrote a report to the leading investigator , Mr PERSON , in which they informed Mr PERSON about the applicant \u2019s absence . On DATE , the applicant having missed the appointment , the investigator PERSON ordered his enforced attendance for questioning and instructed the police to implement that order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In TIME of DATE a group of armed law - enforcement officers approached the applicant \u2019s aeroplane on an airstrip in GPE , apprehended him , and flew him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer complained about the enforced attendance order to ORG of GPE . He asserted that the applicant had had a good reason for missing the interview : he had been out of town on a business trip and had not personally received the summons . As a witness he had been free to travel . On DATE the court dismissed the complaint . The court stated that it had been impossible to hand over the summons of CARDINAL DATE directly into the applicant \u2019s hands , so the applicant had been notified about the questioning through the GPE headquarters . The court concluded that the decision of CARDINAL DATE to bring the applicant to GPE for questioning had been issued in compliance with LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . Once in GPE the applicant was brought before the investigator at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE . The investigator explained to the applicant why he had been apprehended and interviewed him as a witness in connection with the applicant \u2019s personal income tax payments for DATE . Thereafter the applicant was informed that he was being charged in connection with a number of crimes , namely the fraudulent acquisition of the ORG shares in DATE , misappropriation of the ORG proceeds , misappropriation of ORG assets and corporate tax evasion and personal tax evasion schemes allegedly used by GPE and the applicant personally in DATE . The investigator drew up a charge sheet describing the essence of the charges against the applicant . It was CARDINAL pages long and was read out to the applicant at TIME The applicant was then interviewed as a defendant in that case but refused to testify since one of his lawyers was absent . Following the interview , at TIME on DATE the investigator requested ORG to detain the applicant pending investigation . The request was CARDINAL pages long and , according to the applicant , had been prepared in advance .", "CARDINAL . The court heard this request at CARDINAL p.m. The applicant was assisted by CARDINAL of his lawyers , PERSON . The prosecution requested the proceedings to be held in camera , referring to the materials of the case file which should not be disclosed . The defence requested a public hearing , but the court , on an application by the prosecutor , decided to hold the hearing in camera , referring to a need to guarantee the defendant \u2019s rights . The court heard the public prosecutor , the applicant and the applicant \u2019s counsel and examined certain documents from the case file produced by the prosecution . The defence submitted that the applicant had attended promptly for questioning when he had first been requested to do so , in DATE , and that he had been unable to attend the second questioning for legitimate reasons , as he had had no personal knowledge of the summons . The defence pleaded in favour of the applicant \u2019s release on bail . However , as the Government indicated , the defence did not indicate the amount of the proposed bail .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing , which lasted TIME , the court issued a detention order , referring to Articles CARDINAL of LAW ( see the \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d part below ) . The court summarised the charges against the applicant , the arguments put forward by the parties and the procedural history of the case . The main reasons for the detention were as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is accused of serious crimes punishable by over DATE imprisonment , committed in concert with others and over a long period . The circumstances of the crimes , [ the applicant \u2019s ] personality , and his position as head of GPE suggest that , if he remained at large , the applicant may influence witnesses and other participants in the trial , hide or destroy evidence ... , or commit further crimes .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] accomplices have fled from the prosecution . [ The applicant ] might also flee because he has a travel passport and money in foreign banks \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the applicant \u2019s family situation , his residence in GPE and his health condition , and found that there was no reason for choosing a milder measure of restraint . As to the applicant \u2019s assertion that the prosecution had produced no evidence of his implication in the impugned crimes , the court noted as follows :", "\u201c This argument ... shall not be examined on the merits , since the criminal case is still at the stage of the pre - trial investigation , and the court can not express its opinion as to the guilt [ of the applicant ] , proof of his guilt or the correctness of the legal qualification of PERSON acts \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court order did not establish the duration of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant resigned from his position as Chief Executive of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer handed over the applicant \u2019s foreign travel passports to the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed against the detention order . They asserted , among other things , that the reasons for the detention were insufficient , that the hearing in camera had been unlawful and that the applicant had not committed any criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the detention order . The hearing took place in camera , without the applicant but in the presence of his lawyers . The city court expanded on the district court \u2019s reasons :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] owns a large stake in ORG , a company registered in GPE ... , has financial influence , [ and ] enjoys prestige with public bodies and companies . Employees of companies controlled by [ the applicant ] depend on him financially and otherwise .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the materials of the case file contained sufficient evidence to suspect the applicant of having committed the impugned offences . It established , further , that the domestic law allowed the detention hearing to be held in camera , in order to keep the materials of the pre - trial investigation secret and protect the interests of the defendant . ORG also failed to fix the duration of the period of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with a number of additional crimes , including abuse of trust , misappropriation of property , tax evasion , large - scale fraud and forgery of official documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms Artyukhova , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , visited him in prison . As she was leaving , guards searched her and seized a handwritten note with ideas about the case she had prepared TIME and a typed draft of the legal position in Mr PERSON \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , Ms Artyukhova had received a note from the applicant entitled \u201c Written directions to the defence \u201d . These \u201c directions \u201d contained the following instructions ( it appears that the Government quoted from this note ) : \u201c to ensure that Mr GPE gives negative or vague answers about the participation in the RTT , to speak to the witnesses about their testimony of CARDINAL DATE , to check the testimonies of the defence witnesses to ensure that they do not contain any indication as to intent \u201d . It also contained directions as to investment activities and tax payments . The prison officials also seized from Ms PERSON a CARDINAL-page typewritten memo entitled \u201c Preliminary criminal - law analysis of the charges in the case of PERSON Lebedev P.P. \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government produced a report dated CARDINAL DATE by a prison officer who had participated in the search . According to the report , the search had been ordered by inspector B. In the report inspector B. indicated that he had ordered the search because he had sufficient grounds to believe that PERSON was carrying prohibited goods . The Government also produced a report by inspector PERSON , who informed his superiors that he saw that the applicant and PERSON \u201c exchanged a notebook with some notes , and also made notes in it \u201d during their meeting .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the handwritten note was drafted by PERSON It stated as follows :", "\u201c - PERSON [ the applicant \u2019s cell - mate ] : expects a second visit by the lawyer PERSON ;", "- to work on the question of sanctions concerning violation of rules on keeping in custody GPE ( active < - > passive forms of behaviour ( ex . hunger strike ) ;", "- to work on the question of receiving money for consultancy fees on the purchase of shares by various companies involved in investment activities ;", "- expert analysis of signatures , to work on this question because the documents submitted are not the originals but photocopies ( expert analysis of photocopies of signatures of PERSON ) ;", "- to work through questions with witnesses PERSON , PERSON , PERSON ( questioning on CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL - according to circumstances ) ;", "- concerning participation in RTT GPE must give negative ( indecisive ) answer ;", "- prerogatives of executives of ORG and PERSON - to show the scope of their prerogatives , how promotions are made ;", "- check witnesses of the defence ( former managers and administration of ORG , PERSON position CARDINAL , the essence of testimonies", "CARDINAL ) NORP absence of intention ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP absence of instructions , advise on methods of investment and tax activity ;", "It is necessary to work on testimonies of witnesses PERSON , GPE , PERSON , tax people ;", "Other - to conduct , by Western audit and law firms , audit of personal fortune , in the following context \u2018 I have right to receive income in accordance with decision of meeting of shareholders \u2018 counsel . ... in the case ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers were informed that the pre - trial investigation had finished . The defence was given access to the materials of the investigation file for examination and preparation for the trial .", "CARDINAL . The Government produced a copy of a report by investigator Mr. K. to Mr B. , the Head of ORG of ORG , concerning the episode of DATE . Mr PERSON informed Mr B. about the content of the note seized from Ms PERSON According to Mr PERSON , that note contained the applicant \u2019s instructions to the defence team as to the tactics of the defence and , in particular , was aimed at ensuring coordination with Mr GPE , the applicant \u2019s co - accused . According to Mr PERSON , the applicant \u201c dictated \u201d the note to PERSON . Mr PERSON concluded that this note had evidentiary value in the applicant \u2019s criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence made an application to ORG for the measure of restraint to be changed , arguing that as the pre - trial investigation had finished and all the witnesses had been questioned there was no longer even a theoretical possibility that the applicant might interfere with the proceedings . They also argued that there was no reason to believe that the applicant would resume his alleged criminal activities or that he would flee jurisdiction . Sureties and bail were also offered . On DATE the prosecution dismissed the application for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution requested ORG to extend the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The prosecution referred to the \u201c note seized from CARDINAL of the lawyers [ of the applicant ] containing instructions from FAC to exert pressure on witnesses for the prosecution \u201d . The prosecutor was apparently referring to the note seized from PERSON . The prosecution \u2019s application for an extension was lengthy and carefully reasoned ; it ran to CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers learned that the court would hear the request at TIME on DATE , DATE . The lawyers did not receive a copy of the request before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The hearing began at CARDINAL p.m. on DATE . The defence sought an adjournment of the hearing to DATE , but the court instead allowed the lawyers a TIME break to prepare their pleadings . During TIME the lawyers stayed in the courtroom and took instructions from the encaged applicant in the presence of guards and court staff .", "CARDINAL . The court decided to hold the hearing in camera . The applicant \u2019s lawyers objected , referring , in particular , to the fact that ORG had previously publicly stated that there was nothing in the applicant \u2019s case that would lead to the necessity for any hearings in camera . The court refused the applicant \u2019s request that the hearing be in public , without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the hearing the defence produced documents in support of their view that the applicant was no longer a board member of GPE , that he had no shares in GPE or other companies which , according to the prosecution , had been involved in the impugned scam operations , and that before his arrest he had permanently resided in LOC . On that basis , the defence asserted that the applicant would not abscond . However , the court refused to examine the documents provided by the defence .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the hearing was adjourned . It was resumed on DATE . On DATE the defence obtained a copy of the prosecution \u2019s request for an extension of the detention . At the same time the prosecution filed with the court new pieces of evidence , including the note seized from Ms Artyukhova . The court admitted Ms A \u2019s note in evidence . The defence sought an adjournment for DATE to examine those documents . They also contested their admissibility , claiming that the documents had been obtained in breach of the privilege pertaining to lawyer - client communications . They claimed , further , that they had not enough information about the origin of this document . However , the court ruled that a TIME adjournment would suffice .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant \u2019s representative , PERSON , requested the court to adjourn the hearing for one day in order to allow the defence to study new materials submitted by the prosecution . The court ordered a CARDINAL - and - a - half hour break but refused to adjourn the hearing to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court extended the detention until DATE , essentially for the same reasons it had relied on before . ORG examined the applicant \u2019s family situation , and the \u201c personal sureties \u201d proposed by several individuals who guaranteed the applicant \u2019s appearance at the trial . However , those elements did not persuade ORG that the applicant could be released . ORG referred to the fact that the applicant \u2019s presumed accomplices had fled from trial , and that the applicant controlled business structures which were implicated in the alleged crimes and could therefore use them to continue his criminal activities or influence witnesses who worked in those structures . The court noted that the applicant had a foreign passport and personally owned shares in a foreign company and through a trust company . In addition , the court stated that the applicant had tried to intimidate witnesses . It did not refer directly to Ms A \u2019s note in its analysis , although it mentioned it when summarising the submissions by the prosecution . The court also had regard to the necessity of carrying out further investigative actions . It concluded that , if released , the applicant might flee from justice , influence witnesses and continue his activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed against this decision . The appeal was received by ORG from the first - instance court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld it . The hearing in ORG took place in public in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyers . The applicant was absent from that hearing . From that moment on the detention hearings in the applicant \u2019s case were held in public . In the decision of DATE ORG held , inter alia , that the lower court had had evidence that the applicant had tried to exert pressure on witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the prosecution requested ORG to extend the applicant \u2019s detention again because the applicant needed more time to study the prosecution files . In support of his request the prosecutor mentioned in his submissions the \u201c seizure from one of the defendants of the written notes containing the instruction of GPE to put pressure on the witnesses for the prosecution \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing . The defence lawyers complained that they had been unable to see the applicant in private to take instructions as the applicant had only been informed DATE of the hearing and had had insufficient time to review the new case materials submitted by the prosecutor . They themselves had only been informed of the hearing on DATE . They asked for an adjournment of DATE . They also submitted to the court an expert handwriting analysis report showing that the document seized from ORG had been written by her and not by the applicant . The defence claimed , further , that the applicant would not abscond . In support of that claim , the defence referred to one of the co - accused , Mr PERSON , who had signed a written undertaking not to leave his city of residence and had not absconded . The defence indicated that the applicant \u2019s passports had been handed over to the prosecution and that his family were once again offering to put up bail for him . In the opinion of the defence it was absurd to suggest that the applicant would continue with criminal activity , since he was not charged with crimes of violence but with economic crimes : it would be impossible for him to commit such crimes if bailed on condition of house arrest . The prosecution objected to the applicant being granted bail on the condition of house arrest .", "CARDINAL . After having examined the materials of the case file and having heard the parties , the court extended the detention until DATE essentially for the same reasons as before . In support of its conclusions , the court referred to the fact that some of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants had fled from GPE , that the applicant had several foreign passports , that he owned a considerable amount of shares in a foreign company , and that he had tried to exert pressure on the prosecution witnesses . The court also referred to the fact that some of the witnesses were dependent on the applicant . In the detention order the court did not , however , refer to the risk that , if released , the applicant would engage in criminal activities . ORG also held that the detention could not be replaced by personal sureties because the court was not entitled to take such a decision under LAW of the CCrP.", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the applicant \u2019s appeals against the detention order of DATE were received by ORG on DATE ( appeal by Mr GPE ) and DATE ( appeal by PERSON ) . On DATE the materials of the case were forwarded by ORG to ORG . The parties were informed of the date and venue of the appeal court hearing . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution submitted the case to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to hold a preliminary hearing on QUANTITY May and ordered that the applicant should stay in prison . The decision was taken in camera and without the attendance of either the applicant or his lawyers or the prosecution . No reasons for the continued detention of the applicant were given and the period of detention was not specified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , PERSON , lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . She complained , inter alia , that the detention hearing had been held without the applicant or his lawyer , and that the decision extending the detention did not contain any reasons . After having obtained a reply from the prosecution , ORG forwarded the appeal to ORG . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It appears that neither the applicant nor his lawyers were present at the hearing of DATE . According to the Government , the summons was sent to CARDINAL lawyers representing the applicant ; however , the summons was not sent to PERSON , as her power of attorney did not entitle her to represent the applicant before the appeal court . The Government did not produce copies of the summons . ORG found that the decision of DATE had been taken by a competent court in compliance with the relevant legislation . It did not specify the reasons for extending the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . Preliminary hearings in the trial court took place on CARDINAL May and DATE . On the latter date the court decided to open the trial on DATE and to join the cases of the applicant and Mr GPE . It also ordered that the applicant should stay in prison pending trial . No reason for that decision was given and the court did not specify the period of detention . PERSON appealed against that decision , claiming , inter alia , that the decision of DATE to detain the applicant had not been reasoned . On DATE the detention order of DATE was upheld by ORG . ORG in its decision indicated that it had reviewed the materials of the case file , examined the submissions of the parties , and concluded that the detention order by the first - instance had not violated the criminal procedure law . ORG also indicated that , taking into consideration the materials available in the case file , the first - instance court had not found any grounds to reverse or modify the measure of restraint in the form of detention pending trial . According to the applicant PERSON was unable to participate in the hearing on medical grounds . However , the applicant , several of his lawyers and the lawyers representing PERSON PERSON were present at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the trial started , the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the trial court to release the applicant because he was detained unlawfully . The court dismissed that request . In its ruling the court established that during the investigation the detention had been ordered and extended by ORG . ORG declared itself incompetent to reassess those detention orders . ORG further noted that on DATE , following receipt of the case file from the prosecution , it had maintained the measure of restraint imposed earlier . That decision was later confirmed on DATE . Those decisions were not quashed , and only an appeal court could examine the lawfulness of previously imposed detention orders . The court concluded that it did not detect any \u201c breaches of the existing legislation that would prevent the applicant \u2019s detention \u201d .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against that ruling , but on DATE ORG upheld both the above decision and the earlier decision of the same court of DATE ( cf . above ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the prosecution requested the court to extend the applicant \u2019s detention because the trial was continuing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a public hearing , in the presence of the applicant and his lawyers . During the hearing the applicant \u2019s lawyers asked the court to consider alternative measures of restraint . Having examined the parties\u2019 submissions ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , essentially for the same reasons that ORG had given earlier , at the pre - trial stage ( without , however , mentioning the applicant \u2019s property abroad ) . The detention order indicated that there was a risk that the applicant would try to put pressure on witnesses , and that the detention was the only appropriate option .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the extension order . The appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , repeating the reasons given in the earlier decisions in that regard . The court repeated in particular that the applicant had tried to influence witnesses in the case , that many witnesses worked in companies affiliated with him , that the applicant had international connections , and that other suspects had fled GPE . The applicant \u2019s lawyers during the hearing asked the court to consider alternative preventive measures . The applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the court extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE , again with essentially the same reasoning . In the detention order ORG noted that by that time both parties had completed presenting their evidence and the proceedings were reaching the stage of oral pleadings ( preniya ) , which would then be followed by the closing address of the accused persons and the court \u2019s deliberations . However , it was still possible for the court to re - open the judicial examination of evidence , if need be . Further , the court assumed that the pleadings , addresses and deliberations could take a long time , given the complexity of the case and the number of parties involved . The appeal by the applicant against this decision was also unsuccessful , as ORG rejected it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found guilty of the charges brought against him and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment in the main , excluded several charges and reduced the sentence to DATE . Some time afterwards the applicant was transferred to a correctional colony in GPE , where he is currently serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL until DATE the applicant was detained at remand prison no . CARDINAL in GPE , known as \u201c PERSON \u201d . From CARDINAL DATE until DATE the applicant was detained at remand prison no . CARDINAL in GPE , which is a special - purpose block of the \u201c PERSON \u201d . Thereafter , and until his transferral to the penal colony the applicant was again detained at remand centre DATE . On DATE the applicant was sent to serve his sentence at penal colony ORG IK-CARDINAL in the town of GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant indicated that from CARDINAL DATE to DATE he had been held in cells CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . In those cells the partition dividing the toilet from the rest of the cell was CARDINAL cm high . The applicant insisted that the partition was not high enough to ensure his privacy when using the toilet . He insisted that the toilet had not been separated or soundproofed and allowed inmates to see and hear everything happening in the toilet . The smell from the toilet pervaded the cell . The applicant had to eat his meals in the cell in such conditions . The prison authorities did not supply curtains to separate the toilet from the rest of the cell . He noted that no such curtain ( or curtain mark ) was visible in the photographs of cells CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL provided by the ORG . The applicant \u2019s bed was very close to the lavatory . It was only on DATE , after the end of the trial and the applicant \u2019s conviction , that he was transferred to the refurbished cell no . CARDINAL , where the partition was QUANTITY high .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , his cell in remand centre no . CARDINAL housed CARDINAL persons . Thus , each detainee had at QUANTITY of space in the cell , which contained beds , a worktable that also served as a dining table and the toilet bowl and washbasin . The applicant was incarcerated in such a cell for TIME a day for DATE . At remand centre CARDINAL the applicant shared a cell with CARDINAL people .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the unventilated cells of the remand centres became too hot \u2013 QUANTITY and in DATE too cold DATE QUANTITY . The effect of the lack of ventilation was particularly acute on the applicant because he was a non - smoker and was constantly forced to inhale tobacco smoke . On DATE the applicant was unable to have his TIME walk as he had to attend court . Moreover the walking areas were totally enclosed roofed yards at the top of the remand centre . The applicant therefore never had any access to fresh air on these walks . The dimensions of some of the walking areas were very small : TIME .
