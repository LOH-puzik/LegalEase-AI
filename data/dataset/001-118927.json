However , ORG believes that a number of issues continue to be of concern , namely the following : i ) when significant numbers of arrivals take place , CDAs , CARAs and ORG projects alone are unable to host all asylum - seekers who can not provide for themselves ; ii ) the actual level of assistance and the quality of services provided vary significantly depending on the type of facility , with ORG projects offering reception in a multitude of small facilities , many of which have established strong ties to the local area , whilst CARAs and CDAs are larger facilities with capacities ranging from a minimum of CARDINAL places to a maximum of CARDINAL places ; ( iii ) the criteria and procedures for referring individual asylum - seekers to a ORG or a ORG project are not always set out formally in writing ; ( iv ) there have been a number of instances in which reception in a ORG was limited to a maximum of DATE , a practice which does not appear to be in line with the ORG Directive on reception conditions , when applied to asylum - seekers who are unable to provide for themselves and have not received a decision on their applications within this period ; however , recently , ORG has received assurances from ORG that this restrictive practice will be discontinued ; ( v ) CARAs do not all offer the same reception services , with the quality of assistance varying between facilities and sometimes failing to meet adequate standards , especially regarding the provision of legal and psycho - social assistance ; ( vi ) there is still room for improvement in the CARAs , in particular with regard to community participation , the creation of efficient complaints mechanisms and regarding gender and diversity perspectives ; ( vii ) care provided to vulnerable individuals is often inadequate due to low levels of coordination among stakeholders , an inability to provide adequate legal and social support as well as the necessary logistical follow - up , and a poor referral system ; ( viii ) monitoring of reception conditions by the relevant authorities is generally not systematic and complaints often remain unaddressed ; ( ix ) regarding the \u2018 GPE , which enabled accommodation for significant numbers of asylum - seekers ex - GPE to be found within a short space of time , monitoring activities falling under the remit of the regional Implementing Authorities in the framework of the national reception plan have been delayed . Moreover , most of the new facilities established by regional governments to host arrivals from GPE do not currently offer the range of services foreseen by national legislation on minimum reception standards in CARAs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A report published on DATE by ORG for Human Rights , Mr PERSON , following his visit to GPE from DATE ( CommDH(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) , states in respect of reception of migrants including asylum seekers :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The framework for the reception of migrants remains largely unchanged since the last visit of the Commissioner \u2019s predecessor to GPE in DATE . As noted in the DATE report , asylum seekers in GPE can be referred to different types of accommodation , including CARAs ( ORG d\u2019accoglienza per richiedenti asilo , open first - reception centres for asylum seekers ) , CDAs ( ORG di accoglienza , reception centres for migrants ) and ORG ( ORG di primo soccorso ed accoglienza , first aid and reception centres ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerns have been raised about the conditions in some of the reception centres . For example , having visited a ORG during its visit in DATE , ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( ORG ) criticised the fact that this centre was located in prison - like LOC . While the Commissioner is aware that the NORP government defined minimum standards for tenders for the management of these facilities , interlocutors voiced their concern about the high variability in the standards of reception centres in practice , which may manifest itself in , for example : a numerical shortage and a lack of adequate training of staff ; overcrowding and limitations in the space available for assistance , legal advice and socialisation ; physical inadequacy of the facilities and their remoteness from the community ; or difficulties in accessing appropriate information .", "CARDINAL . The inconsistency of the standards in reception centres , as well as the lack of clarity in the regime applicable to the migrants kept in them , became a major concern following the declaration of the \u201c NORP emergency \u201d in DATE . Under the emergency plan , the existing reception capacity was enhanced in co - operation with NORP regions in order to deal with the sharp increase in arrivals from the coasts of GPE ( CARDINAL asylum applications were submitted in GPE in DATE , a more than threefold increase compared to the CARDINAL applications in DATE ) . The Commissioner acknowledges the strain put on the NORP reception system in DATE and commends the efforts of the central and regional authorities to provide the additional reception capacity needed to cope with the effects of the significant increase in migratory flows .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the efficiency and viability of an emergency - based approach to asylum and immigration has been questioned by many interlocutors . The DATE report had already expressed particular concerns over the provision of legal aid , adequate care and psychosocial assistance in the emergency reception centres , and over difficulties relating to the speedy identification of vulnerable persons and the preservation of family unity during transfers . These concerns are still valid , and human rights NGOs pointed to reports of significant problems at some of these facilities , in particular in GPE and GPE . Delays and a lack of transparency in the monitoring of these centres have also been reported , both by NGOs and ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the effects of the end of the emergency period foreseen on DATE , the Commissioner welcomes the information provided by the Minister of the ORG that the examination of the outstanding asylum applications ( estimated at CARDINAL ) will be concluded before that date . He was informed that PERCENT of applicants having arrived during the emergency period were granted protection . The Commissioner also commends the significant efforts of the NORP authorities to improve the examination procedure applied by ORG , within which ORG is represented , noting however that the lack of expertise of some members of these commissions is perceived to be a problem .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the Commissioner understands that there will be no further support for recognised beneficiaries of international protection beyond this date , the authorities considering that the vocational training they will have received by then will allow them to integrate if they choose to remain in GPE . The Commissioner is concerned about this eventuality , in the light of the serious shortcomings he identified in the integration of refugees and other beneficiaries of international protection ( see below ) . He received no information about the position of persons whose judicial appeals to a negative asylum decision will still be ongoing by DATE .", "CARDINAL . As noted in the DATE report , an additional feature of the NORP system is the ORG ( ORG di protezione per richiedenti asilo e rifugiati ) , a publicly funded network of local authorities and non - profit organisations , which accommodates asylum seekers , refugees or other beneficiaries of international protection . In contrast to CARAs and emergency reception centres , which tend to be big institutions hosting significant numbers of persons at CARDINAL time , the ORG is composed of CARDINAL smaller - scale projects and was seen by the Commissioner \u2019s interlocutors to function much better , as it also seeks to provide information , assistance , support and guidance to beneficiaries to facilitate socio - economic inclusion .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the capacity of this network , which represents a second level of reception after the frontline reception centres , is extremely limited ( CARDINAL places ) in comparison to the numbers of asylum seekers and refugees in GPE . As a result , asylum seekers are often kept in CARAs for extended periods of time , as opposed to being transferred to a ORG project after the completion of identification procedures as originally intended . In some cases this could last DATE , whereas it has been reported to the Commissioner that asylum seekers received under the emergency reception plan have stayed in reception centres even beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner observes that the problem of the living conditions of asylum seekers in GPE has been receiving increasing attention in other ORG member states , due to the growing number of legal challenges by asylum seekers to their transfer to GPE under LAW . He notes that a series of judgments by different administrative courts in GPE have suspended such transfers , owing notably to the risk of homelessness and a life below minimum subsistence standards . ORG has also been receiving applications alleging possible violations of LAW as a result of GPE transfers to GPE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In their written comments on this report , the NORP authorities stated :", "\u201c As far as the interventions in favour of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection are concerned , GPE has implemented a strategy aimed at granting the highest possible level of autonomy to beneficiaries which is necessary to their integration in the territorial context . This was achieved thanks to actions aimed at strengthening the existing system . The strategy also meets the requirement of strengthening social cohesion , which is one of the specific priorities of the national strategic framework underlying all ordinary and extraordinary public investments .", "The general objective identified by GPE is therefore unifying the various reception measures existing on the territory ( ORG for Asylum Seekers and Refugees , Territorial Projects of the Protection System for Asylum Seekers and Refugees , Metropolitan Multifunctional Reception Centres , as well as any other type of resource existing on the territory ) in a single national system .", "More specifically , the reception system of asylum seekers is mainly subdivided into CARDINAL phases \u2013 a first reception phase provided by a type of government facilities , namely ORG ) and a second one provided by the facilities of ORG ) , which are run by ORG .", "The resources necessary to finance the entire system are drawn from ORG ( ORG ) run by ORG , established by Law No .

In DATE and DATE several NORP administrative courts granted interim relief in cases concerning transfers to GPE . According to the \u201c Dublin II Regulation National Report \u201d on GPE , published in DATE by the NORP network for technical cooperation on the application of the Dublin II Regulation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) has appealed all of the few judgments which obliged it to invoke the sovereignty clause by taking over responsibility for an asylum request from the country of first abode and , so far , the NORP constitutional court has not suspended any transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its ruling no . CARDINAL given on DATE , concerning the complaint that the transfer from GPE to GPE of an NORP asylum seeker would breach the latter \u2019s rights under LAW , the Acting President of Chamber IV of ORG ( Conseil du contentieux des \u00e9trangers / PERSON vreemdelingen - betwistingen ) decided to suspend the removal order issued against the appellant . After having extensively cited the relevant principles in the ORG \u2019s case - law under the ORG , it held :", "\u201c QUANTITY . ... The general information added to the file by the applicant shows \u2013 at this stage of the proceedings \u2013 to a sufficient degree that currently there are serious problems in GPE as regards the manner in which asylum seekers are being treated . Although press reports and/or general reports do not in itself suffice for finding a violation of LAW , it appears in the instant case that the [ NORP Deputy Minister for Asylum and Migration ] , in taking her decision in which she refers to the responsibility of GPE as to the processing of the asylum request , has not sufficiently taken into account the precarious situation of asylum seekers since the events in GPE .", "The appellant further correctly points out that , since the NORP authorities failed to reply to the transfer request , there is no formal approval by the NORP authorities from which it could ( implicitly ) be derived that he will be given suitable reception .", "It follows that the applicant seems to have an arguable claim based on LAW . The grounds for appeal , in so far as they allege a violation of LAW , thus appear to be serious at this stage of the proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG and GPE examined \u2013 in the case of EM ( GPE ) and others v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL \u2013whether the return of any of the CARDINAL appellants to GPE , either as an asylum - seeker or as a person already accepted as a refugee there , would entail a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of LAW . The appellants claimed that GPE \u2019s system for the reception and settlement of asylum - seekers and refugees is in large part dysfunctional , with the result that anyone arriving or returned there , even if they have children with them , faces a very real risk of destitution .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered this question in the light of the materials adduced by the parties , including \u201c Recommendations on Important Aspects of Refugee Protection in Italy \u201d as published in DATE by the ORG ; a report of PERSON , ORG Commissioner for Human Rights , issued in DATE following a formal visit to GPE in DATE ; reports from ORG ( deriving from a joint NORP and NORP NGO visit to GPE in DATE ) , from ORG ( a NORP NGO , based on the same visit in DATE ) , from ORG ( a NORP NGO which visited GPE at about the same time ) , from ORG ( in a report entitled ORG , sponsored by the ORG and ORG , updated to DATE ) , from a specialist lawyer , PERSON ( DATE ) , and from CARDINAL other specialist lawyers , PERSON and PERSON ( Critical Aspects of ORG in GPE , DATE ) . It summarised the parties\u2019 position as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Home Secretary has put a substantial body of evidence before the court describing GPE \u2019s system for the processing , reception , accommodation and support of asylum - seekers and refugees . We will come in due course to the legal materiality both of this evidence and of the countervailing evidence of the CARDINAL claimants which is summarised above . In essence , as set out in the NORP government \u2019s ORG exhibited to the witness statement made in [ CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cases ] by [ ... ] , ORG NORP liaison officer , it is as follows .", "CARDINAL . Asylum seekers are accommodated in a reception centre for long enough for ORG to evaluate their claims . If accepted as refugees , or while awaiting a decision , they are given an international protection order and assigned to a \u2018 territorial project\u2019 which forms part of ORG , the national system for the protection of asylum - seekers and refugees . ORG will either provide accommodation or transfer the claimant to a public or private local provider . Access to ORG is by referral only . It provides food and lodging and courses designed to assist integration , but ( with few exceptions ) the limit of stay there is DATE . On leaving , claimants can apply to charitable or voluntary providers but there is no guarantee of success . However , the international protection order affords access to free healthcare and social assistance ( which does not extend to social security ) equivalent to that enjoyed by nationals . This requires a fiscal code number , which in turn depends on having an address which can be verified by the police . An international protection order also allows the holder to take employment or undertake self - employment , to marry , to apply for family reunification , to obtain education , to seek recognition of foreign qualifications , to apply for public housing and , after DATE , for naturalisation . For those denied these rights , there is , says [ the representative of the ORG Secretary ] , access to the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON case is that this may be the system in theory , but their own experience and that of many others , to which independent reports attest , is that it is not what happens in reality to a very considerable number both of asylum - seekers and of recognised refugees . In short , they say , GPE \u2019s system for the reception and settlement of asylum - seekers and refugees is in large part dysfunctional , with the result that anyone arriving or returned there , even if they have children with them , faces a very real risk of destitution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although acknowledging that the NGO reports before it gave a great deal of support to the accounts given by CARDINAL of the appellants of their own experiences in GPE , ORG found :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The decision of ORG of ORG in GPE v GPE has set a threshold in GPE II and cognate return cases which exists nowhere else in refugee law . It requires the claimant to establish that there are in the country of first arrival \u2018 systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers ... [ which ] amount to substantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment ... \u2019 .", "CARDINAL . In other words , the sole ground on which a second state is required to exercise its power under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL to entertain a re - application for asylum or humanitarian protection , and to refrain from returning the applicant to the state of first arrival , is that the source of risk to the applicant is a systemic deficiency , known to the former , in the latter \u2019s asylum or reception procedures . Short of this , even powerful evidence of individual risk is of no avail .", "CARDINAL . The totality of the evidence about GPE , although it is extremely troubling and far from uncritical , does not in our judgment come up to this mark . While undoubtedly at a number of points it either overtly alleges or powerfully suggests systemic failure , it is neither unanimously nor compellingly directed to such a conclusion . At least equal , if not greater , weight has to be accorded to the far more sanguine \u2013 and more recent - ORG report , echoed as it is , albeit more faintly , by the PERSON report . While what amounts to a systemic deficiency must to a considerable degree be a matter of judgment , perhaps even of vocabulary , the evidence does not demonstrate that GPE \u2019s system for the reception of asylum seekers and refugees , despite its many shortcomings and casualties , is itself dysfunctional or deficient . This is so whether one focuses on the body of available reports on GPE or the comparative findings in GPE about GPE .", "CARDINAL . It has to follow that the CARDINAL claims before the court , despite their supporting testimony of individual risk , are incapable of succeeding CARDINAL on the present evidence , and that the ORG Secretary is therefore justified in that respect in certifying them . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
