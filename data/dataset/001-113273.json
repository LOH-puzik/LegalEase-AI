Despite the measures announced in the responses of the NORP authorities to the recommendations made by the ORG in its CARDINAL previous reports , the delegation could not identify any noticeable improvements in the conditions of detention of the ITTs visited ...

The majority of ITTs visited were overcrowded . For example , in ORG , CARDINAL persons were being held in cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 and in several cells there were more persons than beds .", "CARDINAL . In all the ITTs visited , access to natural light was obstructed by dense metal netting on the windows or jalousies and the artificial lighting was , in general , insufficient . Reading of any kind was a strain on the eyes . The ventilation was inadequate and the air in the cells visited heavy . The lack of ventilation was exacerbated by the fact that the cells tended to be fetid , detainees being provided with neither products for cleaning their cells nor the possibility of washing themselves other than in a basin of cold water . Only in ORG did all detainees have the possibility of a shower during their stay . Further , the sanitary facilities in nearly all the ITTs visited left something to be desired . A notable exception was PERSON , where the delegation noted the cells were clean and the detainees possessed basic hygiene products .", "In several ITTs there was an insufficient quantity of mattresses and blankets for all the detainees , while the cleanliness of those available was questionable .

In the light of the unacceptable conditions referred to above , the ORG was all the more concerned to learn that a significant number of detainees were being held in ITTs for periods much longer than DATE legal limit .", "...", "CARDINAL . The ORG has already welcomed the measures taken by the NORP authorities in response to the immediate observation made by its delegation . Notwithstanding those measures , the NORP authorities still have some way to go to fulfil their responsibility to detain persons deprived of their liberty under conditions fully consistent with human dignity . It is clear that , in order to achieve lasting improvements , the highest priority should be given to the objective of reducing overcrowding . Only then can the efforts made by the NORP authorities be expected to bear fruit . However , certain steps must be taken in the interim in order to ameliorate the situation . Consequently , the ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to take , without further delay , the following steps already identified in its CARDINAL previous reports :", "- ensure that all persons detained in ITTs are :", "supplied with essential personal hygiene products and have the opportunity to wash DATE ;", "able to take a warm shower on arrival and at least once DATE during their period of detention ;", "given the necessary products to keep their cells clean and hygienic ;", "authorised to receive parcels from the very outset of their detention .", "- ensure that detained persons , in all ITTs , are provided with reading matter ( if the establishment does not have a library , detained persons should be authorised to receive newspapers or books from relatives ) ;", "- review the regulations and practice concerning detainees\u2019 contact with the outside world . \u201d", "The relevant parts of the report read :", "\u201c b.

In addition , there were now CARDINAL exercise areas . However , there were numerous allegations that access to those areas was limited to TIME or so .

There was , however , CARDINAL important deficiency , namely the absence of an outdoor exercise yard .", "Elsewhere , material conditions were very mediocre . In reality , the descriptions in the previous reports still very much apply .

The toilets in the cells were not properly partitioned off , if at all , and the sinks were in a bad state of repair .
