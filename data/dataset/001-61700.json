He argued that the facts of the case had been elucidated : there were CARDINAL more witnesses to be questioned . There was hence no risk of him obstructing the investigation .

Detention was therefore lawful under LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , under which persons charged with serious intentional crimes had to be detained , barring special circumstances . There had to be real facts establishing that there was no risk of the applicant absconding , re - offending or hindering the investigation for the exception of LAW to apply .

The length of detention was no reason to deviate from the strict requirements of LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the trial hearing which took place on DATE the applicant again applied for release .
