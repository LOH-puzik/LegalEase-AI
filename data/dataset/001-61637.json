According to some linguists , although the NORP language is relatively unaffected by regional variations , it is possible to identify CARDINAL regional varieties : Kashubian and Silesian .

From DATE to DATE a census \u2013 the National Population and Housing Census \u2013 was carried out in GPE . Its purpose was to gather data relating to the distribution of the population , demographic and social factors , employment , standards of living and housing .

Subsequently the Katowice Regional Court , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on associations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , served a copy of the applicants ' application , together with copies of the relevant enclosures , on the Governor ( Wojewoda ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor of GPE , acting through ORG ( PERSON ) , submitted his comments on the application to the court . Those comments contained lengthy arguments against allowing the association to be registered , the main thrust of which was as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) It can not be said that there are ' NORP ' [ ORG ] , in the sense of representatives of a distinct ' Silesian nationality ' . ' Silesian ' is a word denoting a representative of a local ethnic group , not a nation . This is confirmed by paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the memorandum of association , which aims merely to ' awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of NORP ' . ...", "( ii ) NORP The social research relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the existence of a ' Silesian nationality ' does not accord with numerous other scientific publications . NORP sociology distinguishes between CARDINAL concepts of ' homeland ' , namely a ' local homeland ' and an ' ideological homeland ' . In NORP , this distinction is expressed by the terms PERSON ( local homeland ) and PERSON ( ideological homeland ) . The research relied on by the applicants merely refers to the self - identification of the inhabitants of GPE , indicating that their local self - identification takes precedence over their national self - identification . ...", "( iii ) Paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association states that any person of Silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the association , but does not clearly specify the criteria for establishing whether or not a given person fulfils this requirement . This absence of unambiguous criteria is contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( i ) and ( iv ) of the PERSON on associations . Moreover , it renders paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the memorandum unlawful , for that provision allows ORG to deprive a person of his membership in the event of failure to satisfy the conditions set out in the memorandum of association . ...", "( iv ) Paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association , which calls the ORG an ' organisation of the NORP national minority ' , is misleading and does not correspond to the facts . There is no basis for regarding the NORP as a national minority . Recognising them as such would be in breach of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the [ former ] LAW , which guarantee NORP citizens equal rights . In particular , under the relevant provisions of the PERSON on elections to the PERSON [ ] of CARDINAL DATE [ ORG wyborcza do PERSON Polskiej \u2013 ' LAW ] , registration of the ORG would give it a privileged position in terms of distribution of seats in ORG . The ORG would obtain rights and privileges guaranteed to national minorities in respect of education in their native language and access to the media . Registration of the association would be to the detriment of other ethnic groups in GPE , such as PERSON [ PERSON ] , NORP [ GPE ] and GPE [ NORP ] ; this would amount to a return to the tribalism [ podzia\u0142y plemienne ] which existed prior to the formation of ORG . ...", "( v ) We therefore propose that the memorandum of association should be amended so as to reflect the above observations . In particular , the misleading name of the association should be changed , the criteria for membership should be set out in an unambiguous manner and paragraph CARDINAL should be deleted . In our opinion , these are the conditions for registration of the association . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a pleading in reply to those arguments . They asserted that the fact that the majority of NORP failed to recognise the existence of a NORP nation did not mean that there was no such nation . They cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the NORP formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at DATE ; moreover , the NORP had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group , regardless of whether ORG had belonged to GPE or to GPE . Consequently , any comparison between them and the PERSON or ORG was totally unjustified , because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as national minorities , nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past . Finally , the applicants cited certain letters of ORG that had been published by the press and which explained that ORG PERSON had explicitly stated that a \u201c declaration that a person belongs to a minority shall not be questioned or verified by the public authorities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor of GPE filed a pleading with the court . He maintained his previous position . On DATE he produced CARDINAL letters from ORG ( dated DATE and DATE respectively , and addressed to ORG of GPE ) . The relevant parts of the letter of CARDINAL DATE read :", "\u201c We share your doubts as to whether certain inhabitants of GPE should be deemed to be a national minority . We therefore suggest that you submit your observations to the court , indicating those doubts , and that you ask the court to grant you leave to join the proceedings as a party .", "We suggest that you rely on the fact that the [ ORG Framework Convention for ORG [ ( ' LAW ) ] has not been ratified by GPE , so that its provisions [ do not apply in the domestic legal system ] . ...", "In our view , neither historical nor ethnographical circumstances justify the opinion that the inhabitants of LOC can be recognised as a national minority . \u201d", "The relevant parts of the letter of DATE read as follows :", "\u201c ... The arguments advanced by the provisional management committee of the association [ in their pleading of DATE ] do not contain any new elements ; [ in particular ] ... the [ LAW ] does not constitute the law applicable in GPE .", "Likewise , the letters of ORG [ on the interpretation of ORG PERSON ] do not change the situation .", "The sense of belonging to a nation falls within the realm of personal liberties ; it does not in itself entail any legal consequences . [ By contrast , ] the formation of an organisation of a national minority is a legal fact which entails legal consequences such as , for instance , those referred to in the DATE LAW .", "In the circumstances , the registration of the association called ' ORG could be allowed provided that the existence of such a nation had been established . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted a further pleading to the court . They criticised the arguments of ORG , pointing out that the latter had failed to indicate any legal basis for rejecting their application . In particular , the authorities had not shown that any provision of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law , whereas , under section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on associations , \u201c the [ exercise of the ] right of association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary for ensuring the interests of national security or public order and for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others \u201d . Lastly , the applicants stated that they would not amend the memorandum of association in the manner proposed by the authorities , in particular in respect of the name of the association and the content of paragraph CARDINAL . They agreed , however , to amend paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum and rephrased it as follows :", "\u201c Everyone who is a NORP citizen and who has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of NORP nationality may become an ordinary member [ of the ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an \u201c explanatory hearing \u201d ( posiedzenie wyja\u015bniaj\u0105ce ) aimed at obtaining comments and clarifications from the parties and settling the matters in dispute . The relevant parts of TIME of that hearing read as follows :", "\u201c The representatives of the [ Governor ] declared that the deletion of paragraph CARDINAL from the memorandum of association would not be sufficient , and that they also required a change in the name of the association .", "They referred to the arguments set out in the pleadings filed in the case .", "The representatives of the applicants declared that paragraph CARDINAL was modelled on a similar provision to be found in the statutes of ORG of the province of GPE . ...", "The President urged the representatives of the [ parties ] to make certain concessions in their positions .", "He proposed to the provisional management committee that , for example , they delete paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum . However , the representatives of the committee absolutely refused to do away with this provision .", "The representatives of the [ Governor ] also adopted a harder position , in that they demanded not only the deletion of paragraph CARDINAL , but also a change of the name of the association .", "The CARDINAL sides engaged in a polemic as to whether or not NORP should be recognised as a nation or nationality . ...", "The representatives of the [ Governor ] argued with the applicants , claiming there were no grounds for ascribing Silesian nationality to people .", "[ The hearing was adjourned and subsequently resumed ]", "At this point the representative of the [ Governor ] declared that , if the applicants were to delete paragraph CARDINAL from the memorandum , the [ Governor ] would not object to registration of the association .", "PERSON reacted vehemently to this proposal , but the President told him to think it over .", "In connection with the above , the [ applicants ] asked to be given a time - limit within which they could react in writing to this suggestion and consider the [ Governor 's ] proposal .", "The ORG decided to allow [ the applicants ] DATE in which to react to the proposal of the [ Governor ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a pleading with the court , maintaining that in the course of the above - mentioned hearing the authorities had \u201c de facto acknowledged that a Silesian nation exists \u201d , in particular by accepting the name of the association and certain provisions of the memorandum ( namely paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and paragraph CARDINAL ) . They stressed , however , that the authorities ' insistence on the removal of paragraph CARDINAL was \u201c unjustified and illogical \u201d and , consequently , refused to alter or delete that provision .", "Later , on DATE , the Governor of GPE submitted his final pleading to the court , opposing the registration of the association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting with a single judge and in camera , granted the applicants ' application and registered their association under the name \u201c ORG \u201d . The relevant reasons for that decision read as follows :", "\u201c ... There was a dispute between [ the parties ] over the concepts ' nation ' and ' national minority ' . Finally [ the authorities concerned ] pleaded that the application for registration of the association should be rejected .", "ORG has found that the application is well - founded [ and as such should be granted ] .", "In the preamble to the PERSON on associations , the legislature guarantees [ everyone ] a cardinal right \u2013 the right to freedom of association \u2013 which enables citizens , regardless of their convictions , to participate actively in public life and express different opinions , and to pursue individual interests .", "Freedom of association is CARDINAL of the natural rights of a human being . [ For this reason , ] section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on associations does not establish the right to freedom of association but merely sets out the manner and limits of its exercise , thus reflecting GPE 's international obligations .", "Under LAW ) of the PERSON on associations , the right to form an association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law either in the interests of national security or public safety , or in the interests of public order , or for the protection of health and morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . No other restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the right to associate with others .", "As recently as DATE , in their pleading , the authorities advanced the argument that the registration of the present association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others because it would result in an unequal treatment of other local communities and would diminish their rights .", "This argument is unconvincing , since it does not emerge from the content of the memorandum of association that the future activities of the association are aimed at [ diminishing ] the rights and freedoms of others .", "Under paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association , the aims of the association are [ , for example , ] to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of NORP , to restore NORP culture , to promote knowledge of GPE and to provide social care for members of the association . None whatsoever of these aims is directed against the rights and freedoms of others . The means to be used for accomplishing these aims are not directed against the rights and freedoms of others either . Those means include organising lectures and seminars , carrying out scientific research , establishing libraries , organising cultural and educational activities for members and other persons , carrying out promotional and publishing activities , promoting the emblems and colours of GPE and GPE , organising demonstrations and protest actions , organising sporting events , setting up schools and other educational establishments , conducting business activities and cooperating with other organisations .", "In sum , the argument that the association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others must definitely be rejected . Moreover , it should be noted that this argument refers to [ a mere possibility ] because only practical action taken by the association could possibly demonstrate whether , and if so to what extent , the [ future ] activities of the association would require taking measures aimed at protecting the rights of others .", "As regards the terms ' NORP nationality ' or ' NORP national minority ' , the problems involved in the determination of their proper meaning can not be examined by this ORG in detail .", "ORG must , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on associations , rule on the present application within a period not exceeding DATE from the date on which it was lodged . It is therefore not possible [ in the course of the present proceedings ] to determine such complicated issues ( which involve problems falling within the sphere of international relations ) .", "It is , however , possible to assume , for the purposes of making a ruling in these proceedings , that the nationality of an individual is a matter of personal choice ; moreover , it is a matter of common knowledge that the original inhabitants of LOC constitute a minority in GPE DATE at least for anyone who has ever spent some time in this region and has been willing to perceive this fact . After all , the authorities , although they ' rend their garments ' [ sic ] complaining that the applicants dare establish an association , do not contest the fact that [ the NORP ] are an ethnic minority .", "In view of the foregoing , this ORG , finding that the provisional management committee has complied with the requirements of sections CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL read in conjunction with section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on associations and LAW , holds as in the operative part of the decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor of GPE lodged an appeal with ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) , asking that the first - instance decision be quashed , that the case be remitted to the court of first instance , and that expert evidence be obtained in order to determine the meaning of the terms \u201c nation \u201d and \u201c national minority \u201d . In his appeal , he alleged that the court of first instance had violated sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the PERSON on associations and unspecified provisions of LAW . The relevant grounds of the appeal read as follows :", "\u201c [ The court of first instance ] formally recognised and legally sanctioned the existence of a distinct NORP nation constituting a ' NORP national minority ' .", "In our opinion , such an important and unprecedented ruling , which is of international significance , could not and should not be given without defining the concepts of ' nation ' and ' national minority ' . ORG , leaving this issue aside \u2013 merely because of certain statutory time - limits \u2013 simplified the proceedings in an unacceptable manner . This led , in itself , to a failure on the part of the court to establish all the circumstances relevant to the outcome of the case and , furthermore , provided a sufficient basis for this appeal .", "The appellant admits that NORP law does not define the terms ' nation ' and ' national minority ' . This , however , does not justify the conclusion of ORG that ' the nationality of an individual is a matter of personal choice ' .", "The appellant does not contest the right of a person to decide freely to belong to a national minority ; however , a precondition for making such a choice is the existence of a ' nation ' with which that person identifies himself .", "The decision appealed against proclaims the opinion that the subjective feelings of the person concerned suffice for the purposes of creating a ' nation ' or a ' nationality ' . Having regard to the potential social repercussions of such an approach , it is not possible to agree with it .", "In these circumstances , prior to making any decision on the registration of the ' Union of People of Silesian Nationality ' , it is necessary to determine whether a ' Silesian nation ' exists \u2013 a distinct , non - NORP nation \u2013 and whether it is admissible in law to create a ' NORP national minority ' .", "In the appellant 's opinion , there are no objective arguments in favour of the finding that a distinct NORP nation exists . In case of doubt , ... this question should be resolved by obtaining evidence from experts .", "In the contested decision , the lower court focused in principle on determining whether the aims of the association and the means of accomplishing those aims were lawful . ... The appellant does not contest the majority of these aims ; it must be said that such activities as restoring NORP culture , promoting knowledge of GPE or providing social care for members of the association are worthy of respect and support . However , these aims can be fully accomplished without the contested provision of the memorandum of association , namely paragraph CARDINAL ... In addition , the applicants were not prevented from incorporating the above - mentioned aims into the memorandum of an existing association called ' Movement for the Autonomy of Silesia ' [ PERSON ] , the more so as the applicants belong to influential circles of the latter organisation .", "The fact that the applicants have failed to do so but [ instead ] are creating a new association , and are describing themselves as a ' NORP national minority ' , clearly demonstrates what their real objective is . In fact , their objective is to circumvent the provisions of LAW , under which parties or other organisations standing in elections must reach a threshold of PERCENT or PERCENT of votes in order to obtain seats in ORG . ...", "Legal acts \u2013 including the act of adopting a memorandum of association \u2013 are null and void under LAW if they aim at evading or circumventing the law . According to legal theory , defects in legal acts , as defined in LAW , may constitute a basis for refusing to register an association .", "Sanctioning the rights of the ' NORP national minority ' amounts to discrimination against other regional and ethnic groups or societies . This will be the case at least as regards electoral law and will be contrary to LAW . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the appeal on DATE . The prosecutor at ORG ( Prokurator Apelacyjny ) appeared at the hearing and asked the court to grant him leave to join the proceedings as a party intervening on behalf of the Governor of GPE . Leave was granted . The court next heard addresses by the appellant , the prosecutor ( who requested the court to set aside the first - instance decision and reject the applicants ' application ) and the representative of the applicants . On DATE the court set aside the first - instance decision and rejected the applicants ' application for their association to be registered . The reasons for that decision included the following :", "\u201c ... The lower court , by registering the association under the name ' ORG , approved paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association , which states that the ORG is an organisation of the NORP national minority . We therefore agree with the appellant that the ORG , on the basis of the above - mentioned paragraph , would have the right to benefit from the statutory privileges laid down in section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . ...", "Furthermore , recognising the NORP as a national minority may also result in further claims on their part [ for privileges ] granted to national minorities by other statutes . ...", "Contrary to the opinion expressed by the lower court , it is possible to determine whether or not the NORP constitute a national minority in GPE ; it is not necessary to obtain expert evidence in that connection .", "Under LAW , facts that are common knowledge , that is , those which every sensible and experienced citizen should know , do not need to be proved . Common knowledge includes historical , economic , political and social phenomena and events .", "It is therefore clear that at present no legal definition of ' nation ' or ' national minority ' is commonly accepted in international relations . ...", "On the other hand , an ' ethnic group ' is understood as a group which has a distinct language , a specific culture and a sense of social ties , is aware of the fact that it differs from other groups , and has its own name .", "NORP ethnographic science of DATE describes ' NORP ' as an autochthonous population of NORP origin residing in GPE \u2013 a geographical and historical region . At present , as a result of political and social changes , the term ' NORP ' refers equally to immigrants who have been living in this territory for several generations and who identify themselves with their new region of residence . It also refers to the NORP - speaking population , linked with GPE by [ such factors as ] birth , residence and tradition ( see the encyclopaedia published by ORG in DATE ) . ...", "The applicants derive the rights they claim from the principles set out in the [ LAW ] , stating that every person belonging to a national minority has the right freely to choose to belong or not to belong to such a minority . ... In relying on NORP standards , they fail , however , to remember that a national minority with which a given person identifies himself must exist . There must be a society , established on the basis of objective criteria , with which this person wishes to identify . No one can determine his national identity independently of a fundamental element , which is the existence of a specific nation .", "It emerges from the above - mentioned definition of a ' nation ' that a nation is formed in a historical process which may last for DATE and that the crucial element which forms a nation is its self - identification , that is to say its national awareness established on the basis of the existing culture by a society residing on a specific territory .", "Certainly , the NORP belong to a regional group with a very deep sense of identity , including their cultural identity ; no one can deny that they are distinct . This does not , however , suffice for them to be considered a distinct nation . They have never commonly been perceived as a distinct nation and they have never tried to determine their identity in terms of [ the criteria for a ' nation ' ] . On the contrary , the history of GPE unequivocally demonstrates that the autochthonous inhabitants [ of this region ] have preserved their distinct culture and language ( the latter having NORP roots from an ethnic point of view ) , even though their territories were not within the borders of the NORP State and even though they were under strong NORP influence . They are therefore NORP DATE in the sense of [ inhabitants of the ] region , not in the sense of [ their ] nationality . Thus , GPE , in its ethnic roots [ sic ] , remained NORP ; that was , without a doubt , demonstrated by CARDINAL uprisings . The role played by the NORP in building and preserving the NORP character of GPE , even though they remained isolated from their homeland , is unquestionable .", "However , a given nation exists where a group of individuals , considering itself a ' nation ' , is in addition accepted and perceived as such by others . In the common opinion of NORP citizens , both the NORP and other regional groups or communities [ for example , the ORG or the NORP ] are perceived merely as local communities . In the international sphere , GPE and , similarly , GPE and GPE are perceived as single - nation GPE , regardless of the fact that there exist distinct ethnic groups ( for example , the inhabitants of GPE or PERSON in GPE , or the inhabitants of GPE in GPE ) .", "On the whole , sociologists agree that the NORP constitute an ethnic group and that the autochthonous inhabitants [ of LOC ] do have some features of a nation but that those features are not fully developed . That ... means that the awakening of their national identity is still at a very early stage . A nation exists only when there are no doubts as to its right to exist . ... In GPE , national minorities constitute only a small part of society , that is to say PERCENT . They include DATE and this has never been denied NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP , NORP , GPE , NORP and NORP .", "In the NORP tradition , national minorities are perceived as groups linked to a majority outside GPE ; in other words , a minority is an ethnic group that has support amongst a majority [ residing ] abroad . Moreover , traditionally , our society has not considered that groups which preserve a distinct culture but which do not belong to any ORG can be deemed to be national minorities . Accordingly , for a long time the GPE people were regarded as an ethnic , not a national group . ...", "The applicants ' opinion that the mere choice of the individual concerned is decisive for his nationality is reflected in paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association . Acceptance of this opinion would consequently lead to a situation in which the aims pursued by the association could be accomplished by groups of members who did not have any connection or links with GPE and who had become members of the Union solely to gain an advantage for themselves . Undoubtedly , such groups of members can not [ be allowed ] to accomplish the aims of an association of a national minority . ...", "The applicants have relied on the results of sociological research carried out in DATE in the province of GPE . Indeed , the research demonstrates that PERCENT of persons requested to declare their ethnic and regional identity replied that they were NORP . However , it transpires from [ the material collected in the course of another piece of sociological research of DATE which was submitted by the applicants during the appeal hearing ] that DATE the number of persons who considered themselves to be ORG had decreased to PERCENT and that , moreover , the majority of inhabitants of the province of GPE considered themselves to be NORP ( that is , PERCENT , including PERCENT who stated that they were ' NORP ' ; PERCENT of inhabitants considered themselves to be NORP , including PERCENT who stated that they were ' NORP ' ) .", "In the light of the above research , it can not be said that such a poorly established self - identity of a small ( and decreasing ) group of NORP , as demonstrated by their refusal to declare that they belong to the [ NORP ] nation , provides a basis for recognising that all NORP ( who have lived in LOC for generations and state that they belong to the NORP nation ) constitute a separate nation . This would be contrary to the will of the majority , a will well known to the applicants .", "We therefore find that the appellant is right in submitting that granting the applicants ' application for their association to be registered is unjustified because the memorandum of association is contrary to the law , namely LAW . Indeed , the application is aimed at registering an organisation of a minority which can not be regarded as a national minority and at circumventing the provisions of the DATE LAW and other statutes conferring particular privileges on national minorities . Granting such a request could lead to granting unwarranted rights to the association in question . This would , moreover , give it an advantage in relation to other regional or ethnic organisations .", "In these circumstances , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the PERSON on associations and LAW , read in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure and section CARDINAL of the PERSON on associations , the appeal must be allowed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law ( kasacja ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) . They alleged that ORG had wrongly interpreted the relevant provisions of the PERSON on associations and that the impugned decision had contravened LAW , LAW . Their arguments are summarised as follows :", "\u201c Since a refusal to register an association could be justified only if an activity specified in the memorandum of association was banned by the law , the principal issue to be determined by ORG was whether the memorandum of the applicants ' association complied with the statutory requirements . That was clearly not the case and the court 's fear that the registration of the applicants ' association would in future lead to discrimination against other national or ethnic minorities was based on mere speculation . In any event , the PERSON on associations [ in sections PERSON ) , CARDINAL et seq . ] provided for various means whereby the activity of an association could be supervised by the competent ORG authorities or , in the event that its activity was unlawful , the association could be dissolved .", "However , ORG , instead of assessing the formal requirements of the registration , decided at the outset that the core issue in the proceedings was to establish whether a NORP nation existed . It consequently went on to lay down its own arbitrary and controversial definition of ' nation ' and ' national minority ' , and finally concluded that there was no ' NORP nation ' . It did so without any effort to obtain expert evidence in respect of such an important matter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor of GPE filed a pleading in reply to the applicants ' appeal on points of law . The relevant arguments are summarised as follows :", "\u201c The refusal to register the applicants ' association was fully justified . In the course of the proceedings at first instance , the Governor eventually proposed that the applicants amend paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum of association and alter the name of their association by deleting the word ' nationality ' . Those arguments were based on section MONEY ) ( i ) of the PERSON on associations , which provides that a memorandum of association should enable the association in question to be differentiated from other associations . This means that the name of an association should not be misleading . Since the requirement set out in the above - mentioned section was not complied with , the refusal to register the applicants ' association was justified under section PERSON ) .", "It must be stressed that even in the explanatory report to the [ Framework Convention ] it is clearly stated that the individual 's subjective choice to belong to a national minority is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to the person 's identity . That means that a given nation must exist prior to the individual making a decision to belong to this nation . That being so , the applicants ' application for their association to be registered must be seen as a thoughtless and incomprehensible attempt to exploit the distinct characteristics [ of the NORP ] with a view to achieving political aims . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor at ORG filed a pleading in reply to the applicants ' appeal on points of law . He submitted , among other things , that it was clear that the content of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law since it explicitly stated that the Union was an association of a national minority , and thus ignored the fact that the NORP could not be regarded as a minority of that kind . The NORP , being merely an ethnic group , could not exercise the rights conferred on national minorities , in particular those referred to in the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicants ' appeal on points of law . The relevant parts of the reasons for this decision read as follows :", "\u201c ... [ A ] necessary prerequisite for the registration of an association is the conformity of its memorandum of association with the entire domestic legal order , including conformity with [ the provisions of ] international treaties ratified by GPE .", "In the present case ORG had no doubts as to the lawfulness of the aims pursued by [ the applicants ' ] association , but refused to register the association for the sole reason that [ the applicants ] , in the memorandum of association , used such terms as ' NORP nation ' and ' NORP national minority ' .", "We agree with the opinion [ of ORG ] . ' National minority ' is a legal term ( see LAW DATE ) , although it is not defined either in NORP law or in the conventions relied on in the appeal on points of law . However , the explanatory report to the [ LAW ] states plainly that the individual 's subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his or her national identity . That means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question . ...", "An individual has the right to choose his or her nation but this , as ORG rightly pointed out , does not in itself lead to the establishment of a new , distinct nation or national minority .", "There was , and still is , a common perception that a NORP ethnic group does exist ; however , this group has never been regarded as a national group and has not claimed to be regarded as such . ...", "Registration of the association , which in paragraph CARDINAL of its memorandum of association states that it is an organisation of a [ specific ] national minority , would be in breach of the law because it would result in a non - existent ' national minority ' taking advantage of privileges conferred on [ genuine ] national minorities . This concerns , in particular , the privileges granted by LAW ... such as an exemption from the requirement that a party or other organisation standing in elections should get PERCENT of the votes , which is a prerequisite for obtaining seats in ORG ... [ or ] ... privileges in respect of the registration of electoral lists ; thus , it suffices for an organisation of a national minority to have its electoral lists registered in CARDINAL constituencies [ whereas the general requirement is to register an electoral list in CARDINAL of the constituencies in the whole of GPE ] .", "Pursuant to the relevant ruling of ORG [ PERSON ] on the interpretation of LAW , ... the privileges [ referred to above ] are conferred on electoral committees of registered national minorities and , in case of doubt [ as to whether or not an electoral committee represents a national minority ] , ORG may request evidence .", "The simplest means of proving the existence of a specific national minority is to present a memorandum of association confirming that fact . It is true that , under LAW , resolutions of ORG on the interpretation of statutes no longer have universally binding force ; however , in view of the persuasiveness of the reasons given by ORG and the requirements of practice , [ we consider that ] a memorandum of association still remains basic evidence demonstrating the existence of a national minority .", "Conferring on the NORP , an ethnic group , the rights of a national minority would be contrary to LAW , stating that all persons are equal before the law , [ because ] other ethnic minorities would not enjoy the same rights .", "The memorandum of association is contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( iv ) of the PERSON on associations , which stipulates that a memorandum of association must set out rules concerning acquisition and loss of membership , and the rights and duties of members . Paragraph CARDINAL of the memorandum provides that everyone who is a NORP citizen and has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of NORP nationality may become a member of the ORG , whereas paragraph CARDINAL states that a person ceases to be a member of the Union if , inter alia , he has not fulfilled the membership requirements set out in the memorandum of association . Since no Silesian nation exists , no one would lawfully be able to become a member of the Union , because his declaration of Silesian nationality would be untrue . ...", "Furthermore , it must be pointed out that the refusal to register the association does not contravene GPE 's international obligations . Both LAW ... and the LAW allow [ the ORG ] to place restrictions on the freedom of association , [ in particular such as ] are prescribed by law and are necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security or public safety or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights of others .", "It is contrary to public order to create a non - existent nation that would be able to benefit from the privileges conferred solely on national minorities . Such a situation would also lead to the infringement of the rights of others , not only national minorities but also all other citizens of GPE . Granting privileges to a [ specific ] group of citizens means that the situation of the other members of society becomes correspondingly less favourable .", "This is particularly so in the sphere of election law : if certain persons may become members of ORG [ because of their privileged position ] , it means that other candidates must obtain a higher number of votes than what would be required in the absence of privileges [ in that respect ] .", "It also has to be noted that the essential aims of the association can be accomplished without the contested provisions of the memorandum and without the [ specific ] name of the association . Under the provisions of LAW , national and ethnic minorities have equal rights as regards their freedom to preserve and develop their own language , to maintain their customs and traditions , to develop their culture , to establish educational institutions or institutions designed to protect their religious identity and to participate in the resolution of matters relating to their cultural identity ( see LAW ) . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

This solution reflects a certain understanding of the equality principle that involves entities participating in elections being given equal opportunities ... This amounts to discrimination in favour of electoral committees of registered national minority organisations in comparison with other electoral committees .
