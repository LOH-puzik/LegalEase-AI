The applicant was born on CARDINAL DATE and at the time of his most recent communication with the ORG was detained in PERSON ( previously PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Early on the morning of DATE PERSON , a night security guard at a shop in PERSON , was found dead and partially undressed at her place of work , with injuries on her head and genitals . It was established that a grinder tool had also gone missing . The prosecutor \u2019s office instituted criminal proceedings on DATE and over DATE proceeded to interview a number of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE QUANTITY police officers arrived at the applicant \u2019s home and asked him , at the time sixteen years of age , and his father to go to the police station with them .", "CARDINAL . Once at the police station , the applicant was separated from his father and questioned as to whether he had any information about the grinder which had disappeared from the shop . According to the applicant , then the police had started urging him to plead guilty to the murder and theft . According to him , as he repeatedly denied those allegations , CARDINAL officers allegedly beat him on various parts of his body and threatened him that he would be raped in prison .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time DATE the applicant \u2019s father and grandfather , who lived in the same house as the applicant , made statements to the police about the presence of the grinder in their house . The father stated that the applicant had apparently brought the grinder home around the time of the murder and had originally told him that a stranger had been offering the grinder for sale . On learning that the police were searching for a grinder , the applicant had told him the story he had told the police ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . However , in the applicant \u2019s story as retold by the father , the grinder was found in a different street . On hearing this , the father had hidden the grinder . The grandfather \u2019s account of events was similar to the father \u2019s . On DATE the police also obtained a statement of PERSON , the applicant \u2019s friend , about the time they had spent together on TIME of the murder and the circumstances under which they had parted .", "CARDINAL . From TIME the police went to the place where the applicant \u2019s father had hidden the grinder . The father pointed to where the grinder was and the police seized it .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant signed a document explaining his rights as a suspect , including the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer before his first questioning . When signing the document , the applicant added that he did not object to PERSON representing him . The applicant alleged that he had mistakenly understood that PERSON had been asked to appear on his behalf by his parents . In fact , PERSON had been asked to represent the applicant by the investigator .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the Qualifications Commission of the Bar of GPE , at the time the highest authority in charge of the advocates\u2019 qualifications and discipline , examined the applicant \u2019s GPE complaint concerning the procedure used in the appointment of ORG established that there was no evidence that PERSON had been appointed through a bar association , as required by law , in particular there was no order of the bar association or agreement with the client appointing PERSON It also established that there was no evidence that the investigator had issued a formal decision appointing PERSON as the applicant \u2019s lawyer , as he had been required to do by law .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was questioned in the presence of L. He stated that on TIME of the murder he had been walking home after TIME out with friends . He had observed a stranger running down the street with a grinder and had started running after him . Once the man had dropped the grinder , the applicant had picked it up and run away . When he had brought the grinder home he had said to his father that someone had been offering to sell a grinder . When he had learned DATE that a night security guard had been killed and that grinders had been stolen , he had revealed the truth to his father , who had then hidden the grinder .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was examined by a forensic medical expert , who concluded that he had several light injuries that had been inflicted DATE before the examination .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the investigator PERSON drew up an arrest report , whereby the applicant was arrested on suspicion of NORP \u2019s murder . According to the report , the applicant was being arrested on the grounds that \u201c eyewitnesses indicate the person who committed the crime \u201d . According to the Government , the applicant \u2019s parents were informed of the applicant \u2019s arrest at that time . According to the applicant , no such notification was made .", "CARDINAL . At the same time most of the applicant \u2019s clothes were seized for a forensic examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father was taken to the family home to accompany the police during a search .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the police completed the search of the applicant \u2019s home , seizing some clothes . According to the applicant it was only then that the police officers who had conducted the search brought replacement clothes from the applicant \u2019s home to the police station .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was left handcuffed at the police station , wearing just his underwear , for the entire period from the seizure of his clothes until the end of the search and return of the police officers who conducted it , feeling very cold and vulnerable . During that time police officers continued urging the applicant to confess to the murder and beat him with plastic water bottles .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicant was placed in a cell in the police \u2019s temporary detention facility with CARDINAL adult detainees , PERSON , born in DATE , and O. , born in DATE , who were at the time registered as suffering from drug addiction . O. had also been suffering from tuberculosis and had had a prior conviction ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . It is unclear whether the applicant knew of the above background of his codetainees at the time he had been held with them .", "According to the applicant , the CARDINAL other detainees were secret police informants . They advised the applicant that as he was a minor and if he chose to cooperate the investigative authorities would prosecute him on less serious charges and he would not receive a real prison sentence .", "PERSON was diagnosed with tuberculosis in DATE . O. and PERSON died in DATE respectively , the former allegedly of an overdose and the latter of a disease .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant continued to be detained in the cell with NORP and PERSON until a court detention order arrived on DATE and he was transferred to the remand prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on TIME of CARDINAL DATE QUANTITY police officers took him out of his cell without registering it . They threatened to make sure he got a long prison sentence , to charge him with rape , which would lead to him being raped and harassed in prison by other inmates , and to create \u201c problems \u201d for his family , unless he confessed . Unable to withstand such pressure , the applicant agreed to copy by hand a statement prepared for him by the police officers , acknowledging his guilt for murder in \u201c self - defence \u201d .", "According to the authorities , on TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant asked to see the officer in charge of the police detention facility .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then made a handwritten statement of surrender to Officer PERSON , the head of the police detention facility . In his statement , the applicant noted that early on DATE , while in a state of alcoholic intoxication , he had decided to burgle the shop . Having suddenly run into the victim , who had tried to attack him with a grinder , he had defended himself and had hit her with a brick . When she had become unconscious , the applicant , scared of what had happened , had carried her to a couch and had undressed her to make it look as though there had been a rape . Then he had picked up the grinder and taken it home .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE the applicant repeated the above confessions in a formal questioning session in the presence of his lawyer , L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , unaccompanied by PERSON , was taken to an identification parade , where PERSON , a shop assistant who had been working on a TIME shift at a kiosk close to the scene of the crime on TIME of the murder , picked the applicant out of a CARDINAL - person line - up as the person she had seen by her kiosk shortly before NORP had been killed . In the course of CARDINAL of the subsequent trials ORG stated that she had not identified the applicant with total certainty but had merely thought that there was a resemblance between him and the person she had seen that night .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with murder without aggravating circumstances and theft . Accordingly , his procedural status changed from that of \u201c suspect \u201d to \u201c accused \u201d . Questioned on DATE in the presence of L. the applicant repeated his previous confession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody pending the completion of the investigation . That decision was not appealed against and became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s cellmates , PERSON and NORP , were released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from the police detention facility to the remand prison in GPE ( at the time Artemivsk ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned in the presence of B. , a lawyer engaged by his parents . He stated that he confirmed his prior statements about the murder . In the course of the subsequent investigation he was again questioned in the presence of the same lawyer and made detailed statements that repeated his confession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission of psychologists and psychiatrists produced a report at the request of the investigator concerning the applicant \u2019s mental state at the time of the crime and at the time of his examination by the experts . The experts concluded , in particular , that the applicant , according to his own account , had committed the killing in self - defence , without premeditation and through an unexpected confluence of circumstances . As a result , he had suffered a serious shock and confusion . At the remand prison he had suffered from sleep troubles , fear , and confusion and had displayed inappropriate behaviour . When examined by a prison psychiatrist he had been diagnosed with an acute reaction to stress , put in the prison \u2019s medical wing and treated with sedatives , which had helped .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial , conducted in the presence of his lawyer PERSON . and his mother acting as a lay defender , the applicant confirmed the account of the attack on NORP which he had given in the course of the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of murder without aggravating circumstances and theft and sentenced him to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by his parents and a new lawyer , PERSON , appealed against the judgment . Additional appeals were also lodged by them on later dates . In the appeals the applicant retracted his confessions as false . He and his representatives alleged that the confessions had been extracted from him under physical and psychological pressure from the police , namely that he had been subject to \u201c physical pressure \u201d , \u201c threats and beatings \u201d , \u201c moral and physical influence \u201d , that his statement of surrender \u201c resulted from beatings \u201d ( \u201c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u201d , \u201c \u0443\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 , \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u201d , \u201c \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u201d , \u201c \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u201d respectively ) . According to him , he had been told that unless he confessed to murder he would be falsely accused of rape making his life in prison extremely difficult . He stated that CARDINAL cellmates at the police detention facility also urged him to confess . He also noted that he had kept to his initial confessions until his conviction because his cellmates and the police had told him that the police would make his life difficult in prison if he told anyone of the pressure on him . On the other hand , they had assured him that if he chose to cooperate with the police they would make sure the charges against him were not serious and that he would be released from custody right after his trial . Accordingly , he had said nothing to his lawyers about his ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor also appealed , in particular arguing that the sentence was excessively lenient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the judgment of DATE and returned the case for further investigation . The court noted that the judgment had been poorly reasoned . As far as the motives for the applicant \u2019s actions were concerned , it had also been based heavily on the applicant \u2019s confessions , without sufficient corroboration from other evidence . The description of the crime scene , for instance that the lock had been sawn off rather than broken off , had not matched the trial court \u2019s conclusion , based on the applicant \u2019s account , that the applicant had simply been exploring the shop out of curiosity . The victim had also had unexplained injuries on her genitals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on several subsequent occasions the investigators attempted to question the applicant within the framework of the further investigations . However , he refused to answer any questions and denied any involvement in the crimes he had been charged with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the investigator reclassified the charges against the applicant from simple murder to aggravated murder for gain , and from theft to robbery . The applicant was also charged with theft of a friend \u2019s cell phone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG released the applicant from custody , finding that a further extension of his detention would be in breach of the applicable procedural time - limits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s case was submitted for a retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again remanded the applicant in custody . It held that while the applicant had no prior convictions and had positive character references , he had no employment and had been charged with grave offences . Accordingly , it held that detention was necessary to prevent the applicant from absconding or interfering with the investigation and to ensure his compliance with procedural decisions . No time - limit for his detention was fixed in that decision or in those made on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , and CARDINAL DATE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the case for further investigation and ruled that the applicant should remain in custody . The court based its decision on the gravity of the charges which , according to the court , made the applicant likely to abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s case was submitted to ORG for a retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again sent the case back for further investigation and , without giving reasons , ruled that the applicant should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of robbery and the murder of NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the conviction , returning the case for further investigation . ORG also ruled that the applicant should remain in custody . It gave no reasons for the latter part of its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the case , which in the meantime had been re - submitted to it , for further investigation . It also ruled that the applicant should remain in custody . By way of reasoning it stated that there were no grounds to order his release given that , in view of the gravity of the charges against him , it could not be ruled out that the applicant would attempt to abscond . On DATE ORG quashed that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG committed the applicant for trial and ruled that he should remain in custody for the same reasons as given in the order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the final retrial the applicant denied any involvement in the attack on NORP and said that he had found the grinder , describing essentially the same circumstances as on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . To explain the presence of his fingerprint in the shop where the victim had been killed he stated that he had bought cigarettes there on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of robbery and aggravated murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In particular , it made the following findings .", "( a ) It found established that the applicant had broken into the shop intending to burgle it , had discovered NORP sleeping , had repeatedly hit her on the head with a brick and then , after she had become unconscious , had inserted the neck of a vodka bottle into her vagina .", "( b ) In finding the applicant guilty , the court referred to various pieces of evidence , including forensic examinations , witness statements and the applicant \u2019s confessions \u201c given by him when questioned as a suspect and as an accused \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and the presence of the applicant \u2019s fingerprint at the crime scene . In particular , the trial court referred to the pre - trial identification of the applicant by witness Y. and to the testimony of GPE , who had seen the applicant near the shop around the time of the murder . The court considered the applicant \u2019s explanation for the presence of his fingerprint in the shop unconvincing since he had first mentioned the supposed visit to the shop on DATE in the course of the retrial and had not previously mentioned that visit .", "( c ) The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that his confessions had been inadmissible because they had been obtained under duress . It noted in particular that there was no evidence that the applicant had suffered any physical injuries at the hands of the police . Moreover , the applicant had consistently repeated his confessions in the presence of his lawyers , mother , and psychiatric experts in the course of the first investigation and trial . His parents had voluntarily paid the victim \u2019s burial costs . Still , the applicant \u2019s confessions had only partially reflected the truth . In particular , according to the forensic and other evidence , NORP had been raped with a vodka bottle , which was not in line with the applicant \u2019s initial statements that he had accidentally killed her after being surprised by her and had then run away almost immediately .", "( d ) The absence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer from the identification parade on DATE had not breached the applicant \u2019s defence rights since he had not made any statements on that occasion and had simply been physically shown with other men in the line - up to the witness Y. through a CARDINAL - way glass partition . It had been Y. , and not the applicant , who had actively participated in that investigative measure , and therefore it had not had any impact on his chosen defence strategy . Moreover , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions , ORG \u2019s statements concerning the applicant \u2019s presence near the crime scene on TIME of the murder had been consistent with the statements of other witnesses .", "( e ) On an application by the defence the court ruled certain expert evidence inadmissible .", "( f ) While the statement in the arrest report that \u201c eyewitnesses indicate the person who had committed the crime \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been technically incorrect in the applicant \u2019s case , the discovery of the grinder in the applicant \u2019s home had in fact constituted an independent legal basis for his arrest . Accordingly , ORG refused to declare the applicant \u2019s arrest unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal to ORG the applicant gave the account of alleged ill - treatment by the police set out above . He stressed , however , that he had managed to withstand most of the pressure from the police . What had made him finally agree to plead guilty to a murder he had not committed had been the threat that he would be charged with rape and that that would lead to him being raped in prison . That threat had had a particularly strong impact on him given that he had already been made to spend TIME in a state of undress and vulnerability . He had chosen the false confession as a lesser evil . He had then maintained his confession throughout the trial because he had been assured by the lawyer PERSON , who had good relations with the investigator in charge of the case , that the trial court would reclassify the charges against him from murder to a lesser charge of a \u201c killing committed while exceeding the limits of legitimate defence \u201d . He had hoped that such a reclassification would allow him to get probation instead of an actual prison sentence . It was not true that , as stated by ORG , he had repeated his confession to psychiatrists . In fact the investigator had assured him that the psychiatric assessment was prearranged to allow for reclassification and its results would be worded accordingly . The applicant had not talked to the experts and his mother assured him that she had arranged for the psychiatrists\u2019 report to be worded in such terms that it may justify reclassification of charges against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above judgment and it became final .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant first raised his allegations of illtreatment in his appeals against his first conviction ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In those appeals his allegations were framed in rather general terms and were limited essentially to allegations of \u201c beatings \u201d and \u201c psychological pressure \u201d . He also stated , more specifically , that he had been told that , unless he confessed , charges of rape would be brought against him and this would make his life in prison extremely difficult .", "Afterwards the applicant \u2019s parents also lodged complaints about his alleged ill - treatment with the prosecutor \u2019s office . It appears that the applicant \u2019s mother lodged first such complaints on DATE and DATE . The ORG has not been provided with copies of those complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office , in response to the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s complaint of DATE , refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the applicant \u2019s complaints for lack of a corpus delicti in the police ORG actions , concluding that there was no evidence of any physical or psychological illtreatment . The prosecutors referred essentially to the lack of medical evidence of any injuries suffered by the applicant at the time of the alleged ill - treatment and the lack of any complaints from him before his first conviction . The prosecutors also stated that there had been no irregularities in the applicant \u2019s placement and holding in the police detention facility and that O. and PERSON with whom the applicant had been placed at that facility had had no prior convictions .", "CARDINAL . In the course of examination of the case against the applicant , on DATE , the applicant complained to the trial court about the beatings , handcuffing , stripping and the threats of prison rape he had allegedly been subjected to by the police . On DATE the trial court ordered the prosecutor \u2019s office to investigate the allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings essentially on the same grounds . No mention was made of the applicant \u2019s placement with adults in the detention facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother complained to the regional prosecutor \u2019s office , reiterating her allegations that the applicant had been physically ill - treated by the police , left in a state of undress and handcuffed and threatened that he would be charged with rape and would , therefore , be raped in prison . She referred to her previous complaint of DATE on the same subject and complained that she had received no satisfactory answer to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office overruled the decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings , essentially on the same grounds as in its previous decisions . The prosecutors stated , with no further explanation , that there were no irregularities in the course of the applicant \u2019s placement and holding in the police detention facility . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office overruled that decision as premature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings essentially on the same grounds . No mention was made of the applicant \u2019s detention with adults . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , other decisions refusing to institute criminal proceedings were taken , the most recent CARDINAL on DATE . The copies of those decisions have not been provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office wrote to the applicant \u2019s father in response to his complaint . It said that the records of local medical institutions showed that at the time the applicant had been placed in the cell with O. the latter had been registered as suffering from tuberculosis but , according to his file , he had not posed a danger of infection to others . He had been admitted to hospital in DATE to treat his tuberculosis . O. had had a conviction at some point in the past but his conviction had been considered sufficiently old to have been considered expunged by time the applicant had been detained with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office wrote to the applicant \u2019s father , again in response to his complaint , stating that the placing of adult arrestees in the same cell with the applicant , a minor , had been in breach of domestic law ( section CARDINAL of ORG ) and had constituted a disciplinary infraction on the part of the police officers who had taken that decision . However , they could not be disciplined because the DATE limitation period for disciplinary measures had expired . The prosecutor \u2019s office also confirmed that the applicant \u2019s cellmates were at the time registered as drug users ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
