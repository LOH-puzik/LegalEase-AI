The applicant had been working as a police officer and was suspected of having obtained by fraud a number of sick leave certificates justifying his absence from work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was placed on the list of wanted persons by ORG of the Interior .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest . On DATE an international arrest warrant was issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the NORP police with a view to his extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Odessa ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , following an application from the prosecution authorities , remanded the applicant in custody for DATE pending the extradition procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE or DATE ( both dates are mentioned in different case - file materials ) ORG of Ukraine ( \u201c the GPOU \u201d ) received a request from its NORP counterpart about the applicant \u2019s extradition and the extension of his detention pending extradition . As noted in that request , there were criminal proceedings against the applicant pending in GPE on suspicion of fraud . The extradition request did not contain any further details in that regard , but mentioned that \u201c a detailed description of the charges against [ the applicant was ] in the enclosed documents \u201d . It is not known what enclosures were attached to the request in question .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the judicial ruling of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that on CARDINAL DATE the ORG received another request from the NORP prosecution authorities about the applicant \u2019s detention and extradition . There is no mention of that request in any other documents in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention \u201c pending resolution of the issue of his extradition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed that application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He complained that he had not been familiarised with the charges against him , that no time - limit for his detention had been set , and that ORG had announced the contested decision following a hearing at which he had not been present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG of Appeal examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in a hearing at which CARDINAL prosecutors were present , but in the absence of the applicant . The prosecutors submitted that the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE was all but settled and would take place shortly thereafter . Having regard to those arguments and noting that an international arrest warrant had been issued in respect of the applicant , the appellate court upheld the lower court \u2019s decision extending his detention pending extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG of Odessa ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for an extension of the applicant \u2019s \u201c extradition detention \u201d pursuant to the legislative amendments to LAW in force since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the above application and ordered that the applicant \u2019s extradition detention be extended \u201c pending resolution of the question of his extradition and the actual transfer \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the above ruling . He submitted that the time - limits for his detention remained unspecified , that he was still unaware of the charges against him , that his detention had been unreasonably long and that the court had not taken into account the fact that he had CARDINAL young children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG of Appeal allowed his appeal in part . It quashed the aforementioned ruling on the grounds that the respective provision of LAW did not provide for any extension of extradition detention . The case was remitted to the first - instance court for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s request for a lawyer to be appointed for him . As a result , the hearing was adjourned till DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a new application with the court for the applicant \u2019s extradition detention pursuant to the amendments to LAW . This time it concerned the imposition of such detention , rather than its extension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a hearing in the presence of the lawyer appointed for the applicant , allowed the prosecutor \u2019s application . The ruling mentioned that the NORP prosecution authorities had lodged a request for the applicant \u2019s extradition on CARDINAL DATE , without any reference to the similar request of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The court relied on the aforementioned ORG amendments effective since DATE and stated that the extradition inquiry case - file materials complied with the applicable legislation . Lastly , the court noted that it had not established any impediments to the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his detention was unlawful and asked to be released . The case file does not contain a copy of this complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE sent an updated extradition request in respect of the applicant , of which there is no copy on the case file . It appears that , in addition to the initial fraud charge , CARDINAL other counts of fraud were imputed to the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to extradite the applicant to GPE in connection with CARDINAL episodes of fraud but rejected the extradition request in respect of CARDINAL such episode . That decision was explained by the fact that NORP criminal law normally does not prescribe imprisonment as a penalty for fraud . However , where fraud has been committed repeatedly , it can be punished by imprisonment . In the applicant \u2019s case there were CARDINAL \u201c repeated fraud \u201d episodes . The ORG decision referred to CARDINAL extradition requests relating to the applicant : CARDINAL of DATE regarding CARDINAL episode of fraud and CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE regarding CARDINAL further episodes ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his detention was unlawful and had been unreasonably long . He argued that the NORP authorities had not been diligent in dealing with the extradition requests in his respect , in contravention of LAW ( f ) of the LAW . The applicant further referred to LAW and submitted that his earlier complaint , of QUANTITY DATE , had never been examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged another complaint with ORG concerning the alleged unlawfulness of his detention and asked to be released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for an extension of the applicant \u2019s extradition detention . It referred to the aforementioned decision of DATE and noted that the issue of the applicant \u2019s actual transfer back to GPE was being decided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted that application in a hearing attended by the applicant . It noted that the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had not been challenged and had come into force . Furthermore , pursuant to the respective prosecutor \u2019s instructions , the applicant was to be transferred to GPE by DATE . As reported in TIME of the hearing , the judge read out the applicant \u2019s complaints of QUANTITY DATE and of DATE , and the applicant reaffirmed them . The court ruling did not , however , mention those complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the above ruling on appeal . He noted that , while the Code of Criminal Procedure provided for extradition detention of DATE , it did not establish any time - limits for submitting and examining the associated extradition request . Accordingly , the applicant argued that the NORP authorities should abide by the DATE Minsk Convention , which provided for a DATE time - limit for submitting an extradition request once the person was detained and a maximum DATE extension of that time - limit for supplementing the extradition request if need be ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He emphasised that in his case a duly completed extradition request had not been submitted until DATE , whereas he had been in detention since DATE . The applicant therefore argued that he should be released immediately . Lastly , he submitted that the charges against him were ridiculous and that it was in his own interests to go to GPE so that his trial could be completed without delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appellate court , while allowing the applicant \u2019s appeal in part , modified the first - instance court \u2019s ruling as follows : instead of the extension of the applicant \u2019s extradition detention , which was not provided for in the legislation , his continued detention was found to be lawful , since its maximum time - limit of DATE had not been exceeded and there were no grounds for the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL .
