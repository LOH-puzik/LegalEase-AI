ORG noted that a copy of the first instance judgment in LANGUAGE was furnished to the applicant on DATE , whereas the term for submitting an appeal had expired on DATE . ORG found that this fact had constituted a breach of domestic criminal procedure . The cassation court also noted , however , that the above irregularity had been remedied by the appellate court which had granted the applicant DATE to supplement his appeal . The case had then been examined by ORG based on the applicant \u2019s revised appeal .", "On DATE the applicant died of a heart disease ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
