NORP The applicant , PYROBATYS , a.s . v re\u0161trukturaliz\u00e1cii ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , is a joint - stock company established under the laws of GPE with its head office in GPE .", "The applicant company was represented before the ORG by Mr \u0160. GPE , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was established in DATE in the legal form of a limited - liability company with the name of ORG , ORG . It later changed its legal status to that of a joint - stock company under the name of ORG , a.s . It then entered the process of restructuring , which is reflected in its name , as indicated in paragraph CARDINAL above . The restructuring was concluded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE separate contracts were entered into between a joint - stock company , A. , and , respectively , the applicant company and a limited - liability company B. ( \u201c the contract \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the contract A. let property to the applicant company and B. in return for payment of rent . The property consisted of an administration building , factory LOC and garages . Leases were concluded for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) declared PERSON , which had meanwhile changed its name , insolvent and appointed a receiver .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE B. was merged with the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company and company ORG had the same address , which was formerly also the address of company B. It appears from a publicly available official source ( http://www.orsr.sk ) that there were also ownership and personal connections between these companies .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , acting through the intermediary of its receiver , unsuccessfully requested an amicable settlement with the applicant company in respect of an amount of money that was allegedly owed by the latter by way of outstanding rent under the contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting through its receiver , sued the applicant company before ORG s\u00fad ) for payment of rent under the contract .", "CARDINAL . The claimant sought an order for the payment of the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) and a ruling to the effect that neither party be awarded costs .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite the claimant \u2019s failure to pay the court fees , ORG went on to examine the action , inter alia by seeking the applicant company \u2019s written observations in reply to the action and in respect of expert evidence , as well as by twice hearing the action on its merits .", "CARDINAL . To defend the action the applicant company appointed an advocate , for whose services up to DATE it paid him the equivalent of some EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG had ordered that the claimant pay the court fees , amounting to the equivalent of some ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimant requested an exemption from the obligation to pay the court fees on the ground that , being insolvent , it had no means to pay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request of CARDINAL DATE . No copy of the decision was served on the applicant company . Despite a specific written request , to which they have responded , the respondent Government have failed to provide the ORG with a copy of this decision and of any other documents or information enabling the ORG to ascertain the decision \u2019s content .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE could have been challenged by way of an appeal on the part of the claimant , in the absence of which it became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By way of an order that was served on the claimant on DATE , it was again asked to pay the court fees . No payment was made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing of the action held on DATE , ORG discontinued the proceedings and ruled that no party was entitled to have its costs reimbursed . The ruling has the procedural form of a decision ( uznesenie ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the claimant had neither been granted an exemption from the obligation to pay the court fees nor had it paid the court fees , despite having been ordered to do so . ORG held that , in such circumstances , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) , the action could not be examined .", "CARDINAL . As to the ruling on costs , ORG observed that :", "- the action had not been withdrawn ,", "- the situation was not such as to call for an examination of procedural responsibility for the discontinuation of the proceedings ( LAW no . PERSON . , as amended - \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and for the application of the criterion of success in the proceedings ( LAW ORG ) ,", "- LAW ORG was to be applied , which allowed for moderation of the repercussions of the rules on costs ,", "- the case was \u201c exceptional and worthy of particular consideration \u201d in terms of LAW ORG , in view of the circumstances in which the contract had been concluded and the fact that the validity of the contract was being examined in another set of proceedings before ORG , which had the aim of securing vacant possession of the LOC in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against the ruling on costs , claiming compensation in an amount equivalent to some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of legal representation and costs reimbursable under the applicable statutory rules , plus the costs of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company contended that ORG findings of fact were erroneous and that its conclusions were not susceptible of review on account of lack of reasoning .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant company submitted that its costs were the responsibility of the claimant , who had provoked them . LAW ORG could only be applied in situations which fell within the purview of CARDINAL of the remaining rules on costs , if all conditions for their application had been met , but their application would produce an intolerable outcome . In so far as ORG had referred to the other set of proceedings , in which the validity of the contract was to be examined , their subject matter was in fact not the validity of the contract but the amount of the rent set out in it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the relevant part of ORG decision . The ruling has the procedural form of a decision ( uznesenie ) , in which ORG found that :", "- ORG had erred in making reference to the criterion of success in the proceedings ( LAW ORG ) ;", "- the rule that would normally have had to be applied was that costs are to be borne by the party which had caused the discontinuation of the proceedings ( LAW ORG ) ;", "- ORG had been right in taking account of the financial standing of both parties ;", "- in view of the circumstances the question of the validity of the contract , which was being examined in another set of proceedings , could be considered a ground \u201c worthy of particular consideration \u201d ;", "- by applying LAW ORG the first - instance court had rightly moderated the repercussions of the application of LAW ORG for the claimant , whose only objective was to realise and distribute fairly its estate in insolvency ;", "- ORG was also of the opinion that \u201c the amount of the costs would not have existential consequences for [ the applicant company ] and would not jeopardise its property holdings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The complaint was directed against ORG decision of DATE , the applicant company arguing that that decision had violated its rights to a fair hearing , procedural equality and protection of property , as well as prohibition of discrimination .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicant company contended that the amount at stake in the proceedings was rather significant from its perspective and that it had accordingly needed to acquire legal representation . It also advanced the following arguments .", "CARDINAL . ORG conclusion concerning the lack of dramatic effects of the costs ruling on the applicant company was without any foundation in fact and evidence whatsoever and , as such , plainly arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . The claim for reimbursement of costs was independent of the financial standing of the party making it . In so far as financial standing of a party was to be taken into account , it was only the standing of the party that would otherwise be liable to reimburse another party \u2019s costs .", "CARDINAL . As regards the claimant , at the relevant time it had been the owner of real property .", "CARDINAL . There was no statutory provision for exemption of an insolvent claimant from obligation to pay court fees and neither was there any provision exempting it from reimbursement of procedural costs it had itself provoked .", "CARDINAL . In the present case the claimant had been liberated from responsibility for the consequences of its actions and the burden of this responsibility had arbitrarily been placed on the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . In other words , the applicant company \u2019s property holdings had been interfered with , in that it had been denied a proprietary claim without any legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that there had been no violation of the applicant company \u2019s rights in issue .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant company had no right to a favourable outcome of the litigation it had been a party to . The reasons given by ORG for its decision were such that any arbitrariness was ruled out . On the one hand , it had upheld the reasons given by ORG , and on the other it had reinforced those reasons by adding further reasons of its own , in particular the reasons related to the financial standing of both parties to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG observed that the decision not to exempt the claimant from the obligation to pay the court fees was not the subject matter of the present proceedings and that the relevant circumstances might have changed between that decision and the contested decision not to award the applicant company reimbursement of its costs .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant company had contended that ORG had drawn conclusions concerning its financial standing without actually examining that standing , ORG reiterated that , as a matter of principle , it had no power to examine whether the ordinary courts had adequately established and assessed the facts . It emphasised , in particular , that \u201c [ CARDINAL fact that the applicant company disagreed with ORG view could not give rise to a conclusion that the latter was manifestly ill - founded or arbitrary , nor did it provide for a basis for ORG to substitute its own legal opinion for that of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with its existing doctrine , ORG held that since there had been no violation of the applicable procedural rights of the applicant company , by definition there could not have been any violation of the applicant company \u2019s substantive proprietary rights . In those circumstances , there was no basis for the prohibition of discrimination to be applied either .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court shall decide complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ORG finds a complaint justified , it shall deliver a decision stating that a person \u2019s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph CARDINAL have been violated by a final decision , specific measure or other act and shall quash such a decision , measure or act . If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which has violated the rights or freedoms to take the necessary action . At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order that authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision on a complaint ORG may grant appropriate financial compensation to a person whose rights under paragraph CARDINAL have been violated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , at the request of the party concerned , the party to the proceedings may be fully or partly exempt from the obligation to pay court fees where it is justified by the situation of that party and provided that the claim at issue is neither frivolous nor clearly devoid of any prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . A party which has been entirely successful is to be awarded costs necessary for purposeful assertion or defence of its rights against the unsuccessful party ( LAW ) . In the event of success in part , the costs are normally to be split proportionally ( LAW ) . However , even in the event of success in part , full award of costs may be granted if the party was unsuccessful in merely a negligible proportion or if the scope of the substantive claim depended on expert evidence or judicial discretion ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A party which is liable for the necessity of discontinuing proceedings is obliged to reimburse the costs of such proceedings ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time , provides that :", "\u201c If there are reasons worthy of particular consideration , the court exceptionally does not need to award reimbursement of costs or their part . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a commentary on LAW , with reference to a previous yearbook of judicial decisions , the view was expressed that , when assessing \u201c reasons worthy of particular consideration \u201d , regard should be had to personal , proprietary , income and other circumstances applying to all parties to the proceedings , and also the circumstances which caused the parties to assert their rights before the court , as well as to their attitude in the proceedings ( see PERSON s\u00fadny poriadok , PERSON a kolekt\u00edv , ORG , spol.s r.o . , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The position described in the preceding paragraph forms part of settled case - law ( see , for example , judgment ( rozsudok ) of ORG in case file no . M Cdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of ORG of DATE in case file no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL , decision ( uznesenie ) of ORG of DATE in case file no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL and decision of ORG of DATE in case file no . QUANTITY M Cdo CARDINAL ) .", "In the decisions quoted , the courts also opined that the application of LAW must be rather exceptional and adequately reasoned . The existence of the special circumstances has to be established on the basis of the situation of all parties to the proceedings . It is necessary to take into account not only the situation of the person liable to pay the costs but also the impact of the decision refusing the reimbursement of costs on the property of the party who is entitled to reimbursement under normal circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Court fees are collected , inter alia , for individual procedural steps or for proceedings before the courts , provided that these have to be initiated by an application ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The fee payer ( poplatn\u00edk ) is the person making the application for a procedural step which is subject to court fees if the tariff scale provides that the fee is payable on the making of the application ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The duty to pay the court fees arises when the application is made , if made by the fee payer ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) . In such a case , the court fees become payable at the same time ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . If the court fees payable on the making of an application have not been paid , the first - instance court is to order the fee payer to pay the fees within DATE , usually DATE . If the fees have not been paid within this period , the court is to discontinue the proceedings ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
