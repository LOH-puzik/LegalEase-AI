The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application he was detained in PERSON prison , GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL PERSON ) ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of aggravated robbery in conjunction with aggravated extortion by means of coercion , committed jointly with further perpetrators ( gemeinschaftlicher schwerer ORG in GPE schwerer r\u00e4uberischer PERSON ) , and imposed an accumulated prison sentence ( Gesamtfreiheitsstrafe ) of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The crimes were committed in GPE on DATE and in PERSON on DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG found it established that in TIME of DATE the applicant , acting jointly with an unidentified accomplice and according to a previously agreed plan , entered by force into an apartment in GPE and robbed its occupants . The men were aware that the apartment was used for prostitution and expected its CARDINAL female occupants to keep valuables and cash in there . They had passed by the apartment in TIME in order to make sure that no clients were present . Shortly afterwards they rang at the door of the apartment which was attended by its tenant PERSON After having overpowered PERSON by force the applicant threatened her with a gas pistol that resembled a real gun ordering her to keep silent . He then went to the kitchen where he found the further occupant of the apartment PERSON , a NORP national who lived and worked there as a prostitute . Pointing his gas pistol at ORG he forced her to hand over her mobile phone . While his accomplice was watching over the QUANTITY women , the applicant searched the apartment for valuables and found CARDINAL further mobile phones as well as CARDINAL ( ORG ) in ORG \u2019s purse . The applicant then threatened to shoot the women should they not disclose where they were keeping any additional money . As a result of his threat PERSON handed over a further LAW which she had kept in the pocket of her jacket . The men then left the apartment with their loot . TIME an acquaintance of PERSON whom she had told about the incident called the police which came to the apartment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the events on DATE , ORG established that the applicant , acting jointly with several accomplices , CARDINAL of whom were the applicant \u2019s co - accused in the proceedings before the court , robbed another apartment located in PERSON . The men acted according to a plan previously set up among the gang . At the relevant time the apartment was occupied by PERSON and PERSON , CARDINAL NORP nationals who were illegally staying in GPE and working in the apartment as prostitutes . O. and P. were friends of PERSON , one of the victims of the crime committed in GPE on DATE , and they had both worked for some time as prostitutes in the GPE apartment rented by PERSON before moving to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE , DATE before the crime , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused together with accomplice NORP passed by O. and P. \u2019s apartment in PERSON with a view to verifying whether the CARDINAL women were its only occupants and whether it contained any valuables . NORP was an acquaintance of NORP and PERSON whom they got to know through their friend PERSON when they had stayed in her apartment in GPE . Hence , the unsuspecting women did not object to the men entering the apartment . Following their visit the CARDINAL men reported to the residual members of the criminal gang that they had spotted a safe in the apartment \u2019s kitchen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant and a further accomplice , PERSON , gained access to O. and P. \u2019s apartment pretending to be potential clients while CARDINAL of the co - accused was waiting in a car parked close to the apartment building and the other co - accused in front of the house . Once inside the apartment B. produced a knife that he had carried along in his jacket . P. , trying to escape from the perpetrators , jumped from the apartment \u2019s balcony located QUANTITY off the ground and ran away . The applicant jumped after her but abandoned the chase after TIME when passers - by appeared nearby on the street . He then called the co - accused waiting in front of the women \u2019s apartment on his mobile phone and gave him an account of the events . He agreed with the latter on a meeting point where the co - accused were supposed to pick him up with the car once accomplice PERSON would have left the crime scene and have joined them . In the meantime inside the apartment , PERSON after having overpowered O. threatened to kill her with his knife should she not disclose where the women kept their money or should she refuse to open the safe for him . Fearing for her life O. opened the safe from which PERSON removed ORG CARDINAL and also handed over the contents of her wallet in the amount of LAW . B. left the apartment at TIME taking the money and P. \u2019s mobile phone as well as the ORG landline phone with him and joined the coaccused . The co - accused and PERSON then picked up the applicant at the agreed meeting point with their car .", "CARDINAL . At TIME O. at the apartment . The women called their friend PERSON in GPE and gave her a brief account of the events . The next day they also told their neighbour PERSON about the crime . DATE the women , afraid of remaining alone in the PERSON apartment , drove to GPE where they stayed DATE with their friend PERSON Following short subsequent stays in GPE am PERSON and back in PERSON they returned to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG based its finding of facts regarding the first crime committed in GPE on DATE on the statements made by the victims NORP and NORP on the occasion of their police interrogations as well as in the course of the subsequent trial . Both witnesses had identified the applicant without any hesitation as the perpetrator who had carried the gun when presented with his photo on the occasion of their police interviews and later when confronted with him personally at trial . ORG found PERSON and ORG \u2019s testimonies to be consistent and credible and noted that they were supported by the statements of the police officers who had attended the crime scene and had interviewed PERSON and NORP in the course of the preliminary investigations and who had all been heard as witnesses during the trial .", "CARDINAL . As regards the establishment of facts in relation to the second crime committed in PERSON ORG relied in particular on pre - trial statements made by the victims O. and P. in the course of police interrogations in the period from DATE and before an investigating judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , dismissing a related objection by the defence , ordered that the records of O. and P. \u2019s interrogations by the police and the investigating judge be read out at the trial and be admitted as evidence in the proceedings in accordance with LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) . The said article provides for such possibility in the event insurmountable impediments make it impossible to hear a witness in the foreseeable future . ORG pointed out in this context that it had not been possible to hear the witnesses in the course of the trial since they had returned to their home country GPE shortly after their interrogations at the investigative stage and all attempts to enable their examination at the main hearing had been to no avail .", "CARDINAL . ORG specified that O. and P. had been summoned to appear before ORG on DATE , DATE of the trial . However , they both had refused to attend the hearing relying on medical certificates dated DATE that indicated their unstable posttraumatic emotional and psychological condition . Consequently , on CARDINAL DATE the court had sent letters to both witnesses asking under what conditions they would be ready to testify at trial . While an acknowledgement of receipt had been returned for both letters , no response had been obtained from PERSON for her part had informed ORG in writing that due to the fact that she was still traumatised by the crime , she would neither accept to appear at the trial in person nor would she agree to be examined by means of an audio - visual transmission . O. had further mentioned that she had nothing to add to her statements made in the course of the interviews before the police and the investigating judge in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless requested legal assistance from the NORP authorities and asked for the witnesses to be heard by a court in GPE and the hearing to be transmitted by voice and image ( audiovisuelle GPE ) . However , a witness hearing scheduled by the competent NORP court for DATE was cancelled shortly before by the presiding NORP judge on the ground that the witnesses , again relying on medical certificates , had demonstrated that they were still suffering from post - traumatic disorders as a consequence of the crime and that a further confrontation with the events in PERSON would risk aggravating their condition . The witnesses had further claimed that following threats by the accused they feared possible acts of revenge .", "CARDINAL . ORG informed their NORP counterpart by a letter dated DATE that according to the standards of NORP law of criminal procedure the reasons advanced by the witnesses were not sufficiently substantiated to justify their refusal to testify . The court suggested to the competent NORP judge to have the witnesses examined by a public medical officer ( ORG ) and , alternatively , to coerce them to attend the hearing .", "CARDINAL . As the letter remained unanswered , ORG considered that it did not dispose of any further legal means to enforce a hearing of O. and P. Having further regard to the fact that the recently renewed medical certificates indicated that the ORG state of health would not change any time soon , ORG concluded that it was impossible to have the witnesses examined in the foreseeable future . Pointing out that courts were under an obligation to conduct proceedings involving the deprivation of liberty expeditiously and in view of the fact that the accused had already been held in custody for a considerable period of time , the court was of the opinion that it could not be justified to further delay the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , a further objection against the introduction of the ORG pre - trial statements by counsel of CARDINAL of the co - accused was rejected by ORG and the records of the witnesses\u2019 police interrogations and interviews with the investigative judge were read out during a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment running to CARDINAL pages , ORG pointed out that in assessing the available evidence it had been aware of the reduced evidentiary value of the records of O. and P. \u2019s pre - trial testimonies . It had further taken into account that neither the applicant nor counsel for the defence had been provided with an opportunity to examine the only direct witnesses of the crime in PERSON at any stage of the proceedings . At the time of the last pre - trial interrogation of NORP and P. on DATE , the applicant had not been informed about the preliminary criminal proceedings initiated against him with a view to not putting the investigations at risk . No warrant for his arrest had yet been issued and he had not been represented by counsel . The investigating judge had excluded the applicant from the hearing in accordance with LAW since he had been concerned that the witnesses would be afraid of telling the truth in the presence of the accused . ORG further emphasised that at the investigative stage there had been no indication that O. and PERSON who had testified on several occasions before the police and then before the investigating judge would refuse to repeat their statements at a subsequent trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that notwithstanding the resulting restrictions for the defence , the trial as a whole had been fair and had complied with the requirements of LAW ( d ) of the LAW . The court was thus not prevented from admitting O. and P. \u2019s pre - trial statements as evidence in the proceedings . It had made considerable efforts to enable a direct examination of O. and P. by the accused and counsel for the defence at trial . Moreover , once the witnesses had proved to be unavailable ORG had ensured that a maximum of further witnesses who had been in contact with O. and P. in relation to the events at issue could be heard at trial . Finally , the court had taken several items of evidence as corroborating PERSON and P. \u2019s pre - trial testimonies into account when assessing their evidentiary value .", "CARDINAL . In ORG opinion the records of O. and P. \u2019s interrogations at the investigative stage showed that they had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the crime . Minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their illegal residence status and activities to the authorities and by the psychological strain they had been subject to during and following the incident . The witnesses had feared problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators . This explained why the witnesses had not pressed charges immediately after the events and why the police had only been informed of the crime on DATE by their friend PERSON As regards O. and P.\u2019s\u2019 failure to identify the applicant when confronted with several photos of potential suspects during the police interrogations , the court observed that the ORG attention during the incident had been focussed on the further perpetrator carrying the knife and that the applicant himself had only stayed a short period of time in the apartment . Their inability to identify the applicant also showed that the witnesses , as opposed to the defence \u2019s allegations , had not testified with a view to incriminating him .", "CARDINAL . In the court \u2019s opinion the fact that the detailed description of the events in the ORG pre - trial statements were consistent with the account they had given the TIME after the crime to their neighbour PERSON , who had been heard as a witness during the trial , was a further strong indication for their credibility and the veracity of their statements . This witness had further testified that on TIME of CARDINAL DATE at TIME another neighbour , an elderly woman who got scared when she heard noise coming from O. and P. \u2019s apartment , had called on her and asked her to accompany her to the women \u2019s flat to investigate what had happened . O. and PERSON had , however , not answered the door when the neighbours were ringing the bell .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that O. and P. \u2019s description of the events also coincided with their friend PERSON \u2019s recollection of her conversations with NORP and PERSON following the crime as reproduced during PERSON \u2019s witness hearing at trial . In addition , the police officers and the investigating judge who had examined ORG and PERSON at the pre - trial stage had all testified at trial that they had found the witnesses to be credible .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that since neither the defence nor the court itself had had an opportunity to observe the main witnesses\u2019 demeanour at trial or by means of an audio - visual examination , it had to exercise particular diligence in assessing the evaluation of the witnesses\u2019 credibility by the police officers and the investigating judge . The court further emphasised that when taking into account the testimonies given by the ORG neighbour PERSON and their friend PERSON it had paid special attention to the fact that their statements constituted hearsay evidence and had to be assessed particularly carefully .", "CARDINAL . In this context it had been of relevance that O. and P. \u2019s testimonies as well as the statements of the further witnesses at trial had been supported by further significant and admissible evidence such as data obtained through tapping of the applicant \u2019s and the co - accused \u2019s mobile phones and by means of a satellite - based global positioning system ( \u201c GPS \u201d ) . Such information had been gathered within the scope of police surveillance measures carried out at the relevant time in relation to preliminary criminal proceedings initiated against the accused on suspicion of racketeering and extortion ( ORG ) in the PERSON drug scene . The link between the evidence obtained in the course of such separate investigations and the crime at issue could only be made after NORP and PERSON had reported the incident of CARDINAL DATE to the police . It followed from the recordings of CARDINAL mobile phone conversations between CARDINAL of the co - accused and the applicant in the evening of CARDINAL DATE at TIME and TIME that the latter had been present in the GPE apartment accompanied by PERSON and that he had jumped from the balcony in order to chase one of the escaping victims whom he failed to capture , while PERSON had stayed in the apartment . Furthermore , an analysis of the GPS data showed that the car of CARDINAL of the co - accused had been parked near the crime scene from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. on TIME of CARDINAL DATE , a period that coincided with the time - frame in which the robbery in issue had occurred .", "CARDINAL . Finally , while the applicant and the co - accused had denied any participation in the robbery as such or any premeditated criminal activity in this respect , their own statements at trial had at least confirmed that CARDINAL of the co - accused together with NORP had visited the apartment at PERSON on TIME before the crime and that the applicant and PERSON had been present in the apartment at the time of the incident the following day . The applicant had testified that he and PERSON had come to the apartment with a view to making use of the women \u2019s services as prostitutes . He further had conceded that he had followed PERSON when she escaped over the balcony and explained that he had done so in order to prevent her from calling the neighbours or the police since he had been afraid of getting problems in view of his criminal record and the problems he had previously had with prostitutes on a similar occasion in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the court \u2019s view the body of evidence taken together gave a coherent and complete overall picture of the events that supported the version provided by witnesses NORP and PERSON and refuted the contradictory statements made by the applicant and the co - accused in the course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG in which he complained that the applicant had not been able to examine the only direct witnesses of the crime committed in PERSON at any stage of the proceedings in breach of LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the Convention . He argued that such inability had been imputable to the domestic authorities . According to ORG case - law counsel had to be appointed for an unrepresented accused if the key witnesses for the prosecution were to testify before an investigating judge and the accused was excluded from this hearing . However , at the time of the witness hearing the applicant had not even been informed about the preliminary proceedings instituted against him and the public prosecution authorities had not requested that defence counsel be appointed for him . Consequently , ORG and P. \u2019s testimonies ought to have been excluded from the trial .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions dated DATE ORG ( ORG ) moved that the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law be dismissed by ORG as manifestly ill - founded in written proceedings pursuant to LAW below ) . ORG argued that while it was true that the proceedings had been characterised by a \u201c complete loss \u201d of the applicant \u2019s right to examine O. and PERSON ( \u201c GPE des Fragerechts \u201d ) , they had as a whole been fair and there had been no reason to exclude the witness statements of ORG and P. as evidence . ORG had assessed the contents of the records of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies read out at trial particularly carefully and critically . Furthermore , it had not made their statements the sole or decisive basis of the applicant \u2019s conviction but had taken further significant evidence into account . In view of the various layers of corroborating evidence the applicant had had ample opportunities to put into question the credibility of the CARDINAL main witnesses and to effectively defend himself . ORG , endorsing ORG related arguments , further pointed out that there was nothing to demonstrate that the restrictions to the defence \u2019s right to examine the witnesses had been imputable to the domestic authorities .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions of DATE the applicant replied to ORG observations and requested ORG to hold a hearing in the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG , referring to CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant complained of a violation of his right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) on the ground that no hearing had been held in the appeal proceedings and that ORG decision rejecting his appeal did not provide any reasons .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s complaint ORG pointed out that any decision dismissing an appeal on the basis of LAW implied a reference to the respective reasoning provided by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decisions of ORG dated DATE and DATE for examination without providing reasons .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the applicant \u2019s submissions that he has meanwhile left prison and returned to his native country GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
