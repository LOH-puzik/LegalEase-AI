AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;Julia Laffranque;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON W.L. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s father was a member of ORG ( ORG , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He died in DATE .", "The statutes of ORG of DATE ( \u201c the DATE statutes \u201d ) provided in its LAW that entitlement to membership would be based , inter alia , on the legitimate descent from a male member . In its LAW , however , the DATE statutes stated that such membership should be suspended , inter alia , in respect of married daughters for the duration of their marriage ( see also \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The applicant , who is married , did not upon her father \u2019s death in DATE apply for membership pursuant to \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE statutes .", "In DATE a woman applied for membership in the ORG after her father , being a member of the ORG , had died . Her application for membership was rejected as she had been married at the time the application for membership was lodged . She appealed and then filed a complaint with ORG . On DATE ORG held that the provision that membership of women was suspended while they were married was discriminatory on grounds of sex . It also held that , in line with its case - law , the statutes of agricultural associations did not have the legal status of an ordinance ( Verordnung ) and that ORG thus did not have the competence to review such statutes directly . As agricultural associations were public - law entities , their statutes were only binding upon an act of public law by the agricultural authorities , namely authorisation of the statutes . Thus the statutes had to be interpreted in conformity with fundamental rights and the basic principles of the LAW , such as the principle of non - discrimination . Any provisions of the statutes that were not in line with those principles would have to be treated as null and void ab initio , as provided for in LAW ( ORG ) . The agricultural authorities had thus erred when finding that the discriminatory provision , according to which membership of women was suspended for the time they were married , was valid and in force . Their decisions to that effect had thus to be set aside .", "Following the decision of ORG held a general meeting and adopted , on DATE , new statutes in order to comply with ORG ruling . On DATE the new statutes were approved by ORG PERSON ) with binding effect as of DATE . The new statutes provided that the key date for defining current members under the new statute was DATE . Furthermore , whereas the right to acquire membership remained the same , the suspension of membership of female married persons had been deleted ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to the ORG in which she applied for membership . On DATE she was informed that her application for membership was refused . The reason given was that the new statutes provided that membership by way of succession could only be derived from persons who were members on the key date of CARDINAL DATE ; since the applicant \u2019s father had died in DATE and thus was not a member on the key date , the applicant could not derive any claim to membership from him .", "Meanwhile , being represented by a lawyer , the applicant applied to ORG on DATE to have the rule on the key date set aside . ORG turned down the application on DATE . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG decided that the applicant ( and several persons who had also challenged the statutes of the Association ) should be accepted as members of the Association . Whereas ORG found that all applicants in the proceedings had failed to submit documentary evidence that they fulfilled all further prerequisites for membership , it found it unjust to refuse membership on those formal grounds .", "The ORG appealed to ORG ( Oberster Agrarsenat ) . On DATE , however ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s appeal .", "The ORG thereafter complained to ORG , which , on DATE , set aside the decision to accept the applicant \u2019s membership . It held that whilst the applicant had been entitled to become a member under the old statutes which would have had to be interpreted in a non - discriminatory way , she had only applied for membership after the statutes had been changed and according to which she was not entitled to membership . The case was returned to ORG for consideration .", "On DATE ORG granted the ORG \u2019s appeal and rejected the applicant \u2019s application for membership . It held that the application for membership had been made too late and that the rejection of her application was therefore justified .", "The applicant complained to ORG , which on DATE refused to deal with the complaint . The applicant applied to have the case transferred to ORG .", "ORG dismissed the complaint on DATE . It held that ORG was bound by ORG decision of DATE . ORG had decided in the light of that decision . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "ORG is situated in GPE PERSON .", "ORG ( Flurverfassungsgesetz ) , governing inter alia agricultural associations , defines agricultural associations as follows :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) ORG agricultural association consists of the totality of the respective owners of the real - estate properties to which participation rights in a real - estate property of an agricultural association attach ( ancestral real - estate properties ) , including those persons who are entitled to person ( \u201c walzende \u201d ) shares . \u201d", "An agricultural association has the legal status of a public - law corporation , but is not endowed with the typical sovereign competences ; it is thus not a state institution , but an association of private persons .
