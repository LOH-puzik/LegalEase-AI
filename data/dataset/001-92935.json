Her complaint read as follows :", "\u201c I request that the President of ORG , PERSON , be charged with a disciplinary offence for exerting unlawful pressure on me in DATE , when I was presiding in the criminal proceedings against PERSON . She demanded that I give an account on the merits of this case while its examination was underway , and that I inform her about the decisions the court was about to take ; she even called me out of the deliberations room for that purpose . [ She ] insisted on removing certain documents from the case file , forced me to forge TIME of the hearing , and also recommended that I ask the lay assessors not to turn up for the hearing . Following my refusal to bow to this unlawful pressure [ she ] removed me from the proceedings and transferred the case to another judge .", "As to the particular circumstances , they were as follows .", "I was appointed to examine the case against GPE and the court , acting in a bench with CARDINAL lay assessors , NORP and NORP , started its examination .", "Having started the trial , the court questioned a number of victims . The public prosecutor who was representing ORG clearly decided that this questioning was not favourable to the prosecution and therefore did everything possible to disrupt the hearing . For no reason he challenged me as a judge , the lay assessors and the whole composition of the court . His motions were made in a manner that was humiliating , offensive and insulting to the court , and were clearly untrue . Soon after his challenge was rejected by the court , ORG President PERSON called me to her office .", "In violation of LAW and section CARDINAL of the Law \u201c On the Status of a Judge in the GPE \u201d , ORG President demanded an explanation from me as to why the lay assessors and I were putting CARDINAL or other question to the victims in the trial and why CARDINAL or another motion by the parties was refused or accepted . In my presence ORG President had a telephone conversation with the [ First Deputy Prosecutor General ] , who had issued the indictment against GPE . PERSON informed [ the First Deputy Prosecutor General ] that the judge was being called to account with regard to what was going on in the proceedings .", "Back in my office I told the lay assessors what had happened . By then they were already reduced to despair by the repeated groundless objections and insulting challenges against them on the part of the public prosecutor , and they therefore considered it impossible to continue to take part in the proceedings . CARDINAL of the assessors , PERSON , was seeking medical assistance due to a health problem . For these reasons they decided to withdraw from the proceedings and to state frankly in their request that the reason for their withdrawal was the pressure put on them by the agent of ORG .", "At the court \u2019s following meeting the lay assessors announced their withdrawal on the above grounds . Their written requests were given to me to be enclosed in the file , and the court adjourned for deliberations .", "I was again called from the deliberations room by ORG President , PERSON . This time she demanded that I explain what we were doing in the deliberations room and what decisions we were going to take . Her main point was that there should have been no mention in the ORG written requests that the reason for their withdrawal was pressure being exerted on the court . ORG President also insisted on excluding from TIME any mention of the behaviour by the public prosecutor which the assessors had regarded as pressure . In essence , PERSON was pushing me to forge the case file . Moreover , she proposed that I ensure that the assessors did not turn up for the hearing , literally \u2018 ask them not to come to the court any ORG . The aim was obvious \u2013 if the assessors [ did ] not appear the proceedings themselves [ would ] fall apart . It seemed that for some reason [ she ] did not want the case to continue to be examined in this composition . The unlawfulness of ORG President \u2019s actions was obvious .", "I followed none of her instructions . The lay assessors\u2019 requests were included in the file , the court allowed their withdrawal and stated that the reason for it was the pressure being applied by ORG . The hearing TIME reflected everything that happened in the proceedings .", "Once I signed [ the minutes ] PERSON withdrew the case from me and transferred it to another judge without stating reasons .", "I consider that such acts on the part of ORG President , PERSON , are incompatible with the status of a judge and undermine judicial authority , and are thus destructive for justice , for which she must be held liable . This is what I hereby request from ORG of GPE . \u201d", "The applicant was not notified of this complaint . In DATE Ms GPE , furthermore , gave CARDINAL radio interview and CARDINAL newspaper interviews reiterating the above allegations and criticism .", "Following this , on DATE PERSON , one of the lay assessors who had , on DATE , withdrawn from the criminal case against the applicant sent a letter to ORG which read as follows :", "\u201c Further to the publication of an interview with judge PERSON ... I decided to write you because I participated in GPE \u2019s case as a lay assessor .", "I entirely support everything judge PERSON said in her interview .", "During the trial the [ public prosecutor ] did everything to prevent the court from hearing the case . He was rude and aggressive to the court ; in his interventions and requests he deliberately misrepresented what was going on in the proceedings , and he repeatedly filed objections to the court \u2019s composition . These motions were made in a humiliating , even obnoxious manner . By doing so he was exerting pressure on the court , to force it to give a judgment that was convenient to him , or , alternatively , to set the court hearing at naught .", "I was appalled by that , but what was my surprise when I learned about the pressure also being exerted on judge GPE by the court President !", "We , the assessors , were there when , during the interval , judge GPE received a phone call from the court President to come and see her . After some time judge GPE returned , she was upset and depressed . To our question she replied that [ the court President ] had accused her that the court was reluctant to examine the case ; that the lay assessors were asking the victims the wrong questions ; and that she had suggested that judge GPE arrange for the lay assessors not to appear at the court proceedings .", "... On TIME ... both PERSON and I decided to withdraw from the proceedings .", "At the start of the hearing on DATE the public prosecutor , before he was called by the court , began with a motion in which he , in essence , again degraded and insulted me by repeating [ a ] comment made by [ the victim ] outside the courtroom about me ... he did not react to the reproof by the judge .", "After that ... I declared that I was withdrawing from sitting in the proceedings on the grounds of the public prosecutor \u2019s rude and offensive behaviour , which could not be defined as anything but pressure on the court . After that PERSON also withdrew .", "Before the trial I had never met anybody [ involved in the proceedings ] : not the judge , not [ the applicant ] , not the public prosecutor , not the defence counsel ; I had no personal interest in the case . The public prosecutor \u2019s behaviour was therefore inexplicable and came as a shock to me .", "At TIME judge PERSON was called out from the deliberations room , where the court was taking a decision . It was the court President who called her . ...", "On DATE ... judge PERSON told us that the court President had shouted at her , demanding that she refrain from enclosing [ the assessors\u2019 ] withdrawal requests in the file and not refer in the court \u2019s decision to the reason for the withdrawal .", "PERSON and I were shocked by what was going on . First it was the public prosecutor who put pressure on us at the hearing , and then it turned out that the [ court President ] joined in .", "What a surprise it was when the [ court \u2019s Deputy President ] came into the deliberations room and started trying to persuade me and PERSON not to comment on the public prosecutor \u2019s behaviour in the court decision , but to state in our requests and in the court decision that we withdrew on medical grounds . She said that they would invite me and PERSON to take part in other proceedings .", "PERSON and I refused to change our requests , and after the Deputy President had left the court issued the decision [ to allow withdrawal ] which reflected what had happened .", "I have been a lay assessor before , I have taken part in several other proceedings , but this was the first time that I came across such pressure being exerted on the court .", "I request you to look into the above events and to take action against the [ court \u2019s President and her Deputy ] . \u201d", "On DATE the other lay assessor who had withdrawn , PERSON , sent a similar letter to ORG .", "Following PERSON complaint of DATE , the High Judiciary Qualification Panel appointed PERSON , a judge of ORG , to examine the allegations against PERSON , ORG President .
