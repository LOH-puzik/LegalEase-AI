In its judgment dated DATE , ORG noted that in LOC CARDINAL countries , including GPE , did not give convicted prisoners a vote , while CARDINAL did not disenfranchise prisoners and CARDINAL imposed a more restricted disenfranchisement . Reference was made to ORG which had rejected a challenge to LAW disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners ( PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ) ; and to NORP precedents , in particular ORG which in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( No . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL SCR CARDINAL ) struck down the disenfranchisement of prisoners as too widely drawn and infringing against the minimum impairment rule and ORG which upheld in PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL CF ) the subsequent legislative provision which restricted the ban to prisoners serving a sentence of DATE or more in a correctional institution . The cases before ORG and this ORG were also reviewed .", "Lord Justice PERSON concluded :", "\u201c ... I return to what was said by ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment in PERSON . Of course as far as an individual prisoner is concerned disenfranchisement does impair the very essence of his right to vote , but that is too simplistic an approach , because what LAW is really concerned with is the wider question of universal franchise , and \u2018 the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u2019 . If an individual is to be disenfranchised that must be in the pursuit of a legitimate aim . In the case of a convicted prisoner serving his sentence the aim may not be easy to articulate . Clearly there is an element of punishment , and also an element of electoral law . As the Home Secretary said , ORG has taken the view that for the period during which they are in custody convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed . ORG said that such prisoners had lost the moral authority to vote . Perhaps the best course is that suggested by ORG , namely to leave to philosophers the true nature of this disenfranchisement whilst recognising that the legislation does different things .", "ORG also requires that the means employed to restrict the implied Convention rights to vote are not disproportionate , and that is the point at which , as it seems to me , it is appropriate for this court to defer to the legislature . It is easy to be critical of a law which operates against a wide spectrum ( e.g. in relation to its effect on post - tariff discretionary life prisoners , and those detained under some provision of LAW DATE ) , but , as is clear from the authorities , those states which disenfranchise following conviction do not all limit the period of disenfranchisement to the period in custody . ORG in this country could have provided differently in order to meet the objectives which it discerned , and like PERSON in GPE , I would accept that the tailoring process seldom admits of perfection , so the courts must afford some leeway to the legislator . As [ counsel for the Secretary of ORG ] submits , there is a broad spectrum of approaches among democratic societies , and GPE falls into the middle of the spectrum . In course of time this position may move , either by way of further fine tuning , as was recently done in relation to remand prisoners and others , or more radically , but its position in the spectrum is plainly a matter for ORG not for the courts . That applies even to the \u2018 hard NORP of post - tariff discretionary life sentence prisoners ... They have all been convicted and if , for example , ORG were to have said that all those sentenced to life imprisonment lose the franchise for life the apparent anomaly of their position would disappear . ...", "If section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act can meet the challenge of LAW [ of LAW ] then LAW had nothing to offer , any more than LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claims were accordingly rejected as were those of the other prisoners .", "CARDINAL .

Every citizen of GPE has the right to vote in an election of members of ORG or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority opinion given by PERSON is summarised as follows in the headnote :", "\u201c To justify the infringement of a LAW right under s. CARDINAL , the government must show that the infringement achieves a constitutionally valid purpose or objective , and that the chosen means are reasonable and demonstrably justified . The government \u2019s argument that denying the right to vote to penitentiary inmates requires deference because it is a matter of social and political philosophy is rejected . While deference may be appropriate on a decision involving competing social and political policies , it is not appropriate on a decision to limit fundamental rights . The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the rule of law and can not be lightly set aside . Limits on it require not deference , but careful examination . The framers of the LAW signalled the special importance of this right not only by its broad , untrammelled language , but by exempting it from legislative override under s. CARDINAL \u2019s notwithstanding clause . The argument that the philosophically - based or symbolic nature of the objectives in itself commands deference is also rejected . ORG can not use lofty objectives to shield legislation from LAW scrutiny . Here , s. CARDINAL ( e ) is not justified under s. CARDINAL of the Charter .", "The government has failed to identify particular problems that require denying the right to vote , making it hard to conclude that the denial is directed at a pressing and substantial purpose . In the absence of a specific problem , the government asserts CARDINAL broad objectives for s. CARDINAL(e ) : ( CARDINAL ) to enhance civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law ; and ( CARDINAL ) to provide additional punishment or \u2018 enhance the general purposes of the criminal sanction\u2019 . Vague and symbolic objectives , however , make the justification analysis difficult . The first objective could be asserted of virtually every criminal law and many non - criminal measures . Concerning the second objective , nothing in the record discloses precisely why ORG felt that more punishment was required for this particular class of prisoner , or what additional objectives ORG hoped to achieve by this punishment that were not accomplished by the sentences already imposed . Nevertheless , rather than dismissing the government \u2019s objectives outright , prudence suggests that we proceed to the proportionality inquiry .", "Section CARDINAL(e ) does not meet the proportionality test . In particular , the government fails to establish a rational connection between s. CARDINAL(e ) \u2019s denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives . With respect to the first objective of promoting civic responsibility and respect for the law , denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values . The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote . To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility . The government \u2019s novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness , equality , and citizen participation . That not all self - proclaimed democracies adhere to this conclusion says little about what the NORP vision of democracy embodied in the LAW permits . Moreover , the argument that only those who respect the law should participate in the political process can not be accepted . Denial of the right to vote on the basis of attributed moral unworthiness is inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lies at the heart of NORP democracy and the LAW . It also runs counter to the plain words of s. CARDINAL of the LAW , its exclusion from the s. CARDINAL override , and the idea that laws command obedience because they are made by those whose conduct they govern .", "With respect to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment , the government offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of state punishment . Denying the right to vote does not comply with the requirements for legitimate punishment - namely , that punishment must not be arbitrary and must serve a valid criminal law purpose . Absence of arbitrariness requires that punishment be tailored to the acts and circumstances of the individual offender . Section CARDINAL(e ) qua punishment bears little relation to the offender \u2019s particular crime . As to a legitimate penal purpose , neither the record nor common sense supports the claim that disenfranchisement deters crime or rehabilitates criminals . By imposing a blanket punishment on all penitentiary inmates regardless of the particular crimes they committed , the harm they caused , or the normative character of their conduct , s. CARDINAL(e ) does not meet the requirements of denunciatory , retributive punishment , and is not rationally connected to the government \u2019s stated goal .", "The impugned provision does not minimally impair the right to vote . Section CARDINAL(e ) is too broad , catching many people who , on the government \u2019s own theory , should not be caught . Section CARDINAL(e ) can not be saved by the mere fact that it is less restrictive than a blanket exclusion of all inmates from the franchise .", "Lastly , the negative effects of denying citizens the right to vote would greatly outweigh the tenuous benefits that might ensue . Denying prisoners the right to vote imposes negative costs on prisoners and on the penal system . It removes a route to social development and undermines correctional law and policy directed towards rehabilitation and integration . In light of the disproportionate number of NORP people in penitentiaries , the negative effects of s. CARDINAL(e ) upon prisoners have a disproportionate impact on GPE \u2019s already disadvantaged NORP population . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority opinion given by PERSON is summarised , in extract , as follows :", "\u201c ... In this case , while it has been conceded that s. CARDINAL(e ) of LAW infringes s. CARDINAL of the LAW , the infringement is a reasonable limit that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society . The objectives of s. CARDINAL(e ) are pressing and substantial . Both objectives are based upon a reasonable and rational social or political philosophy . The first objective , that of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law , relates to the promotion of good citizenship . The social rejection of serious crime reflects a moral line which safeguards the social contract and the rule of law and bolsters the importance of the nexus between individuals and the community . The \u2018 promotion of civic responsibility\u2019 may be abstract or symbolic , but symbolic or abstract purposes can be valid of their own accord and must not be downplayed simply for the reason of their being symbolic . The second objective is the enhancement of the general purposes of the criminal sanction . Section CARDINAL(e ) clearly has a punitive aspect with a retributive function . It is a valid objective for ORG to develop appropriate sanctions and punishments for serious crime . The disenfranchisement is a civil disability arising from the criminal conviction .", "Section CARDINAL(e ) meets the proportionality tests . First , the impugned legislation is rationally connected to the objectives . While a causal relationship between disenfranchising prisoners and the objectives is not empirically demonstrable , reason , logic and common sense , as well as extensive expert evidence , support a conclusion that there is a rational connection between disenfranchising offenders incarcerated for serious crimes and the objectives of promoting civic responsibility and the rule of law and the enhancement of the general objectives of the penal sanction . ... Further , the disenfranchisement of serious criminal offenders serves to deliver a message to both the community and the offenders themselves that serious criminal activity will not be tolerated by the community . Society may choose to curtail temporarily the availability of the vote to serious criminals to insist that civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law , as goals worthy of pursuit , are prerequisites to democratic participation . With respect to the second objective , the disenfranchisement is carefully tailored to apply to perpetrators of serious crimes , and there is evidence in the record indicating that the denial of the right to vote is perceived as meaningful by the prisoners themselves and can therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners . Lastly , many other democracies have , by virtue of choosing some form of prisoner disenfranchisement , also identified a connection between objectives similar to those advanced in the case at bar and the means of prisoner disenfranchisement .", "Second , the impairment of the Charter right is minimal . ... Only \u2018 serious ORG , as determined by ORG , are subject to disenfranchisement . Since ORG has drawn a DATE cut off line which identifies which incarcerated offenders have committed serious enough crimes to warrant being deprived of the vote , any alternative line will not be of equal effectiveness . ... The provision is reasonably tailored insofar as disenfranchisement reflects the length of the sentence and actual incarceration , which , in turn , reflect the seriousness of the crime perpetrated and the intended progress towards the ultimate goals of rehabilitation and reintegration . Section CARDINAL(e ) is not arbitrary : it is related directly to particular categories of conduct . The DATE cut off line also reflects several practical considerations . Further , since this ORG gave the impression that it was up to a ORG to do exactly this after the first PERSON case ... , there is a need for deference to ORG in its drawing of a line . The analysis of social and political philosophies and the accommodation of values in the context of the LAW must be sensitive to the fact that there may be many possible reasonable and rational balances . Line drawing , amongst a range of acceptable alternatives , is for ORG , ...", "Third , when the objective and the salutary effects are viewed in the totality of the context , they outweigh the temporary disenfranchisement of the serious criminal offender . The enactment of the measure is itself a salutary effect . The legislation intrinsically expresses societal values in relation to serious criminal behaviour and the right to vote in our society . Value emerges from the signal or message that those who commit serious crimes will temporarily lose CARDINAL aspect of the political equality of citizens . Furthermore , the temporary disenfranchisement is perceived as meaningful by the offenders themselves and could have an ongoing positive rehabilitative effect . ... The statistical data mentioned by ORG indicate that the provision catches serious and repeat offenders and that most prisoners will only be deprived of participation in CARDINAL election . Because the duration of the disenfranchisement is directly related to the duration of incarceration , a serious criminal offender may never actually be denied the opportunity to vote if there is no election during the time he is incarcerated . In light of the special context of this case - that the justification advanced by ORG is rooted in a social or political philosophy that is not susceptible to proof in the traditional sense - deference is appropriate since the impugned provision raises questions of penal philosophy and policy . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
