The substituted letter was typed on a different kind of paper from the original , and omitted any reference to PERSON \u2019s disease .

It was thus much less incriminating to the general practitioners than the original letter of DATE which emphasised the importance of referring PERSON back to the hospital if vomiting re - occurred .", "Third , the general ORG notes contained a referral letter to PERSON signed by PERSON , and dated DATE . The letter was deliberately misleading . It made no mention of vomiting , which PERSON told the PERSON was the reason for immediate referral of PERSON back to PERSON .
