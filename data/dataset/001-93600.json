On DATE the ORG of Kazan rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and his application for release and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE .

On DATE the defendants and their lawyers started studying the case file which comprised CARDINAL volumes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court reasoned as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] should remain in custody since he is charged with grave offences and might abscond and threaten the witnesses and other parties involved in the proceedings . Besides , [ the applicant ] is to study a considerable volume of the case - file materials . In view of the above , the court grants the investigator \u2019s request to extend [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the investigator had not furnished any evidence to substantiate his allegations that the applicant might abscond or interfere with the administration of justice .

When dismissing the defendants\u2019 application for release , the court noted as follows :", "\u201c The defendants have been charged with numerous grave and serious offences which might entail a custodial sentence exceeding DATE . [ The court does not ] discern any special exceptional circumstances which would render [ the defendants\u2019 ] release possible .

On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of DATE finding no reason to depart from the lower court \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the detention of CARDINAL defendants , including the applicant , until DATE . The applicant argued that he should be released pending trial . He claimed that the gravity of the charges alone could not constitute a sufficient reason for extension of his detention ; that he had been detained during a lengthy period ; that the prosecution had failed to prove that he might abscond or interfere with the administration of justice ; that the court had already examined the materials concerning a number of charges against the defendants ; and that the criminal proceedings had been too long . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments , noting as follows :", "\u201c [ The defendants\u2019 ] application for release can not be granted for the following reasons .

LAW of DATE establishes that a judicial decision is required before a defendant can be detained or his or her detention extended ( Article CARDINAL ) .

The new ORG requires a judicial decision by a district or town court on a reasoned request by a prosecutor supported by appropriate evidence ( LAW CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE , pre - trial detention was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( Article CARDINAL ) . The amendments of DATE repealed the provision that permitted defendants to be remanded in custody on the sole ground of the dangerous nature of the criminal offence they had committed .

Under the old ORG , such an extension could be granted once only and for DATE . The new ORG does not set any time - limits in this respect .

These provisions did not apply to defendants charged with particularly serious criminal offences . The new ORG provides that the term of detention \u201c during judicial proceedings \u201d is calculated from the date the court received the file up to the date on which the judgment is given .
