CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions;Article 1 para. 2 of Protocol No. 1 - Control of the use of property);Just satisfaction dismissed (out of time) (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Split .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a commercial building in ORG , which he uses as a car repair workshop . The building in issue was bought from the ORG in DATE . At the time of purchase , no limitation on its use was registered or apparent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG for ORG ( ORG kulture , PERSON za\u0161titu kulturne ba\u0161tine , GPE odjel u PERSON , hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ordered a measure of preventive protection relating to cultural heritage with regard to the applicant \u2019s building , pending the final evaluation of its cultural value . It explained that the building , which was being used as a car repair workshop at that point , appeared to be a rare example of early industrial architecture in ORG , and therefore this warranted a measure limiting its use by the applicant . Under section CARDINAL of ORG ( Zakon o za\u0161titi i o\u010duvanju kulturnih dobara , hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) the measure would remain in place for DATE , and , in accordance with LAW of the same LAW , would afford the same protection as a final protective measure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The decision ordering the preventive protection was not transmitted to the applicant . It was forwarded to the land registry of ORG ( PERSON ) and duly registered in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the expiry of the DATE period , ORG again ordered a measure of preventive protection with regard to the applicant \u2019s commercial building , reiterating the same grounds as those specified in its previous decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not informed of the above decision relating to the second measure of preventive protection in respect of his building . On DATE the measure was registered in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after becoming aware of the second measure of preventive protection following an enquiry with the land registry , the applicant challenged the extended application of that measure before ORG ( ORG culture , hereafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) . He contended , in particular , that he had not been informed of the decision ordering the preventive protection , and that the protection could no longer be ordered , since the maximum duration of such a measure under LAW was DATE . The applicant also enquired about compensation in respect of the pecuniary damage he had sustained as a result of the measure of preventive protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forwarded the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG . It stressed that the decision of DATE extending the preventive protection after the expiry of the first DATE period had been necessary , owing to the fact that it had not been possible to obtain an excerpt from the land register from ORG , and that the building represented an important example of early industrial architecture in Split .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded , on the grounds that there was nothing in the law preventing the competent authority from applying the measure twice for periods of DATE , and that the measure of preventive protection had not limited the applicant \u2019s ownership rights . It also pointed out that it was necessary to extend the preventive protection in respect of the building , as the determination of its heritage value required further comprehensive assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative action in ORG ( ORG ) , challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of the measure of preventive protection , and emphasising the passivity of the competent authorities in finally resolving the matter . He also contended that the decisions of the lower authorities had been arbitrary . He pointed out that , contrary to what ORG had stated , his ownership rights had been significantly limited , as his freedom to deal with the property as he wished had been restricted . In particular , his several attempts to sell the building and set up another business cooperation had failed , owing to the existing preventive protection . The applicant also asked ORG to award him MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of the damage he had sustained as a result of the conduct of the administrative authorities .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s building should not be registered as an object of cultural heritage . On DATE , after the expiry of the measure of preventive protection , ORG ordered that the entry concerning the measure be deleted from the land register .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative action as unfounded , endorsing the reasoning of the lower authorities . In particular , it pointed out that there had been solid evidence suggesting that the building was an important object of cultural heritage , and that the measure of preventive protection was therefore justified given the need to carry out further assessments . Moreover , ORG considered that nothing in the relevant domestic law prevented the adoption of the second decision on preventive protection following the expiry of the first DATE time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , complaining of a violation of his property rights under LAW with regard to the allegedly unlawful and unreasonable application of the measure of preventive protection in respect of his property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
