THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE . He resides in GPE nad ORG .", "A.", "On DATE the ORG Jablonce nad ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00e9 zastupitelstvo ) ( ORG ) accepted the mayor \u2019s proposal to appoint the applicant as the Secretary of the PERSON u Jablonce nad ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad ) ( \" the Town Office \" ) .", "On DATE the applicant and ORG , represented by the mayor , signed a contract of employment . The applicant began to work on DATE .", "On DATE ORG decided to remove the applicant from his position . By letter of DATE the mayor informed the applicant that ORG could not offer him an alternative employment and that he would be dismissed as of DATE .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG before the GPE nad ORG ( okresn\u00ed soud ) ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) claiming unfair dismissal . He challenged the validity of the dismissal as having been made by LAW Rychnov u Jablonce nad Nisou ( m\u011bsto ) ( \" the Town \" ) and not by ORG which signed his contract of employment , and having been pronounced without the previous consent of a trade union authority . The applicant also claimed that the dismissal could not be made in pursuance of Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( z\u00e1kon\u00edk pr\u00e1ce ) as these provisions applied only to a termination of an employment relationship based on appointment [ i.e. without a contract as such ] , which was not his case because his employment relationship was created by the contract signed on DATE without any previous or subsequent appointment . The fact that on CARDINAL DATE ORG approved the mayor \u2019s proposal could not be considered as the applicant \u2019s appointment because at that time he had not yet been working for the defendant .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . The court stated inter alia that the applicant \u2019s employment relationship had been based on appointment and created on DATE , the date on which the applicant would start exercising his duties as agreed by the parties . It further considered that , bearing in mind that ORG and Town were identical legal persons , it could not be said that the applicant had not been employed by LAW . The court also examined the decision of ORG concerning the applicant \u2019s dismissal and found it valid . It finally stated that the dismissal notice contained a clause which read that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been a matter of consultation with the trade union authority on DATE , and that the original of the notice had been signed by the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment . He claimed inter alia that ORG had not established the facts correctly and had not assessed evidence in accordance with the domestic law . He further objected to the legal assessment of the case by this court .", "By ruling of CARDINAL DATE LOC ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , after a public hearing held on DATE in which the applicant had participated , quashed the judgment of ORG and stayed the proceedings . It found that , in accordance with Section PERSON ) of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended ( z\u00e1kon o obc\u00edch ) , a municipality ( obec ) had a legal personality . However , according to LAW ) and ( CARDINAL)(a ) of this LAW , a municipality office was an organ of the municipality without legal personality . Accordingly , ORG could not be a party to the proceedings . The ruling was not given in public .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) challenging the legal opinion of ORG . He further maintained that his appeal had been dealt with by judges who should have been excluded for bias because of their knowledge of another action brought by the applicant against some judges of ORG . On CARDINAL DATE a lawyer appointed by the applicant informed ORG ( Vrchn\u00ed soud ) that he agreed with the content of the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE ORG , without a public hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG confirmed the finding of ORG that the applicant \u2019s action had been brought against ORG which did not have legal personality and which , therefore , could not be a party to the proceedings . It found unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s objection concerning the exclusion of the judges stating that by a decision of DATE , referred to by the applicant , ORG had excluded all judges of ORG because of their relation to CARDINAL defendants in other proceedings brought by the applicant , who did not participate in the present proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of his right to judicial protection under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( \uf041Charter\uf040 ) . He claimed in particular that the courts had not complied with their duty under LAW to advise the applicant to change the defendant . He referred in this regard to the judgment of ORG No . II \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning a similar problem . He also submitted that he was in a difficult financial situation , that ORG had refused to appoint for him a lawyer for the purposes of the constitutional appeal and that he did not have access to the court - file of ORG because it had been sent to ORG . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal was submitted by a lawyer .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal manifestly ill - founded . ORG held that the applicant was wrong in his opinion that the ordinary courts are generally and in any case obliged to advise a claimant on the legal capacity to be a party to the proceedings , and on who could or could not be the defendant in a particular case . The claimant is free to specify the defendant but must be sure that the defendant can be a party to the proceedings . The ORG stated that the question who was authorised to dismiss the applicant and who , therefore , could be a party to the proceedings , was the subject - matter of those proceedings and that this question had been duly clarified in the course of the proceedings . Therefore , it was not explicitly included , as one of the court \u2019s obligations , to advise the applicant in this regard . In particular , ORG had concluded that there was no reason to declare the dismissal void on the ground that the Town had no authority to do it . Accordingly , the applicant could have concluded that it was necessary to change the defendant in his appeal . The fact that he did not do so could not be considered as a violation of his right to judicial protection as provided for in LAW and in LAW . ORG finally stated that its judgment , referred to by the applicant , concerned matters of extra - judicial rehabilitation which were different from his case .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW .
