The applicant is a non - governmental organisation that publishes ORG Iskra , a newspaper in LOC . As of DATE , the PERSON branch of ORG of GPE and the PERSON branch of ORG of GPE , a nationwide movement , were listed as the applicant organisation \u2019s founders . This information was specified on the front page of the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the ORG of incorporation , the founders were in charge of setting up an editorial board and determining the editorial policy ; in the case of disagreement on the editorial policy the matter was to be resolved by a meeting of the ORG representatives .", "CARDINAL . During the election campaign for ORG , the lower chamber of ORG , on DATE , the applicant organisation expressed to ORG of GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) its intention to accept proposals for publication for a fee and , as required by law , published the fees applicable to the publications on behalf of political parties ( MONEY ( RUB ) per page ) . The applicant organisation specified that the above fee \u201c was not applicable to the newspaper \u2019s founder \u201d . The applicant organisation signed a contract with ORG for this purpose for publications on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE . The contract mentioned a fee of RUB CARDINAL per page ; the total amount of the contract was RUB CARDINAL for CARDINAL pages . Some of the publications in the applicant organisation \u2019s newspaper on these dates did mention the ORG \u2019s sponsorship , others did not ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the publications mentioned above , on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicant organisation \u2019s newspaper also published , in the same DATE issues , CARDINAL articles written by its staff correspondent , PERSON Both articles were critical of Mr Stroyev , the then governor of GPE and the former Chairman of ORG ( the upper chamber of ORG ) . Governor PERSON was a candidate at those elections : he was no . CARDINAL on the regional list of GPE ( ORG ) , a political party aligned with President PERSON and dominant in ORG . ORG was CARDINAL of the main opposition parties at those elections .", "CARDINAL . The first article was entitled \u2018 Hatred , PERSON style\u2019 . It can be summarised as follows . It described Governor PERSON as a person consumed by hatred towards people who oppose him . The journalist referred to the decision of the governor to wind up a publicly owned newspaper , PERSON . According to journalist PERSON , that decision was a direct consequence of a conflict between Mr PERSON and the newspaper \u2019s former editor - in - chief who kept criticising PERSON \u2019s policies . The speaker of the municipal council , who was politically weak owing to a corruption scandal involving municipal land , was unable to oppose the decision of the governor to close the newspaper . Most of the regional journalists under PERSON became servile ; those few who , like the editor - in - chief of PERSON , remained independent and refused to flatter Mr PERSON , were subjected to pressure and fell victim to Mr PERSON \u2019s hatred . The article then turned to the story of CARDINAL deputies of the regional legislature . They were elected as members of ORG and were originally in opposition to Mr PERSON , but later they both became members of GPE . CARDINAL of them was a businessman . The author suspected that the first deputy had changed political sides because of very serious pressure exerted by the PERSON administration on local businessmen . The second deputy was a history professor . The article suggested that his decision to leave ORG was also forced . The journalist ironically supposed that in fact Mr PERSON did not want GPE to win the elections , since he was doing everything to make the electorate angry with the ruling party . In DATE the town population voted in large numbers for ORG , which was in fact a vote of disapproval of Mr PERSON \u2019s policies . However , the journalist supposed that Mr PERSON \u2019s personal interests always prevailed over those of ORG . The town mayor tried to protect himself by joining GPE , but this was a weak defence against Mr PERSON \u2019s hatred . The only people Mr PERSON loved and defended were his own relatives and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s . The article cited the example of Mr PERSON \u2019s nephew , a businessman suspected of abuse of public funds and fraud . His case was still pending ; the article suggested that regional law - enforcement agencies being discouraged from pursuing the investigation actively . The article then turned to the dismissal of the head of the regional public ORG , who reported on abuses of funds allocated for road maintenance . The newly appointed head of ORG , who was Mr PERSON \u2019s man , came to the opposite conclusion , namely that the manipulation of the road funds had been perfectly in order . Nevertheless , the money had been spent ; as a result , the federal authorities had had to allocate additional funds for road maintenance in LOC . Mr PERSON tried to get credit for that funding , but it was not GPE money that had been used , as they claimed , but DATE . In the opinion of the author , by trying to present the whole situation as his personal achievement Mr PERSON was making a fool of President PERSON and of the population of LOC .", "The article had a long post - scriptum . It cited ORG findings in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . PERSON , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) . That case concerned a defamation claim lodged by a governor of another NORP region against a journalist of a local newspaper . The case ended with a finding of a violation of LAW by the ORG . The author alluded to similarities between her criticism of PERSON ORG \u2019s policies and the situation in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . The second article was entitled \u2018 ORG sues people : people sue CARDINAL . It also concerned several topics . It opened with the statement that the electorate of PERSON did not trust the authorities and at the DATE and DATE elections preferred to support ORG . Next , it touched upon the story of PERSON . , a former forest inspector who was dismissed from her job as a result of a reorganisation of the forestry authority . CARDINAL other workers of the forest authority also lost their jobs . The article alleged that the reform of the forest authorities was initiated by Governor PERSON in breach of federal legislation . It suggested that the reform was driven by the need to facilitate industrial tree - cutting . Ms ORG . sued the regional authorities , and at the relevant time the proceedings were pending . However , in the opinion of the journalist , there was little hope for impartiality on the part of the regional courts . The article then turned to the case of PERSON , who had made statements critical of the governor during a public rally and had been prosecuted for slander . The article then analysed recent public statements of the governor , who had criticised the policy lines of former President PERSON , whereas he himself during that period had been Chairman of ORG , and therefore the second most important statesman in the country . According to the journalist , the proceedings in the case of PERSON PERSON were adjourned , probably because Governor PERSON wanted to avoid a scandal before the date of elections . The article closed with the suggestion that President PERSON should not have associated himself such controversial figures as Governor PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the regional ORG examined both articles . ORG concluded that the articles contained elements of electoral campaigning ( \u0430\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f ) . ORG concluded as follows :", "The publications contained \u201c negative , purposeful , systematically published information about a member of ORG GPE political party ... PERSON E. Stroyev . The above - mentioned publications have created a negative attitude on the part of the voters towards ... GPE . Although the text of the articles does not call for people to vote for or against GPE , all the electorate understand that this is in fact counter - campaigning [ against Mr PERSON ] \u201d . The publications \u201c did not correspond to the current information policy of the organisations editing mass media \u201d , which ( the policy ) was \u201c aimed at informing the voters about the development of the electoral campaign ... [ and ] about the political parties participating in it \u201d . Those articles , in the opinion of ORG , fell \u201c outside the information space created by the political parties during the ongoing electoral campaign \u201d . The publication of those articles was not paid for from the official campaign fund of any party participating in the campaign , contrary to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , in the opinion of ORG , publication of those articles amounted to a breach of electoral law punishable by a fine in accordance with Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The official of ORG compiled an administrative offence record against the applicant organisation , referring to the legislative provisions defining \u201c campaigning \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) :", "\u201c [ The applicant organisation ] has committed an administrative offence : publications on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE containing elements of election campaigning as defined in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG Elections Act \u201d ...", "Liability for this offence is prescribed under : Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case was then submitted to a justice of the peace . On CARDINAL DATE the justice of the peace examined the case . At the hearing the editor - in - chief of the newspaper explained that both articles were informational in essence and were not a part of the election campaign . They reflected the author \u2019s opinion of Governor PERSON . Consequently , there was no need for those articles to be paid for from any candidate \u2019s campaign fund .", "CARDINAL . The judge held that , according to ORG , taken in conjunction with LAW , \u201c election campaigning \u201d meant publications where information about one of the candidates prevailed and was combined with negative comment about him or her . Having studied the impugned articles the judge agreed with ORG that they primarily concerned candidate PERSON , and secondly were negative . The judge concluded that those articles were in substance election \u201c campaigning \u201d . Such material should either have been paid for from the campaign fund of CARDINAL of the candidates or have been published free of charge ; in any event , the newspaper had been required to indicate who had sponsored the publication . No such mention had been made in the articles . Consequently , the publication of both articles amounted to a breach of the electoral law . The applicant organisation was therefore found guilty of the administrative offence described in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Offences of DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the CAO \u201d ) . The justice of the peace ordered the applicant organisation to pay a fine of MONEY ( RUB , equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant organisation appealed to the Zheleznodorozhny ORG of Orel . On DATE it heard the applicant organisation \u2019s representatives and rejected the appeal . The relevant extract from the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to the fact that the publication of the above articles took place during an election campaign period , the judge considers that the above - mentioned articles contained elements of election campaigning , and therefore could be described as campaign literature . This conclusion is supported by the words of the representatives of the newspaper ... who acknowledged that the articles contained criticism of Governor PERSON ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appeal decision entered into legal force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the applicant organisation received a copy of this decision and lodged a supervisory - review application with the President of ORG . The scope of that application remains unclear .", "CARDINAL . Without holding a hearing , on DATE the acting president of the court issued a decision dismissing the application . The reasoning of the decision of the acting president was identical to that of the lower courts . On an unspecified date the applicant organisation received a copy of the acting president \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant organisation then lodged a supervisory - review application with the President of ORG . The scope of this application remains unclear . On DATE the Vice - President dismissed it . On an unspecified date the applicant organisation received a copy of this decision .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant organisation introduced an individual application before ORG , arguing that the impugned provisions of LAW and ORG ran counter to freedom of the press . The Acts de facto regarded any critical material published during a pre - election period as \u201c campaigning \u201d , and imposed additional requirements on such publications .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant organisation that its application was not allowed because , in substance , it was merely challenging the factual and legal findings made by the courts in the administrative offence case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant organisation resubmitted its application to ORG . On DATE a panel of judges of ORG issued a decision ( \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) refusing examination of the application . It held as follows :", "\u201c In its ruling of DATE ORG made the following statement of principle concerning a distinction between information for voters and pre - election campaigning . To protect the right to free elections , freedom of expression on the part of the mass media may be restricted , provided that the balance of constitutional values has been respected ...", "[ LAW ] distinguishes between information for voters appearing in the mass media and pre - election campaigning by them . Both information and campaigning can influence voters to make certain choices , thus the obvious and only criterion to distinguish between them would be the existence of a particular aim , namely to incline voters to support or oppose a certain candidate ... Without such an aim in mind there would be no dividing line between information and campaigning , to the effect that all information would amount to campaigning . This would go against the constitutional guarantees of freedom of information and freedom of expression ...", "It is incumbent on the courts and other authorities to establish that there is a campaigning aim in each case ... Thus , in view of the above statement of principle , the impugned legislative provisions can not be considered to have violated the applicant organisation \u2019s rights or freedoms ... Establishment of the specific circumstances ( whether or not the information provided by the applicant organisation concerned the electoral campaign rather than the reporting on the candidate \u2019s professional activity as a governor ) are beyond of ORG competence ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
