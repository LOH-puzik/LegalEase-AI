The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a lawyer and was appointed insolvency administrator of the NORP limited partnership PERSON ( hereafter \u201c the company \u201d ) in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , in his position of insolvency administrator of the company , took legal action against PERSON , a former limited partner ( PERSON ) of the KG , to seek the reimbursement of MONEY ( ORG ) , which had been paid to her as advance payment on profits ( FAC ) by the KG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his statement of claim , the applicant indicated that he might introduce an additional action concerning QUANTITY , to seek the reimbursement of payments received by PERSON as compensation for her participation as a limited partner ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) and as advance payments for profit . The applicant declared that he had refrained from introducing an action concerning these claims at that point in time because of the costs involved .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was notified of the legal action on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested legal aid for his initial action and with a view to introducing an action concerning the supplementary claims , amounting to approximately EUR CARDINAL . The statutory timelimit for those latter claims was DATE . This request for legal aid was placed in the case file . It was neither examined by a judge nor was notice given to PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to ORG to enquire whether he had been granted legal aid . He did not receive a response . On DATE , he sent another letter , to which he received no response . The applicant claimed that , in addition , he had also made telephone calls to ORG on DATE and on DATE to find out whether he had been granted legal aid and that , both times , he had been informed by ORG that the file was at the judge \u2019s office and that , therefore , no information could be given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid , following another written inquiry of that DATE . The decision to grant legal aid was served on PERSON on DATE . On DATE ORG issued a decision , clarifying that the grant of legal aid covered the supplementary claims brought on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant introduced the additional action concerning the said claims . PERSON was notified on DATE . On DATE a hearing was held .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment on DATE ORG ordered Ms B. to pay EUR PERSON to the applicant and dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s initial action . That court likewise dismissed the applicant \u2019s additional action for reimbursement of approximately ORG CARDINAL in its entirety , finding that the claims were time - barred . It stated that the statutory time - limit for these claims was DATE and that submitting the request for legal aid on DATE had not been sufficient to suspend the running of time for purposes of limitation , because domestic law also required that the court arrange for notice to be given to the defendant ( see relevant domestic law and practice paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that PERSON was notified of the request for legal aid DATE , hence CARDINAL and a half years after the expiry of the limitation period . It considered that the exception foreseen by domestic law allowing for the retroactive effect of arranging for notice to be given was not applicable in the instant case . According to that exception , the running of time for the purposes of limitation was suspended with effect from DATE a request for legal aid was lodged , if the notification of that request was arranged \u201c shortly after \u201d ( demn\u00e4chst ) . ORG noted that , according to the constant case - law of the domestic courts , the term \u201c shortly after \u201d was interpreted in a way that required the litigant to act with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notice or service . It found that the applicant \u2013 who , as a lawyer , must have known that arranging for notice to be given to the defendant of his request for legal aid \u201c shortly after \u201d its submission was required to prevent his claim from becoming timebarred DATE had in a reproachable manner contributed to the delay and thus not acted with the necessary diligence required . ORG observed that the applicant had not asked ORG to notify immediately the defendant of his request for legal aid , irrespective of its prospects of success , which he could have done without additional costs and without suffering any procedural disadvantages . Also , rather than enquiring whether the notification of the request had been arranged , the applicant limited himself to enquiring whether his request for legal aid had been successful . In relation to the alleged telephone calls in DATE and DATE , it found that , given that ORG had not responded to his written request of DATE , the applicant should not have relied on the registry \u2019s alleged statement . The court found it incomprehensible that the applicant had waited until DATE , and CARDINAL DATE , to enquire again in writing about the success of his request for legal aid .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that , in any event , the claim concerning the reimbursement of approximately ORG CARDINAL was ill - founded and thoroughly reasoned this finding .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant requested legal aid in order to lodge an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE / ORG dismissed his request , finding that the appeal lacked prospects of success as ORG had rightly considered the applicant \u2019s claims to be time - barred . It observed that ORG had arranged for notice to be given to Ms B. of the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid at the earliest in DATE and argued that notice DATE after the request \u2019s introduction could not be considered as having taken place \u201c shortly after \u201d that introduction . The interests of the defendant , who had no knowledge of the submission of the request for legal aid , in the protection of her legal positions and the clarification of the legal situation , had to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that it was constant case - law of the domestic courts that the term \u201c shortly after \u201d was to be interpreted in such a way that the risk of a delayed notification was distributed fairly between both parties to the dispute and , therefore , the litigant concerned must have acted with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notification . Furthermore , there must not be legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect ( see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It confirmed ORG finding that the applicant had not acted with the necessary diligence . It underlined that the applicant would have had to alert ORG about the imminent expiry of the limitation period and to ask to arrange for the immediate notification of the defendant in order to suspend the running of time for the purposes of limitation . In fact the applicant had to take into account that ORG also had the possibility to refuse his request for legal aid without hearing , and hence without notifying , the defendant if it considered the claim to be illfounded or the applicant to have the necessary means ( decision a limine ) . ORG likewise considered that the subsequent steps taken by the applicant were not sufficient , because he had not asked for the notification to be effected immediately . ORG based its decision to refuse legal aid exclusively on the finding that the claims were time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , alleging that the refusal to grant him legal aid violated his right of access to a court and that he had been discriminated against as an impecunious person compared to a litigant with sufficient financial means .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a formation of CARDINAL judges , declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the period of processing the request for legal aid and the delay in arranging for notice to be given to the defendant constituted gross negligence ( grob fehlerhaft ) by ORG . Nonetheless , it considered that the decision of ORG was in conformity with the case - law of ORG , according to which a notification could only be \u201c shortly after \u201d the submission of a request for legal aid if the applicant concerned acted with the necessary diligence to effect the immediate notification , and if there were no legitimate interests of the defendant that conflicted with such retroactive effect ( see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG found that ORG finding that the applicant had not acted with the necessary diligence did not raise concerns . The applicant failed to ask ORG to notify immediately the defendant about the request for legal aid . Neither in his initial lawsuit nor in his subsequent enquiries did the applicant indicate the particular urgency of the matter , namely , the imminent limitation of the claims .", "CARDINAL . NORP In relation to the alleged discrimination , ORG found that impecunious litigants and litigants with sufficient financial means were in a comparable situation as regards the possibilities and obligations in order to suspend the running of time for purposes of limitation . Referring to the case - law of ORG ( see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it considered that a litigant with sufficient financial means must not limit himself to submitting a lawsuit , but rather had to remind the court to ask him to pay the necessary court fees or even to pay the fees on his own initiative , if the court had failed to ask him , in order to effect the service of the legal action . ORG found that such obligations on the part of a litigant with sufficient financial means were comparable to those of the applicant , namely his obligation to ask the court concerned to notify immediately the defendant of the request for legal aid , and to remind the court to arrange for notice to be given ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
