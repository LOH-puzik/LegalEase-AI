Subsequently , he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators . The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage , explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises , they risked blocking the main road . The leaders of the protesters visited the garage , but were not satisfied with that offer . They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to GPE and hold their demonstration there , in the village community centre .

Since the negotiations had failed , PERSON . ordered the police to start clearing the road . The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers , several of whom were hit , so Mr ORG . authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons .

Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them . PERSON . authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters . By TIME the road had been unblocked .", "CARDINAL . Mr Yakh . , CARDINAL of the protesters , testified that when they had arrived in GPE , the road had not yet been blocked . People had started to block the road spontaneously with stones in order to draw the authorities\u2019 attention to their claims . The leaders of the demonstration , who spoke before the crowd , called everybody to order and asked them not to break the law . Then a police colonel appeared . He asked the leaders of the protesters to unblock the road , but they refused . The police then attacked the protesters from CARDINAL sides and started to shoot and throw gas grenades into the crowd . People started to run in the direction of GPE .

Near the entry to GPE he was stopped by a group of youngsters who ordered him , under the threat of violence , to dump the stones directly on the road .", "CARDINAL . The written testimonies of several other eyewitnesses were inconclusive . Some of them testified that a group of adolescents had been throwing stones at the police ; others said that the police had used firearms by shooting in the air , whereas the demonstrators had no firearms . Some witnesses heard shots from the side of the protesters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested for participating in the organisation of an unauthorised demonstration on DATE ( criminal case no . DATE ) .

According to the ORG , the decision of the Prosecutor of GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the RPO \u201d , ORG ) to seek the first applicant \u2019s detention was based on the witness statements of PERSON . , Mr Agsh . , Mr Shk . and an anonymous witness .

The lawyer also stated that the first applicant had not been contacted by the investigators before his arrest . The lawyer noted that a suspect could be held in pre - trial detention before being formally charged only in exceptional circumstances . The court \u2019s ruling did not refer to any specific facts showing that the first applicant indeed intended to continue his criminal activities , abscond or obstruct the course of justice . Furthermore , the lawyer pointed to various irregularities in the application by the police and in the court \u2019s ruling imposing the detention order .", "CARDINAL .
