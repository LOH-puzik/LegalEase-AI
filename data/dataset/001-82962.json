On DATE the Minister of Justice ( Minister PERSON ) and the Minister of the Interior ( Minister PERSON ) informed ORG of ORG ( ORG ) of the disbandment in DATE of the GPE / ORG ( NORP Recherche Team ; \u201c IRT \u201d ) on account of deployment of controversial criminal investigation methods in the fight against organised crime ( for further details , see PERSON v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . ORG , ECHR DATE ) . This triggered off a parliamentary inquiry ( parlementaire enqu\u00eate ) into criminal investigation methods used in the GPE and the control exercised over such methods .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parliamentary commission of inquiry on criminal investigation methods ( parlementaire enqu\u00eatecommissie opsporingsmethoden ; \u201c PEC \u201d ) was instituted . It was composed of CARDINAL ORG parliamentarians .", "CARDINAL . The ORG conducted an extensive inquiry , which lasted for DATE . DATE documents were collected and examined and preliminary interviews with CARDINAL persons were held . The ORG had subsequent informal , confidential \u201c private conversations \u201d ( besloten gesprekken ) with a total of CARDINAL persons DATE of which verbatim records were drawn up \u2013 in order to broaden its understanding of the issues involved , to select the persons and experts to be heard in public , and to prepare these public hearings . On the basis of these documents , interviews and conversations , the ORG made a selection of persons whom it wished to hear . Those interviews and \u201c private conversations \u201d , which were all held on a voluntary basis , were of a confidential nature and the ORG gave an undertaking that , unless consent was given by the person concerned , it would not use any direct citations .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , the ORG held CARDINAL public hearings during which CARDINAL persons gave evidence , including the applicant who was heard twice . These public hearings were directly broadcast on national television . It did not hold any witness or expert hearings in camera .", "CARDINAL . The ORG presented its final report containing its findings and recommendations on DATE . It concluded that there was a crisis in the field of criminal investigation which comprised CARDINAL main elements , namely the absence of adequate legal norms for investigating methods used in respect of organised crime , a criminal investigation system that was not functioning properly in that it involved too many separate organisations with little or no co - ordination of their activities , resulting in unclear decision - making as regards competences and responsibilities , and problems with power structures in that the prosecution department did not always have or exercise sufficient authority over the police .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report has had a great impact on the organisation of criminal investigation in the GPE and has formed the basis of a number of changes to LAW , including ORG herziening gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) and the Special Investigative Powers Act ( Wet bijzondere opsporingsbevoegdheden ) which entered into force on DATE , amending the legal rules on investigative powers and coercive measures in criminal investigations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , with the permission of the Minister of ORG and under the responsibility and direction of the public prosecution service ( PERSON ) , a special team of ORG ( rijksrecherche ) , the so - called \u201c GPE - team \u201d , started a broad factfinding inquiry into the manner in which ORG ( PERSON ; \u201d RCID \u201d ) operated DATE , in particular its use of special investigation methods which were not dissimilar to those having been used by the disbanded GPE / GPE IRT .", "CARDINAL . NORP The mission of the GPE - team was : \u201c To carry out , as thoroughly as possible , a fact - finding inquiry into the activities , functioning and working methods of ORG from DATE to date . In so doing , particular attention must be paid to the use of special investigation methods . In addition , the responsibilities of both the police and the public prosecution service for the RCID and RCID operations must be mapped out . The inquiry is to result in a report containing findings and recommendations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was agreed with the Minister of ORG and the Minister of the ORG that the ORG and Vice - Chair of the ORG would be kept informed from the outset of this inquiry of the findings of the GPE - team . It was to be a fact - finding exercise , primarily aimed at drawing lessons from facts found .", "CARDINAL . The functioning of the Kennemerland RCID during the period under investigation by the GPE - team had already been the subject of a number of previous inquiries by the ORG regional police force as well as by ORG . The results of the previous inquiries were incorporated into those of the GPE - team inquiry , which covered a multitude of aspects related to the practical functioning of the PERSON RCID , including its involvement in a number of specific activities , such as a \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d \u2013 a controlled - delivery channel involving the transport of narcotics concealed in fruit - juice concentrates .", "CARDINAL . In the course of its inquiry , CARDINAL persons gave evidence , CARDINAL of whom more than once . The persons heard included higher officials of the police and public prosecution department , police officers involved in criminal investigations , police informers and other civilians . The applicant and his former superior Mr L. also gave evidence to the GPE - team . All persons heard by the GPE - team were given an undertaking that their statements would not be used , without their consent , in any criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . According to the final report issued by the GPE - team on DATE , it had had contacts DATE from the start of its inquiry \u2013 with Mr NORP , a NORP fruit - juice producer who during the relevant period had acted as an informer for the Kennemerland RCID and who had been \u201c run \u201d by the applicant . PERSON had contacted ORG ( ORG ; \u201c CRI \u201d ) in DATE and had declared that , since DATE , he had been in contact with the applicant and subsequently with the latter 's colleague PERSON From the end of DATE Mr NORP had provided the applicant with information about the production of fruit - juice concentrates in GPE and their transport to the GPE . After PERSON had set up a fruit - juice factory in GPE in DATE , he had met PERSON , whom he initially knew under a pseudonym . At the request of the applicant and PERSON , PERSON NORP had set up the fruit - juice factory GPE in GPE . Although the applicant and PERSON had invested MONEY in both the NORP and GPE factories , they decided in DATE that the GPE factory was to be closed down and sold . PERSON , who did not understand this decision , started to distrust the applicant and Mr L. and decided to inform the ORG about the matter . The ORG subsequently brought PERSON into contact with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The final report of the GPE - team further states that , during its inquiry , the statements given by PERSON had as far as possible been verified by the use of observations , audio devices and documents and that inquiries had been made as to whether and , if so , why the applicant and PERSON L. had financially supported the factory in GPE and had the Delta Rio factory in GPE set up .", "CARDINAL . Although reports by ORG are generally not public , the report of the GPE - team was rendered public given the attention this inquiry , against the background of the ORG inquiry , had attracted . Its main conclusions comprised , inter alia , the following elements :", "- the Kennemerland RCID was to be characterised as a disorganised service , in which no direction was given and where no substantive control whatsoever was exercised ;", "- in the Kennemerland RCID , basic rules on the \u201c running \u201d of informers and infiltrators had been breached frequently and on a large scale ;", "- the police force command had seriously fallen short in the exercise of its responsibility over the RCID in that the commander , his deputy and the head of the criminal investigation division were not or hardly aware of the particulars of ORG activities ; - the scope of the ORG work had for a long time been seriously underestimated by the GPE public prosecution department ;", "- DATE the ORG chief PERSON and his ( ex)collaborator [ the applicant ] had , with a high degree of probability , spent MONEY from an undocumented source , thus giving rise to the impression that the money had criminal origins ;", "- the spending of this money had not been subjected to any form of control ;", "- the ORG chief PERSON had consequently disregarded his duty to inform and give explanations to his superiors and the public prosecution department on essential points , and he had intentionally misinformed his superiors as well as ORG ;", "- since at least CARDINAL the PERSON RCID had used the method of controlled drug deliveries ;", "- the relevant police commanders and public prosecutors had only controlled the application of this method by the Kennemerland RCID to a limited extent ;", "- Mr L. and the applicant had set up a ORG operation in GPE wholly independently ( without informing their superiors or the public prosecution department ) and in this so - called \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d all rules applicable to ORG activities had been breached ;", "- the most plausible explanation for the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d was the wish to set up an infrastructure for controlled narcotics shipments and it had remained unclear what purpose this channel still served after the ORG had been disbanded and for what purposes major investments were still being made ;", "- the statements given by PERSON and the applicant before the ORG about the funds invested in the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d were , on important points , in contradiction with the findings made in the inquiry of ORG ;", "- the conducting of ORG operations abroad ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) , without informing the foreign authorities , had violated the sovereignty of these countries , making it subservient to domestic investigation interests ;", "- it had not appeared that killings in the criminal world could be attributed to the Kennemerland RCID 's practice of \u201c running \u201d informers or to the targeting of such informers ;", "- after the ORG 's disbandment , on several occasions serious threats against PERSON had formed the topic of conversation , but it had appeared after investigation that there was nothing concrete behind these threats ; yet it was noteworthy that these threats coincided with moments when PERSON was called to account explicitly for far - reaching ORG activities ;", "- moreover , after having left the police force , the applicant had maintained contacts with CARDINAL informers and had \u2013 in cooperation with former colleagues \u2013 transported drugs through police - controlled channels and accepted money of criminal origin ; and", "- no explanation had been found for a number of actions by PERSON and the applicant and they themselves had never given a reasonable explanation ; the question whether they had been active , within the limits of the rule of law , in fighting crime or , whether , intentionally or unintentionally , they had participated in that same criminal activity could not be answered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately after PERSON appearance , the applicant gave evidence under oath at a public hearing before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG had a \u201c private conversation \u201d with Mr NORP , who was referred to in the verbatim record of this conversation as \u201c GPE - man \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . On DATE , directly after Mr L. 's second appearance , the ORG also took evidence from the applicant in public for a second time .", "CARDINAL . Although , in the course of its inquiry , the GPE - team had requested the applicant to give a statement on a number of occasions , he did so only once , namely shortly before his second ORG hearing , and briefly in the context of the inquiry into the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d , and refused further cooperation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG transmitted to the chief public prosecutor of GPE a formal record of perjury ( proces - verbaal van meineed ) in relation to the applicant and his former superior Mr L. concerning various parts of their statements before the ORG , in particular those parts concerning the question of payments to PERSON", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant was ordered to appear before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE to stand trial on charges of repeated perjury before the ORG and of repeatedly , that is to say , on different occasions DATE and DATE , having sought to intimidate PERSON when the applicant knew or had serious reason to assume that a statement from him would be sought in the context of the ORG inquiry .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , following hearings on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . Both the applicant and the prosecution lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , following CARDINAL hearings held DATE and DATE and in the course of which PERSON had given evidence to ORG on DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of repeated perjury before the ORG ( in respect of CARDINAL parts of the statements he had made at hearings before the ORG ) and of repeatedly having sought to intimidate the ( potential ) witness PERSON It acquitted the applicant of the remaining charges and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , suspended pending a DATE probationary period .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant 's argument that the evidence in his case had been unlawfully obtained . As regards the inquiry by the GPE - team , ORG noted that the tasks of ORG included carrying out inquiries into the manner in which police officers used their statutory powers , and that , in accordance with section QUANTITY of LAW ( ORG ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL of the Order on the functions of special - duty police officers ( GPE bijzondere ambtenaren van politie ) of DATE ( ORG Staatscourant ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , the prosecutorgeneral ( ORG ) can instruct ORG to carry out an inquiry , which may concern acts of an individual police officer or the functioning of a particular police force unit . After an extensive analysis of the mission of the GPE - team and the manner in which its inquiry had evolved , ORG found no reasons for holding that this inquiry should be regarded as a covert criminal investigation or that , in the course of this inquiry , the applicant should have been regarded as a criminal suspect in connection with the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the applicant 's argument that the recording by PERSON of his ( telephone ) conversations with the applicant with technical equipment made available by ORG had infringed his right to privacy under LAW . It found it established that , in the course of CARDINAL hearing sessions DATE and DATE , Mr NORP had made statements to the GPE - team about the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d , that CARDINAL facetoface conversations ( DATE ) and CARDINAL telephone conversations ( DATE ) between the applicant and PERSON had been recorded by PERSON , that he had done so on a voluntary basis and with the aid of devices provided by the FAC - team at Mr NORP 's own request as he was initially disbelieved and as he also wished this for personal safety considerations , that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL recorded telephone conversations only consisted of a recording of what Mr NORP had said , and that only in respect of CARDINAL particular conversation had PERSON received specific instructions as to what information should be obtained from the applicant , namely an admission of payments by him to PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG held that , according to domestic case - law , the mere tape - recording of a ( telephone ) conversation without the permission ( or knowledge ) of the conversation partner did not , in itself , entail a violation of that conversation partner 's right to respect for privacy ; for that to be the case , additional circumstances were required . In the instant case , the additional circumstances were that a number of conversations had been recorded , including the applicant 's contributions to those conversations . Furthermore , the ( telephone ) conversations had been conducted by the applicant as the former \u201c runner \u201d of a ( former ) police informer about matters having occurred during the period in which the applicant \u201c ran \u201d PERSON as informer and the winding - up of that relationship . As these conversations DATE in any event on the part of the applicant \u2013 were of an exclusively professional nature and content , ORG held that , in view of domestic case - law on this point , this allowed no other conclusion than that the applicant 's private life did not come into play in respect of the recorded ( telephone ) conversations at issue . It further held that PERSON recourse to a recording device DATE and PERSON had been entirely free to decide whether or not to activate it as well as to make the recordings available to the GPE - team \u2013 had mainly been prompted by PERSON need to substantiate his account of the \u201c fruit - juice channel \u201d in order to be believed . ORG therefore considered that it could not be said that there had been interference on the part of the authorities in respect of the recording . It only accepted the existence of such interference in breach of LAW in respect of the CARDINAL recorded conversation for which PERSON had received explicit instructions , to the extent that this conversation related to matters falling within the applicant 's sphere of privacy . It did not use that particular statement in evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of ORG , these findings were not altered by the fact that the GPE - team , for its part , had an interest in recording the conversations for the purposes of verifying information relevant to its factfinding inquiry , provided by PERSON , about the involvement in the \u201c fruitjuice channel \u201d of staff attached to the Kennemerland RCID , the unit forming the object of the GPE - team inquiry . ORG found it relatively obvious that this verification , in view of the accounts of the inquiry in subsequent reports , had taken place in the form of tape - recordings and the preparation of transcripts and , in this connection , recalled its finding that the inquiry was not to be regarded as a ( covert ) criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) in which he raised a total of CARDINAL grievances , including a complaint \u2013 in which he relied inter alia on LAW that ORG had unjustly rejected his argument that his right to privacy had been violated on account of the recording of his ( telephone ) conversations with PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG on DATE . It dismissed the alleged violation of the applicant 's right to privacy , holding :", "\u201c The complaint does not provide grounds for overturning the ruling of ORG ( kan niet tot cassatie leiden ) . Having regard to section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) , no further reasoning is called for , since the complaint does not give rise to a need for a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity or legal development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW ( PERSON ) of GPE provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone shall have the right to respect for his privacy , without prejudice to restrictions laid down by or pursuant to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Rules to protect privacy shall be laid down by ORG in connection with the recording and dissemination of personal data .", "CARDINAL . Rules concerning the rights of persons to be informed of data recorded concerning them and of the use that is made thereof , and to have such data corrected shall be laid down by ORG . \u201d", "LAW reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The privacy of correspondence shall not be violated except in the cases laid down by ORG , by order of the courts .", "CARDINAL . The privacy of the telephone and telegraph shall not be violated except , in the cases laid down by ORG , by or with the authorisation of those designated for the purpose by ORG . \u201d", "According to the relevant provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) as in force at the material time ( section ORG ) , it is not a criminal offence when a conversation partner taps or records a ( telephone ) conversation with a technical device or when a conversation partner passes a recording of such a conversation on to another person . It is further not a criminal offence when a person makes available to another person a recording device , unless the former is aware or in all reasonableness should be aware that the device concerned contains unlawfully made recordings or unlawfully obtained and stored data .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Parliamentary Inquiries Act ( Wet op de Parlementaire Enqu\u00eate \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , all persons residing in the GPE are obliged to comply with a summons to appear before a parliamentary commission of inquiry in order to be heard as a witness or expert . In case a person fails to comply with a summons to appear , the commission may issue an order for the person concerned to be brought before it ( bevel tot medebrenging ) within the meaning of LAW . The commission may require such witnesses to take the oath or make a solemn affirmation that they will state the whole truth and nothing but the truth ( LAW QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . Unlike the situation in criminal proceedings , persons heard by a parliamentary commission of inquiry do not have the right to remain silent . The only persons who enjoy the privilege of non - disclosure before a parliamentary commission of inquiry are those who DATE by virtue of their office , their profession or their position \u2013 are bound to secrecy , but only in relation to matters the knowledge of which has been entrusted to them in that capacity ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) or in case disclosure of secret information would entail disproportionate damage to the exercise of the profession of the person concerned or to the interest of his or her company or the company for which he or she works or has worked ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides that , with the exception of the situation referred to in LAW , statements given to a parliamentary commission of inquiry can never be used in evidence in judicial proceedings against the person having given such statements or against any third party . This reflects the principle that the purpose of a parliamentary inquiry is to find out the truth about facts and events having taken place in the past and not to determine personal liabilities under civil or criminal law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides , inter alia , that perjury ( meineed ) on the part of a witness heard by a parliamentary commission of inquiry attracts the penalties provided for in LAW for giving false testimony in civil proceedings . It further provides that the written record of the hearing concerned constitutes legal evidence .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( ORG ) provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The special - duty police officers shall ... be appointed , promoted , suspended and dismissed by the Minister of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The main task of ORG is to investigate ( purported ) punishable behaviour of civil servants which affects the integrity of the administration of justice and/or that of the public administration . It exercises this task by conducting either a fact - finding inquiry or a criminal investigation , depending on the mission given . As a fact - finding inquiry is solely aimed at obtaining factual clarification , ORG can not avail itself of any investigative powers ( opsporingsbevoegdheden ) or coercive measures ( dwangmiddelen ) in conducting such an inquiry . On the other hand , when conducting a criminal investigation , it can use such powers and measures and a criminal investigation may follow a fact - finding inquiry .", "CARDINAL .
