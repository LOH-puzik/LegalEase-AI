POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed armed robbery against a lorry driver . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand for DATE . It found that in the light of the evidence obtained , in particular from his accomplices , there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed that offence . The court further observed that the applicant had not confessed and found that there was a risk that he might obstruct the investigation . Having regard to the severity of the penalty that could be expected , the court held that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , finding that , given that the applicant had been caught in flagrante delicto , there was a strong likelihood that he had committed the offence in question . The court stressed that the applicant had \u2013 like his CARDINAL detained co - suspects \u2013 given contradictory evidence and had not confessed , which gave sufficient reasons to believe that , once released , he would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s continued detention was also justified by the severity of the penalty that could be expected . Moreover , evidence from ballistics and fingerprint experts \u2013 which was crucial for the determination of the role played by each co - suspect \u2013 needed to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE , reiterating the grounds previously given for his detention . It further held that the gravity of the charges and the severity of the likely penalty justified the prolongation of the most severe preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bill of indictment was filed with the NORP ORG against the applicant and his CARDINAL accomplices . The applicant was charged with attempted armed robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm . The bill of indictment specified that the applicant had been previously sentenced for similar offences . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , repeating the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions . It also held that the value of the goods that the accused had planned to steal and the previous criminal records of some of them made it likely that they would be given a heavy sentence .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , apparently in DATE , ORG referred the case to ORG , finding that the latter court should deal with the matter . The ensuing jurisdictional dispute was determined on an unspecified later date by ORG . The latter court ordered that the case be referred to ORG since ORG had in the meantime been closed down . On DATE the bill of indictment was transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG had prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , finding that the reasons previously given for holding him in custody were still valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention until DATE . In both decisions the court relied primarily on the severity of the sentence that could be expected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE prolonging his detention . It found that the applicant \u2019s continued detention on the basis of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure remained valid . Having regard to the nature of the alleged offences , the circumstances in which they had been committed and the fact that the applicant had committed similar offences in the past , ORG found that there was a very strong likelihood that he would be given a heavy sentence . It further held that LAW established a kind of presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on an accused might induce him to obstruct the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Since on DATE the length of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention reached the statutory CARDINAL time - limit laid down in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , all further decisions prolonging his detention on remand were given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant decisions were taken on the following dates : on DATE ( extending his detention until DATE ) , DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE and having regard to the particular complexity of the case ) and on a later unspecified date in DATE ( extending his detention for a further period ) . In its decision of DATE , ORG found that prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention beyond the statutory CARDINAL time - limit was justified under LAW on account of major insurmountable difficulties , referring in this connection to the above - mentioned jurisdictional dispute .", "CARDINAL . ORG listed the first hearing for DATE but the trial could not be started since the case file was with another court . CARDINAL hearings listed for CARDINAL and DATE were adjourned due to the change of the applicant \u2019s counsel and the need for the latter to prepare for the hearing . CARDINAL further hearings listed for DATE and DATE were also adjourned ( at the GPE request and because of the absence of the applicant \u2019s counsel respectively ) . As a result , the trial started on DATE . Further hearings were held on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted armed robbery and , having regard to his previous criminal record , sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment . It acquitted the applicant of the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm . It also prolonged his detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor and all the defendants appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . It ordered that the applicant be kept in detention pending the retrial until DATE in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he had been charged and the severity of the likely sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , holding that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid . It further held that keeping him in detention was sufficiently justified by the severity of the likely sentence and the need to secure the proper conduct of the trial . Subsequent decisions prolonging the applicant \u2019s detention were given by ORG on the following dates : DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , DATE ( extending his detention until DATE ) and DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) . The court held that the grounds previously given for his continued detention were still valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , relying on the severity of the likely sentence and the associated risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release and placed him under police supervision . It held that further prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention was unjustified , since ORG had not put forward any arguments warranting the continued application of the most severe preventive measure . In particular , ORG had not indicated any concrete grounds which would justify the risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , the applicant made numerous , unsuccessful applications for release and appealed , likewise unsuccessfully , against refusals to release him and decisions extending his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted armed robbery and sentenced him to seven years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . The applicant \u2019s legal aid lawyer declined to file a cassation appeal against ORG judgment since he had not found any grounds on which an appeal could be based .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that during his detention his correspondence was censored by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Registry sent the applicant a letter in reply to his first letter setting out his Convention complaints . That letter , with which an application form and accompanying documents were enclosed , was delivered to the applicant after having been controlled by the authorities . The ORG \u2019s envelope bears a stamp that reads \u201c Censored . Judge \u201d ( \u201c ORG . GPE . \u201d ) , followed by a date \u201c CARDINAL [ DATE \u201d and an illegible signature .
