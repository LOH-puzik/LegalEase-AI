ORG The town of PERSON has a heavy concentration of leather industries . Several tanneries there , all belonging to a limited company called ORG , had a plant for the treatment of liquid and solid waste built with a ORG subsidy on municipal land QUANTITY away from the applicant \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . ORG The plant began to operate in DATE without the licence ( licencia ) from the municipal authorities required by LAW on activities classified as causing nuisance and being unhealthy , noxious and dangerous ( \" LAW \" ) , and without having followed the procedure for obtaining such a licence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Owing to a malfunction , its start - up released gas fumes , pestilential smells and contamination , which immediately caused health problems and nuisance to many PERSON people , particularly those living in the applicant \u2019s district . The town council evacuated the local residents and rehoused them free of charge in the town centre for DATE , DATE and DATE . In DATE the applicant and her family returned to their flat and lived there until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , following numerous complaints and in the light of reports from the health authorities and ORG ( GPE para el ORG y la Naturaleza ) for the GPE region , the town council ordered cessation of CARDINAL of the plant \u2019s activities - the settling of chemical and organic residues in water tanks ( lagunaje ) - while permitting the treatment of waste water contaminated with chromium to continue .", "There is disagreement as to what the effects were of this partial shutdown , but it can be seen from the expert opinions and written evidence of DATE , produced before the ORG by the ORG and the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , that certain nuisances continue and may endanger the health of those living nearby .", "CARDINAL . ORG Having attempted in vain to get the municipal authority to find a solution , PERSON lodged an application on DATE with ORG , seeking protection of her fundamental rights ( section CARDINAL of PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on the protection of fundamental rights ( \" PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL \" ) - see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . She complained , inter alia , of an unlawful interference with her home and her peaceful enjoyment of it , a violation of her right to choose freely her place of residence , attacks on her physical and psychological integrity , and infringements of her liberty and her safety ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on account of the municipal authorities\u2019 passive attitude to the nuisance and risks caused by the waste - treatment plant . She requested the court to order temporary or permanent cessation of its activities .", "CARDINAL . ORG The court took evidence from several witnesses offered by the applicant and instructed the regional Environment and ORG to give an opinion on the plant \u2019s operating conditions and location . In a report of DATE the agency noted that at the time of its expert \u2019s visit on DATE the plant \u2019s sole activity was the treatment of waste water contaminated with chromium , but that the remaining waste also flowed through its tanks before being discharged into the river , generating foul smells . It therefore concluded that the plant had not been built in the most suitable location .", "ORG endorsed PERSON application . However , the Audiencia Territorial found against her on DATE . It held that although the plant \u2019s operation could unquestionably cause nuisance because of the smells , fumes and noise , it did not constitute a serious risk to the health of the families living in its vicinity but , rather , impaired their quality of life , though not enough to infringe the fundamental rights claimed . In any case , the municipal authorities , who had taken measures in respect of the plant , could not be held liable . The non - possession of a licence was not an issue to be examined in the special proceedings instituted in this instance , because it concerned a breach of the ordinary law .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE PERSON lodged an appeal with ORG Tribunal Supremo - see paragraph CARDINAL below in fine ) . She maintained that a number of witnesses and experts had indicated that the plant was a source of polluting fumes , pestilential and irritant smells and repetitive noise that had caused both her daughter and herself health problems . As regards the municipal authorities\u2019 liability , the decision of LOC appeared to be incompatible with the general supervisory powers conferred on mayors by LAW , especially where the activity in question was carried on without a licence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Regard being had to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW , inter alia , the town council \u2019s attitude amounted to unlawful interference with her right to respect for her home and was also an attack on her physical integrity . Lastly , the applicant sought an order suspending the plant \u2019s operations .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG at ORG filed pleadings to the effect that the situation complained of amounted to arbitrary and unlawful interference by the public authorities with the applicant \u2019s private and family life ( DATE the LAW taken together with LAW and CARDINAL - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court should accordingly grant her application in view of the nuisance to which she was subjected and the deterioration in the quality of her life , both of which had moreover been acknowledged in the judgment of DATE . On CARDINAL March Crown Counsel supported the suspension application ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The impugned decision had been consistent with the constitutional provisions relied on , as no public official had entered the applicant \u2019s home or attacked her physical integrity . She was in any case free to move elsewhere . The failure to obtain a licence could only be considered in ordinary - law proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

It observed that the complaint based on a violation of the right to respect for private life had not been raised in the ordinary courts as it should have been . For the rest , it held that the presence of fumes , smells and noise did not itself amount to a breach of the right to inviolability of the home ; that the refusal to order closure of the plant could not be regarded as degrading treatment , since the applicant \u2019s life and physical integrity had not been endangered ; and that her right to choose her place of residence had not been infringed as she had not been expelled from her home by any authority .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE CARDINAL sisters - in - law of PERSON , who lived in the same building as her , brought proceedings against the municipality of PERSON and ORG in ORG of ORG ( Tribunal Superior de Justicia ) , alleging that the plant was operating unlawfully . On DATE the court , noting that the nuisance had continued after DATE and that the plant did not have the licences required by law , ordered that it should be closed until they were obtained ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , enforcement of this order was stayed following an appeal by the town council and ORG . The case is still pending in ORG .", "CARDINAL .

ORG The investigation file contains several medical certificates and expert opinions concerning the effects on the health of those living near the plant . In a certificate dated CARDINAL DATE PERSON , a paediatrician , stated that PERSON daughter , PERSON , presented a clinical picture of nausea , vomiting , allergic reactions , anorexia , etc . , which could only be explained by the fact that she was living in a highly polluted area . He recommended that the child should be moved from the area .", "In an expert report of DATE ORG in GPE indicated that gas concentrations in houses near the plant exceeded the permitted limit . It noted that the applicant \u2019s daughter and her nephew , PERSON , presented typical symptoms of chronic absorption of the gas in question , periodically manifested in the form of acute bronchopulmonary infections .
