The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born out of wedlock . In DATE her father PERSON was ordered , on the initiative of the social services and by a decision of a ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , to pay child support until the applicant 's CARDINALth birthday .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Paternity Act came into force . The transitional provisions in LAW state that paternity proceedings with regard to a child born before the entry into force of the LAW had to be initiated within DATE , that is , before DATE . Moreover , no claim could be examined after the death of the father . No such restrictions exist for children born after the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's mother and ORG agreed on DATE of child support . The agreement was certified by the social services . The applicant attained majority in DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON died in DATE and the applicant found out that he had never been legally registered as her father . All of the parties had always been under the impression that paternity had been established when the duty to pay child support was ordered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a civil claim against ORG legal heir and requested ORG to confirm the paternity . She stated that neither she nor her mother had known that they needed to bring a claim against PERSON to establish paternity , nor did they know that there was a time - limit . They further stated that the social services had been obliged by law to inform them of these issues . No such information had been given to them although the mother of the applicant 's CARDINAL - sister had been informed at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered DNA tests to be performed on the applicant , her mother and PERSON 's CARDINAL brothers . The test was conclusive as to the paternity , with PERCENT certainty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim . The court stated that the transitional provision with regard to the death of the father was no longer relevant in the case as modern technology enabled testing that had not been possible in DATE when the LAW had been enacted . PERSON 's death was thus no longer an obstacle for bringing a paternity claim against him . However , the claim had been brought after the expiry of the DATE time - limit . The reason why the claim had been brought late was that the applicant and her mother had been mistaken about the legal character of the child support decision but this mistake was not of a kind that would have justified a derogation from the DATE time - limit . The time - limit itself was not unreasonable or discriminatory nor was it incompatible with the LAW , the LAW or ORG on the Rights of the ORG . The court thus concluded that the applicant 's claim was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld ORG decision on the same grounds as the latter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The referendary of ORG considered in her report ( mietint\u00f6 , bet\u00e4nkande ) that , since it had been established with DNA tests that PERSON was actually the biological father and since the applicant had a CARDINAL - sister born in DATE who had been acknowledged by ORG in DATE , it would not be against the spirit of the LAW to allow the establishment of paternity with regard to the applicant . Furthermore , she considered that applying the DATE rule in the specific circumstances would put the daughters in unequal positions with regard to inheritance and family relations . She referred to LAW as well as to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim in its precedent judgment ORG on the following grounds :", "\u201c LAW , on which [ the applicant 's ] claim is based , entered into force on DATE . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , the provisions of LAW are also applied when the child is born before the entry into force of the LAW , unless otherwise provided in LAW . When the child was born before the entry into force of LAW , proceedings for the establishment of paternity must be initiated , in accordance with LAW , within the time - limit of DATE from the entry into force of LAW . According to the same provision , proceedings can no longer be initiated if the man is deceased .", "[ The applicant ] requested in her action directed against the heir [ ORG ] of [ R.J. ] , who had died in DATE , that it be confirmed that [ R.J. ] was her father . [ The applicant ] was born out of wedlock on DATE and thus before the entry into force of LAW . According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , proceedings for the establishment of the paternity of [ R.J. ] should have been brought within the DATE time - limit from the entry into force of LAW , that is , at the latest on DATE . [ The applicant ] initiated the proceedings only on CARDINAL DATE . Therefore the lower courts rejected her action as time - barred .", "The above - mentioned DATE time - limit applies only to those children who were born before the entry into force of LAW . Those children who were born after the entry into force of LAW can initiate proceedings for the establishment of paternity without any time - limits or any restriction related to the death of the man .", "The question is first of all whether the time - limit in question , which prohibits [ the applicant ] having paternity established , puts her , contrary to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW , in a different position without acceptable justification , due to her date of birth and thus her age , to those children who were born out of wedlock after the entry into force of LAW . Only in the case that the answer to this question is in the affirmative , can the question of whether [ ORG 's ] death prevents the establishment of his paternity arise .", "It can be stated that the purpose of the time - limit in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW is that the child or its guardian decides to initiate the paternity proceedings within a reasonable time after the entry into force of the LAW . Taking into account the interests of different parties , the legislator has considered DATE as a reasonable and sufficient time - limit . This time - limit can be motivated by legal certainty considerations .", "Before the entry into force of LAW , paternity of a child born out of wedlock could normally be established only if the man acknowledged his paternity . The paternity could be established by a court decision against the man 's will only on very limited occasions and mainly when the child was considered as an engagement child in accordance with section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as in force at the relevant time . On other occasions the man , who by having intercourse with the mother could have made her pregnant , could only be held liable to pay to the child alimony in accordance with LAW out of Wedlock ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A child who had not been acknowledged or who was not an engagement child had no right to inherit from its father or the father 's relatives .", "The aim of LAW and of the concurrent legislative reform of the rights of a child was to guarantee the legal equality of children regardless of their descent . Therefore the provisions of LAW were made applicable also to children born before the entry into force of the LAW . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , children born out of wedlock had the same legal standing regardless of whether they were born before or after the entry into force of LAW . The fact that an alimony issue had been decided by a court before the entry into force of the LAW did not prevent bringing proceedings for the establishment of paternity . Children also received the same right , irrespective of their descent , to inherit from their fathers and the fathers ' relatives .", "The Paternity Act thus meant that the legal status of children born out of wedlock was fundamentally changed and that they received an equal status with children born within wedlock . The entry into force of the Act did not , however , automatically ex lege change the children 's legal status . If a man did not acknowledge a child , paternity proceedings had to be initiated in respect of a child born out of wedlock and the action could only be granted if there was sufficient evidence of the biological paternity . In this respect the provisions are the same as concerning children born after the entry into force of the LAW .", "The fact that LAW was made applicable also to children born before the entry into force of the LAW created uncertainties as to whether new claims , which had not even been possible under the previous legislation and for which there had thus been no need to be prepared , were going to be presented on the basis of events that had maybe taken place long before the entry into force of the LAW . It was important for a man to know , inter alia , who his heirs were in order to dispose by will of their shares . This also had consequences for the man 's relatives as the establishment of paternity had an effect on their rights because of the child 's right to inherit .", "The number of persons who could be concerned by the change of legal status provided for in LAW was considerable . Proceedings for the establishment of paternity could be initiated within the above - mentioned DATE time - limit irrespective of the age of the person born out of wedlock . The establishment of paternity could change legal relationships created DATE . The change of the man 's legal status due to the establishment of paternity can lead to an annulment of previous decisions also in cases when the children are born after the entry into force of LAW . The retroactive application of the provisions concerning establishment of paternity in respect of children born before the entry into force of the LAW and the effects that it has on legal relationships created under the earlier provisions may create even bigger and more significant problems . The probability of such problems is greater the more time has elapsed since the entry into force of the LAW . There are thus strong reasons for having the time - limit in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW .", "The provision containing the time - limit has not been conducive to creating confusing interpretations but , on the contrary , it is unambiguous and strict . In its precedent judgment ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL the court has examined an action for the establishment of paternity although it had been brought later than within the DATE time - limit from the entry into force of LAW and the man was deceased . However , the case concerned a child who had had the status of a child born within wedlock when the LAW entered into force and who could only initiate proceedings for the establishment of the paternity of another man after the paternity of the mother 's husband had been annulled . [ In the applicant 's ] case there were no legal obstacles for initiating the proceedings .", "LAW has now been in force for DATE . All children born before its entry into force have been adults for some time . It is probable that the paternity of almost all children born then out of wedlock has already been established in CARDINAL way or another with a final court decision or otherwise in accordance with the time - limit provided in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . The legal status of these children has also been determined accordingly . The legal situation can be regarded as established . For these reasons , and especially having regard to the time elapsed since the entry into force of LAW , this time - limit has DATE an even more significant role in providing legal certainty .", "It has not been claimed that [ the applicant ] and the putative father [ R.J. ] had ever lived together nor has there ever been any family relationship between them or any other close relationship . [ The applicant ] was already DATE when she initiated the proceedings . Taking into account [ ORG 's ] death and the circumstances as a whole , the establishment of his paternity would have significance only in relation to the applicant 's right to inherit . The international conventions by which GPE is bound , such as the Convention on the Rights of the LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and ORG MONEY ) , and their case law , do not support such interpretation that the literal application of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW would be incompatible with these LAW in the present case .", "On the above - mentioned grounds ORG considers that section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW does not put [ the applicant ] , who was born before the entry into force of LAW , in a different position without acceptable justification , due to her date of birth and thus her age , to those children who were born out of wedlock after the entry into force of the LAW . The application of the DATE time - limit in that provision is thus not incompatible with the prohibition of discrimination provided in DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The referendary of ORG stated in her report that refusing to establish the applicant 's paternity would be unconstitutional and would involve discrimination . The referendary proposed that the ORG disregard the time - limit on the basis of DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . The LAW of Finland ( perustuslaki , grundlagen , Act no . GPE ) , Article CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL , guarantees to everyone equality before the law and forbids discrimination of any kind :", "\u201c Everyone is equal before the law .", "No one shall , without an acceptable reason , be treated differently from other persons on grounds of sex , age , origin , language , religion , conviction , opinion , health , disability or other reason that concerns his or her person . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the LAW gives a court of law the right to give primacy to LAW when the application of an Act would conflict with LAW :", "\u201c If , in a matter being tried by a court of law , the application of an Act would be in evident conflict with the LAW , the court shall give primacy to the provision in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; Act no . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c A minor who has attained DATE of age shall have an independent right of action and right to be heard in a matter concerning his or her person , parallel to that of the person responsible for his or her care and custody or his or her other legal representative . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the LAW Born out of Wedlock ( laki avioliiton ulkopuolella syntyneist\u00e4 lapsista , lagen om barn utom \u00e4ktenskap , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a child born out of wedlock had a father , if a man acknowledged paternity , but paternity could not be established against a man 's will . According to section CARDINAL of the same Act , such defendant was deemed to be the person liable to provide child support to the child if he had had sexual intercourse with the child 's mother at the time when the child was possibly conceived . However , such an action was to be dismissed if it was manifestly improbable that the child was conceived as a result of that sexual intercourse .", "CARDINAL . As the children born out of wedlock were put in a substantially worse position than the children born in wedlock , there was a need to guarantee equal treatment of all children before the law ( see government proposal HE ORG ) . This became the main aim of the new LAW of DATE ( isyyslaki , lagen om faderskap , Act no . DATE ) which repealed LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Paternity Act provides that paternity is established either by acknowledgement or by a court decision . According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , the child has a right to institute proceedings with a view to having paternity established .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of LAW ( laki isyyslain toimeenpanosta , lagen ang\u00e5ende inf\u00f6rande av lagen om faderskap , Act no . DATE ) provides that the provisions of the LAW shall also apply if the child was born before the entry into force of the LAW , unless otherwise provided below . LAW provides that if a man , pursuant to LAW out of PERSON , enacted before the entry into force of LAW , has committed or been obliged by a final judgment to pay child support to a child born out of wedlock who has not the status of an acknowledged child , the provisions in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of this Act shall apply to the investigation of paternity , actions for the establishment of paternity and the exercise of the child 's right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c The child welfare supervisor shall attend to the investigation of paternity as provided in LAW , if a child born before the entry into force of this LAW has not reached DATE and the mother or the legal guardian of the child has expressed a wish that the child welfare supervisor attend to the investigation of paternity . After a man has acknowledged his paternity , the provisions in LAW ; section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ; and section CARDINAL of the LAW shall apply to the obligation of the child welfare supervisor to attend to the investigation of paternity , and to the enforcement of acknowledgement . \u201d", "\u201c A child or his or her legal guardian shall have the right of action for the establishment of paternity as provided in LAW . The child welfare supervisor shall not be entitled to exercise the child 's right to be heard without a separate authorisation . Proceedings for the establishment of paternity must be initiated within DATE from the entry into force of LAW . However , no proceedings may be instituted if the man is deceased . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears from the drafting history of LAW ( see Report of ORG PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) that considerations of legal certainty underlay the decision to restrict the right of action . The entry into force of the LAW opened up an opportunity to initiate proceedings that did not exist at the time when the children in question were conceived . The legislator considered that putative fathers ' legal security required rapid elimination of uncertainty about possible claims being brought against them on the basis of LAW . The restriction that a man 's death prevented the initiation of proceedings was justified by the argument that in such cases it was usually no longer possible to obtain sufficient evidence of the man 's paternity .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held on several occasions that the DATE time - limit in question is to be strictly applied . An exception has been made in a case where the paternity of the mother 's husband had to be annulled first and , as a result of that , the child would have become fatherless if the time - limit had been strictly respected ( see PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In its precedent case ORG CARDINAL-II-CARDINAL ORG considered that the DATE time - limit in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW was not such a time - limit that could be restored by seeking extraordinary remedies ( menetetyn m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4ajan palauttaminen , \u00e5terst\u00e4llandet av f\u00f6rsutten fatalietid ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
