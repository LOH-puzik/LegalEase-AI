NORP In DATE a person calling himself PERSON came to the headquarters of the newspaper employing the first CARDINAL applicants and offered to sell a video containing explicit images of a priest engaged in promiscuous behaviour . It appeared later that PERSON was member of a criminal gang and that the video in question had been used to blackmail the priest . The information was passed on to the QUANTITY police officers and on DATE CARDINAL of the applicants helped the police officers to apprehend Petrus . CARDINAL applicant was remunerated for her assistance and , on DATE , wrote a receipt to ORG .

On DATE the first applicant was allegedly contacted by CARDINAL of the QUANTITY police officers and was asked not to publish an article about illegalities at ORG due to appear DATE . The police officer took the applicant to a store , apparently specialising in electronics , where he showed her a video of her and the other applicants filmed on DATE in the sauna and threatened to have it broadcast on national television if his conditions were not met and added that copies of the video would be sent to the applicants\u2019 parents . He also allegedly threatened her with imprisonment and violence and warned her that her collaboration with the police would be made public . The first applicant informed the police officer in question that it was too late to stop the article \u2019s publication since the material had already been sent to the printing house . On DATE the article in question was published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the national television service broadcast a programme dedicated to the phenomenon of corruption and the moral character of journalists from the newspaper employing the applicants . The programme was presented by the president of the national television service and GPE was a guest . The guest was presented as a businessman who alleged that he had bribed the second applicant to secure the publication of material .

NORP In examining the complaint the Prosecutor \u2019s Office questioned CARDINAL of the applicants , all of whom gave similar accounts of the facts of the case and accused the CARDINAL police officers of the secret filming and blackmail . The police officers were questioned too , and all denied having had close relationships with the applicants and going with them to a sauna on DATE . They denied any implication in the secret filming , the allegations of blackmail and those concerning the transmitting of the video to the national television service .

It was also noted that the payment of money to that applicant was to be checked with ORG , the administrator of the public funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again dismissed the first applicant \u2019s criminal complaint on the ground that the receipt of CARDINAL DATE did not constitute a ORG secret and that its disclosure to the national television service was not an offence . As to the complaint concerning the alleged abuse of power by the QUANTITY police officers , it was also found to be ill - founded because it had not been established that the applicants had ever assisted in bringing about the arrest of PERSON . The first applicant appealed against this decision and submitted , inter alia , that what she was remunerated for by ORG had not been established . She also submitted that the investigators had failed to examine the original video from the sauna and that they had failed to examine the complaint about blackmail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the Prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE on the ground , inter alia , that ORG had failed to examine the first applicant \u2019s complaint concerning blackmail .", "CARDINAL .

The applicants also complained about the defamatory nature of some of the statements made on the programme aired on national television on DATE . For the alleged breaches they sought compensation in amounts varying CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the part of the applicants\u2019 action against the national television service concerning the broadcasting of the video from the sauna and the defamatory statements made during the programme of DATE . The court considered that there was no public interest in broadcasting the video from the sauna . The rest of the applicants\u2019 action was dismissed as ill - founded , the court finding that the applicants had failed to prove that the video had been shot by the QUANTITY police officers . The applicants appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE and found ORG responsible for the filming in the sauna on DATE , for blackmailing the applicants and for handing to the national television of the video of the sauna scene and of a copy of the receipt issued to ORG to one of the applicants . The finding was based on the statements made by all the applicants during the criminal investigation , on the fact that the programme of CARDINAL DATE contained images from the video of the arrest of the editor in chief of the newspaper employing CARDINAL of the applicants , a video which was not publicly available ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on the presence in the programme of a copy of a receipt issued by CARDINAL of the applicants . The judges of ORG also recognised the man making a \u201c thumbs up \u201d sign in the video ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as being CARDINAL of the QUANTITY police officers . The court also found the national television service responsible for broadcasting the video from the sauna . The court ordered the defendants to pay the applicants non - pecuniary damage varying CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) and MDL MONEY ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and compensation for costs and expenses in the amount of MDL MONEY ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . All the parties lodged appeals on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a final ruling in the case . It found the statements made during the programme of DATE to the effect that the applicant journalists had been bribed to publish an article and that they intended to kidnap a child defamatory . The court also found that the disclosure by ORG of one of the applicants\u2019 collaboration with the police by way of disclosing a receipt written by her had breached her right to respect for her private life . A similar breach with regard to all the applicants was found in respect of the broadcasting of the video of the sauna scene on national television without their consent and in the absence of a public interest justification . The court also found that the secret filming in the sauna constituted an unjustified interference with the applicants\u2019 right to privacy as guaranteed by LAW . However , relying on the outcome of the criminal investigation , the court found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the secret filming of the sauna scene had been carried out by employees of ORG . At the same time the court concluded that ORG was responsible for unlawfully transmitting to the national television service secret video material from a criminal case file , namely , a video of the arrest of the editor in chief of the newspaper employing the first and second applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the national television service to pay each applicant MDL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( the equivalent of EUR CARDINAL ) for non - pecuniary damage caused by the broadcasting of the video of the sauna scene .

The court also ordered the defendants to pay the applicants MDL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for costs and expenses .
