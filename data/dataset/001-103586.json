De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The present applicants are both nationals of GPE . The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in FAC . Her son , the second applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and also lives in FAC . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant entered GPE on DATE on a DATE visitor \u2019s visa valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , she claimed asylum on the basis of her NORP ethnicity , NORP Christianity , and the threats to and attacks upon her family by the mafia because of her NORP son - in - law who , it was assumed , must be sending money to the family in GPE . In particular , she claimed that , while in GPE , CARDINAL men had held a knife to her ribs demanding money in DATE and that her family home had been subjected to an attempted arson attack in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , her application was refused by the Secretary of ORG who considered her claim to be incredible because , inter alia , there were discrepancies in her account of when she had started to receive demands of money from the mafia ; she had failed to claim asylum on previous visits to GPE in DATE , and DATE ; there were inconsistencies in the date that she claimed to have been attacked with a knife ; it was implausible that the mafia would have known when her NORP family had sent her money in GPE ; and her son - in - law would not have returned to GPE after DATE if his life was genuinely in danger there . In addition , the Secretary of ORG considered that she had failed to demonstrate that there would be insufficient protection from the NORP authorities from the mafia or that she would be unable to relocate internally within GPE . Finally , the problems and discrimination that she claimed to have suffered due to her ethnicity and religion were not considered to amount to persecution .", "CARDINAL . Her appeal against this refusal was dismissed by the then ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE . The Adjudicator upheld the majority of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s findings and also found that the first applicant \u2019s credibility was undermined by her delay in claiming asylum until DATE . Furthermore , the Adjudicator found nothing in the objective evidence to suggest that the first applicant would be at risk in GPE by virtue of her status as a returning failed asylum seeker .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the then ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed an application for reconsideration of that determination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted an application for reconsideration of that determination for unknown reasons .", "CARDINAL . In a decision promulgated on DATE , the ORG dismissed her appeal upon reconsideration , finding that the ORG \u2019s decision had to stand as her representatives had conceded that it did not disclose any arguable error of law .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also entered GPE on DATE on a DATE visitor \u2019s visa valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . He also made an application for asylum on DATE , on the basis of his NORP ethnicity , NORP Christianity , the multiple attacks upon him by the mafia because of his NORP brother - in - law ( which had led to the second applicant \u2019s hospitalisation for DATE ) , and an attempted arson attack upon the family home in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , his application was also refused by the Secretary of ORG who considered his claim to be incredible because , inter alia , he had not been physically attacked until DATE after his brother - in - law had left GPE ; there were discrepancies in his account of when he had been attacked ; it was implausible that the mafia would have been aware of when his brother - in - law had sent the family money ; and he had failed to claim asylum on previous visits to GPE in DATE . The Secretary of ORG also considered that the second applicant had not established that the police had failed to assist him or that he would be unable to relocate within GPE . It was noted that the second applicant claimed not to practise his religion and therefore it was not accepted that he would be at risk of persecution on that account . The problems that he claimed to have suffered due to his ethnicity and religion were not considered to amount to persecution .", "CARDINAL . His appeal against this refusal was dismissed by the ORG on DATE . The Adjudicator upheld the findings of the Secretary of ORG and found that the second applicant \u2019s account of past events was not credible . Furthermore , the Adjudicator did not accept that NORP or ethnic NORP were persecuted in GPE . Whilst the Adjudicator was satisfied that the second applicant had an existing private and family life in GPE , it was found to be proportionate to remove him to GPE in the lawful and legitimate interests of immigration control .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant was granted permission to appeal to the then ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . On DATE , further to reforms of the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) , the appeal was dismissed by the ORG . It found that the second applicant had not submitted any objective evidence with regards to the situation of ethnic NORP or NORP in GPE and therefore could not make out his contention that the Adjudicator had failed to take into account any such evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant submitted further representations in relation to the increased risk upon return of ethnic NORP to GPE , which were rejected by the Secretary of ORG on CARDINAL DATE as not amounting to a fresh claim . It was accepted that NORP may face discrimination in GPE , but not that such treatment would amount to persecution . It was considered that the documents that the second applicant had submitted were generic and did not specifically relate to his own experience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , further representations were submitted to ORG on both the first and second applicants\u2019 behalf , which were rejected on DATE as not amounting to a fresh claim . Given the previous findings upon appeal , ORG did not accept that there was any objective evidence to suggest that they would be at real risk on account of their ethnicity or religion on return to GPE . It was accepted that discrimination against ethnic NORP might be perpetrated by random individuals , but considered that the applicants could seek protection from the authorities or move to another part of the country to avoid the same . It was also considered that the applicants could decide to join their extended family that had already moved to GPE from GPE . In relation to their claims under LAW , it was accepted that the first applicant had both family life with her NORP daughter , son - in - law and grandson and private life in GPE after having integrated into the community over DATE . Similarly , it was accepted that the second applicant had both family life with his NORP sister , brother - in - law , and nephew and private life in GPE . Nevertheless , it was not considered that their removal would be disproportionate under LAW as they had remained in GPE unlawfully and would be removed together .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted further representations through their legal representatives , in which they relied upon compassionate and discretionary grounds which focussed on their family life in GPE . Those representations also clarified that they were not pursuing their asylum claims and stated :", "\u201c ... it is not contended that there is any continuing asylum , or ORG claim . Although anti - NORP and Government harassment are running at high levels in GPE , there is insufficient evidence to counter the judicial ( and [ ORG ] ) conclusion , in each of these cases , that those threats do not amount to \u2018 ORG or any risk of \u2018 serious harm\u2019 upon return . For both mother and son , their claims are compassionate , derived from their family situation in FAC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , those representations were rejected by ORG as not amounting to a fresh human rights claim as it was considered that the ORG claim to have established family life in GPE had already been fully considered both on appeal and in responses to earlier representations . It was not accepted that the relationship between the first applicant and her adult daughter , or the second applicant and his adult sister constituted family life for the purposes of LAW as they had not submitted any evidence of dependency . Furthermore , it was considered that the applicants could maintain contact with family members in GPE by the usual methods of communication from overseas . It was considered that the applicants\u2019 removal was necessary and proportionate to the wider interests of maintaining an effective immigration control .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted further representations which they claimed raised new and serious concerns about the likelihood of torture of failed asylum seekers forcibly returned to GPE . Those representations were supported by a letter dated DATE from Mr PERSON , the former NORP Ambassador to GPE from DATE to DATE , which set out concerns about the fate of anybody deported to GPE whose exit visa had expired . Mr PERSON stated that :", "\u201c The notoriously cruel NORP security service \u2013 the SNB \u2013 have a permanent presence behind the immigration officers at GPE airport and at all points of entry . They would pick up anybody with an expired exit visa and subject them to ferocious questioning .", "In DATE , ORG on torture , Prof PERSON , published a report that said that torture in GPE was a \u2018 routine investigative technique\u2019 . I can absolutely confirm that from experience of CARDINAL of cases . Any hint that [ the applicants ] had claimed political asylum in the GPE DATE and ORG are a massive , very efficient and well - equipped intelligence service \u2013 and [ the applicants ] will almost to a certainty be subjected to treatment that well exceed the bar for torture . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG refused those representations concluding that they did not amount to a fresh claim . It was noted that PERSON had been reprimanded by ORG on several occasions in DATE and DATE , and subsequently dismissed from his post in DATE at which point he had been charged with gross misconduct and an investigation had been commenced . Given Mr PERSON \u2019s outspoken public views on the human rights situation in GPE , it was not considered that he could be accepted as an independent source of evidence which would add weight to their claims .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , the applicants lodged applications with the ORG and requested interim measures under LAW to stop their removal to GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Acting President of the Section to which the application was allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and indicate to the Government of GPE that the applicants should not be expelled until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE ( \u201c the NIA Act CARDINAL \u201d ) , provides a right of appeal against an immigration decision made by the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , appeals in asylum , immigration and nationality matters were heard by the ORG . LAW CARDINAL provided that , with the permission of the ORG , a party to an appeal could apply to the ORG against an ORG determination on a point of law . LAW CARDINAL provided that where the ORG had determined an appeal under LAW , a party to the appeal could bring a further appeal on a point of law to ORG . It also provided that , in the event that ORG upheld any error of law in the determination , it had the power to make any decision which the ORG could have made or to remit the case to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the then ORG replaced the former system of ORG and the ORG . This in turn has been replaced by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen . Section CARDINAL ) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides as follows :", "\u201c When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused or withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph CARDINAL of these Rules and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim . The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered . The submissions will only be significantly different if the content :", "( i ) had not already been considered ; and", "( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , created a realistic prospect of success , notwithstanding its rejection . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the scrutiny of fresh asylum claims and the power of the courts to review such scrutiny , ORG in PERSON ( ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) has held :", "\u201c Accordingly , a court when reviewing a decision of the Secretary of ORG as to whether a fresh claim exists must address the following matters . First , has the Secretary of ORG asked himself the correct question ? The question is not whether the Secretary of ORG himself thinks that the new claim is a good one or should succeed , but whether there is a realistic prospect of an adjudicator , applying the rule of anxious scrutiny , thinking that the applicant will be exposed to a real risk of persecution on return ... The Secretary of ORG of course can , and no doubt logically should , treat his own view of the merits as a starting - point for that enquiry ; but it is only a starting point in the consideration of a question that is distinctly different from the exercise of the Secretary of ORG making up his own mind . Second , in addressing that question , both in respect of the evaluation of the facts and in respect of the legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts , has the Secretary of ORG satisfied the requirement of anxious scrutiny ? If the court can not be satisfied that the answer to both of those questions is in the affirmative it will have to grant an application for review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thus , an applicant making fresh representations must establish that they have a realistic prospect of success to establish a \u201c fresh claim \u201d which , even if then refused by ORG , will nonetheless generate a fresh right of appeal to be considered on the merits .", "CARDINAL . Country guidance determinations of both the former ORG and ORG are to be treated as an authoritative finding on the country guidance issue identified in the determination , based upon the evidence before the members of the ORG that determined the appeal . Unless expressly superseded or replaced by a later country guidance determination , country guidance determinations are authoritative in any subsequent appeals so far as that appeal relates to the country guidance issue in question and depends upon the same or similar evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the country guidance determination of ORG ( Returning citizens \u2013 minorities \u2013 religion ) GPE CG [ DATE ] UKAIT CARDINAL , the ORG considered a large amount of objective evidence in relation to the general human rights situation in GPE and heard evidence from Mr PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In relation to Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence , the ORG commented as follows :", "\u201c We have some concern about Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence . He is in an unusual position and it has given us cause to reflect on the weight which we should give to his opinion . We say that for this reason . Mr PERSON has produced a short statement which is entirely unsourced . He has given evidence during the course of which he gave an indication in general terms as to some of the sources which he relies upon . In CARDINAL aspect , the return of the NORP failed asylum seekers , there was express source , namely the NORP Ambassador . Having said that his report was unsourced , we acknowledge that he is not an expert of an academic nature who relies upon the reports of others for their information . Rather , he had been GPE Ambassador in GPE for DATE or so and is therefore a person who has had an exceptional opportunity to observe and obtain information . We also acknowledge that , ORG having ejected much of the foreign press , and many NGOs , there is limited opportunity for obtaining information about what is going on there .", "...", "We are left with the impression that although Mr PERSON is in a unique position to assist us about GPE , he also has interests of his own which may effect , consciously or otherwise , the interpretation which he puts on facts and events . We have therefore decided that although the factual incidents of which he speaks are likely to be reliable , we should treat with some circumspection his interpretation of them . That is not to say that we reject his interpretation out of hand . We are fortunate in this case that there is also a great deal of background evidence from other sources . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In light of the above and other considerations , the ORG then held as follows :", "\u201c We are not satisfied that it is not possible to obtain a passport renewal outside GPE . We say that because the appellant \u2019s husband has recently returned there and he will in all probability have had to obtain some form of travel document . He arrived with the appellant in DATE . We have not been told of any difficulty on his part .", "...", "The fact that he has returned undermines Mr PERSON \u2019s assertion that it is not possible to get documentation . We accept he may not have been issued with an actual passport but that does not matter . It is the fact he was in possession of an official document that enabled him to return , apparently without difficulty , which is important . His return also detracts very considerably from Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence , and the appellant \u2019s mother - in - law \u2019s assertion , that there is severe punishment for those who do return , having stayed away beyond the end of their exit visa . The appellant is still in communication with her mother - in - law and we have no doubt that if her former husband had been charged , or even imprisoned , as a result of returning after a long absence , she would have heard about it and we would have been told . We find there is no satisfactory evidence that it is not possible to obtain a travel document ( whether it be a renewed passport or some other form of documentation ) . Nor is there any satisfactory evidence to show that a returnee is likely to be punished for having been out of the country longer than permitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG further held that there was no satisfactory evidence that non - NORP faced discrimination of such a nature as to amount to persecution , or serious harm , or a breach of their LAW . Furthermore , it held that , whilst followers of all religions , save for NORP who attend registered mosques , were subject to a degree of harassment , it did not in general amount to persecution , serious harm or a breach of a worshippers\u2019 human rights . Finally , it held that ministers of religion , those who practise religion in unregistered LOC , particularly active members of evangelical NORP congregations , and proselytising or fundamentalist denominations of any religion could be at risk depending on the facts in every case .", "CARDINAL . In his report of CARDINAL DATE , the Special Rapporteur concluded that torture or ill - treatment was \u201c systematic \u201d in GPE . He also stated that \u201c the pervasive and persistent nature of torture \u201d throughout the criminal investigative process in GPE could not be denied . GPE has not extended a further invitation to the Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit the country , despite repeated requests .", "CARDINAL . In its Concluding Observations upon GPE of DATE , ORG set out its concerns about , inter alia , \u201c numerous , ongoing and consistent \u201d allegations concerning the routine use of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment committed by law enforcement and investigative officials or with their instigation or consent , often to extract confessions or information to be used in criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , after setting out information about the numerous allegations of excessive use of force and ill - treatment by NORP military and security forces during the DATE events at Andijan ( when CARDINAL protesters were killed by the NORP authorities ) , ORG reported that it had received credible reports that some persons who had sought refuge abroad and had been returned to the country had been kept in detention in unknown places and possibly subjected to breaches of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In its Concluding Observations upon GPE of DATE , ORG set out various concerns , including , inter alia :", "\u201c the continued reported occurrence of torture and ill - treatment , the limited number of convictions of those responsible , and the low sanctions generally imposed , including simple disciplinary measures , as well as indications that individuals responsible for such acts were amnestied and , in general , the inadequate or insufficient nature of investigations on torture / ill - treatment allegations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG also concluded that it remained \u201c concerned about the need for individuals to receive an exit visa in order to be able to travel abroad \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Reports of non - governmental organisations", "CARDINAL . NORP In its submissions to ORG dated DATE and DATE , ORG remained seriously concerned about persistent allegations of widespread torture and other ill - treatment of detainees and prisoners by law enforcement personnel and prison guards , reports of which stemmed from all layers of civil society . Allegations had also been made that individuals returned to GPE from other countries pursuant to extradition requests were held in incommunicado detention , thereby increasing their risk of being tortured or otherwise ill - treated . The submission also set out that illegal exit abroad or illegal entry into GPE , including overstaying the permission to travel abroad or failure to renew it , are punishable under LAW with imprisonment from DATE or in aggravated circumstances by up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Returned asylum seekers were considered to be particularly vulnerable to being charged under LAW , as many would not have renewed their permission to travel abroad .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions to ORG of DATE and DATE , ORG set out its concerns about the \u201c atrocious \u201d human rights record of GPE . It noted that the Government of GPE continued to refuse access to the country to CARDINAL ORG special procedures ( the human rights mechanisms established by ORG to address either specific country situations or thematic issues ) despite their repeated requests for invitations to visit GPE . It also reported that torture and ill - treatment remained endemic to the criminal justice system in GPE , and stated that another distinct concern relating to torture and ill - treatment is that of NORP refugees and asylum seekers forcibly returned by neighbouring countries , despite the risk of torture and ill - treatment that they face upon return ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
