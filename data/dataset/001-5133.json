{"ITEMID": "001-5133", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "LIE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "WALDEN v. LIECHTENSTEIN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and residing in GPE since DATE . In the proceedings before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant 's wife retired in DATE and received a single old age pension ( einfache GPE ) . Since DATE , the DATE allocation amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) . The applicant retired in DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Alters und Hinterlassenenversicherung ) fixed a common married couple 's pension ( Ehepaar - Altersrente ) for the applicant and his wife in the amount of ORG DATE . In accordance with the relevant legislation , the husband is entitled to receive the married couple 's pension , while the wife 's former claim to a single old age pension ceases and is replaced by a derived right to payment of CARDINAL of the common pension . Further , the married couple 's pension is calculated on the basis of the husband 's contribution years . It is PERCENT of the husband 's single pension . As the applicant 's insurance period was shorter than his wife 's , the resulting amount was lower than his wife 's single pension . According to the relevant provisions a compensation was added to arrive at the amount of his wife 's former pension .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( PERSON ) against the above decision . He argued that the method of calculation applied rendered his own contributions null and void as the married couple 's pension was no higher than his wife 's single pension . Further , he held that he and his wife were discriminated against in relation to other married couples . He requested CARDINAL separate pensions to be paid instead of the common pension .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's objection . As to the applicant 's first argument it observed that the GPE pension scheme was based on the principle of social solidarity . Thus , it did not grant pension claims in direct relation to the contributions paid . As to the applicant 's second argument , ORG agreed that there was unequal treatment of men and women as only the husband was entitled to the married couple 's pension , which was calculated solely on the basis of the husband 's contribution years . Moreover , in a case like the applicant 's where the husband had an incomplete insurance career while his wife 's was complete , a lower married couple 's pension was paid than in the opposite case . However , the legal provisions were clear and precise and did not permit any other interpretation . The question could , thus , only be resolved by an amendment of the law . Such an amendment was envisaged for DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Obergericht ) , upon the applicant 's appeal , confirmed ORG decision as being in conformity with existing legislation even if it was contrary to the principle of non - discrimination . It also refused the applicant 's motion to interrupt the proceedings and to request ORG ( PERSON ) to examine the constitutionality of the contested provisions of ORG . It found that in the event of an abrogation of these provisions the applicant 's claims would not find any other legal basis without further initiative of the legislator .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law . It stated that the unequal treatment of husband and wife in the current pension scheme could not be remedied by the courts , but required an amendment of the relevant law by the legislator .", "On DATE the applicant , after having lodged a complaint with ORG , challenged ORG judge PERSON for bias on the ground that the latter had written a dissertation on social security law , which had been partly financed and distributed by ORG .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a Constitutional Court ( Verfassungsgerichtshof ) , rejected the applicant 's challenge for bias and partly granted his constitutional complaint .", "As to the applicant 's challenge for bias , ORG found that the past financial support and distribution of a dissertation by a public law institution did not create such a personal link as to affect a judge 's impartiality .", "As to the applicant 's complaint , ORG found that the applicant 's constitutional rights were violated by ORG decision . The married couples ' pension system , based on a traditional view of marriage , was unconstitutional as being contrary to the principle of non - discrimination on the basis of gender , in particular as only the husband 's contribution years were decisive for the calculation of the married couple 's pension . Moreover , it was unconstitutional as being contrary to the general principle of equal treatment , in that married and unmarried couples were treated differently with regard to their pension benefits .", "", "However , ORG rejected the applicant 's request to quash the contested judgment and to set aside the relevant provisions in the Old Age Pension Act . It noted that it would , technically speaking , be possible to set aside a number of provisions with the result that the applicant and his wife would each be entitled to a single old age pension . However , this would cause massive disadvantages to others , in particular to married couples where the wife did not have an own insurance career . The situation was even more complex in view of ORG between GPE and GPE which could only operate if the requirements for pension claims were more or less identical in both GPE . In conclusion , ORG did not see itself in a position to set aside the contested provisions , given the complexity of social security law and the statutory time - limit of a maximum of DATE for suspending an abrogation . ORG went on to say that despite these considerations the continuing application of unconstitutional legislation for a protracted period would be unacceptable . However , a comprehensive legal reform with the explicit aim of guaranteeing gender equality in social security law was already being prepared and ORG had requested the ORG to submit all necessary amendments of social security law before DATE . Moreover , the draft amendment of the Old Age Pension Act included provisions according to which couples in the position of the applicant and his wife would be entitled to CARDINAL single pensions . Having regard to the time - table for the pending reform , the above - mentioned maximum time - limit of DATE for enacting new legislation could possibly be complied with . Nevertheless , it was not justified to annul the unconstitutional provisions with a DATE suspension as the envisaged date of entry into force , namely DATE , would become illusory if for instance a referendum was requested . In this case , the annulment would become effective and would entail all the negative consequences described above .", "In fact , the amendment to ORG was adopted in DATE ( see below ) . According to its provisions the applicant and his wife each receive a single pension of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , respectively , as of DATE .", "B. Relevant Domestic Law", "ORG ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Alters- und GPE ) of DATE , PERSON ( LGBl ) CARDINAL , before its amendment , provided for common married couple 's pensions which were to be paid as soon as both spouses reached the retirement age . When a common pension was paid the wife 's claim for pension payments expired . Only the husband 's contribution DATE were decisive for the calculation of the married couple 's pension .", "By amendment of DATE , PERSON , to ORG , the married couple 's pension system was replaced by a scheme providing single pensions for both spouses . Married couple 's pensions existing at the time of the amendment were transformed into CARDINAL single pensions as of DATE , subject to the clause that the total amount of both pensions was not to be lower that the previous married couple 's pension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
