Mr N. appealed , arguing that the allegations that he had been violent were untrue and that he had always cared better for his child .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal proceedings ORG held a hearing on DATE . It heard CARDINAL witnesses who confirmed Mr N. \u2019s aggressive behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment but considered that there was ample evidence that Mr N. had been aggressive and had battered the first applicant during their marriage .
