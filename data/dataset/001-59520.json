The applicants and Mr ORG had been under surveillance by officers of Her ORG and Excise for DATE prior to their arrest on DATE . On DATE the CARDINAL men were observed travelling to FAC . They did not leave the airport and almost immediately after arriving they checked in their luggage and returned to FAC . The second applicant ( henceforth , \u201c PERSON ) and Mr ORG travelled to GPE on DATE , and the first applicant ( \u201c PERSON ) went to GPE on DATE . The CARDINAL applicants returned to GPE on DATE , when PERSON was observed arriving at FAC carrying a black suitcase . On DATE he met PERSON ( who had been in GPE ) and PERSON ( coming from GPE ) at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a man named PERSON flew from GPE to GPE via ORG . He had with him a black suitcase containing QUANTITY of cocaine .", "CARDINAL . That morning , the applicants went to Mr ORG \u2019s GPE hotel . PERSON was seen carrying a black suitcase similar to PERSON . Shortly thereafter he and PERSON left the hotel by taxi for FAC , carrying the black and a grey suitcase . At the airport they boarded a flight for GPE , checking in the black suitcase in Mr ORG \u2019s name and the grey suitcase in PERSON \u2019s name . Immediately on their arrival in GPE they checked themselves on to a return flight to FAC . Mr PERSON was also on this flight , although there was no evidence of contact between Mr GPE , PERSON and Mr Terrasson .", "CARDINAL . When the aeroplane reached FAC , customs officers intercepted the luggage . They found that the CARDINAL black suitcases were indeed very similar . Mr PERSON \u2019s suitcase was to contain QUANTITY of cocaine . It was almost twice as heavy as the suitcase checked in by PERSON , which had a number of identifying tags attached to it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The officers put the CARDINAL suitcases back with the other luggage from the flight which passed for collection on to the carousel . CARDINAL of the officers saw PERSON take Mr PERSON \u2019s suitcase from the carousel and put it onto Mr ORG \u2019s trolley . Mr Terrasson took this suitcase through the green , \u201c nothing to declare \u201d , channel at customs . PERSON also collected the grey suitcase , which he took through the green channel . The other black suitcase , which had been checked on to the flight by PERSON , was not collected from the carousel .", "CARDINAL . Mr Terrasson and PERSON were arrested by customs officers . PERSON , who had not been on the flight or at the airport , was arrested DATE at the home of a relative in GPE . All CARDINAL men were interviewed and denied any knowledge of or participation in the offence . PERSON said that he was an emerald and diamond dealer in GPE for a short time on his way to GPE . He claimed not to know Mr ORG and stated that he did not know anything about his son \u2019s trip to GPE . PERSON said that he had previously travelled to GPE in connection with the purchase of some jewels , but said that he had made the most recent trip to see a girlfriend . He also denied knowing PERSON , until customs officers told him that Mr ORG \u2019s credit cards had been found in the grey suitcase . PERSON then conceded that he had had a brief encounter with Mr Terrasson in GPE . Mr ORG denied knowing either of the applicants or PERSON . He said that he had travelled alone to GPE , taking with him a black suitcase , to meet a married woman friend . He was unable to meet her because her husband was home , so he returned immediately to GPE . He claimed to have taken his own , not Mr PERSON , black suitcase from the carousel . Mr PERSON was arrested later in GPE . He said in interview that he had been instructed by a man called PERSON PERSON to bring the black suitcase , which he believed to contain antiques , from GPE to FAC and to leave it on the luggage carousel .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE \u201c old - style \u201d committal proceedings ( requiring the prosecution witnesses to give oral evidence ) were held at ORG . Under cross - examination by the defence counsel , the customs case - officer claimed that the only relevant evidence held by the prosecution which had not been disclosed to the defence was CARDINAL tapes of interviews with the applicants\u2019 GPE relatives , CARDINAL or CARDINAL ORG statements and some material taken from the house where PERSON had been arrested .", "CARDINAL . At the trial , which started in DATE , the prosecution case was that PERSON had organised the importation , using PERSON as the courier from GPE to GPE and GPE , and that he had instructed PERSON ORG , with PERSON as \u201c minder \u201d , to collect PERSON suitcase at FAC as if in mistake for his own . There was no forensic , photographic or video evidence to substantiate the prosecution case , which relied to a large extent on the accounts given by customs officers of what they had observed .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL defendants pleaded not guilty and gave evidence . The applicants maintained that PERSON worked principally as a jewel trader , but that he did not keep written records because he systematically avoided paying taxes and duties in GPE . The illegality of his jewel trading had motivated their lies during their initial interviews with customs officers . The applicants\u2019 defence centred around a dispute between PERSON and a rival jewel trader based in GPE called PERSON . They stated that PERSON had paid Mr PERSON USD MONEY in advance for diamonds , which Mr PERSON had failed to deliver to the applicants as agreed in GPE on CARDINAL occasions : QUANTITY DATE , DATE and DATE . On this last occasion , since , as before , Mr PERSON did not appear , PERSON and Mr Terrasson , who had gone together to collect the diamonds , returned immediately to FAC , where PERSON removed PERSON , not Mr Smolny \u2019s , suitcase from the carousel . The applicants contended that Mr PERSON was an informer for ORG and Excise . They claimed that , in order to avoid repaying his debt and for fear that the applicants would discredit him amongst other NORP traders following the non - delivery of the diamonds , he had arranged falsely to implicate them in the importation of cocaine . However , they had no evidence to connect PERSON to Mr PERSON \u2019s suitcase full of drugs or to substantiate the suggestion that he was a ORG and Excise informer .", "CARDINAL . Under cross - examination the customs officers involved in the case refused either to confirm or deny whether or not they had used an informer . No evidence relating to an informer or to PERSON was served on the defence or put before the judge .", "CARDINAL . In his summing up the judge summarised the defence by saying , inter alia :", "\u201c ... PERSON had long since either directly or through the NORP authorities informed ORG and Excise that PERSON and PERSON and Mr ORG were preparing to smuggle cocaine to GPE , and in that way had induced the ORG and Excise here to mount a prolonged and labour - intensive observation of those CARDINAL men . On the DATE , PERSON sprang his trap . He got PERSON to send PERSON off with the suitcase ... with the drugs in it , believing it , of course , to be antiques and works of article He got PERSON to believe that it was worthwhile going for the third time to GPE for a delivery of the diamonds and he notified ORG of the itinerary of the various people which was to be foreseen from these arrangements , and that is how the incident you have heard about on TIME and indeed the observations of that day , came about . It follows from that account DATE if it is an accurate one \u2013 that Mr PERSON had some luck : firstly , ORG had a suitcase just like ORG . Possibly someone had observed ORG \u2019s suitcase and given a very exact description to ORG and they were able to get a duplicate . It would be difficult for PERSON to ask ORG and Excise about ORG \u2019s suitcase for that purpose , you may think , without revealing that he himself was engaged in setting them up . You may think that ORG and Excise in GPE would agree \u2013 you may want to consider whether they would agree to co - operate on that basis in framing an innocent group of foreigners of good character at the behest of an unknown NORP businessman like PERSON . ... Just consider in your mind what it would be like to try and induce ORG , even as an LANGUAGE subject , to co - operate with you in such a way . ... [ I]t is worth just looking at the costs to Mr PERSON if PERSON story is right ... to see what was in it for Mr PERSON . His costs : he provided initially some samples [ of diamonds ] worth CARDINAL or eight thousand ... US dollars . ... He lost the cost of sending [ his representative ] diagonally across the world and back [ with the sample ] with a bit of time in a hotel . ... He lost the cost of PERSON fare in the QUANTITY - class FAC return , and he lost the cost of Mr PERSON \u2019s GPE hotel ... . ORG [ T]he case is that he lost all those things and whatever is the cost of QUANTITY of PERCENT pure cocaine in GPE . No doubt that cost is very , very much less than it would be in GPE , but ... you may think that QUANTITY of high quality cocaine like that would cost a substantial sum , albeit nowhere near QUANTITY , in the providing country . I put those bits and pieces of information together because it is not altogether obvious when CARDINAL just runs through the story that that is what the information amounts to , but you may think it does , and it may be relevant to considering the likelihood of somebody behaving in the way Mr PERSON is said to have done . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury , by a majority of CARDINAL , convicted the applicants and Mr Terrasson of importing the cocaine . Mr PERSON was acquitted . On DATE , after an inquiry by the judge under LAW DATE , PERSON was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and a confiscation order of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL with a further CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment to be served in default of payment . PERSON and Mr PERSON both received sentences of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and PERSON was also ordered to pay a confiscation order of GBP DATE or serve a further DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction . On DATE the single judge refused his application . The first applicant renewed it before ORG and the second applicant applied directly to that ORG for leave to appeal against conviction . On DATE a summary of the case was prepared by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants learned from the NORP press ( ORG ) that a NORP undercover police officer , Commissioner PERSON , had written a report , called \u201c the ORG \u201d , concerning his DATE investigation into drug trafficking between GPE and LOC . In DATE the ORG solicitor obtained a copy of the report . It mentioned PERSON , describing him as CARDINAL of CARDINAL regular informers of the NORP , NORP and NORP police . He was said to have an interest in stolen jewels and a long - term involvement in the traffic from GPE to LOC of large quantities of cocaine , which he was able freely to obtain from the NORP police . In a letter dated DATE , ORG informed the applicants\u2019 solicitors that the report was the property of the LOC cantonal police and that in DATE a meeting was held at ORG headquarters in GPE concerning the PERSON investigation but that it was not possible to provide any further information in this connection . The applicants provided a copy of the report to the prosecution , which declined to confirm or deny its authenticity or the truth of its contents , and repeated that there was no undisclosed material relevant to the issues at trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicants added a further ground of appeal coupled with an application for leave to call fresh evidence . They maintained that ORG substantiated their suggestion at trial that Mr PERSON had access both to stolen jewels and cocaine and that he had an established relationship with law enforcement agencies in LOC . In their submission , the fact that the jury had not had before it evidence relating to these matters , and the fact that the judge , ignorant of the true facts , had characterised Mr PERSON in his summing up as an unknown NORP businessman , rendered their convictions unsafe .", "CARDINAL . On or about DATE the prosecution informed the defence that , contrary to earlier statements , unserved unused material did in fact exist , which the prosecution wished to place before ORG in the absence of the applicants or their lawyers . The prosecution then applied ex parte to ORG for a ruling whether it was entitled , on grounds of public interest immunity , not to disclose this material . The applicants objected to the holding of an ex parte hearing , in writing on DATE and orally before ORG on DATE , submitting inter alia that the court was a tribunal of both fact and law and could be adversely influenced by material which was wrong or inaccurate .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the objections and heard the prosecution \u2019s ex parte application . It decided not to rule on the application unless or until such time that , having considered the applicants\u2019 application to introduce new evidence , it became necessary to do so .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of the applications for leave to appeal against conviction and to bring new evidence commenced on DATE . ORG indicated its view that ORG would not be admissible in evidence because , inter alia , its author could not be found to vouch for its accuracy and be cross - examined on its contents .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG request the hearing was adjourned on DATE and legal aid was granted to enable their solicitor to travel to GPE where , it was believed , PERSON was in custody awaiting trial on a charge of smuggling cocaine . However , the NORP authorities were unwilling to assist the applicants without the backing of a formal letter of request from a competent authority . The applicants therefore applied to ORG for a letter requesting the NORP authorities to give their solicitor access to the criminal proceedings there . On DATE a different constitution of ORG ruled that in principle it had jurisdiction to issue such a letter of request . On DATE , however , the originally constituted court decided that the ORG proposed request to the NORP authorities was too wide - ranging and , even if more restrictively drawn , unlikely to elicit information which would be either admissible or of assistance in the appeal . It therefore decided that it was not in the public interest to issue a letter of request , and adjourned the case until after the conclusion of Mr PERSON \u2019s trial in GPE in the Autumn of CARDINAL . In the event , however , PERSON was released on bail and his whereabouts were unknown at the time of the applicants\u2019 appeal hearing in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 solicitor was able to obtain a number of documents relating to the NORP proceedings , including transcripts of interviews with Mr PERSON , arrest warrants and a list of his previous convictions . He was also able to obtain a statement from Commissioner PERSON , the NORP police officer who had prepared ORG . In his statement the Commissioner confirmed the authenticity of the report . He stated that he had been introduced to Mr PERSON by a NORP police officer and had become Mr PERSON \u2019s \u201c handler \u201d , passing information to the NORP authorities during the investigation into the applicants . According to the Commissioner \u2019s statement , his NORP \u201c contact \u201d had been a customs officer named PERSON , whom he had contacted at ORG in GPE . He believed that Mr PERSON had spoken to Mr Crago several times and had sought payment for information he had given him . The Commissioner concluded by indicating that he would be willing to appear as a witness in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants added a further ground of appeal , alleging that the prosecution had failed to make full disclosure of the evidence in its possession concerning Mr PERSON , and that the lack of full disclosure rendered their convictions unsafe .", "CARDINAL . DATE before the hearing of the appeal , Commissioner ORG informed the defence lawyers that his superiors in ORG had refused him authorisation to attend . The ORG counsel suggested to ORG that this decision might have resulted from communication between ORG and Excise and the NORP authorities , but there is no evidence in support of this . Mr PERSON was called by the defence to give evidence . He denied that he had been Commissioner PERSON \u2019s contact and declined to answer any question about Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing the applicants\u2019 application to admit new evidence and holding an ex parte hearing in the absence of the defence lawyers , ORG ruled that justice did not require disclosure by the ORG of the public interest immunity evidence . The applicants and their lawyers were not permitted to be present when the court delivered its judgment on disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the application for leave to appeal . It observed :", "\u201c Little , if any , of the material [ put before ORG by the ORG counsel ] would have been admissible at the trial . That is not only because it is largely hearsay and unspecific as to events and dates , but simply because much of it is wholly irrelevant to the central issue in this case , namely whether ORG and Excise officers conspired with PERSON to \u2018 frame\u2019 the NORP . However , in considering all the information put before us , we have not been able to avoid taking a view of its effect if , and to the extent that it were admissible and credible , on the outcome of this appeal , that is , whether ... it \u2018 [ might ] afford any ground for allowing the appeal\u2019 . We have tested that by assuming for the purpose : ( CARDINAL ) that PERSON ... was charged in GPE , with others , on a charge of smuggling a large quantity of cocaine from LOC to GPE in DATE ; ( CARDINAL ) that his role in the importation of the drug to GPE is said to have been as a participating informer to the NORP police ; ( CARDINAL ) that since DATE he had been concerned in the smuggling of large quantities of cocaine from GPE to LOC ; ( CARDINAL ) that for DATE before the DATE importation of cocaine he had been an informer to various law enforcement agencies in LOC , though there is nothing to suggest that he had any contact with ORG and Excise before that importation ; ( CARDINAL ) that at the time of the DATE importation he had access to large quantities of cocaine in GPE at little or no cost ; ( CARDINAL ) that he had provided information to a NORP law enforcement agency which led to ORG and Excise observations of the NORP before the DATE importation ; and ( CARDINAL ) that , as alleged by PERSON at the trial , PERSON may have had a grudge against him arising out of some previous dealing between them . ... [ Prosecuting counsel ] suggested that the only way PERSON could have been sure of achieving such an end would have been to persuade the officers to \u2018 plant\u2019 the drug on , or falsely attribute it to , PERSON or ORG . Such a conspiracy between PERSON and the officers would have been hard for them to organise to an assured outcome . ... [ H]ow could they have organised it so that ORG had a suitcase almost identical to that of PERSON ? And what possible motive or reason could the officers have had to lend themselves to such a disgraceful enterprise whether PERSON was a known informer or not ? In the ORG \u2019s view , there is force and hard logic in those submissions . There are also a number of other questions indicating the impossibility of the Atlans\u2019 defence . Why , if they thought they were to collect diamonds from ORG , not drugs , did PERSON and ORG immediately check their luggage onto the return flight without apparently enquiring by telephone why he had not turned up or whether he had been delayed ? Why did PERSON and the CARDINAL of them make no contact in GPE and ignore each other on the plane to FAC ? Why did PERSON and ORG separate as ORG boarded a taxi at FAC with the case containing the cocaine ? Why did the NORP tell so many lies on arrest and in interview about their activities together before the flight to GPE and about the reason for it ? Why did PERSON lyingly state that he had travelled on his own on the return flight to GPE and that he did not know ORG ? Why did they later give wholly different accounts in evidence at their trial ? Why did PERSON make indirect telephone contact with someone on PERSON \u2019s telephone number in GPE on DATE of the importation ? In the ORG \u2019s view , none of its assumptions , some of which go well beyond the new information relied upon by the NORP , detracts in any way from the overwhelming strength of the prosecution case identified in those various questions or provides any material support for the possibility of a conspiracy between the ORG and Excise officers and PERSON or anyone else to \u2018 frame\u2019 the Atlans . The jury , by its verdict , clearly rejected PERSON and ORG \u2019s suggestion of it . Although PERSON did not then suggest such a conspiracy , it was his only possible line of defence , though , for the reasons we have given , a wholly unrealistic one . [ Prosecuting counsel \u2019s ] submission , which echoes considerations voiced by the judge to the jury in the summing up , provides a logical and complete answer to the complaint based on PERSON \u2019s alleged role as an informer and drug smuggler . If the jury had had before it information matching our assumptions , it might have led them to conclude that PERSON may have provided some information , direct or indirect , to ORG and Excise , but it could not have left them with any doubt as to the Atlans\u2019 knowing and deliberate involvement in the importation of cocaine into GPE . The evidence against them , which had been thoroughly and robustly tested at the trial , was overwhelming : the ORG and Excise officers\u2019 observation of their various and highly expensive international air flights , for which there was no plausible explanation or documentation suggesting any legitimate business ; the ORG observation of their movements and meetings in GPE and of the CARDINAL strange return trips to and from GPE ; their various handling of what was to become ORG \u2019s suitcase used for the switch ; their lies on arrest and in interview . All that activity pointed only to their involvement in the high value and high risk activity of drug smuggling , not some black market dealing in gems under NORP law . Whatever PERSON \u2019s possible role as an informer , the Atlans\u2019 guilty participation in cocaine smuggling is clear . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial . The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Attorney - General issued Guidelines , which did not have the force of law , concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ( [ DATE ] vol . CARDINAL ORG p. CARDINAL : \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) . The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution \u2019s power to withhold \u201c unused material \u201d . Under paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c unused material \u201d was defined as :", "\u201c ( i ) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence ; ( ii ) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and ( if not in the bundle ) any documents referred to therein ; ( iii ) the unedited version(s ) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles . \u201d", "Under paragraph CARDINAL , any item falling within this definition was to be made available to the defence if \u201c it", "According to the LAW , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive \u201d material which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as follows :", "\u201c ... ( a ) it deals with matters of national security ; or it is by , or discloses the identity of , a member of ORG who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known ; ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ( c ) it is by , or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known ; ( d ) it contains details which , if they became known , might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect ; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime ; ( e ) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed , at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier \u2013 e.g. a bank official ; ( f ) it relates to other offences by , or serious allegations against , someone who is not an accused , or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him ; ( g ) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife . \u201d", "According to paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed , a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence \u201d . The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was CARDINAL for the prosecution , although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure . If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen , but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material , the prosecution would have to be abandoned .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the applicants\u2019 trial in DATE , but before the appeal proceedings in DATE , the Guidelines were superseded by the common law . In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] vol . CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity . It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case , because :", "\u201c ... [ When ] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings . Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence . If , in a wholly exceptional case , the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court , the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] vol . CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity , and outlined CARDINAL different procedures to be adopted . The first procedure , which had generally to be followed , was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held . The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court . Secondly , however , where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed , the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made , but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte . The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question . In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence .", "ORG observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence , in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute , and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest . It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing , the defence had \u201c as much protection as can be given without pre - empting the issue \u201d . Finally , it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed . Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure \u201c in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant \u201d . For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
