GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP origins who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s husband entered NORP territory , where he unsuccessfully lodged an asylum request . Following her husband \u2019s departure , the applicant had been visited several times by NORP security officers who interrogated her about her husband \u2019s whereabouts . In DATE , NORP soldiers took her to a military station and raped her . This became known to the applicant \u2019s family and to the whole village . Following this incident , the applicant suffered a post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD , posttraumatische PERSON ) and considered suicide .", "On DATE the applicant , together with her CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE , travelled by plane from GPE to GPE in GPE . She had been assisted by her father and other relatives , who had helped her to obtain false passports .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an asylum request with ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr die ORG ) . She alleged that she had been persecuted because of her husband \u2019s activities in support of the NORP separatist movement . She further submitted that men from her village had urged her father to kill her in order to restore the honour of her family .", "Later on the applicant submitted a medical report from her attending physician PERSON dated DATE , who drew the following conclusions :", "\u201c According to our ... examinations , PERSON suffers from symptoms of anguish and a depressive disorder with dissociative symptoms and somatic disorders based on a severe post - traumatic stress disorder following suppression , abuse , threats and rape in GPE .", "In order to carry out psychotherapy , it is necessary to provide a stable environment , because the treatment of traumas necessitates security and stability . PERSON is in need of both psychological and psychotherapeutic treatment . An antidepressant medication ( Doxepin QUANTITY mg ) has been started . The psychotherapy will last approximately DATE . A continuing treatment with supportive conversations is necessary in order to stabilise her mental condition and to avoid an aggravation .", "In case of lack or interruption of treatment there is the risk of an aggravation of the illness , a decompensation of the condition , or suicide .", "An escalation of her situation with respect to her right to stay would very probably lead to an aggraviation of PERSON clinical symptoms and thus to a mental decompensation and suicidal tendencies ( PERSON aufenthaltsrechtlichen FAC aktuellen Situation ist eine weitere Versch\u00e4rfung der klinischen PERSON und damit eine psychische GPE suizidalen PERSON als extrem wahrscheinlich einzusch\u00e4tzen ) .", "In case of an expulsion to GPE , it has to be assumed that she could carry out her suicide thoughts and the expulsion to GPE has to be regarded as a re - traumatisation . \u201d", "In DATE the applicant was temporarily hospitalised in a psychiatric clinic .", "On DATE the applicant submitted further medical attestations according to which her situation had aggravated .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request , ordered the applicant to leave the NORP territory within DATE and announced expulsion in case of non - compliance . They found that the applicant had failed to establish that her rape had been politically motivated . According to ORG , there was no concrete risk that the applicant would , once again , be abused on her return to GPE . With respect to the alleged risk to be killed by family members in order to restore the family \u2019s honour , the ORG noted that ORG prosecuted so - called \u201c crimes of honour \u201d and that there existed the possibility to obtain protection in women \u2019s refuges . Furthermore , the ORG did not attach much credence to the applicant \u2019s submissions relating to the risk of persecution by her family .", "Referring to a report by ORG dated DATE and to a further report dated DATE , ORG further found that the necessary medical treatment for the applicant \u2019s illness was available in all major psychiatric clinics , such as the university clinics in GPE and GPE and the public hospital in GPE . According to ORG , these clinics applied internationally approved diagnostic standards and offered the same therapeutic concepts which were common in LOC . In case of need , it was possible to obtain free medical treatment with the so called \u201c green card \u201d . This did also apply in case of a possible retraumatisation .", "ORG further found that it was not competent to examine if the applicant \u2019s deportation as such could lead to suicide attempts , as this primarily concerned the question of the feasibility of deportation .", "The applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a motion with ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) . She argued , inter alia , that the necessary medical treatment was not available in practice . In support of her allegations , she submitted a report by ORG in GPE on the medical care provided for persons with mental illnesses dated DATE . This report noted , inter alia , that care for mentally ill patients was provided for in the major cities and provincial centres of GPE . On the other hand , there was a lack of possibilities of long - term treatments for adult patients .", "The last paragraph of the report reads as follows :", "\u201c ORG there are CARDINAL hospitals in CARDINAL towns which are entitled to issue medical attestation for handicapped and/or mentally ill persons ... It follows that there is not in every province the possibility to obtain specialist medical treatment .", "CARDINAL of the most serious problems is the almost complete hopelessness ( \u201c fast v\u00f6llige Ausweglosigkeit \u201d ) of certain groups of patients \u2013 in particular adults \u2013 to obtain adequate treatment : this concerns traumatised persons , raped women , persons suffering from anguish traumas , highly suicidal persons , to name but a few . The local ORG confirmed that while the purely medical care of handicapped or mentally ill people could be provided , it was generally ( in der PERSON ) impossible to offer continuing therapy for lack of professional and financial resources . It is not possible to continue therapies for patients returning from GPE or the GPE , as follows already from the different therapeutic concepts of these countries . \u201d", "The applicant further alleged that her return to GPE would , with a high probability , lead to her re - traumatisation , which would eventually endanger her life . She submitted a further medical report by PERSON dated DATE , which reads as follows :", "\u201c I am treating PERSON since DATE . PERSON is a severely traumatised person , who suffers from typical disturbances caused by a posttraumatic stress disorder ( ORG CARDINAL ORG ) with extreme nervousness and attacks of fear and panic .", "PERSON is regularly treated with supportive conversations which take place at ORG intervals . Additionally , she is treated with antidepressant medication , currently with QUANTITY GPE per day . The patient \u2019s state of health has further deteriorated . She increasingly complains about insomnia and gives credible accounts of suicidal thoughts . She reports about the escalation of her situation with respect to her right to stay . This scares her additionally . She suffers from serious losses of self - esteem .", "On the basis of DATE \u2019s conversation , a further aggravation of her clinical symptoms and thus a mental decompensation with suicidal behaviour has to be regarded as being extremely likely . \u201d", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion . That court found that the applicant had neither a right to asylum as guaranteed by LAW , nor was she protected from expulsion as a political refugee pursuant to LAW , see relevant domestic law below ) . ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s submissions that she had been raped and subsequently suffered from a post - traumatic disorder . It further assumed that the applicant \u2019s persecution had been politically motivated . While the applicant had failed to establish that she herself or her husband had been persecuted as suspects of supporting the NORP separatist movement , the ORG accepted that the applicant \u2019s rape may have been related to her NORP origins .", "However , the applicant did not risk further persecution , as she would be safe if she travelled to the Western part of GPE ( inl\u00e4ndische ORG ) . As neither the applicant nor her husband could be regarded as being suspected of separatist activities , there was no indication that the security forces would persecute her there . ORG further found that the applicant had not established that she risked falling victim to a \u201c crime of honour \u201d in the NORP part of GPE , taking into account that her father had helped her to escape to GPE .", "ORG further found that there was no impediment to the expulsion under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW for lack of a serious and concrete risk for her life or physical integrity . According to consistent reports ( nach st\u00e4ndiger ORG ) , there was a possibility to treat mental illnesses in GPE . Referring to a judgment of ORG and considering all material in its possession , ORG followed this assessment . It found , in particular , that the applicant was not restricted to seek medical treatment in her home region , but could also be expected to expand her search into her further environment and into LOC . The applicant had not established that her illness could not be treated in LOC .", "ORG finally considered that the possibility of a retraumatisation could in principle constitute an impediment to expulsion . According to ORG , however , it could not be deduced from the medical attestations submitted by the applicant that this applied to the applicant for the time being . It found that in the report dated DATE Dr PERSON indicated that the applicant \u2019s deportation as such might aggravate her medical condition . This might lead to an impediment to deportation relating to NORP territory ( inlandsbezogenes PERSON ) , but not to a danger in the receiving country ( zielstaatsbezogenes PERSON ) . In his more recent medical attestation dated DATE , PERSON more generally stated that a further aggravation of her clinical symptoms and thus a mental decompensation with suicidal behaviour had to be regarded as being extremely likely . This indicated that the aggravation of the applicant \u2019s illness was independent from her return to GPE . ORG finally found that the other medical attestations submitted by the applicant did not lead to other conclusions .", "The question if the applicant \u2019s deportation as such would cause a danger to her health had to be examined separately by the local ORG Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde ) . ORG further noted that the applicant could seek ORG and ORG assistance in finding the necessary health facilities .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request to be granted leave to appeal . She alleged , in particular , that ORG had failed to consider the report of ORG of DATE which , according to the applicant , raised serious doubts if her illness could be treated in GPE . She further complained that ORG had failed to consider her submissions with respect to the risk of retraumatisation .", "On DATE the GPE Court of Appeal ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) refused the applicant \u2019s request . It found , in particular , that ORG had duly examined the possibility to obtain medical treatment in GPE . It noted that ORG had found that the applicant was not restricted to her home area , but could be expected to search medical care in LOC . Under these circumstances , ORG did not have to refer explicitly to the NORP Consulate \u2019s report . ORG further found that ORG had duly considered the expert reports on the applicant \u2019s state of health .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint . She alleged that the administrative courts had violated her right to a fair hearing and her right to asylum as guaranteed by LAW . She complained , in particular , that ORG had failed to duly consider the fact that the applicant , according to the medical report dated DATE , risked re - traumatisation on her return to GPE . She further complained that ORG had failed to hear expert opinion on the risk of re - traumatisation .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "The applicant , her husband and children subsequently lodged a request with the North Rhine - Westphalia Commission for ORG ) . No decision has yet been given . These proceedings do not have a suspensive effect ; the ORG \u2019s recommendations are not binding on the domestic authorities .", "By order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Amtsgericht ) placed the applicant into a psychiatric hospital . ORG found a strong indication that the applicant suffered from a psychotic disorder which necessitated treatment and which could pose a danger to her life or integrity . According to a medical report of DATE , she had recently been suicidal . ORG further ordered the preparation of an expert opinion on the applicant \u2019s state of health .", "Article CARDINAL ) of the NORP Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) provides that persons persecuted on political grounds enjoy the right of asylum .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 as in force at the relevant time \u2013 prohibits the deportation of aliens to a state where they would face political persecution .", "Section CARDINAL prohibits deportation into a state where the alien faces a serious risk of being subjected to torture . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW further prohibits any expulsion which would be contrary to the provisions of the LAW .", "If the preconditions for the application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) are not met , protection may be granted under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which grants a discretion to the authorities to suspend deportation in case of a substantial danger for life , personal integrity or liberty of an alien .", "According to the case - law of ORG ) ORG , during asylum proceedings , only examines if the alien would be in danger in the receiving country ( zielstaatsbezogene Abschiebungshindernisse ) . Other impediments to deportation , which could arise on NORP territory ( inlandsbezogene NORP ) have to be examined in separate proceedings by the local ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
