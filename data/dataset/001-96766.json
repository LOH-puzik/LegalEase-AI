PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a retired professional soldier . In DATE ORG ( Wojskowa Agencja Mieszkaniowa ) decided to allocate him military accommodation ( kwatera ) in GPE . The lease was signed by the applicant , but his wife and CARDINAL children had the right to live in the flat .", "In DATE the applicant moved out from the flat and started divorce proceedings .

Afterwards , the applicant officially changed his registered address ( wymeldowanie ) and moved to GPE .", "In DATE the applicant remarried .", "On DATE the applicant gave notice to the ORG informing it that he wished to terminate the lease .", "His former wife and son continued to live in the disputed flat . They refused to leave it and the applicant \u2019s former wife stopped paying the rent . It appears that subsequently the ORG instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant . Given the debt accumulated by the applicant \u2019s former wife , after she had stopped paying the rent , the ORG attempted to allocate a smaller flat to the applicant so he would vacate the accommodation . However , the applicant \u2019s former wife refused to leave the flat and the decision ordering the occupants to leave the flat was stayed on DATE .", "On several occasions the applicant complained to ORG and he received replies on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE .

The ORG then stated :", "\u201c If the military accommodation occupied by the divorced spouses belongs to CARDINAL of the [ categories listed in section CARDINAL ) ] , it is possible to terminate their lease ( rozkwaterowac ) under section CARDINAL ) of LAW . However , in cases outside [ the above categories ] the divorced spouses can not , under the rules , seek to terminate the lease ....", "In the above - cited law there is no provision for the removal of a troublesome divorced spouse . In particular , in the cases examined above , there are no provisions that would authorise the ORG to issue an administrative decision terminating a lease . There is also no legal ground for requesting the eviction of a former spouse from the flat they occupied together ....", "In the ORG \u2019s opinion such a situation , in which the legislator has excluded a certain group of citizens from the judicial system by not granting them active procedural rights ( czynna legitymacja procesowa ) , infringes the constitutional right of access to a court ( LAW ) and the right to a fair trial guaranteed by LAW ] ( LAW ) .. \u201d", "The ORG further informed the applicant that , according to ORG resolution of DATE , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Law of DATE on ORG ( LOC o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych ) , ( \u201c DATE Act \u201d ) applied to the eviction of a divorced spouse from military accommodation . The ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c The particular regulation of the situation of the spouse of a professional soldier , similarly to that of a lease in civil law , is such that his or her entitlement does not terminate with the divorce . It means that the loss of this entitlement [ to use the military accommodation granted to the professional soldier ] can occur only under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of [ DATE Act ] . Under this provision , a tenant may institute proceedings for eviction of a divorced spouse if his or her excessively reprehensible behaviour ( ra\u017c\u0105co naganne zachowanie ) makes cohabitation impossible ... It is for a court examining a particular claim for eviction to interpret this provision ... \u201d", "Apparently in DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his former wife in which he sought reimbursement of the rent she had failed to pay since DATE but which had been deducted from his old - age pension . It is not clear what transpired in those proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG allocated to the applicant a smaller flat and requested him to vacate the military accommodation which his former wife had been occupying .

In such cases , the head of the local branch of the Agency shall assign the military accommodation or enter into a lease with a designated person . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL ) of ORG listed CARDINAL categories of military accommodation in which it was possible to terminate the lease under LAW ( CARDINAL ) . Those are :", "CARDINAL . NORP accommodation in buildings on closed military land ,", "CARDINAL . NORP accommodation which is allocated , by a decision of the director of the district office of ORG , to the whole or a part of the staff of a certain military unit ,", "CARDINAL . NORP function - related accommodation .", "On DATE ORG gave a resolution III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL in which it considered that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act should apply to a civil action for eviction against a former spouse of a professional soldier . LAW was repealed by LAW of DATE on ORG tenants , housing resources of municipalities and amendments to LAW ( LOC o ochronie praw lokator\u00f3w , mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie LOC cywilnego ) ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . However , it contains an analogous regulation in LAW ( CARDINAL ) which allows eviction of a divorced spouse if his or her excessively reprehensible behaviour makes cohabitation impossible .", "On DATE ORG was substantially amended and LAW was repealed ( the \u201c new LAW \u201d ) . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the new LAW open the possibility of the forcible eviction of a person who has not been a soldier but who has remained in military accommodation . They also provide for the possibility of seeking a court ruling in cases where the person subject to eviction belongs to CARDINAL of the protected categories ( for example a pregnant woman or a disabled person ) .", "The new LAW also explicitly excludes the application of the CARDINAL Act to matters related to military accommodation .", "On DATE ORG gave a resolution IIICZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL in which it found that a civil action by a professional soldier against his former wife was possible if the soldier had been granted the military accommodation prior to the date on which CARDINAL of ORG lost its force and if the civil action had been brought after that date . The court however refused to specify which provision of the domestic law should be the legal basis for such an action , finding that the question put to it had been worded too vaguely ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
