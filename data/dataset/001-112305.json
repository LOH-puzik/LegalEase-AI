The applicant is a veteran of the NORP Resistance during the Second World War and a former professional officer of ORG . His veteran status on the grounds of his involvement in the underground NORP movement during that war was recognised by an administrative decision given on an unspecified date by the Director of ORG .", "CARDINAL . For DATE the applicant collected antique arms and weapons from the period of the Second World War and earlier .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the police searched the applicant \u2019s home and DATE cottage . They confiscated the applicant \u2019s collection which at that time numbered CARDINAL pieces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG ( \u201c the Museum \u201d ) in GPE issued a statement for the purposes of an investigation against the applicant which had been instituted immediately after the search and seizure . He stated that the applicant had been cooperating with the ORG as a specialist in old weaponry and that on a number of occasions he had lent certain pieces of his collection for the purposes of their being exhibited at the ORG . He stated that the applicant \u2019s expertise was highly valued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the prosecuting authorities ordered that an expert opinion be prepared as to whether the confiscated pieces were to be regarded as arms within the meaning of the legislation governing the licensing of possession of arms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG sent a letter to ORG . He stated that the applicant \u2019s integrity and the fact that he was a law - abiding citizen were wellknown . He had been decorated on a number of occasions for his involvement in the NORP Resistance during the Second World War . By accumulating a unique collection of historical weapons , uniforms and military equipment he had rendered outstanding services in the dissemination of knowledge about the history of GPE . He had financed this collection himself , at considerable personal sacrifice . The fact that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him had met with general disbelief . It had been universally considered among persons interested in military history that his collection could not possibly be regarded as posing any threat to public order . On the contrary , it had played a significant role in teaching younger generations about the history of GPE and about the fight for the country \u2019s independence . The applicant \u2019s services not only merited recognition but should also be taken into consideration by the court in the assessment of his guilt and any sentence to be imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution ordered that CARDINAL pieces of the collection should be returned to the applicant , relying on an expert opinion prepared for the purposes of the investigation . The expert concluded that these items were only parts of weapons and therefore a licence to possess them was not necessary . On DATE a bill of indictment against the applicant on charges of illegal possession of arms was filed with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant concerning charges of illegal possession of arms , contrary to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court first listed CARDINAL pieces of the applicant \u2019s collection , the oldest of them produced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant had explained that he had been collecting old arms , mostly memorabilia of the Second World War as well as other older pieces , for DATE . He had previously on numerous occasions made parts of his collection available on loan to various museums . He had been collaborating as an expert in old weaponry with ORG . The court noted that the applicant had explained that in order to prevent unauthorised third parties from having access to the collection he had kept it in his apartment which was secured with CARDINAL locks and equipped with an alarm . He had also taken the necessary technical measures to make it impossible to use most of the weapons in his possession as arms . He declared his willingness to take such measures also in respect of the remaining pieces .", "CARDINAL . The court acknowledged that no criminal intent to use the arms to anyone \u2019s detriment could reasonably be ascribed to the applicant . However , he must have known that the possession of arms without a permit was unlawful . He had not availed himself of the possibility of legalising his collection by having recourse to the DATE LAW , devised specifically with a view to making it possible for Second World War veterans and other persons having fought for the independence of GPE to regularise arms acquired in the past and in connection with their involvement in the Polish Resistance .", "CARDINAL . The court acknowledged that there had been no evidence whatsoever that the applicant had ever used the arms with any criminal intent . It emphasised that the applicant was , at that time , DATE , a war veteran who had fought in ORG and who was a retired professional officer of ORG with no criminal record . He was a lawabiding citizen .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s submissions as to the part of the collection which had been put out of action had been partly confirmed by the experts . The experts had found that it was impossible to use most of the pieces as weapons , but that some of them could be made to work again ( \u201c ze znacznej wi\u0119kszo\u015bci egzemplarzy broni nie by\u0142o mo\u017cliwe oddanie strzalu , niemniej jednak z cz\u0119\u015bci egzemplarzy broni mo\u017cliwym by\u0142o oddanie strza\u0142u , jak r\u00f3wnie\u017c mo\u017cliwym by\u0142o przywr\u00f3cenie cech u\u017cytkowych broni \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the offence was minor in nature and discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant , referring to LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . At the same time , the court decided to apply LAW in conjunction with its LAW and to confiscate CARDINAL pieces of the collection .", "CARDINAL . The court , explaining why it decided to avail itself of its discretionary power to confiscate the entire collection , stated that dividing up the collection by returning to the applicant those pieces which had already been put out of action would seriously diminish its value . It noted that the collection should , because of its historical interest , be handed over to an institution capable of securing appropriate storage and display conditions for it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and the prosecution appealed . The applicant essentially challenged the confiscation measure .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision . It fully endorsed the reasoning of the lower court . It further noted that the confiscation of the collection should not lead to its destruction . The ORG authorities should be well aware of the historical value of the collection ( \u201c organy pa\u0144stwa DATE zdawa\u0107 sobie spraw\u0119 z ... warto\u015bci historycznej zabezpieczonych przedmiot\u00f3w \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Director of the ORG replied , indicating that the ORG wished to take certain pieces selected by ORG , the ORG \u2019s expert . On DATE the court authorised the transfer of these pieces to the ORG and on DATE they were transferred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court requested ORG in GPE , the Regional Curator for Monuments ( PERSON Ochrony Zabytk\u00f3w w PERSON , PERSON ) , to indicate the name of a cultural institution which would accept the remainder of the collection . A number of cultural institutions expressed their interest , including ORG . ORG also expressed interest in the remainder of the collection covered by the forfeiture decision . The Regional Curator for Monuments gave a positive opinion in this regard . This part of the collection is currently being transferred to the ORG .", "\u201c CARDINAL .
