The first and second applicants are husband and wife . The third , fourth and fifth applicants are their children . The sixth to thirteenth applicants are the CARDINAL brothers and CARDINAL sisters of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP named PERSON was arrested by the police of GPE in possession of QUANTITY of heroin . His arrest brought protests from the authorities of the \u201c GPE \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , who alleged that he had been unlawfully arrested in the buffer zone controlled by ORG in GPE ( \u201c the UNFICYP \u201d ) , where neither the NORP nor the NORP side was allowed to exercise authority . There were reports that PERSON vehicle had allegedly been found abandoned by the NORP authorities inside ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) buffer zone , with its engine running and headlights on . GPE authorities maintained that the arrest had been effected within their jurisdiction just outside the buffer zone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was charged with drug possession and smuggling , and was remanded in custody by ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to a report of the ORG Secretary General dated DATE on the ORG operation in GPE , ORG \u2019s own investigation into the incident had not yielded sufficient evidence to confirm or refute either version of the events regarding the arrest of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE PERSON was sentenced to DATE imprisonment by ORG on various drugrelated charges , but was subsequently pardoned by President PERSON and released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a building contractor . At the time of the events giving rise to this application , he owned a construction company , ORG , which employed workers from both sides of the island .", "CARDINAL . Like many other NORP Cypriot contractors employing NORP workers , the first applicant picked up his NORP workers each morning from a caf\u00e9 ( \u201c PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 \u201d ) located in LOC ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) of Dhekelia in the vicinity of the Pergamos checkpoint , where people crossed from the \u201c TRNC \u201d to the ORG . The first applicant would collect his NORP workers from the caf\u00e9 TIME at CARDINAL a.m. and would drive them to work . At DATE , he would drop them off at the same location .", "CARDINAL . The events that took place on TIME DATE , which resulted in the first applicant \u2019s detention by the \u201c NORP \u201d authorities , are disputed between the parties . They will therefore be presented separately .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the first applicant left his house in the village of LOC in GPE to collect his NORP workers from PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 in his red ORG double - cabin pickup , as he did every workday . Since it had rained heavily TIME , parts of the road were flooded , which forced him to drive slowly . The heavy rain had stopped by TIME , but it was still drizzling when he left the house .", "CARDINAL . On the main road from LOC to GPE leading to PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 , the first applicant noticed QUANTITY ahead of him a white ORG pickup with the registration number UJ CARDINAL , which he recognised as belonging to a fellow NORP contractor ( GPE ) . As he was driving slowly behind that vehicle in the left - hand lane , the first applicant noticed further down the road another car , a red ORG , which had pulled up on the left side of the road just before the PERSON camp junction , QUANTITY before PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 . The bonnet of the red car was open and CARDINAL men in civilian clothes were checking the engine .", "CARDINAL . The white pickup driving in front of the first applicant slowed down as it approached the red ORG and the driver rolled down his window to talk to the CARDINAL men . While CARDINAL of the men continued to check the car \u2019s engine , the other one waved the driver of the white pickup to move along .", "CARDINAL . As the first applicant approached the stationary red ORG , another car , a white ORG which he had not previously noticed , emerged from the junction on the left - hand side and started heading towards him at full speed . The first applicant swerved his car to the right to prevent a collision and then applied the brakes . The white ORG also stopped right in front of his car and CARDINAL men in civilian clothes leapt out . The first applicant then noticed that the white ORG pickup travelling ahead of him had also stopped , probably to check what was happening behind . In a matter of TIME , one of the men who had leapt out of the white ORG opened his driver \u2019s door , shouted some words in NORP and put a gun to his forehead , while another tried to pull him out of the car . When the first applicant resisted , holding tight to his unfastened seat belt , the man holding the gun hit him on the head above the left ear with the handle of his gun , which caused him to fall down on the road into a puddle of rainwater measuring QUANTITY , in a semi - conscious state as a result of the force of the blow . The men kicked and punched him on the ground , and twisted and bit his hands to force him to let go of the seat belt , while the first applicant called for help . After receiving some forceful kicks below the pelvis and to the ribs , which were so strong that he thought his ribs were broken , he let go of the belt and rolled on the ground . The CARDINAL men then picked him up by the arms and legs and dragged him to the white ORG , which was a left - hand drive car . The first applicant estimated that the whole ordeal , which had started at TIME , had lasted TIME , and it had been witnessed by the driver of the white ORG pickup travelling ahead of him .", "CARDINAL . Once inside the car , with both his arms twisted behind his back , the first applicant received another strong kick from the man who was holding him by the right arm . The man holding the pistol sat in the front passenger seat and continued to point the pistol at him . They then started driving towards the Pergamos checkpoint . When the first applicant noticed that the right passenger door of the car was not fully closed , he started pushing the man to his right with his shoulder so that they would fall out of the car . As they were passing PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 , the first applicant saw a group of people standing outside and called out for help from the slightly open door , but he could not manage to attract their attention .", "CARDINAL . When the car reached the Pergamos checkpoint , the first applicant noticed that the barrier , which was normally down , had been lifted so that they were able to drive straight through to the \u201c TRNC \u201d without slowing down . After driving in the occupied area for a while , the man sitting to the first applicant \u2019s left placed a rope around his neck and tied his hands behind his back with the ends of the same rope , which prevented him from moving . When the applicant asked whether they were going to kill him , the same man answered yes and then the man sitting in the front passenger seat punched him in the face , which damaged his teeth and caused his mouth to bleed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant could not understand the conversation in the car , which was in NORP , except for the word \u201c police \u201d , which was uttered frequently . Since he had lived in the occupied area until he was DATE , he recognised that he was being driven towards GPE . Once they reached the NORP industrial area , the car stopped , and the man sitting in the front passenger seat took off his sock and taped it around the first applicant \u2019s eyes , and then taped his mouth . TIME , the first applicant heard another car drive up to them . He was quickly transferred to the other car , with his hands still tied behind his back with the rope that ran around his neck . After driving for TIME the second car stopped and he was taken out of the car . He was subsequently taken into a building and put in a room on his own , where he waited for quite some time with his eyes and mouth taped , and his hands tied behind his back .", "CARDINAL . After a while , someone untied the rope around the first applicant \u2019s hands and neck , but left his hands cuffed behind his back , and removed the tape from his mouth . He was then asked personal questions regarding himself and his family , including whether he had any relatives working in the police force or the army . No one explained to him where he was or why he was being held . The person who spoke to him alternated between broken NORP and LANGUAGE . His captors then made him sit in front of an electric heater so that he might dry , as his clothes were all wet from falling into the puddle of water outside his car during the struggle prior to his abduction .", "CARDINAL . When his captors eventually removed the sock from his eyes , the first applicant noticed that he was in an office , and the time was TIME CARDINAL men in civilian clothes , whom he had not seen before but later discovered to be GPE PERSON and police sergeants PERSON and PERSON , were standing in front of him . When he asked them in NORP why he had been seized , CARDINAL of them replied in broken NORP that he had been arrested for drug possession . They then gave him a fresh set of clothes and shoes and asked him to change out of his wet clothes . The first applicant suspected that he was in a police station , but his captors continued to conceal his whereabouts and the identity of the QUANTITY persons interrogating him .", "CARDINAL . After changing into new clothes , the first applicant was led out of the building by the CARDINAL men . In the reception area of the building , he saw police officers in uniform , which reinforced his assumption that he had been taken to a police station . He was subsequently taken to a hospital in GPE by CARDINAL of his interrogators .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was first examined by a doctor at the hospital in the presence of the CARDINAL men who had taken him there . As the doctor did not speak LANGUAGE or NORP , they relied on the ORG interpretation to communicate . The first applicant explained to the doctor that he was diabetic and asked the doctor to check his blood sugar levels . Tests showed that his blood sugar level had increased considerably , so the doctor prescribed him an antidiabetic drug . The first applicant also tried to tell the doctor that he was suffering from pain in his pelvis and ribs , and in particular that the pain in the ribs was making it difficult to breathe , but the doctor paid no attention to his grievances and merely registered the swelling in his head and some redness on his chest and back , without examining the injuries in his mouth or lower body .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was subsequently referred to a radiologist , who PERSON his chest and head . He was also examined by a specialist in pulmonary diseases . He was then taken for a drug test . When the first applicant refused to take the drug test and requested to see ORG doctors instead , CARDINAL of the men escorting him punched him in the stomach . It is not clear whether a drug test was subsequently performed on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following the examinations at the hospital , which lasted TIME , the first applicant was taken to another building , where he was again placed in an office . In that office , the men handling him showed him a black plastic bag with NORP writing on it , and told him that the bag contained the drugs recovered from him . However , after some discussion among themselves , one of them went out of the room and came back with another black plastic bag , which bore no writing , and placed the drugs allegedly recovered from him in the new bag . They then placed the bag in a plastic container and sealed it before his eyes .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , the first applicant was taken to yet another small office in a nearby building . There were CARDINAL men in the office , including the CARDINAL who had been escorting him and CARDINAL interpreters . The men were speaking to each other in NORP , without translating for him , and drinking tea ; the first applicant did not understand where he had been taken . CARDINAL of the interpreters then told him in broken NORP that he was before a judge , who had charged him with possession of drugs , and that he would be placed in custody for DATE . For the brief period he was in that room , the first applicant was not given the opportunity to respond , apart from stating that he had no involvement with drugs , or to ask questions ; he was not informed of his rights , nor was he asked whether he wanted the assistance of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was subsequently taken to the FAC police station ( referred to as the \u201c LOC police station \u201d ) in GPE and placed in a very small cell , measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY , where he stayed for DATE . The cell was very cold , damp and mouldy in parts , because there was no glass in the small window . Despite the cold , he was given only one filthy blanket to keep warm . There were , moreover , no shower facilities in the police station . As for the toilets , they were very dirty ; no soap or toilet paper was provided and the toilet did not flush . The first applicant had to call an officer each time he needed to use the toilet , and on many occasions he was not let out of his cell to go to the toilet , despite his need to urinate frequently on account of his diabetes . He solved the problem by urinating in a plastic bottle inside his cell . The first applicant further stated that he had not been given any food at the LOC police station and that he had had to purchase food from the canteen with his own money .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant claimed that DATE , a NORP detainee at the LOC police station approached him and told him in NORP that the police had asked him to confess to being the person who would pick up the drugs that the first applicant had intended to hide in the \u201c TRNC \u201d , but that he had refused to collaborate with the police .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the first applicant was visited by a ORG inspector and a doctor . The inspector issued an incident report following the visit , the relevant parts of which read as follows :", "\u201c During the visit the prisoner , who is a diabetic , stated that he had no complaints in relation to how he had been treated by the ORG [ NORP Cypriot Police Element ] but that he had been assaulted i.e. punched and kicked by QUANTITY civilians and had been threatened with a gun by them a short time before his arrest by the ORG . He stated that his arrest had occurred in the GPE [ sic . ] area .", "Since his arrest he had been taken to ORG by the ORG where he was administered some drugs for his diabetes . He requested the ORG to secure his own clothes for him , to deliver his Diabetes Monitoring Kit to him and also to arrange a visit for his wife . He further stated that he did not do anything and that he was kidnapped at GPE . He was in a distressed state .", "He consented to a medical examination by the ORG doctor who found a number of tender areas with no bruising . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was visited at the LOC police station by a NORP lawyer , PERSON , who was appointed by his family to represent him . The meeting was monitored by a number of police officers . On DATE another NORP lawyer , PERSON PERSON , visited him and they met , once again , in the presence of police officers . The first applicant claimed that all his subsequent meetings with his lawyers at the LOC police station had been held in the presence of police officers or other prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . The Government \u2019s version of the events is based on the incident reports prepared by ORG - inspector PERSON , who allegedly led the operation for the first applicant \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG - inspector PERSON \u2019s report , on DATE he received a tip - off call from a police informant , informing him that a NORP named \u201c NORP \u201d would enter the \u201c GPE \u201d through the ORG of Dhekelia TIME with narcotics , which he would hide in a predesignated spot just outside the NORP cemetery to the west of the Pergamos checkpoint , to be picked up by a contact from the \u201c LOC \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE ORG - inspector PERSON , accompanied by police sergeants PERSON and PERSON , took their positions in the vicinity of the drop - off point to wait in ambush . At TIME , before daybreak , they saw someone approaching on foot from the direction of the ORG , QUANTITY to the west of the Pergamos checkpoint . It was believed that this person , who was later identified as the first applicant , had crossed the ditch which ran along the boundary between the \u201c NORP \u201d and the ORG and which was filled with rainwater at the relevant time , and then jumped over the wire fence between boundary stones CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , where parts of the fence had shrunk . As the first applicant was walking towards an olive tree in the designated area , ORG - inspector PERSON came out of his hiding place and ordered him to stop , in NORP . Upon hearing that order , the first applicant started to run back towards the ORG ; however , the CARDINAL police sergeants caught up with him and seized him after a struggle , during which the applicant fell to the ground . The sub - inspector then grabbed the package that the first applicant was holding in his hands , which was wrapped in a black plastic bag . In the meantime , PERSON informed the first applicant in NORP that they were police officers and told him that he had entered \u201c TRNC \u201d territory without permission . He also asked the first applicant to identify himself and to explain what he was carrying in the plastic bag . The first applicant gave his name and stated that he was innocent . The police officers then handcuffed him and placed him in the police car . Once inside the car , the police officers opened the plastic bag and found CARDINAL plates of cannabis resin wrapped in a white cloth and a NORP newspaper . ORG informed the applicant once again , in NORP , that he had entered \u201c GPE \u201d territory without permission and that he had in his possession prohibited drugs .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the first applicant was taken to the LOC ( PERSON ) police headquarters for an identity check , where he was also questioned about where he had obtained the drugs and to whom he was taking them in the \u201c GPE \u201d . The first applicant remained silent in response to those questions .", "CARDINAL . At TIME PERSON - inspector PERSON and ORG went to the narcotics bureau of ORG ) police headquarters to inform their superiors of the first applicant \u2019s arrest , while the first applicant stayed at the NORP police headquarters under the supervision of Sergeant R.\u00d6 .. After going to the narcotics bureau , ORG - inspector PERSON and ORG went back to the scene of the incident , where GPE PERSON sketched a map of the area and another sergeant took photographs . Sub - inspector PERSON also took a soil sample from the area for forensic analysis .", "CARDINAL . At TIME PERSON - inspector PERSON and ORG went back to the NORP police headquarters , and took the first applicant \u2019s clothes and shoes as evidence .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the first applicant was taken to the Dr ORG ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) for a general medical examination . After the examination , he was taken to the narcotics bureau of the GPE police headquarters , where the material which was obtained from him earlier and which was believed to be cannabis resin was sealed in his presence , to be dispatched to the laboratory for further examination . The first applicant \u2019s shoes , together with the soil sample collected from the area where he was believed to have crossed into the \u201c NORP \u201d , were also sealed before his eyes for forensic analysis .", "CARDINAL . Later TIME , the first applicant was brought before the \u201c GPE \u201d ORG , where the presiding judge ordered his remand in custody for DATE to facilitate the police investigation . The hearing was held in the judge \u2019s office and the applicant was assisted by CARDINAL interpreters .", "CARDINAL . According to the detailed incident report prepared by ORG - inspector PERSON , on TIME CARDINAL DATE various measures were taken in the area where the first applicant had been arrested to catch the person who was supposed to pick up the drugs , but no one showed up .", "CARDINAL . The analysis report of DATE drawn up by ORG of the \u201c TRNC \u201d confirmed that the substance allegedly seized from the first applicant was cannabis resin , in the amount of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . According to the report of ORG of the \u201c NORP \u201d dated DATE , various different kinds of soil were found under the first applicant \u2019s shoes , while the muddy specimen found on the heel appeared to be the most recent . The amount of soil extracted from the heel was not found to be sufficient for a comprehensive analysis . Nevertheless , the limited examinations conducted revealed that the sample obtained from the shoes resembled the sample obtained from the scene of the incident , without , however , being identical . The report indicated that variations in soil properties could be due to the depth from which the soil sample had been obtained , or whether it had been obtained from a fertilised part of the land or not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG - inspector PERSON informed the first applicant of the charges against him , which were the possession of QUANTITY of cannabis resin and its unlawful import into the \u201c GPE \u201d . The first applicant , who was provided with an interpreter , used his right to remain silent , merely stating that his lawyer would defend him . However , he refused to sign a written statement to that effect .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the first applicant was brought before the \u201c GPE \u201d ORG for a bail hearing , where he was represented by CARDINAL lawyers , Mr PERSON , a local lawyer practising in \u201c GPE \u201d , and Mr P. PERSON , who practised at FAC . He was also assisted by an interpreter . At the hearing , the prosecution requested the court to order the first applicant \u2019s detention until the trial in view of the risk of his absconding , and called GPE PERSON as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s counsel pleaded in favour of his release , and also argued that he had not been arrested in \u201c NORP \u201d territory as alleged , but had been abducted from ORG territory by unknown persons and then taken to the \u201c TRNC \u201d after being badly beaten . The assault had left injuries on his body , as documented in various medical reports . The first applicant did not make any additional comments on his alleged ill - treatment , but merely stated that he would appear for trial if he were released on bail .", "CARDINAL . Sub - inspector GPE denied the allegation that the first applicant had been assaulted and stated that the injuries observed on his body might have been caused as a result of the resistance he had shown to his arrest .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing , the \u201c GPE \u201d ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s bail request on the weight of the arguments presented by the prosecution and ordered his pre - trial detention for a period not exceeding DATE . ORG indicated in this connection that it had not found the first applicant \u2019s statement that he would appear for trial if released on bail to be credible and reliable , but it did not comment on his counsel \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment . The first applicant was transferred to FAC after the hearing .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE the first applicant appeared before the court for another bail hearing . The ORG has not been provided with the minutes of that hearing , but it appears that the hearing was adjourned until DATE on account of the first applicant \u2019s deteriorating health , and that he was transferred to hospital for treatment for high blood sugar levels ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below for further details ) .", "DATE . On DATE the charges against the first applicant were lodged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convened for a preliminary inquiry in the case , which lasted until DATE , during which period ORG sat for DATE . The first applicant was present throughout the hearings and was represented by both his lawyers . He was also assisted by interpreters .", "CARDINAL . During the preliminary inquiry the prosecution called CARDINAL witnesses : the QUANTITY police officers who had allegedly arrested the first applicant , namely ORG - inspector PERSON and police sergeants PERSON and GPE ; another police officer who had interpreted the formal charges against the first applicant ; and the forensic chemist who had analysed the drugs allegedly seized from him . The first applicant , on the other hand , called CARDINAL witness , PERSON , the ORG Liaison Officer in GPE at the material time .", "CARDINAL . ORG first heard the prosecution witnesses , who gave testimonies consistent with the incident reports and presented evidence against the first applicant , including a sketched map indicating where the applicant had crossed into the \u201c NORP \u201d and where he had been captured , photographs of the relevant areas taken TIME after the arrest , the drugs allegedly recovered from the applicant , and the clothes and shoes he had been wearing on the relevant day , which were soiled with mud on account of the struggle on the ground , as well as copies of the medical reports drawn up following his arrest .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution witnesses were subsequently cross - examined by the defence counsel , who challenged the veracity and credibility of their testimonies in the light of the first applicant \u2019s account of events , according to which he had been kidnapped from his car in LAW territory and had then been handed over to the \u201c NORP \u201d police . The defence counsel accordingly asked detailed questions about the tip - off call which ORG - inspector PERSON had allegedly received DATE before the first applicant \u2019s arrest and the identity of the police informant ; the planning of the ambush and the weather conditions on the relevant TIME ; the route that the first applicant had followed to reach the \u201c GPE \u201d ; the exact point from which he had allegedly crossed into \u201c GPE \u201d territory ; and the paperwork undertaken by the police subsequent to the first applicant \u2019s arrest . The responses received appeared to be consistent with the earlier testimonies and did not reveal new evidence , apart from some factual details , such as the height of the border fence , which , according to the prosecution witnesses , was QUANTITY at the point of crossing but yielded when pressed , details of the conversation with the police informant , and the notes taken by the arresting officers in their police notebooks prior to and after the operation .", "CARDINAL . Sub - inspector PERSON was asked why he had not submitted the package of drugs allegedly recovered from the first applicant for a fingerprint examination , to which he responded that he had seen no need for such an examination as he had taken the package directly from the applicant \u2019s hands himself . He further maintained that no examination had been made of the footprints identified on the terrain , as the first applicant had apparently slipped and had not left very clear marks .", "CARDINAL . Sub - inspector PERSON was also asked whether he had recorded the tip - off he had received from his informant . He responded that he had recorded both the tip - off call and the subsequent operation conducted on TIME DATE for the first applicant \u2019s arrest in his police notebook , which had been submitted to the court as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of the preliminary inquiry the defence counsel called PERSON as the defence \u2019s sole witness . PERSON stated that he had been appointed by the ORG as a ORG Police Liaison Officer . His duty was to liaise between the NORP and the NORP sides on policing and humanitarian issues . He explained that on DATE his contact person on the NORP side on humanitarian issues , PERSON , who was the head of ORG Defence of the \u201c NORP \u201d , had called him for a meeting . During the meeting , PERSON had told PERSON that he wanted to protest , through the ORG , about the recent arrest of PERSON by the NORP police in the ORG buffer zone . Mr M.\u0130. had allegedly told him that if PERSON was not released before TIME on DATE , NORP Cypriots from LOC , a mixed village located in the ORG buffer zone , would start disappearing . ORG had added that if the NORP police had adopted a new policy of kidnapping suspects from the buffer zone , the NORP police would respond in the same manner .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the objections of the prosecution regarding the admissibility of PERSON testimony as evidence , ORG held that it would accept Mr ORG testimony not as evidence as to the truth of the statement allegedly made by Mr GPE , which would be against the rule on hearsay evidence , but only as evidence of the fact that a meeting had taken place between Mr PERSON and Mr J.C.", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the testimonies and other evidence presented before it , on DATE ORG decided that there were sufficient grounds to commit the first applicant for trial before ORG . It also prolonged the first applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant claimed that during the preliminary inquiry , he had seen one of his abductors amongst the audience , but that the latter had managed to leave the court room before he had had the chance to point him out to his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s trial commenced in ORG on DATE . He attended all of the hearings together with his CARDINAL lawyers . He was also provided with an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the CARDINAL witnesses who had testified at the preliminary inquiry , the prosecution called as witnesses a forensic police officer , a \u201c GPE \u201d military officer stationed in GPE , the CARDINAL doctors who had examined the first applicant on DATE and the agricultural engineer who had analysed the soil obtained from the first applicant \u2019s shoes . The evidence provided by the prosecution witnesses , including during crossexamination , was , in general , consistent with the previous testimonies and official reports .", "CARDINAL . During his cross - examination ORG - inspector PERSON was asked a number of questions regarding the identity of his informant , which he refused to answer . However , he gave detailed information about the telephone conversation he had had with the informant , and also about his \u201c exploratory visit \u201d to the estimated drug drop - off point in TIME of DATE together with the informant . PERSON also stated that he had informed his supervisor about the information he had received from his informant prior to the operation conducted on CARDINAL DATE , while keeping the identity of the informant secret . However , he had not alerted the local police and military officers in GPE in order to protect the secrecy of the operation . In response to a question as to why no one had been left at the drop - off point following the first applicant \u2019s arrest to capture the latter \u2019s contact person in the \u201c NORP \u201d , ORG - inspector PERSON stated that he had suspected his informant to be that contact person and that , in any event , a unit had been stationed at the dropoff point on TIME CARDINAL DATE to catch any suspects .", "CARDINAL . During his cross - examination PERSON , who had conducted the initial medical examination of the first applicant after his arrest , was asked to provide details of the findings of his medical report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , he indicated that on the relevant morning he had observed a swelling with a diameter of QUANTITY on the left side of the first applicant \u2019s head , as well as redness measuring QUANTITY by CARDINAL cm behind the right ear , redness measuring QUANTITY across the chest , and CARDINAL areas of redness measuring QUANTITY by DATE cm on the back , all of which appeared to have been sustained TIME before the examination . He stated that the swelling observed above the first applicant \u2019s left ear could have been caused by blunt - force trauma or by the impact of falling on a stone or similar hard object . He also confirmed that the examination had been conducted in the presence of CARDINAL persons in civilian clothes , whom he had perceived to be police officers and who had also acted as interpreters between the first applicant and himself . He added that although he had raised the question specifically , the first applicant had not expressed any complaints of bodily injury , apart from stating that he was diabetic . The police , on the other hand , had explained that there had been a scuffle during his arrest .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , who had examined the first applicant after PERSON for any pulmonary problems , stated that the first applicant had presented symptoms of bronchitis . He had therefore prescribed medicine to him for that purpose but had not noted any other injuries or marks on his face or torso . He also indicated that the examination had been conducted in the presence of another person in civilian clothes , whom he assumed to be a police officer .", "CARDINAL . Dr GPE , a general surgeon , stated before the court that he had also examined the first applicant on the relevant day in response to his complaints of abdominal pain , but had not identified any causes for such pain .

On the basis of the information received from the \u201c TRNC \u201d authorities , the ORG police searched the first applicant \u2019s car for traces of drugs and fingerprints . It appears that they found no traces of drugs , and no further information was provided regarding fingerprints . Over DATE , they also interviewed some ORG people in an attempt to shed light on the events of DATE . Amongst the interviewees were the first applicant \u2019s NORP workers , his fellow NORP Cypriot contractors , including those who later testified before ORG , members of the ORG police force , and the residents of the houses in the area where the first applicant \u2019s car had been found and where he had allegedly crossed into the \u201c NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A number of interviewees attested to having seen the first applicant \u2019s car on TIME CARDINAL DATE parked in an odd manner on the main road from GPE to GPE , albeit with some inconsistencies as to its position and state , such as whether and which doors of the car were open , which way it was facing and whether the engine was running . Some others who had taken the same road around the relevant time stated that they had not noticed anything out of the ordinary or seen the first applicant \u2019s car . A number of persons approached for statements , including some NORP , refrained from giving statements altogether because they were afraid to talk for political reasons .", "CARDINAL . Of the ORG people interviewed , CARDINAL , PERSON and ORG , who also subsequently testified before ORG , had seen the ORG cars that had allegedly been used for the first applicant \u2019s abduction . Although ORG stated before ORG that he had seen CARDINAL ORG cars , CARDINAL white and CARDINAL red ( see above paragraph CARDINAL ) , he had not mentioned anything about a white car in his earlier statement to the ORG given on DATE . Moreover , the sketched plan attached to GPE \u2019s statement , indicating the respective positions of the red and the white ORG cars and the car of the first applicant , did not fully correspond to the statements given by the other witnesses and the first applicant himself , nor did it match his subsequent statement before ORG , particularly as to where the red ORG car had been parked vis - \u00e0 - vis the white one .", "CARDINAL . Amongst all those interviewed , CARDINAL person DATE a NORP builder , Mr GPE , who also subsequently appeared before ORG as a witness \u2013 claimed to have witnessed anything suggesting an abduction on the relevant TIME . In his statement to the LAW police on DATE , GPE said that at TIME on TIME of CARDINAL December CARDINAL , he had seen a red double - cabin pickup parked on the main LOC road , with no other cars around it , and a man running from that car towards the field on the right side of the road . There were CARDINAL other men in the field , who were pulling someone by the hands and arms towards the east side of the field , and he heard that man yelling \u201c Let me go ! \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG police interviewed Mr GPE , the owner of the white ORG pickup with registration number UJ CARDINAL , which the first applicant claimed had been travelling in front of him towards PERSON on the relevant morning . PERSON stated that on TIME DATE , his car had been driven by a NORP worker of his , whose name he did not reveal for safety reasons ( but who will be referred to as \u201c NORP \u201d hereinafter ) . According to what PERSON had heard from X , as he was driving from Pergamos to LOC on the morning of QUANTITY DATE , X had noticed CARDINAL civilian cars , CARDINAL red and the other white , blocking the way of a doublecabin pickup that had been coming from the direction of LOC ( that is , the opposite direction to him ) . As he approached , he saw CARDINAL persons running from CARDINAL of the vehicles towards the pickup and by the time he was driving past those vehicles , they were pulling the driver out of the pickup , while CARDINAL other people were sitting inside the other vehicle . ORG stated that X had not seen anything more because he had driven past without stopping . Allegedly , DATE after the incident the first applicant \u2019s nephew , PERSON ( who himself is an applicant before ORG ) , and an ORG police officer managed to track down X. Yet , apart from their allegations , there is no evidence in the case file to demonstrate that any contact was actually made with X or that X confirmed GPE \u2019s testimony .", "CARDINAL . As for the interviews conducted with the residents of the area , it appears from their testimonies that none of them had seen anyone around on the morning of DATE . They had certainly not seen anything suggesting an arrest or abduction on the road . Some of them confirmed that the depth of the stream by the border fences , which the first applicant had allegedly crossed to enter the \u201c TRNC \u201d , had been QUANTITY on TIME in question . It further appears from the documents submitted by the applicants that after finishing the interviews with the residents of the area around FAC , an ORG officer set off to walk from the point of the alleged crossing into the \u201c TRNC \u201d to the point of the alleged abduction in order to measure the time it would have taken the first applicant to walk that distance . According to the officer \u2019s notes , the relevant path could be covered in TIME at a normal pace .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted various ORG police reports regarding the investigation conducted into the first applicant \u2019s alleged abduction . The report dated DATE stated the following :", "\u201c On CARDINAL Panicos\u2019 [ the first applicant \u2019s ] wife , accompanied by a NORP Advocate , visited him in custody in LOC . It has been confirmed by both parties that PERSON alleges that at the location of his abandoned vehicle he saw a vehicle with the bonnet open and CARDINAL men with their attention fixed on the engine compartment . He stopped to offer assistance , and at this point he was bundled into their vehicle and driven from the ORG into the controlled site via Pergamos gate . This was against his will . He was then driven around for TIME , given a parcel and pushed out of the vehicle at an unknown location . TIME passed and then a NORP Police car arrived . He went to them for assistance and was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a parcel of controlled drugs \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In another report prepared on DATE , ORG sergeant PERSON noted that the first applicant \u2019s nephew , PERSON , had given him some information that he had received from his uncle \u2019s NORP lawyer regarding the alleged abduction . The relevant parts of the report read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON also told his solicitor that following his abduction he was taken to a place where there were airplanes . During the journey the persons who abducted him were beating him up .

NORP In a report prepared on DATE , ORG sergeant PERSON noted that the \u201c Political Section \u201d of ORG used CARDINAL unmarked civilian vehicles , a red ORG and a white ORG , to patrol the area of LOC and GPE . In his opinion , those vehicles had also been used for the abduction of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . In their report issued on DATE , the ORG police made the following conclusions :", "\u201c NORP ORG maintain that they arrested Tsiakkourmas inside ORG QUANTITY west of FAC .", "If this account is accepted then Tsiakkourmas must have abandoned his vehicle , engine running , lights on and driver \u2019s door open , almost in the middle of what was then a fairly busy road . He must have left his briefcase and mobile telephone and ( carrying a large quantity of cannabis ) walked QUANTITY across a muddy field , climbed a QUANTITY high fence and crossed QUANTITY wide ditch . An ORG Police Officer will state that there was water to a depth of QUANTITY in the ditch that morning . He thereafter must have tried to hide the cannabis under a QUANTITY high olive tree ( the only one in the area described by ORG ) . ( This in an area with which Tsiakkourmas would be unlikely to be familiar \u2013 inside ORG ) . All of this he must have accomplished knowing that his employees were waiting for him at TIME , as they had been doing for DATE , at the Pergamos Check Point .", "...", "Notwithstanding the fact that it is often much more difficult to prove innocence rather than guilt it is submitted that , in spite of the statements of ORG to the contrary , all other available evidence indicates that PERSON was taken from his vehicle at the locus where that vehicle was abandoned DATE well within LOC .

Some members of the ORG police also appeared before ORG as defence witnesses . Their statements have been noted above ( paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In a separate affidavit he sent to the ORG , ORG sergeant PERSON stated that various NORP witnesses who had wished to testify before ORG for the defence had been intimidated by the NORP authorities . PERSON claimed that some of those witnesses had personally told him that they had been questioned and threatened by the NORP police . The ORG notes that it can not be inferred from the case - file that these allegations were brought to the attention of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG police conducted a reconstruction of the first applicant \u2019s alleged abduction on the basis of the evidence available to them . The reconstruction was also recorded on video . It appears that a number of \u201c GPE \u201d police officers also watched the reconstruction .", "CARDINAL . The ORG police were not permitted to interview the applicant during his detention in the \u201c NORP \u201d . However , following his release they took a statement from him , which was consistent with his account of the events submitted to ORG . They also showed him the video of the reconstruction exercise . According to the records of the ORG police , the first applicant recognised CARDINAL of the bystanders in the reconstruction video as his abductors . Upon investigation , it was established that CARDINAL of the persons recognised by the applicant was police officer PERSON Intelligence Service and the second one was police officer \u00dc. , who worked at the NORP police station . Arrest warrants were subsequently issued against those persons on DATE on suspicion of the offence of abduction . There is no further information in the case file on this matter , nor is it clear whether this information was shared with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG asked me whether [ they ] had been summoned , in which case the court could order their presence . I told the ORG that the summonses had not been served yet . As there was no service of the summons , the judge , under LAW and the related Regulation , could not order the arrest of these witnesses . As a result , the defense closed its case ( without calling these additional witnesses ) after calling CARDINAL witnesses listed in the attached paper .", "The reason a proper service of the summonses could not be done was the concealment of the names of these witnesses even from me till TIME , and our attempt to summon them without applying for a short service order from ORG . As a defense lawyer , as well as not personally having seen the witnesses , I got to know about their identities just before the issuing of the summons , DATE before in the afternoon , and issuing a summons DATE , I sent it by hand to FAC . It is not again in my knowledge whether these witnesses were personally served with these summonses . We produced no evidence that they had been duly served .

The applicants submitted as evidence an affidavit made by PERSON before a notary public in GPE , GPE , on DATE . The relevant parts of his affidavit read as follows :", "\u201c On TIME Sunday CARDINAL at TIME , I received a telephone call whilst in my apartment within the ORG compound in ORG in GPE .

Mr PERSON then wished to speak to the Special Adviser to the Chief of Mission who was also Head of ORG . I failed to make contact with the Special Adviser and informed him accordingly . He was very agitated and I agreed to meet him to discuss what he described was a serious matter ...", "Mr PERSON was very agitated and very concerned about the arrest of PERSON who , he alleged , was arrested in the ORG buffer zone in the LOC area . PERSON is a NORP , who was arrested by LAW TIME Friday CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL being found in possession of a substantial amount of the illegal drug heroin .", "... he [ Mr GPE ] told me to take down a protest about PERSON arrest . As he spoke , I noted his protest in my notebook .", "...", "I then read out to Mr GPE the protest that he made in the format that I would present it which was as follows :", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the parties presented different accounts as to how the first applicant came to be under the control of the \u201c GPE \u201d authorities . While the Government contended that he had been caught in possession of drugs after having illegally crossed into the \u201c GPE \u201d , the first applicant consistently claimed that he had been abducted within the LAW territory by \u201c GPE \u201d agents in civilian clothes and had then been detained in the \u201c GPE \u201d on the basis of fabricated charges of drugs smuggling .", "CARDINAL . According to the submissions of the Government , the location of the first applicant \u2019s arrest was an issue that had been taken up and examined scrupulously by the \u201c NORP \u201d courts . The first applicant \u2019s lawyers had subjected the main prosecution witnesses to extensive cross - examination , and the prosecution had likewise cross - examined the witnesses called by the first applicant . After hearing those witnesses , the domestic courts had accepted the version of the facts as presented by the prosecution . It had accordingly been established that the first applicant had entered the \u201c NORP \u201d illegally from the ORG , between boundary stones CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL separating the NORP bases from the GPE . He had apparently left his car in ORG territory , but the location of the arrest was within the borders of the GPE . There were a few witnesses who had allegedly seen the first applicant \u2019s car on the relevant TIME ; however , none of the passers - by had witnessed his arrest . Moreover , it was the Government \u2019s opinion that the evidence given by the defence witnesses was far from coherent , even on the issue of the original location of the first applicant \u2019s car .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the separate investigation conducted by the ORG police into the circumstances of the first applicant \u2019s detention , the Government further maintained that that investigation had been based on a \u201c reconstruction \u201d of the incident and on statements taken from persons who could not be described as \u201c independent \u201d and detached from the adverse political atmosphere prevailing in southern GPE , bearing in mind that this was a highly publicised case at the time . Moreover , the statements taken by the ORG were not subjected to the scrutiny of a court of law .", "CARDINAL . As to whether there was any link between the arrest of the first applicant and that of PERSON , the Government contended that the reason why the CARDINAL names had been pronounced together was that both men had gone through similar experiences and that the incidents had taken place within a very short span of time . During both the preliminary inquiry and the subsequent hearing before ORG , the first applicant \u2019s lawyers had insisted on the alleged link between the CARDINAL incidents . For that purpose , they had called the ORG Liaison Officer in GPE at the material time , PERSON , to testify as to what PERSON M.\u0130. , ORG at ORG , had allegedly told him and they had protested when the said evidence was not allowed to be included in the case file for being hearsay . The Government could not understand , however , why the defence had not called Mr PERSON directly as a witness so that he could testify on the content of his alleged statement , especially given that the domestic courts had the authority to compel GPE to testify .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE stated for its part that the evidence of a connection between the abduction of the first applicant and the earlier arrest of PERSON was overwhelming . They referred in particular to the formal protest made by PERSON to the ORG Liaison Officer , PERSON , and maintained that the first applicant had been targeted randomly in execution of the threat made in that protest . This was further evidenced by the numerous appeals made by the NORP side for the exchange of the applicant for PERSON , including by Mr PERSON himself .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the exhaustive and independent inquiry conducted by the ORG police also supported unequivocally the conclusion that the first applicant had indeed been abducted within the territory of the ORG . ORG maintained that where the accounts of the parties were diametrically opposed , the ORG had to give conclusive weight to independent evidence , which had been provided by the ORG investigation report in the instant case . They added that while the respondent Government had claimed that the \u201c TRNC \u201d courts had thoroughly examined the allegations of both sides , what took place before those \u201c courts \u201d was not in any way determinative of the way in which ORG should approach the evidence and did not constrain the ORG in its fact - finding exercise .", "CARDINAL . In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events , the ORG is inevitably confronted , when establishing the facts , with the same difficulties as those faced by any first - instance court ( see , for instance , PERSON v. the former GPE [ ORG ] , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) . In this connection , the ORG emphasises that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role , and that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case . As a general rule , where domestic proceedings have taken place , it is not the ORG \u2019s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them . Though the ORG is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own assessment in the light of all the material before it , in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the reasoned findings of fact reached by the national judicial authorities , particularly where , as in the present case , the ORG has not itself had the benefit of examining the relevant witnesses and forming its own assessment of their credibility ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE , and PERSON and Others v. the GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the facts before it , the ORG notes that following the preliminary inquiry held DATE , ORG commenced criminal proceedings against the first applicant on DATE . During the DATE trial that ensued , ORG was presented with a substantial body of evidence about the events of CARDINAL DATE , including oral testimony and documentary and photographic evidence submitted by both parties . Relying on that evidence , on DATE ORG ruled for the first applicant \u2019s conviction for drug - related crimes . It held that , having carried out a comprehensive examination of the testimonies and documentary evidence presented to it , the \u201c testimonies of the prosecution witnesses had been found to be credible , accurate and reliable \u201d , whereas the \u201c testimonies of the defendant and his witnesses had lacked credibility , accuracy and reliability \u201d . ORG thus accepted the facts as presented by the prosecution and convicted the first applicant on that basis .", "CARDINAL . While the ORG has no reason to suspect that the trial court \u2019s admission or assessment of the evidence before it was arbitrary per se , it notes that ORG provided no reasoning in relation to its findings of fact and assessment of evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG , therefore , can not determine whether the judgment of the domestic court , which had not only the means but also the principal duty to clearly establish the facts contested by the parties , was the result of a fair and comprehensive consideration of the contradictory arguments before it , or whether it ruled in favour of the official version of the events presented by the prosecution following a perfunctory assessment that did not give sufficient regard to the first applicant \u2019s serious claims . The absence of such reasoning not only has implications vis\u00e0 - vis certain procedural rights of the applicant , which will be examined in further detail below , but also detracts from the reliance which might otherwise have been placed on the trial court \u2019s judgment by the ORG . In these circumstances , the ORG is compelled to make its own assessment of the facts on the basis of the evidence before it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence in this context , it has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard : as applied by the ORG , it has an autonomous meaning ( see PERSON the GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX for further details ) . According to its established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion is intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see , amongst others , PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the light of the foregoing principles , and the gravity of the allegations submitted by the applicants , the ORG will subject the evidence presented by the parties to careful scrutiny in order to come to a conclusion regarding the circumstances in which the first applicant was apprehended on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes at the outset that the first applicant was not able to present a direct and reliable eyewitness to corroborate his account of the events . He claimed before the ORG that the driver of the white ORG pickup with registration number UJ CARDINAL , who had been driving ahead of him on TIME in question , must have witnessed his abduction . However , he made no such claims during the domestic proceedings , nor , to the ORG \u2019s knowledge , was any attempt made to call that person as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the only defence witness who claimed to have seen what took place on the relevant morning , a NORP contractor named PERSON , contradicted the first applicant \u2019s account of the events . In his statement before ORG , GPE claimed that on TIME of the incident , he had seen a man getting out of a red pickup parked on the main LOC road , which was the only car around . CARDINAL other men were in the fields to the right side of the road . CARDINAL of them was being dragged by the arms and pleading to be let go ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the account presented by the first applicant , however , there were CARDINAL other cars on the road that had been used for his abduction , and after a struggle , he had been transferred directly from his car to the red ORG . Moreover , the first applicant made no mention of being dragged across the field by the side of the road , as alleged by GPE The ORG observes that the first applicant made no attempt to offer an explanation for GPE \u2019s conflicting account .", "CARDINAL . As for the other witnesses called by the first applicant during the domestic proceedings , including a number of LAW police officers , the ORG notes that they mainly provided information as to the location and the state in which the first applicant \u2019s car had later been found in the ORG , and that there were some inconsistencies as to its exact location and state . CARDINAL witnesses , Mr GPE and Mr PERSON , who were apparently driving TIME in question , claimed to have seen the red and the white ORG cars that were allegedly used to orchestrate the first applicant \u2019s abduction . However , the descriptions they provided in relation to those cars were somewhat inconsistent : whereas PERSON claimed that there was a white ORG parked on the left - hand side of the road with its bonnet open , and a red ORG to the right of that white car , ORG stated that the car parked on the left - hand side of the road with an open bonnet had been a red ORG , and that the white ORG had been waiting on the opposite side of the road by some cypress trees and had flashed its lights at him . Even more striking was the fact that in his earlier statement to the ORG police on DATE that is , DATE after the incident \u2013 ORG had not mentioned anything about a white car , which is hard to explain considering his later claim that that car had flashed its headlights at him . Moreover , as already mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , the statement of GPE before ORG did not match his earlier statement to the ORG police .", "CARDINAL . While the ORG is ready to accept that some of the discrepancies noted above , in particular those concerning the exact state in which the first applicant \u2019s car was found , may be explained by the differences in the subjective assessments of individual witnesses and the passage of time , it considers in any event that the establishment of the location and the circumstances in which the car was found , despite the many valid questions it raises , does not on its own shed light on the circumstances in which the first applicant was detained . Similarly , the fact that the sniffer dog found no traces belonging to the first applicant around his abandoned car or any other traces in the fields , although it must certainly have been taken into account by the trial court in its consideration as to how the first applicant had reached \u201c GPE \u201d territory , does not as such rebut the ORG \u2019s allegations regarding his capture , particularly in view of Mr GPE \u2019s conflicting statement that he had seen a number of persons in the fields , whose tracks the dog did not pick up either . The ORG stresses in this connection that the evidence presented by the applicants is not even sufficient to establish whether the first applicant himself was driving his car on the relevant TIME or whether he was alone in the car .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicants alleged that a number of important NORP witnesses had been unable to testify in the first applicant \u2019s favour on account of the threats to which they had been subjected , the ORG can not make a conclusive finding on that issue either , particularly in view of the statements of PERSON , the first applicant \u2019s lawyer , to the trial court and to Mr PERSON suggesting his unawareness of such intimidation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above , respectively ) , and given that there were no real attempts to substantiate the allegations of witness intimidation before the trial court during the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also observes that although the first applicant referred in his application before the ORG to a NORP detainee who had allegedly been asked by the \u201c GPE \u201d police to falsely admit to being his drugs contact in the \u201c GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the evidence in the case file indicates that he did not draw that serious allegation to the attention of his lawyers or the domestic courts , nor did he subsequently reiterate it in his statement to the ORG police following his release .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further takes note of the separate investigation conducted by the ORG police into the circumstances of the first applicant \u2019s detention , which resulted in a finding that he had been \u201c taken from his vehicle at the locus where that vehicle was abandoned DATE well within LOC ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG observes in this connection that according to the documents submitted to it , the ORG police interviewed CARDINAL people within the framework of that investigation , and that it found the opportunity to review all of those interviews . As explained in detail in the \u201c Facts \u201d section , amongst the interviewees were the defence witnesses who subsequently appeared before ORG , a number of NORP Cypriots who either worked for the first applicant or knew him otherwise , some other NORP builders who had used the NORP - Pergamos road on the relevant morning , as well as the residents of some of the houses in the vicinity . Even though the assessment of the LAW police may appear plausible having regard to the place where the applicant \u2019s car was found and the latter \u2019s state as well as the official information about the place of the applicant \u2019s arrest , this assessment does not constitute sufficient evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s account of events ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes in the first place that none of the residents of the area where the first applicant allegedly abandoned his car in the ORG or crossed into the \u201c TRNC \u201d had seen anything suspicious on TIME in question . Similarly , none of the other NORP or NORP persons interviewed provided any additional information to that subsequently presented to ORG . Some of them had no information to share with the ORG police , other than the rumours they had heard ; some others stated that they had not seen anything suspicious , not even the first applicant \u2019s car , even though they had also used the Pyla - Pergamos road at around CARDINAL.CARDINAL to TIME . Others , however , attested to having seen the first applicant \u2019s abandoned car , although again with some inconsistencies as to its location and state DATE such as which way the car was facing , whether its engine was running , whether and if so which doors of the car had been left open and whether the headlights were on . The ORG stresses at this juncture that the car had been moved to another spot following the instructions of the first applicant \u2019s brother prior to the arrival of the LAW police officers at the scene of the incident . Therefore , the official ORG records only included second - hand information on where and in what condition the first applicant \u2019s car had originally been found , instead of photographs or other such direct evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , CARDINAL statements made to the ORG police are worth a special mention . The first CARDINAL of those statements , made by GPE , GPE and ORG have already been discussed in detail in paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL above . The fourth statement that the ORG wishes to highlight is that of Mr GPE , the NORP contractor who owned the aforementioned white ORG pickup with registration number UJ CARDINAL , whose statement has been summarised in paragraph CARDINAL above . The statement given by GPE regarding his employee X \u2019s alleged witnessing of the first applicant \u2019s abduction does not correspond to the latter \u2019s testimony . Whereas the first applicant alleged that the white ORG had been travelling ahead of him in the direction of PERSON , and had actually stopped by the red ORG car and talked briefly to the persons standing in front of that car before driving away towards GPE , GPE claimed that X was travelling from GPE to GPE , namely in the opposite direction , and had driven past the cars in question as the first applicant was being dragged out of his car , without stopping . The ORG also finds it curious that although ORG informed the ORG police of GPE \u2019s alleged eyewitness account as early as DATE , neither ORG himself , nor PERSON or the ORG police officer who had allegedly tracked X down had been called as witnesses by the defence during the subsequent criminal proceedings against the first applicant before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes the contradictions in some ORG police reports regarding the circumstances in which the first applicant was abducted . While the first applicant had claimed during the domestic proceedings and subsequently before the ORG that he had been forced to stop after his car had been intercepted by a white ORG on his way to PERSON \u2019s caf\u00e9 ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , according to an ORG report dated DATE , he claimed that he had been forced out of his vehicle only after he had willingly stopped to offer assistance to a car which appeared to have an engine problem ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Moreover , although the first applicant stated before the domestic courts and ORG that his abductors had personally handed him over to the NORP police and that he had not seen the drugs which he was accused of smuggling until later in the day at the police station ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) , CARDINAL ORG police reports dated DATE noted that the first applicant had been arrested by the NORP police after his abductors had abandoned him in the vicinity of an airport with a package of drugs ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) .", "CARDINAL . Apart from taking witness statements , the ORG police also conducted a crime - scene investigation . It has already been mentioned above that the sniffer dog was not able to find any tracks in the vicinity of the car that could have shed light on the events , nor were any traces of prohibited substances found inside the car . ORG also notes , however , that whereas the doors and the windows of the car were dusted for fingerprints , there is no information to suggest that foreign fingerprints were identified on the car , although the first applicant alleged that he had been dragged out of his car by force and his car was subsequently moved from its original location .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , during the preliminary inquiry the ORG Liaison Officer , Mr J.C. , made a statement regarding a meeting he had had with Mr. PERSON on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The first applicant relied on that statement to argue that he had been kidnapped in retaliation for PERSON \u2019s earlier arrest by the NORP Cypriot authorities . While the ORG has no reason to doubt the independence and impartiality of PERSON , it is not prepared to give decisive weight to that untested circumstantial evidence . The ORG also notes in this connection that the applicants have failed to respond to the ORG \u2019s query as to why PERSON PERSON was not summoned to testify before ORG , which would have had the power to compel him to attend ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of their arguments the Government chiefly relied on the evidence presented by the prosecution during the domestic proceedings , which consisted mainly of the official incident reports , as well as photographs and sketches of the relevant area where the first applicant had allegedly crossed into the \u201c TRNC \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Like the first applicant , the Government did not present any eyewitnesses who could attest to their version of the events . According to the testimony of the QUANTITY police officers from the drugs branch who had allegedly caught the first applicant in flagrante delicto , they were the only ones present at the scene of the incident , apart from the applicant himself . Subinspector PERSON claimed during the domestic proceedings that apart from his superintendent and the other CARDINAL officers who had accompanied him that TIME , no other officers or authorities had been informed of the tipoff call that he had received on DATE from his informant , nor had advance notice been given to anyone else about the operation , including the officers on duty at the Pergamos checkpoint . Unfortunately , the ORG is not in a position to verify the accuracy of any of that information , nor can it turn to ORG for such verification . As already indicated above , ORG did not engage in a satisfactory discussion as to the veracity of the evidence before it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes from the information in the case file that the forensic evidence submitted by the prosecution during the domestic proceedings was limited to an examination of the mud recovered from the first applicant \u2019s shoe on the date of his arrest , which partially matched the soil sample extracted from the area where he had allegedly crossed into the \u201c NORP \u201d . No fingerprint examination was conducted on the package of cannabis resin allegedly seized from the first applicant ; it was explained that since the package had been taken directly from his hands by ORG - inspector PERSON himself , it had been deemed unnecessary to submit it for a fingerprint examination . Moreover , although the area where the first applicant had allegedly crossed into the \u201c TRNC \u201d had been photographed , including a couple of photographs showing footmarks allegedly belonging to the first applicant , it does not appear that any detailed examination was made to match those marks to his footwear .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lastly notes that amongst the evidence submitted by the ORG was also the sketched map of the area between border stones nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , showing the point where the first applicant had allegedly entered the \u201c TRNC \u201d , as well as photographs of the same area . According to those photographs , the top of the fence in the relevant area had no barbed wire and was deformed in some parts , which the ORG argued had made it easier for the applicant to jump over .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is of the opinion that the arguments and evidence submitted by the first applicant , albeit inconclusive and inconsistent in some respects , raise serious suspicions about the official account of events presented by the Government , particularly when viewed against the backdrop of the political climate on the island at the material time . The fact that the first applicant was arrested in \u201c GPE \u201d territory for smuggling drugs DATE after the controversial arrest of PERSON by the NORP Cypriot authorities , which apparently led to some strong protests from the NORP side , may cast some doubts on the accusations brought against him . Moreover , whereas the allegation remains that the first applicant entered the \u201c TRNC \u201d between border stones CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL separating the ORG from the \u201c TRNC \u201d , the ORG notes that the domestic authorities , including the trial court , do not appear to have concerned themselves much with how he may have arrived there . Thus , they failed to establish where and in what condition he had left his car and which route he had followed , despite the consistent allegations that the car had been found abandoned on the wrong side of a road with its engine running and doors open .", "CARDINAL . The ORG nevertheless considers that in view of the gravity of the first applicant \u2019s allegation that he was abducted from ORG territory by or with the connivance of \u201c GPE \u201d agents , it needs very compelling evidence before it can uphold the allegation . In this connection , the ORG wishes to emphasise that although it has no reason to doubt the independence of the investigation conducted by the ORG police , the findings that emerged from that investigation were not submitted to the scrutiny of a court of law and thus remain untested .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is mindful of the fact that the difficulties it has encountered in establishing the facts are due , to a large extent , to the domestic judicial authorities\u2019 failure to discharge their duty to subject the evidence before them to a critical and thorough analysis in a reasoned judgment . However , while that significant failure certainly raises procedural issues that will be examined below in particular within the context of LAW , it does not provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to allow the ORG to find that the first applicant \u2019s allegations can be considered proven in accordance with the requisite standard of proof under the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the foregoing explanations and all the material before it , and while it in no way disregards the seriousness of the allegations made by the first applicant , the ORG can not but hold that there is an insufficient evidentiary basis on which to conclude that the first applicant was kidnapped from ORG territory by , or with the connivance of , \u201c GPE \u201d agents ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
