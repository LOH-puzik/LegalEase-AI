The applicant was born in DATE in ORG , in the former GPE ( GPE ) , and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the natural daughter of a Mr Schildgen , who recognised her DATE after her birth . She lived in the territory of the former GPE until DATE , while her father lived in the ORG . The father and daughter corresponded regularly during this period , and after the reunification of GPE she visited him . He died DATE and DATE ( the precise date has not been specified ) .", "The applicant subsequently made several attempts to assert her inheritance rights in the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a certificate of inheritance attesting that she was entitled to at least a PERCENT share of Mr PERSON \u2019s estate .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Amtsgericht \u2013 Nachlassgericht ) refused the applicant \u2019s application , holding that , notwithstanding the reform of the law of succession following the introduction of LAW of DATE ( Erbgleichstellungsgesetz ) , the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act ( Gesetz \u00fcber die rechtliche PERSON ) of DATE remained in force . The provision in question stated that children born outside marriage before DATE were not deemed to be statutory heirs ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also referred to a decision given by ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) on DATE ( see also \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in which the provision had been found to be in conformity with LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Landgericht ) , arguing in particular that the law of the former GPE , which provided for equal treatment between children born within and outside marriage , should apply in her case . In any event , section CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act contravened Article CARDINAL ( principle of equality before the law ) of LAW as there was no objective justification for the difference in treatment .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG decision on the same grounds . It acknowledged , however , that the exclusion of children born outside marriage before DATE from the statutory right of inheritance placed them at a very clear disadvantage in relation to those born after that date and also to those covered by the law of the former GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to it to establish whether the applicant was indeed Mr PERSON \u2019s natural daughter and whether there were any other heirs . If the applicant were to be entitled to PERCENT share of the estate , ORG should examine whether the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act was in conformity with LAW .", "ORG confirmed at the outset that by virtue of the rules of private international law and , in particular , the settled case - law concerning section GPE ) of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz in ORG ) , FRG law alone was applicable in the applicant \u2019s case , since the deceased ( Erblasser ) had not been resident in the territory of the former GPE on DATE , when NORP reunification had taken effect .", "However , it considered that the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act was not in conformity with LAW , for the following reasons . Firstly , the legal and social status of children born outside marriage had evolved considerably since ORG decision of DATE and had in practice become equivalent to that of children born within marriage . ORG , moreover , had itself adopted a more restrictive approach to LAW ( principle of equal treatment between children born outside and within marriage ) in its decision of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Furthermore , a new situation had arisen as a result of the accession of the former GPE to the ORG , since by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , taken together with section GPE ) , children born outside marriage before DATE had the same rights as children born within marriage if the father had been resident in the territory of the former GPE on DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . However , there were no objective grounds for a difference of treatment between children born outside marriage before or after DATE , or between children born outside marriage before DATE according to whether or not the father had been resident in the territory of the former GPE on DATE . ORG concluded that the arguments put forward by ORG in its decision of DATE were no longer valid , particularly with regard to the practical and procedural difficulties of establishing the paternity of children born outside marriage before DATE , and the need to protect the \u201c legitimate expectations \u201d of the deceased ( ORG ) and his family .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE the ORG confirmed its previous decision on the basis of the same arguments . Even if it was established to PERCENT degree of certainty that the applicant was indeed Mr PERSON \u2019s daughter and there were no other known heirs , she was excluded from any statutory entitlement to the estate by the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act . In ORG view , that provision did not contravene LAW despite NORP reunification , as ORG had held in its decision of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG again quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to it to establish whether there were any other heirs of the second or third order and to re - examine whether the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act was compatible with LAW where the ORG was the sole statutory heir .", "ORG held that it was not acceptable to set a cut - off date if the deceased had no other heirs and , as a result , the ORG became the sole statutory heir . It referred in that connection to the right of inheritance ( Erbrechtsgarantie ) guaranteed in LAW , which in its view also protected the rights of a child born outside marriage where there were no private statutory heirs other than the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the ORG confirmed its previous decisions on the basis of the same arguments . It added that it was not required in the case before it to examine whether the provision in issue was in conformity with LAW , since it had been established that the deceased had heirs of the third order and that the ORG was therefore not the statutory heir .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant , on the ground that it was bound by the decisions of ORG in which the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act had been found to be in conformity with LAW . It further refused to refer the case back to ORG for a fresh examination , seeing that the ORG was not the statutory heir in the case before it .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to consider the appeal .", "It observed , in particular , that the aspect of protecting the \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d of the deceased had gained in importance since , following its decision of DATE , it had considered the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage before DATE to have been clarified in relation to LAW . It added that the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act had not lost its objective justification simply because children born outside marriage in an entirely different social context had the same rights as children born within marriage . The difference in treatment in comparison with children born outside marriage who were covered by the law of the former GPE was justified by the inherent purpose of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , that of avoiding any disadvantage resulting from the former GPE \u2019s accession to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act of DATE , which came into force on DATE , provided that on the father \u2019s death , children born outside marriage after DATE shortly after the entry into force of LAW were entitled to compensation from the heirs in an amount equivalent to their share of the estate ( Erbersatzanspruch ) . The sole exception concerned children born outside marriage before DATE : the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW excluded them from any statutory entitlement to the estate and from the right to financial compensation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the general context of the reform of family law with regard to custody and parental rights , the legislature also made changes to the law of succession for children born outside marriage through LAW of DATE , which came into force on DATE . Children born outside marriage are in principle now treated as equal to those born within marriage as regards all aspects of the law of succession .", "However , the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act of DATE remains in force as a transitional provision .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , taken together with section GPE ) , of LAW to the FRG Civil Code , children born outside marriage in the territory of the former GPE before DATE ( the date on which NORP reunification took effect ) have the same inheritance rights as children born within marriage in accordance with the FRG Civil Code if the father died after DATE and had been resident in the territory of the former GPE on DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) seeks to protect the rights of children born outside marriage prior to reunification who would have been covered by the law of the former GPE , which afforded equal inheritance rights to children born outside and within marriage .", "CARDINAL . It follows that the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage before DATE are dependent on the deceased \u2019s place of residence on DATE : if the deceased was resident in the territory of the former GPE , the child born outside marriage has the same inheritance rights as a child born within marriage ; if , however , the deceased was resident in the territory of the ORG , the child born outside marriage has no statutory entitlement to the estate .", "CARDINAL . In a leading decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the provision in issue was compatible with LAW .", "It stated , in particular , that fixing DATE as the cut - off date was objectively justified in view of the practical and procedural difficulties of establishing the paternity of children born outside marriage before that date , since the scientific methods used at the time were less developed than present - day methods . Many paternity suits were therefore unlikely to succeed owing to insufficient evidence . Moreover , the new legislation made it possible to contest declarations of paternity drawn up before DATE . Accordingly , having regard to those factors , the legislature had not overstepped its margin of discretion in this regard . Furthermore , it had to a certain extent been able to take account of existing uncertainties regarding the law of succession and of the opinion of those opposed to reforming the legal status of children born outside marriage . Lastly , the \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d of the deceased and their families that the exception provided for in the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act would be maintained also deserved a certain degree of protection .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG confirmed its earlier position notwithstanding the reunification of GPE . It held that the legislature had taken into account the social conditions prevailing when the Children Born outside ORG had been enacted . This objective justification was still present even though children born outside marriage in an entirely different social context had the same rights as children born within marriage .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that section DATE of LAW , which provided that a child born outside marriage was entitled to a share in the estate only if at the time of the father \u2019s death his paternity of the child had been acknowledged or determined by a court ruling , or judicial proceedings to that effect were pending , was not in conformity with LAW .", "CARDINAL . During the passage of LAW Kinderrechteverbesserungsgesetz ) of DATE , the legislature again upheld the exception in the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act . It took the view that that provision was compatible with LAW in the light of ORG decisions of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , which had created an even stronger \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d ( PERSON ) for the deceased and his family ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
