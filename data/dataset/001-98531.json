On DATE Judge PERSON of the GPE ORG ordered that the applicant 's case be examined on DATE at a public hearing with the participation of a state prosecutor and defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG composed of Judge PERSON and CARDINAL people 's assessors held an open hearing . The applicant , his counsel and the victims appeared before the court . The prosecutor failed to appear , for unknown reasons .", "CARDINAL . According to the court records , the court asked whether the participants in the proceedings had any requests . There were none . The court then asked whether it was possible to begin the court investigation with those present . The participants in the proceedings responded in the affirmative and the court , having deliberated , decided to do so .", "CARDINAL . The indictment was read out in court . The applicant was accused under LAW of a violation of traffic rules which caused bodily harm and , LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , of concerted burglary by a group of people causing significant damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was asked if he understood the charges against him and whether he pleaded guilty . He answered that he understood the charges , that he pleaded guilty to the traffic offence and not guilty to burglary . The participants in the proceedings were then asked about the order of examination of evidence . They left that question to the court 's discretion and the court decided first to hear the applicant , then the victims , and then to examine written evidence and the statements by witness Mr L. It then proceeded with the examination of evidence in that order .", "CARDINAL . Having deliberated , the court of its own motion decided to examine , as an additional witness , a police officer , PERSON , who had arrested the applicant at the site of the crime . It announced a TIME break , after which Mr Y. appeared before the court and was examined . Mr Y. stated that he had arrived at the scene of the burglary in a police patrol car with other police officers . He had seen a man and tried to pursue him but he had run away . They had found a car which was open and some time later he had caught the applicant , who was approaching the car and who looked similar to the man he had been pursuing earlier . The applicant had denied any connection with the burglary and stated that he had been visiting friends but could not give his friends ' names or address .", "CARDINAL . The court then asked whether it was possible to conclude the court investigation with those present . The participants in the proceedings responded in the affirmative and the court proceeded to pleadings . In particular , it heard the applicant 's counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Savelovskiy ORG delivered a judgment in which it convicted the applicant under LAW of a violation of traffic rules which caused bodily harm and LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of concerted burglary by a group of people causing significant damage , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's conviction on the charge of burglary was based on the statements of the victim Mr PERSON ; witness PERSON , a security guard who said he had seen CARDINAL people get out of a car , CARDINAL of whom had stayed in the yard while the other CARDINAL had approached the building with an object resembling a crowbar . PERSON had heard the sounds of scraping metal and called the police . The conviction was further based on statements by witness PERSON Y. ; a report on the examination of stolen property which was found by the police at the site of the crime and identified by the victim and a report on the examination of a crowbar which was also found at the site of the crime . The court found that the applicant took the other accomplices to the site of the crime in his car , made his car available to transport the stolen property , and kept watch while the others were forcing a window grille . ORG declared certain written evidence inadmissible as unlawfully obtained .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel appealed against the judgment , arguing that there was no evidence that the applicant had committed the burglary . He also pointed out that the case file did not contain information about the prosecutor 's notification of the hearing and reasons for his nonattendance . The first - instance court had held the trial in the absence of the prosecution , thus assuming its functions . In accusing the applicant and delivering the judgment at the same time , as with inquisitorial justice , it had violated the constitutional principles of impartiality of court , equality of parties and adversarial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an open hearing . It heard submissions by the applicant 's counsel and by the prosecutor , who argued that the judgment should be upheld . It dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated in its decision that it could not agree with the applicant 's allegation that he had not participated in the burglary , because the allegation was rebutted by the materials of the case . ORG held that there had not been any substantial violations of the law on criminal procedure which would warrant the quashing of the judgment . ORG made no comment in its decision in respect of the applicant 's complaint about the prosecutor 's absence from the hearing before the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG examined the applicant 's case by way of supervisory review , changed the qualification from burglary to aiding and abetting burglary under LAW and LAW and reduced the sentence to DATE and DATE imprisonment and a fine .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) , in force at the material time , required the court to undertake all lawful measures for the comprehensive , thorough and objective examination of all the circumstances of a case , and to detect incriminating and exonerating as well as both mitigating and aggravating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , during the preparation of a case for a trial a judge had to decide whether a state prosecutor should participate in the trial . If the judge decided that the prosecutor 's participation was necessary his decision was binding on the prosecutor . If the prosecutor informed the court when transferring a case for trial of his wish to sustain the charges in the court the judge could not decide otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code , if the prosecutor failed to appear , the court , after hearing participants present at the hearing , decided whether it was possible to examine the case in his absence or whether the hearing should be adjourned . That decision was not appealable to a higher court ( Article CARDINAL of the Code ) .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the prosecutor prosecuted the defendant on behalf of the ORG , took part in the examination of evidence , and gave conclusions and submissions , in particular in respect of the law and punishment to be applied to the defendant . If the prosecutor was convinced that the materials of the judicial investigation no longer supported the charges levelled against the defendant , he had to drop the charges and state his reasons for doing so to the court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court of GPE on several occasions examined the question of compatibility of functions imposed on the court according to LAW with , in particular , the court 's role in administering justice independently and impartially ( LAW ) and the adversarial nature of criminal trial ( LAW ) . ORG found the following functions imposed on the judge incompatible with those principles : to institute criminal proceedings and formulate charges under LAW ( a decision of DATE ) ; to institute criminal proceedings , in particular against a new person , and to apply a preventive measure against that person under LAW , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( vi ) , QUANTITY , CARDINAL DATE ( i ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( iv ) and QUANTITY , CARDINAL and DATE ( a decision of DATE ) ; to sustain charges after the prosecutor 's dropping the charges under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( a decision of DATE ) ; and to remit , of its own motion , a criminal case to the prosecutor for additional investigation in case of irreparable incompleteness of investigation , in particular if evidence was found to have been received illegally , or in the case of grounds for laying more serious charges or new charges against the defendant under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( i ) and ( iii ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( the decision of DATE and a ruling of DATE ) .", "ORG held that functions concerning formulation and sustaining the charges before the court should be performed by the prosecution and should not be imposed on the court . In particular , it stated in its decision of DATE that a criminal trial was based on the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of the parties , which meant first of all strict separation of the judicial function and the prosecution function , which were therefore carried out by different actors . The adversarial nature of criminal trials implied that the institution of criminal prosecution , the formulation of a charge and its sustaining before the court , were insured by competent bodies and officials , as well as victims . Imposing on the court the obligation to substitute , in CARDINAL or another form , for those bodies and persons ' prosecution activity , was incompatible with LAW and obstructed the independent and impartial administration of justice by the court as required by LAW , as well as LAW CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the court investigation started with the reading out of an indictment . ORG held that there was no indication under LAW that the indictment was to be read out by the court . Therefore , it did not follow from that provision that the court had to assume any functions concerning levelling , sustaining or proving charges against the defendant which would be incompatible with its constitutional function to administer justice on the basis of the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of the parties . In particular , the prosecutor could not refuse to read out the indictment if ordered to do so by the presiding judge ( a ruling of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the prosecutor 's participation was compulsory in jury trials ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The appeal court considered , on the basis of the materials in the case file and newly submitted materials , whether a first - instance judgment was lawful and well - founded . It was not bound by the grounds of the appeal and exercised a full review of the case ( LAW ) . Under Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code , the appeal court could decide to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment , to quash the judgment and remit the case for a new investigation or for a fresh trial , to terminate the criminal proceedings or to vary the judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code read as follows :", "Grounds for quashing or varying judgments [ on appeal ]", "\u201c The grounds for quashing or varying a judgment on appeal shall be as follows :", "( i ) prejudicial or incomplete inquest , investigation or court examination ;", "( ii ) inconsistency between the facts of the case and the conclusions reached by the court ;", "( iii ) a grave violation of procedural law ;", "( iv ) improper application of [ substantive ] law ;", "( v ) discrepancy between the sentence and the seriousness of the offence or the convicted person 's personality . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , which entered into force in DATE , the state prosecutor 's participation is mandatory in all trials in public prosecution cases .", "CARDINAL . Recommendation to Member GPE on the role of public prosecution in the criminal justice system ( Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) adopted by ORG on DATE ( during the FAC session of ORG ) notes that the public prosecution 's functions in all NORP criminal justice systems includes the decision on whether to lay charges or to abandon prosecution , the prosecution of these charges before the courts and the possibility to appeal all or certain courts ' decisions . In certain criminal systems , the public prosecution also conducts , manages or supervises the investigation , provides support and legal assistance to the victims or decides on alternative measures to prosecution ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . As to the relationship between state prosecutors and court judges , the recommendation provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . States should take appropriate measures to ensure that the legal status , the competencies and the procedural role of state prosecutors are established by law in a way that there can be no legitimate doubt about the independence and impartiality of the court judges . In particular states should guarantee that a person can not at the same time perform duties as a state prosecutor and as a court judge . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG adopted certain LAW ( DATE ) at ORG on ORG and the Treatment of Offenders ( GPE , GPE , DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) .
