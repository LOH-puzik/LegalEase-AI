The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother and her CARDINAL siblings jointly inherited CARDINAL estates \u2013 Marum CARDINAL:CARDINAL and Marum CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u2013 from their father . The ownership of the estates , consisting of several islands in the archipelago of GPE , was over DATE partly transferred to other members of the family . Disagreements arose between the family members . Some of them wished to divide the property ( klyvning ) and thus dissolve the joint ownership , but the applicant \u2019s mother opposed this idea .", "CARDINAL . On the land managed by the applicant \u2019s mother DATE which formed part of Marum DATE the mother owned a number of houses . CARDINAL of the houses were used by the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL sisters . A third house situated on the property was considered too small for the applicant \u2019s needs and it was therefore decided to enlarge it . The applicant applied for a building permit to FAC ( byggnadsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE , finding that the enlargement could not be approved as the house in question was situated too close to the shore , the committee nevertheless granted a permit for the building of a new house further away from the shore . The new house was built in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother died , leaving CARDINAL children , namely the applicant , her brother and her QUANTITY sisters . However , no distribution of the mother \u2019s estate was made before DATE . By a partial division on DATE , the new house was transferred to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE practically all the other joint owners of the CARDINAL estates brought proceedings against the applicant in ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON , requesting that she be ordered to remove the new house on PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL as it had been built without their consent , contrary to the requirements of LAW ( NORP om sam\u00e4gander\u00e4tt , DATE the LAW \u201d ) . The applicant disputed this and argued , inter alia , that it was her mother who had built the house and that accordingly it belonged to her mother \u2019s estate . Thus , she was not the proper defendant in the case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the removal judgment \u201d ) ORG declared that the applicant was to remove the house , or risk having it demolished at her expense . The court stated , inter alia , that it was the applicant who owned the house and that she had built it without the necessary consent of all the other joint owners .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL of the joint owners applied for the sale of PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL and Marum CARDINAL:CARDINAL at a public auction . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to stay those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG removal judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) . She later requested , inter alia , that no further action be taken on the case pending the outcome of division proceedings which she had begun in DATE . In these proceedings , the applicant claimed that the joint ownership of the CARDINAL estates should be dissolved and individual plots be assigned to the family members . Following several decisions taken by ORG ( GPE \u2013 \u201c the GPE \u201d ) and the courts , the case had to be referred back by ORG to the GPE for re - examination as the latter had made procedural errors . Subsequently , by a decision of DATE , the ORG allowed the creation of CARDINAL individual plots on PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL but rejected the applicant \u2019s request for the creation of an individual plot around the new house on account of ORG ruling that that house be removed . The applicant appealed against the PERSON \u2019s decision to ORG ( fastighetsdomstolen ) in GPE . As an alternative ground for staying the proceedings before ORG , the applicant pleaded that , in DATE , she had requested that ORG give a declaratory judgment on the question of ownership of the new house .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to have the removal proceedings stayed and refused her leave to appeal against ORG ruling .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG decision , several family members requested that ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten \u2013 \u201c the Office \u201d ) enforce the removal judgment . On DATE the ORG ordered the applicant to remove the house before DATE or risk having it demolished by the ORG at her own expense . By a later decision the time - limit was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at ORG request , ORG of ORG ( LOC \u2013 \u201c the Central Office \u201d ) gave its opinion in the division proceedings . It considered that the removal judgment did not prevent the creation of an individual plot around the house in issue . On the contrary , this could preserve the house and reduce the risk of adverse consequences for the applicant . Thus , ORG recommended that the applicant be assigned an individual plot .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE ORG refused the applicant a further postponement of the enforcement of the removal judgment . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG decisions and rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a stay of the enforcement . Subsequently , ORG , on DATE , decided that the house was to be demolished by a construction firm on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , requesting an immediate stay of the demolition order . She submitted that enforcement of the removal judgment should be stayed until the division proceedings or , in the alternative , until the ownership proceedings had been concluded . She also claimed that she had not been given the opportunity to remove the house herself in accordance with ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . She stated that she had started to dismantle the house but was not able to complete the work before DATE . Furthermore , the applicant requested a DATE respite in order to substantiate her appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant to complete her appeal by TIME on DATE . On DATE , that is on DATE , ORG received a letter from the applicant in which she requested an immediate stay of the demolition order . She submitted , inter alia , that enforcement of the removal judgment should be stayed until the division proceedings had been concluded or , in the alternative , until ORG had decided the question . She also requested a DATE respite to substantiate her appeal .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court \u2019s order for the completion of the appeal DATE which was sent to the applicant \u2019s address at the time in Sp\u00e5nga \u2013 was allegedly not received by the applicant until TIME of CARDINAL June , as she had been at the site of the house in issue . On TIME CARDINAL June she sent a fax to the appellate court , asking for a DATE respite for the completion of her appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , at a session held on DATE ORG had already examined the case and , by a decision delivered the following day , refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . Thus , no further stay of the enforcement proceedings was granted . It appears from the court files that the applicant called ORG on DATE and was told that the case had already been examined and that regard had been had to the contents of her letter of DATE On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal against the appellate court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The house in issue was therefore demolished by a construction firm . The applicant had claimed that her appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE prevented the enforcement of the removal judgment . However , this claim was rejected by ORG on DATE , referring to LAW , section DATE , of LAW ( ORG ) . The demolition of the house began on DATE and was concluded DATE . On DATE ORG declared that the house had been demolished and that accordingly the removal judgment had been duly enforced . However , this decision was appealed against by the other joint owners on the ground that the building material had not been removed from the property . On DATE ORG , finding in favour of the appellants , quashed ORG decision that the enforcement had been finalised and referred the matter back to the ORG . Leave to appeal against ORG decision was refused by ORG and ORG on DATE and DATE respectively . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to remove the building material from the property before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay the enforcement costs of MONEY . The applicant appealed and applied for legal aid in the matter . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid on the ground that she did not have a legitimate interest in having the case heard as the enforcement had been concluded . The applicant \u2019s further appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment in the division proceedings . It decided that PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL should be divided into CARDINAL individual plots and CARDINAL common plot . The applicant was assigned a plot where the now demolished house had been situated . In this respect , ORG thus agreed with the opinion given by ORG of the National Land Survey on DATE . ORG judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided another removal case which had been brought by the applicant and her sister in DATE . Apparently in response to the removal proceedings brought against the applicant , they had claimed that several other joint owners of PERSON CARDINAL should remove buildings they had erected on the estates . However , ORG rejected the claims , finding that the buildings had been erected DATE when the applicant and her sister , through the partial division of their mother \u2019s estate , had become joint owners of the CARDINAL properties \u2013 and that the other joint owners at the time had expressly or impliedly consented to the various building projects . Furthermore , considering that the claimants did not have a legitimate interest in having their cases heard , the court also decided that further litigation in this respect should not be paid for through public legal aid . Thus , with effect from the date of the judgment , the legal aid previously awarded was withdrawn . The applicant and her sister appealed against the judgment , submitting , inter alia , that ORG decision on legal aid should be quashed . However , on DATE ORG upheld the legal - aid decision . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal . Stating that they were unable to plead their case properly without legal aid , the applicant and her sister , by a letter to ORG DATE , withdrew most of their claims in the removal case .", "CARDINAL . By a declaratory judgment of DATE in proceedings concerning the ownership of the house in issue , the ORG agreed with the applicant \u2019s argument , submitted to the court in DATE , that the house had been erected on her mother \u2019s behalf and thus formed part of the latter \u2019s estate . Accordingly , at the time of ORG removal judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the house had not belonged to the applicant . Thus , in this respect , the court came to a different conclusion from the CARDINAL reached in the removal judgment . Following an appeal , the declaratory judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . No further appeal was lodged and the appellate court \u2019s judgment consequently acquired legal force .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , ORG granted the applicant building permits for the reconstruction of the demolished house and the construction of CARDINAL smaller outbuildings .", "CARDINAL . Domestic provisions of relevance in the present case are found in LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , ORG f\u00f6rvaltning av vissa sam\u00e4gda jordbruksfastigheter , CARDINAL DATE \u201c the DATE LAW ) , ORG , DATE the DATE LAW ) , LAW and LAW ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the building of the house in issue , the ownership of Marum DATE and CARDINAL was governed by LAW . LAW provided that a joint owner wishing to dispose of real estate must have the consent of all the other joint owners . According to ORG case - law , a joint owner who was of the opinion that another joint owner had acted in a way which conflicted with section DATE that is had not had the necessary consent \u2013 could challenge the action in court ( Nytt juridiskt arkiv ( \u201c NJA \u201d ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ; the same right to bring proceedings is afforded to a joint owner under LAW \u2013 see NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Under section CARDINAL , a joint owner who disagreed with the administration or use of real estate could request the court to appoint an administrator . Further , under section CARDINAL , a joint owner had the right to apply for a sale of real estate at public auction . The only way for another joint owner to prevent such a sale was to request division proceedings in accordance with section CARDINAL . If such proceedings had been started , the court could not decide on the question of a sale until the division proceedings had been concluded .", "CARDINAL . As the real estate in the present case is assessed , for tax purposes , as agricultural property , the provisions of the DATE Act are applicable as from DATE . The relevant provisions of that LAW are essentially the same as in LAW . Thus , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act contains a rule that corresponds to section DATE CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , LAW CARDINAL , of LAW , jointly owned real estate may , on application by a joint owner to ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , be divided into individual plots , provided that each plot created is deemed permanently suitable for its purpose in accordance with LAW , LAW . LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , provides that if a court has ordered real estate to be offered for sale at a public auction , the estate may be divided only if no sale has taken place .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement rules are laid down in LAW . According to LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , a court judgment may be enforced as soon as it has acquired legal force . LAW of the same chapter deals with objections against enforcement . Such objections may only be raised in respect of circumstances that have occurred after the delivery of the enforceable judgment , and ORG is accordingly not entitled to reconsider the judgment itself . Thus , under section ORG ) enforcement can not take place if the defendant shows that he or she has fulfilled the obligation set forth in the judgment in question . Furthermore , according to section CARDINAL ) , enforcement can not take place if the defendant claims that there are other circumstances which hinder enforcement , provided that the court finds that the objection can not be dismissed . This rule concerns substantive objections , for example an objection that property which the defendant is obliged to deliver has been conveyed or encumbered .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , section DATE , of LAW , an application for enforcement becomes void if the applicant in the enforcement proceedings grants the defendant a respite which lasts DATE from the date of the application . However , there are no rules empowering ORG to grant the defendant a respite at his or her own request . A decision by the ORG to refuse a stay of the enforcement proceedings is , in accordance with LAW , LAW , subject to appeal before a court .", "CARDINAL . When it is of utmost importance for deciding a case that a question subject to other court proceedings be determined first , the court may , under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , order a stay of proceedings ( vilandef\u00f6rklaring ) . According to the preparatory documents ( NJA II CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , the relationship between the CARDINAL court cases may be such that the decision in CARDINAL set of proceedings has a binding effect on the outcome of the other set of proceedings . An action for pecuniary compensation for damage to real property and another action concerning the ownership of the property is given as an example . The outcome of CARDINAL set of proceedings may also have evidential significance in another set of proceedings . In these situations the relevant court has to decide whether it is in the interests of all parties concerned to stay the proceedings or not ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
