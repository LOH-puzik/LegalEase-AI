AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "J.A. Carrillo Salcedo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG NORP \" ORG f\u00fcr das PERSON \" is an association of doctors who are campaigning against abortion and are seeking to bring about reform of the NORP legislation on the matter . In DATE and DATE it held CARDINAL demonstrations which were disrupted by counter - demonstrators despite the presence of a large contingent of police .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant association decided to hold a religious service at ORG ( GPE ) on DATE , after which there would be a march to the surgery of a doctor who carried out abortions . As required under LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) , it gave notice , on DATE , to the police authority for the district of ORG . The police made no objection and gave the participants permission to use the public highway . The police did , however , have to ban CARDINAL other planned demonstrations , which were announced subsequently by supporters of abortion , as these demonstrations were to be held at the same time and in the same place as the NORP demonstration .", "CARDINAL . ORG As the organisers feared that incidents might occur nonetheless , they sought - shortly before the beginning of the march - to change their plans , in consultation with the local authorities . They gave up the idea of demonstrating outside the doctor \u2019s surgery and decided instead to march to an altar erected on a hillside quite a distance away from the church and hold a religious ceremony there .", "CARDINAL . ORG The police representatives pointed out to them that the main body of the police officers had already been deployed along the route originally planned and that because of the lie of the land the new route was not suited to crowd control . They did not refuse to provide protection but stated that - irrespective of the route chosen or to be chosen - it would be impossible to prevent counter - demonstrators from throwing eggs and disrupting both the march and the religious service .", "CARDINAL . ORG During the mass , a large number of counter - demonstrators - who , it seems , had not given the notice required under LAW - assembled outside the church and were not dispersed by the police . They disrupted the march to the hillside by mingling with the marchers and shouting down their recitation of the rosary . The same thing happened at the service celebrated in the open air : CARDINAL people attempted to interrupt it using loudspeakers and threw eggs and clumps of grass at the congregation .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the end of the ceremony , when tempers had risen to the point where physical violence nearly broke out , special riot - control units - which had until then been standing by without intervening - formed a cordon between the opposing groups , and this enabled the procession to return to the church .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter to ORG , the chairman of the association described the counter - demonstrators\u2019 behaviour as \" relatively peaceful \" : on other occasions , the opponents of NORP had attacked the association \u2019s members and had assaulted policemen .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant association lodged a disciplinary complaint ( LANGUAGE - see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) alleging that the local police had failed to provide sufficient protection for the demonstration .", "ORG considered that the behaviour of the police had been irreproachable and it decided not to take any disciplinary measures against them . It referred to the difficulty of completely protecting an open - air demonstration from verbal abuse and from missiles which were not likely to cause the participants any physical harm . The ORG added that , in not intervening , the police had been prompted by the concern to avoid more serious trouble .", "CARDINAL . Plattform subsequently lodged an appeal with ORG ( Verfassungsbeschwerde - see paragraphs CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) ; in the association \u2019s submission the local authorities\u2019 failure to act had in the instant case allowed an infringement of the freedoms of assembly and religious observance , both of which were guaranteed by LAW .", "On DATE , the ORG heard evidence from several witnesses with a view to establishing the facts sufficiently clearly . In a judgment on DATE , it held that it had no jurisdiction and consequently declared the appeal inadmissible . It noted that the applicant association \u2019s complaint was clearly not directed against a \" decision \" or acts of direct administrative coercion within the meaning of LAW ( see ORG of ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Plattform did not take any ordinary criminal proceedings by lodging a complaint or by bringing a subsidiary private prosecution ( \" Subsidiaranklage \" - see paragraphs LAW of the Commission \u2019s report ) .", "ORG and the local police , however , opened investigation proceedings against a person or persons unknown for disruption of a meeting . For its part , a private organisation , the \" \u00d6sterreichische B\u00fcrgerinitiative zum PERSON \" , lodged a complaint against CARDINAL of the counter - demonstrators , a member of parliament , alleging obstruction of a religious ceremony and incitement to hatred under ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW as well as an offence against LAW . Complaints were also lodged against CARDINAL other people .", "The PERSON public prosecutor discontinued the proceedings on DATE , however , under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG One person caught in the act of throwing eggs was fined CARDINAL NORP schillings under section IX of the law enacting LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The competent police authority gave permission for a second demonstration against abortion to be held in the cathedral square in GPE on DATE . An anniversary meeting was due to be held in the square by ORG on DATE , but it had to be cancelled because notice of it had been given after the applicant association had given notice of its own meeting .", "The demonstration began at TIME and ended with an TIME of prayers inside the cathedral .", "At TIME CARDINAL people angrily shouting their opposition had passed through the CARDINAL archways which provide access to the square and gathered outside the cathedral . CARDINAL policemen formed a cordon around the NORP demonstrators to protect them from direct attack . Other trouble was caused by sympathisers of an extreme right - wing party , the ORG , who voiced their support for ORG . The police asked the association \u2019s chairman to order these people to disperse , but without success .", "In order to prevent the religious ceremony being disrupted , the police cleared the square .", "CARDINAL . ORG No proceedings were taken after these incidents , and in view of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicant association considered that a second appeal would have served no purpose ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
