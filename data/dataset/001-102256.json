In the general election held on DATE HADEP received CARDINAL votes , which represented PERCENT of the total number of votes cast . In the general election held on DATE HADEP received CARDINAL votes . However , as HADEP did not succeed in passing the required threshold of PERCENT , it was unable to be represented in ORG of GPE following these CARDINAL general elections ( see HADEP and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . In local elections held on DATE HADEP won control of CARDINAL municipalities . It had branches in CARDINAL cities and in CARDINAL of districts . In DATE HADEP became a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that , during a National Security Council ( PERSON ) meeting held on DATE , a decision had been taken to dissolve HADEP . In support of this assertion the applicants submitted to the ORG a report which , they claimed , had been adopted by ORG and which had subsequently been leaked to the press . The report , which is classified ' Secret ' , details a number of recommendations including \u201c the control and pursuit of ORG by the ORG in order to quell its activities \u201d . Following this decision ORG branches had been raided and its administrators had been subjected to physical pressure . In support of this latter argument the applicants submitted to the ORG CARDINAL reports , detailing the physical attacks on and the killings and forced disappearances of CARDINAL of ORG members , some of which have been examined by ORG ( see , inter alia , ORG and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINAL\u2013VIII ) .", "CARDINAL . On various dates criminal proceedings were brought against a number of members of ORG who were holding executive positions within the party . Some of the proceedings were suspended while some ended in convictions . Some of them were convicted of spreading \u201c separatist propaganda \u201d , in breach of section CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism Act , while others were convicted of \u201c incitement to racial hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes , races or religions \u201d , in breach of LAW . A number of others were convicted of lending assistance to the ORG in breach of LAW of LAW , for making speeches , allowing hunger strikers to use HADEP LOC and for possessing a number of documents prepared by ORG members in a law - firm owned by CARDINAL of them . Some served their prison sentences while execution of the sentences of a number of others was stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief prosecutor at ORG brought proceedings before ORG and demanded that HADEP be dissolved . The chief prosecutor argued that ORG had become a \u201c centre of illegal activities against the integrity of GPE \u201d . In support of his allegations the chief prosecutor referred to the criminal proceedings pending against members of ORG and a number of activities of its members . CARDINAL incident relied on by the chief prosecutor was that during ORG 's DATE general meeting in DATE the NORP flag had been taken down and replaced with a NORP flag .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief prosecutor asked ORG to render an interim decision banning ORG from taking part in the forthcoming DATE general and local elections . The chief prosecutor 's request was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lawyers for ORG submitted a written defence to ORG . They alleged that the chief prosecutor 's request for the dissolution of ORG had been made as a result of ORG above - mentioned decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . They further argued , inter alia , that as it was not clear what the accusations against HADEP were , it was not possible for them to make full use of their defence rights . The lawyers relied on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL to the LAW , and asked ORG to take into account the decisions and judgments of ORG in cases concerning the dissolution of a number of other political parties in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The chief prosecutor maintained in his written submissions of DATE that ORG had close ties with the ORG , and alleged that the former was being controlled by the latter . The chief prosecutor also repeated his request for HADEP to be dissolved before the elections which were to be held on DATE . This request was not accepted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , in their submissions to ORG representatives drew attention to the fact that the person who had taken down the flag was not a member of the party . They further stated that , immediately after the incident the ORG congress had publicly condemned the incident . Since then ORG had been dissociating itself from the incident and condemning it as an attack on a common symbolic value of the people of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided unanimously to dissolve ORG . The ORG based its decision on Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW and sections FAC and CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . PERSON ) . In arriving at its conclusion , ORG took account of the activities of certain leaders and members of ORG and concluded that ORG had become a centre of illegal activities which included aiding and abetting the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , in particular , that during ORG 's DATE general meeting in DATE a non - HADEP member wearing a mask had taken down the NORP flag and replaced it with a NORP flag and a poster of the then leader of the ORG , PERSON . During the same meeting slogans had also been chanted in support of the ORG and its leader . The then general secretary of HADEP Mr PERSON , who was present during the meeting on DATE , had done nothing to stop the NORP flag being taken down and had stated during his speech that \u201c the existence of the NORP in GPE , who were not allowed to speak their mother tongue , had been denied . The ORG , despite ongoing military operations , massacres and provocations , was holding its ceasefire . Nothing could be resolved with military operations or with occupation . \u201d ORG considered the taking down of the NORP flag as proof of the links between ORG and the ORG . It further considered that the references made by PERSON PERSON to GPE 's fight against terrorism as an \u201c occupation \u201d and portraying NORP as a separate nation showed that PERSON was supporting the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court referred to LAW in its judgment and stated that the rights guaranteed in that provision were not absolute and could be restricted in the circumstances listed in LAW . It also referred to LAW , and reached the following conclusion :", "\u201c Carrying out activities , by relying on democratic rights and freedoms , against the indivisible unity of the ORG with its nation is unacceptable . In such circumstances it is the duty and raison d'\u00eatre of the ORG to prevent the abuse of these rights and freedoms . Allowing a political party which supports terrorism and which is supported by terrorism to continue to exist can not be contemplated .", "In statements and speeches made on behalf of ORG and in the course of various meetings , the party 's general secretary PERSON , other party officials and chairmen and members of the party 's provincial and district branches have stated that the NORP nation was a different nation from the NORP nation ; that ORG had been enforcing a policy of pressure and oppression on the NORP nation ; that there was an ongoing war between the ORG terrorist organisation and ORG ; and that the NORP nation should take sides with the ORG in this war . Some of these activities have resulted in convictions . These persons have thus aided and harboured the ORG and its leader PERSON , whose aim is to destroy the indivisible unity of the ORG . The incidents , which are detailed in relevant parts of this judgment and which took place during the Second Congress of ORG on DATE in GPE , as well as the objects and documents found in the party headquarters and in the party 's various branches confirm the [ above - mentioned conclusion ] .", "Activities by members of ORG and the evidence [ in our possession ] clearly show the links between the respondent party and the ORG .

In its Guidelines on the prohibition and dissolution of political parties and analogous methods ( published in DATE ) ORG ) proposed the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . States should recognise that everyone has the right to associate freely in political parties . This right shall include freedom to hold political opinions and to receive and impart information without interference by a public authority and regardless of frontiers . The requirement to register political parties will not in itself be considered to be in violation of this right .", "CARDINAL . Any limitations to the exercise of the above - mentioned fundamental human rights through the activity of political parties shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of LAW and other international treaties , in normal times as well as in cases of public emergencies .", "CARDINAL . Prohibition or enforced dissolution of political parties may only be justified in the case of parties which advocate the use of violence or use violence as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order , thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution . The fact alone that a party advocates a peaceful change of the LAW should not be sufficient for its prohibition or dissolution .", "CARDINAL . A political party as a whole can not be held responsible for the individual behaviour of its members not authorised by the party within the framework of political / public and party activities .", "CARDINAL . The prohibition or dissolution of political parties as a particularly far - reaching measure should be used with utmost restraint . Before asking the competent judicial body to prohibit or dissolve a party , governments or other state organs should assess , having regard to the situation of the country concerned , whether the party really represents a danger to the free and democratic political order or to the rights of individuals and whether other , less radical measures could prevent the said danger .", "CARDINAL . Legal measures directed to the prohibition or legally enforced dissolution of political parties shall be a consequence of a judicial finding of unconstitutionality and shall be deemed as of an exceptional nature and governed by the principle of proportionality . Any such measure must be based on sufficient evidence that the party itself and not only individual members pursue political objectives using or preparing to use unconstitutional means .", "CARDINAL . The prohibition or dissolution of a political party should be decided by the LAW court or other appropriate judicial body in a procedure offering all guarantees of due process , openness and a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

[ T]he ORG believes that in exceptional cases , it may be legitimate for a party to be banned if its existence threatens the democratic order of the country .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion and in the light of the foregoing , the ORG calls on the governments of member states to comply with the following principles :", "i. political pluralism is one of the fundamental principles of every democratic regime ;", "ii . restrictions on or dissolution of political parties should be regarded as exceptional measures to be applied only in cases where the party concerned uses violence or threatens civil peace and the democratic constitutional order of the country ;", "iii . as far as possible , less radical measures than dissolution should be used ;", "iv . a party can not be held responsible for the action taken by its members if such action is contrary to its statute or activities ;", "v. a political party should be banned or dissolved only as a last resort , in conformity with the constitutional order of the country , and in accordance with the procedures which provide all the necessary guarantees to a fair trial ;", "vi . the legal system in each member state should include specific provisions to ensure that measures restricting parties can not be used in an arbitrary manner by the political authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting on a request from ORG of ORG of ORG PACE ) asking it \u201c to review the constitutional and legal provisions which are relevant to the prohibition of political parties in GPE \u201d , adopted the \u201c Opinion on ORG to the Prohibition of Political Parties in GPE \u201d . The relevant parts of the Opinion are as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . ORG concludes that , when compared to the common NORP practice , the situation in GPE differs in QUANTITY important respects :", "CARDINAL . There is a long list of substantive criteria applicable to the constitutionality of political parties , as laid down in DATE ( CARDINAL ) and the PERSON on political parties , which go beyond the criteria recognised as legitimate by the ECtHR and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP There is a procedure for initiating decisions on party prohibition or dissolution which makes this initiative more arbitrary and less subject to democratic control , than in other NORP countries .", "CARDINAL . There is a tradition for regularly applying the rules on party closure to an extent that has no parallel in any other NORP country , and which demonstrates that this is not in effect regarded as an extraordinary measure , but as a structural and operative part of the constitution .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG is of the opinion that the provisions in LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and the relevant provisions of the LAW on political parties together form a system which as a whole is incompatible with LAW ORG as interpreted by the ECtHR and the criteria adopted in DATE by ORG and since endorsed by ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The basic problem with the present NORP rules on party closure is that the general threshold is too low , both for initiating procedures for and for prohibiting or dissolving parties . This is in itself in abstracto deviating from common NORP democratic standards , and it leads too easily to action that will be in breach of the ORG , as demonstrated in the many NORP cases before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Because the substantial and procedural threshold for applying the NORP rules on party prohibition or dissolution is so low , what should be an exceptional measure functions in fact as a regular one . This reduces the arena for democratic politics and widens the scope for constitutional adjudication on political issues . The scope of democratic politics is further eroded by the constitutional shielding of the first CARDINAL articles of the LAW , in such a way as to prevent the emergence of political programmes that question the principles laid down at the origin of GPE , even if done in a peaceful and democratic manner .", "CARDINAL . ORG is of the opinion that within democratic LOC these strict limitations on the legitimate arena for democratic politics are particular to the NORP constitutional system , and difficult to reconcile with basic NORP traditions for constitutional democracy .", "CARDINAL . ORG recognises and welcomes the fact that in DATE the rules on party prohibition in GPE have been changed in such a way as to raise the threshold for dissolution . In the DATE reform , LAW was amended to include the qualification that for a party to be in conflict with the criteria of LAW ( CARDINAL ) the party must be a ' centre ' for such activities . At the same time , the requirement of a CARDINAL majority of ORG for dissolving a political party was introduced into LAW . This has shown itself to be an important reform , which was decisive for the outcome of the AK party case . While laudable , these reforms have not been sufficient to fully bridge the gap between the NORP rules and the standards of the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG is of the opinion that , although the DATE revision was an important step in the right direction , it is still not sufficient to raise the general level of party protection in GPE to that of the ORG and the NORP common democratic standards . Further reform is necessary in order to achieve this , both on the substantive and the procedural side .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
