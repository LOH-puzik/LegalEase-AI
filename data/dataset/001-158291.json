The third applicant \u2013 a child \u2013 was born out of wedlock in DATE . The second applicant does not live with the child and his mother . According to the applicants , the child nevertheless recognises the second applicant as his father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S.G. lodged an action with FAC seeking to establish his paternity of the third applicant , submitting that he was the biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE applicant officially acknowledged his paternity of the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE adopted a judgment in which it dismissed PERSON \u2019s claims in full . The first applicant was the respondent and the second applicant was a third party in the civil proceedings . The court held the corresponding provision of LAW did not give NORP the standing to dispute in court a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity .", "CARDINAL . S.G. appealed to ORG and DATE on DATE requested the same court to order genetic ( DNA ) testing in order to establish whether the second applicant or PERSON was the biological father of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG held a hearing and adopted a decision to order the genetic testing of LOC , the second applicant and the third applicant in order to verify the child \u2019s biological descent . According to the court , it was necessary to order genetic testing because the second applicant had acknowledged paternity of the child only after PERSON had already lodged the action with the court . For that reason it was held that LOC had standing to bring a claim to determine paternity . The decision to order genetic testing was not subject to appeal in accordance with the provisions of LAW . On DATE a copy of the record of the hearing was sent to the applicant \u2019s representative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , relying on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , submitted a request to the President of ORG of the ORG of ORG asking him to lodge a protest against the order of ORG . They claimed , inter alia , that in giving the order for genetic testing ORG had failed to take into consideration the interests of the child and the second applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of the ORG of ORG lodged a protest , citing several violations of procedural and substantive law , notably that : the contested order had been issued prior to the examination on the merits of the civil case ; the decision had not been prepared in accordance with the procedure set out by LAW ; and the court had not examined whether the medical laboratory was authorised to carry out such tests . In particular , the wording of the protest noted that at the time of the examination of the case the child \u2019s paternity had been voluntarily acknowledged , whereas the claimant \u2013 S.G. \u2013 had not challenged the paternity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG , relying on section CARDINAL of LAW , dismissed the protest . The ORG considered that the claim submitted by ORG had not been intended to challenge the paternity of the second applicant ; rather , it considered that the claim had been submitted in order to determine PERSON paternity . The ORG argued that the second applicant had recognised his paternity only after PERSON had lodged his action and that therefore , the question of LOC \u2019s standing would only fall to be examined when the case was examined on the merits . The ORG also disagreed that procedural violations such as those alleged in the protest were decisive for the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( as worded at the material time ) provided that a protest against a court judgment and/or decision that had taken effect might be submitted to the ORG of ORG by the President of ORG , by the President of ORG of the ORG of ORG or by ORG , provided that DATE had passed since the ruling took effect .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that admissible grounds for submitting a protest regarding a ruling ( a judgment or decision ) that has taken effect are : substantive breaches of material or procedural legal provisions in cases which have been adjudicated only by a first - instance court ( provided that no appeal against the ruling has been lodged by the parties to the case in accordance with the law , for reasons beyond their control ) , or the rights of ORG or municipal institutions or persons who were not parties to the case have been affected by the ruling .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL sets out the jurisdiction of the ORG when reviewing an ancillary complaint . It follows from the domestic courts\u2019 practice that the ORG has the same jurisdiction when reviewing a protest . In particular , the ORG may adopt the following decisions : CARDINAL ) to uphold the lower court \u2019s decision and dismiss the appeal or protest ; CARDINAL ) to quash the decision , in whole or in part , and remit it to the lower court for fresh examination ; CARDINAL ) to quash the decision , in whole or in part , and decide the question on the merits ; CARDINAL ) to amend the decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
