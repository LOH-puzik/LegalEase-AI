The applicant , therefore , assuming that the overall amount of the pecuniary gain for which the seizure order had been made corresponded to the sum of the CARDINAL amounts noted ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) , submitted a detailed estimate value of each item of the restrained property based on the information from a publicly available Internet portal on the market values of real properties in GPE . According to this estimate , the total value of the seized property corresponded to some ORG CARDINAL . The applicant thus contended that there was a gross disproportionality between the alleged pecuniary gain obtained by the commission of the offences referred to in the indictment and the value of the seized property , which imposed on him an excessive individual burden .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as the appeal court , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal by noting the following :", "\u201c The same complaints had been made against the decision of DATE ... and then it was answered to the appellant that the principle of proportionality had not been breached ... By a speculative assessment of the value of the real properties listed in the appeal , the appellant did not manage to put into doubt the findings of the first - instance court .", "The appellant \u2019s argument that it is not clear from the impugned decision which amount of the pecuniary gain he has allegedly obtained is unfounded .", "The first - instance court stated in the impugned decision that the accused had obtained a pecuniary gain in the amount of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , as referred to in count CARDINAL of the indictment , but it failed to cite the amount referred to in count CARDINAL of the indictment of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , which is as such , in view of the status of the case , uncontested .
