The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE am GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG issued an arrest warrant against the applicant as there was a strong suspicion that he had aided the commission of crimes , worth MONEY , of aggravated fraudulent conversion , corruption , corruption in commercial practice and aggravated tax evasion through an elaborate system of bribes and fictitious invoices in connection with international business undertakings by a company . The arrest warrant was based on the risk of his absconding owing to the possible heavy sentence for the offences in question . He was also married to the co - accused , who , like him , was a national of GPE , and he did not have a legal residence or other significant ties to GPE . There was also a risk of collusion . On DATE , he was arrested and ORG ordered his detention on remand . On DATE ORG included additional charges in the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am GPE prosecution authorities brought criminal proceedings against the applicant , charging him with CARDINAL counts of aiding aggravated fraudulent conversion , CARDINAL count of aiding aggravated corruption and CARDINAL counts of aiding aggravated tax evasion . On DATE ORG sent the translation of the CARDINAL indictment to the applicant . On DATE he responded to the indictment and asked the court not to open the main proceedings . On DATE the prosecution authorities asked ORG to amend the proceedings against the applicant , based on the results of the investigation obtained after the criminal proceedings had been brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to open the main proceedings , which commenced on DATE . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts each of aiding fraudulent conversion and tax evasion and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The conviction has not yet become final , with appeals lodged by both the applicant and the prosecution authorities still pending at the time the ORG examined the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG decided to set aside the arrest warrant of DATE , which since the outset had been the basis for the applicant \u2019s continuous detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant challenged the lawfulness of his remand detention before the GPE am ORG and the GPE am ORG without success . Following a request by the prosecution authorities , the GPE am ORG on DATE ordered the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s remand detention . It also ordered that the case file be re - submitted to it by DATE at the latest for the next periodic review . Until that time , it transferred the competency for further reviews to the court having jurisdiction according to the general provisions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It considered that there was a risk that the applicant might abscond and that continued detention on remand was not disproportionate in light of the sentence which he risked incurring if found guilty . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against that decision . The court refused to accept it for adjudication , without providing reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a decision which was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant initiated another set of review proceedings before ORG and lodged a complaint of bias against the competent judge . The complaint was eventually rejected in accordance with the proceedings prescribed by law , as were the remedies pursued by the applicant . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed an application from the applicant to set aside the detention order as it had become devoid of purpose ( prozessual \u00fcberholt ) because the GPE am ORG had been seized with a review of the applicant \u2019s detention under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution authorities submitted a statement and the case file to the GPE am ORG , requesting the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand in accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the detention order be set aside . He also requested that ORG decide on his objection and an appeal to be heard , lodged on DATE against ORG decision of DATE , prior to the expiry of the timelimit given to him to respond to the prosecution authorities\u2019 submission . On DATE ORG dismissed the objection and the appeal to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the names of the judges called to decide on the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention were disclosed to the applicant , following his request of DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint of bias against CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges concerned , arguing that they had repeatedly contacted the wrong authorities \u2013 either the GPE am ORG or ORG , rather than the prosecution authorities \u2013 to request the case file and had taken DATE to decide on his objection and appeal to be heard . That had amounted to an arbitrary handling of his case and the judges involved could not decide on the continuation of his detention with the necessary impartiality . The judges gave their statements on DATE and DATE . The applicant then requested additional statements from them , which was not deemed to be necessary by ORG on DATE . DATE the applicant lodged another complaint about bias , arguing that their statements in response to his first such complaint could not restore his confidence in their impartiality . The judges concerned again gave statements and the applicant \u2019s counsel was given the opportunity to respond . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s first complaint of bias as ill - founded , finding that there were no indications that the judges concerned were partial , even assuming that they had made a procedural mistake in connection with requesting the case file , leading to a delay in deciding on his objection and appeal to be heard . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection against that decision . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s second complaint of bias as ill - founded , also addressing his objection in its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the GPE am ORG about the current state of the criminal proceedings and what developments there had been . ORG was informed by the prosecution authorities that the criminal proceedings had been brought before ORG , rather than the GPE am ORG , so ORG made a similar enquiry to the court in question on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer sent to ORG CARDINAL comprehensive submissions which he had made in the main proceedings before ORG and asked the appeal court to take them into account when deciding on the continuation of the applicant \u2019s remand detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL applications with ORG , asking it to take a decision in the pending review proceedings without delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged another constitutional complaint with ORG , alleging that the absence of a decision by ORG in the pending detention review proceedings had violated his right to liberty and security . On DATE ORG refused to accept the complaint for adjudication without providing reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with a decision by the GPE am ORG , taken on DATE and issued on CARDINAL DATE , ordering the continuation of his detention on remand . It found that the risk of his absconding continued to exist . It further considered that in the light of , inter alia , the amount of evidence to be examined , the requests for legal assistance sent to several countries , and the scope and complexity of the case , there was no indication of undue delay in the conduct of the criminal proceedings , with the trial being scheduled to commence in DATE . The applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand was , therefore , proportionate . The court did not address the duration of the review proceedings nor provide any reasons for it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
