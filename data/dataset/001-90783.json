The plaintiff argued that he had not received adequate medical care in detention and that he had been detained in overcrowded cells in poor sanitary conditions .", "ORG quashed the second - instance judgment in which the applicant 's claim had been dismissed . ORG held that the case should have been examined under LAW , in conjunction with LAW of LAW , and that it was the respondent who had the burden of proving that the conditions of detention had been in compliance with the statutory standards and that the plaintiff 's personal rights had not been infringed . The case was remitted to the appeal court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the case under LAW in conjunction with LAW , as interpreted by ORG . The appeal court reiterated that overcrowding coupled with inadequate living and sanitary conditions in a detention facility could give rise to degrading treatment in breach of a detainee 's personal rights . The court condemned the practice of maintaining high rates of occupation in detention facilities throughout the country and stressed that the minimum standard of QUANTITY per person was to be reduced only in exceptional circumstances and for a short period of time . On the other hand , ORG observed that in the light of ORG established case - law , a trial court did not have a duty to award compensation for each personal right 's infringement . CARDINAL of the main criteria in assessing whether or not to award compensation for a breach of a personal right was the degree of fault on the part of a respondent party . The court held that in relation to the overcrowding , no fault could be attributed to the management of a particular detention facility since the management were not in a position to refuse new admissions even when the average capacity of a detention facility had already been exceeded . Considering the large scale of the problem in the country and the fact that the competent authorities had not acted with a particular intent to humiliate the plaintiff or in bad faith , the appeal court found that awarding compensation for a breach of personal rights on account of overcrowding and poor conditions of detention would contradict the universal sense of justice . Ultimately , the case was dismissed .", "CARDINAL .

The court observed that the protection of personal rights offered by LAW was conditional on CARDINAL elements : firstly , there must have been an infringement or a risk of infringement of the right protected ; secondly , the infringement must have resulted from an unlawful act or omission . It was reiterated that an act or omission was not unlawful , even though it might breach personal rights , as long as it was based on a valid legal provision . The court further noted that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the infringement or the risk of infringement while the respondent had the burden of proving that his acts or omissions were not unlawful . ORG held that detaining the plaintiff in conditions below the minimum standard established by LAW was not unlawful , as it was regulated by the DATE Ordinance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made an application under LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , to ORG , asking for the DATE Ordinance to be declared unconstitutional .

On DATE a certain PERSON , who was at the time in prison , made a constitutional complaint ( skarga konstytucyjna ) under LAW , read in conjunction with LAW of the LAW , asking for LAW to be declared unconstitutional . He alleged that the impugned provision infringed , inter alia , the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment as derived from ORG CARDINAL of the LAW . He challenged LAW in particular in so far as it allowed for the placement of detainees for an indefinite period of time in cells below the statutory size .", "On DATE ORG held , inter alia , that the impugned LAW was in breach of LAW torture or cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment ) , LAW ( right of a detainee to be treated in a humane manner ) and LAW ( the principle of the rule of law ) of the LAW . The court stressed that the provision lacked clarity and precision , which allowed for a very broad interpretation .", "ORG found that , in effect , the provision in question allowed for an indefinite and arbitrary placement of detainees in cells below the statutory size of QUANTITY per person , thus causing chronic overcrowding in NORP prisons and exposing detainees to the risk of inhuman treatment . The court observed that the overcrowding of detention facilities had to be treated as a serious problem , posing a permanent threat to rehabilitation of prisoners . Moreover , in the court 's view , the overcrowding in itself could be qualified as inhuman and degrading treatment . If combined with additional aggravating circumstances , it may even be considered as torture . In that connection the court noted that already the minimum statutory standards of QUANTITY per person was one of the lowest ones in LOC .", "ORG further stressed that the provision in question was meant to be applied only in particularly justified cases , for example an engineering or building disaster in prison . Such a provision should not leave any doubt as to the definition of those permissible circumstances , the minimum size of the cell and maximum time when the new standards would apply . It should also lay down clear principles on how many times a detainee could be placed in conditions below the standard requirements and the precise procedural rules to be followed in such cases . Conversely , in practice LAW gave a wide discretion to prison governors to decide what constituted \u201c particularly justified circumstances \u201d and in consequence sanctioned the permanent state of overcrowding in detention facilities . It allowed for the placement of detainees in a cell where the area was below the statutory size for an indefinite period of time and it did not set a minimum permissible area .", "ORG , taking into consideration \u201c the permanent overcrowding of the NORP detention facilities \u201d , ruled that the unconstitutional LAW should lose its binding force within DATE from the date of the publication of the judgment . ORG justified the delayed entry into force of its judgment by the need to undertake a series of actions to reorganise the whole penitentiary system in GPE , in order to , ultimately , eliminate the problem of overcrowding . It was also noted that , in parallel , a reform of criminal policy was desired with the aim of achieving a wider implementation of preventive measures other than deprivation of liberty . The court observed that an immediate entry into force of its judgment would only aggravate the already existing pathological situation where , because of the lack of room in NORP prisons , many convicted persons could not serve their prison sentences . At the time when the judgment was being passed , the problem concerned CARDINAL persons .", "In addition , ORG under the principle of the so - called \u201c right of privilege \u201d ( przywilej korzy\u015bci ) ordered an individual measure , namely that with regard to the author of the constitutional complaint the judgment should enter into force immediately after its publication . The right of privilege is relied on by ORG in the event the proceedings instituted by an individual terminate with a judgment with a delayed entry into force . This principle aims at rewarding the individual who brought the first constitutional complaint concerning a particular matter for his or her proactive attitude .", "As regards the context of the case , all the ORG authorities involved in the proceedings before ORG , namely ORG , the ORG and the Speaker of the PERSON , acknowledged the existence of the overcrowding in the NORP detention facilities . ORG , in his pleadings of DATE , submitted that the problem of overcrowding in NORP detention facilities had continually existed since DATE , arising from the flawed interpretation of the impugned provision by domestic courts and penitentiary authorities . He also pointed out that , with the rate of overcrowding peaking at PERCENT on DATE , the prison authorities estimated that CARDINAL new places were needed in order to secure to detainees the statutory space of QUANTITY per person .", "CARDINAL .
