THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in GPE . The second applicant is also a NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in GPE . They are brother and sister . Before the ORG they are represented by PERSON , legal officer for ORG , in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG , as Agent for ORG .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Events of DATE", "The applicants\u2019 brother , PERSON , was shot dead outside the family home , GPE , PERSON , by officers of the Devon and ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . PERSON is located in an isolated and rural location .", "On DATE , PERSON went to his local police station and voluntarily handed in a number of legally held weapons to Inspector PERSON . The Inspector was concerned about the state of PERSON mental health and , on DATE , he attended PERSON and seized more weapons . On DATE , PERSON asked for the return of some of the weapons . However , Inspector PERSON refused until such time as Mr Hay could produce a certificate as to the state of his mental health .", "On DATE , ORG doctor , PERSON , had received a message from PERSON neighbour saying that PERSON was displaying irrational behaviour whilst in possession of a weapon . The neighbour was concerned as to the state of PERSON mental health .", "On DATE , there were CARDINAL incidents involving firearms . Firstly , at QUANTITY , Mr Hay fired a gun CARDINAL times into a sheep trailer at a nearby farm in the presence of the farmer \u2019s wife . The woman was very frightened and stated that PERSON was in an emotional state and had said to her after loading the gun , \u201c This is what I will do to the police if they come near me \u201d . Later , at TIME , Mr Hay went into the local public house armed with a gun with a bayonet attached and a hand gun . He again displayed irrational behaviour , and fired one of the guns several times into the open fireplace in front of the barmaid . He then reloaded the gun in her presence . The barmaid telephoned the police . A neighbour had already telephoned . A further shot was fired in the street outside . Mr Hay then returned to GPE where he had lunch with his mother .", "At TIME the ORG at ORG had received the call from the neighbour of the public house . Police vehicles were ordered to the scene , a police surveillance helicopter took off QUANTITY and the instructions to the helicopter crew were to keep PERSON in view until there could be actual physical containment by a firearms team . A firearms unit was notified . By chance , CARDINAL firearms officers happened to be on a training exercise and so they were used , rather than following the standard procedure .", "The ORG had a pre - arranged command and control structure for incidents of this kind , dividing the command into Gold , Silver and Bronze . Gold was in overall command , determined strategy and had overall responsibility for the provision of intelligence , resources and logistics . The Gold Commander was of senior rank and ORG was based in the operations room at police headquarters . Silver Commander was the officer responsible for the tactical control of an incident at the scene . He was supported by ORG which was based at the nearest police station to the incident for communications purposes . ORG was the specialist task or sector commander who had the role of implementing the tactics determined by the Silver Commander .", "Following the report of shots being fired , this structure was put into place . At CARDINAL p.m. , PERSON temporarily assumed the position of Silver Commander , although it was intended that he would later assume the role of negotiator , and that Superintendent PERSON would replace him as Silver Commander . FAC took the role of ORG . ORG was set up in the operations room at police headquarters under the command of Assistant Chief PERSON . Chief Inspector ORG , as officer in charge of ORG , would assume the role of ORG . At TIME authorised the deployment of armed police officers . This command structure was communicated to everyone at TIME", "The delay in setting up this structure was due to the fact that it was not possible to establish which senior officers were on duty or to contact them . In particular , Superintendent PERSON chose to drive to the incident in his private car , which did not have a radio installed , despite the fact that fully equipped police vehicles were available . This meant that he was out of communication for a period of TIME , and was therefore not fully aware of the changes in the situation .", "The Forward Control Point was not established , as it should have been , by either Superintendents PERSON or GPE , although the firearms team had met at the GPE public house and appeared to be treating the pub as the Forward ORG .", "In a conversation at TIME between FAC , ORG , and another officer , it was stated that negotiators should be contacted . There were difficulties in contacting them , as they did not have any means of emergency communication , and they did not arrive or play any useful role before the death of ORG . PERSON was not able to act as negotiator whilst he was still waiting for Superintendent PERSON to replace him as Silver Commander .", "At TIME the helicopter crew reported that PERSON was waving and pointing a rifle in their direction , and they withdrew to a safe distance . They observed that he had CARDINAL rifles in a stand position near his car . They could not keep him under constant surveillance . At TIME the operations room became aware of the earlier firearms incident at ORG .", "At TIME , Mr Hay was seen loading items into his car outside the manor house . He was now wearing a bullet - proof vest . At TIME the helicopter observed that it was his mother driving the car away from GPE . The helicopter also observed PERSON as he set up a PERSON gun in the driveway of the house , although , it was noted , that the gun did not have a magazine attached to it . There appeared to be ammunition boxes positioned near the PERSON gun and also black bin liners which it was considered could possibly contain explosives . Attempts were made to get information about Mr Hay from his mother for negotiation purposes . She was interviewed by a policeman , but no use was made of her knowledge of either her son \u2019s mental state or the layout of the house , as by the time all the information was gathered the incident was over .", "At TIME Superintendent PERSON radioed that he was \u201c at X - ray \u201d ( i.e. the Forward Control point at FAC ) ; he was in fact at FAC , QUANTITY from GPE . PERSON and the firearms team were at FAC . Chief Inspector PERSON briefed the firearms team and in particular reminded them of their personal liability under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . He also reminded the team about the possible benefits of trying to engage an armed suspect in conversation as part of the containment process . Presuming that Superintendent PERSON would arrive imminently , PERSON left for GPE in order to fulfil his negotiating role , but did not actually proceed to the manor itself , remaining at the nearby crossroads to await the completion of the armed containment . Superintendent PERSON was still not in proper communication at TIME when he made several calls from a private house , and thus was never in control of the situation . In fact Superintendent Mechan did not take any effective action as Silver Commander because his arrival to take command was overtaken by events .", "At TIME the pilot of the helicopter observed PERSON lying on the lawn in front of the house , and was actually of the opinion that he had shot himself , confusing a shadow around him for blood . No attempt was made to detain him at this time , although the officer operating a video camera in the helicopter subsequently observed at the inquest that , as at this point the man was seated on the ground , it would have been a very good opportunity to move in and physically detain him . PERSON then got up , and was seen to point a weapon at the helicopter , at which point it moved away . PERSON was also seen by the helicopter to run up and down the lawn and imitate an aeroplane .", "The armed officers made their way to the house and placed themselves around the house . Individual officers decided where to position themselves . Once in position , officers realised that there were particular escape routes for ORG which they sought to close off . CARDINAL of the officers were placed in positions with poor cover . The aim was to disarm Mr Hay and to contain him in order to prevent him from escaping into the countryside and thereby becoming a danger to the public .", "At TIME ORG was in place around the house . It appears that the team were unaware of the personal circumstances of PERSON and unaware who owned the property . They were readily identifiable as police with caps with \u2018 Police\u2019 written on them . PERSON was not at the manor itself and , due to the fact that events developed rapidly , did not arrive to commence any negotiations . When the firearms team arrived PERSON was still seen to be lying on the ground . Police officers were positioned fairly close to PERSON to prevent access to the building and to be closer to the PERSON gun with a view to preventing access to it . Mr Hay jumped up and started shouting , swearing and waving the gun in his hand . A police dog was sent towards him to attempt to restrain him and disarm him . Mr Hay \u2019s own dog distracted the attention of the police dog . CARDINAL of the firearms team shouted \u201c Armed Police . Stand still \u201d . CARDINAL of the team tried to talk to PERSON asking him to comply with their directions and repeatedly to put the gun down . PERSON did not respond to any of the communications . A number of verbal challenges were made by the police from the time Mr Hay got up to the time he was shot . PERSON repeatedly pointed at his forehead and shouted \u201c Do it , go on , what are you waiting for ? \u201d", "At TIME , Chief Inspector PERSON perceived that his officers were in danger and ordered a second police dog to be sent towards PERSON . PERSON ran screaming and shouting towards the dog and fired CARDINAL times at the dog with a hand gun and fatally injured the dog . Mr Hay then raised his weapon towards QUANTITY police officers , and at that point CARDINAL officers opened fire . Due to the fact that he was wearing body armour , CARDINAL shot was aimed at the top of his chest near the throat . PERSON was killed instantaneously by that bullet which hit his forehead . The officer who fired the fatal shot was QUANTITY away and used a self - loading rifle . There were other wounds which would not have been fatal by themselves . Armed containment , if it was completely achieved , was only achieved TIME before Mr Hay was shot . Medical evidence at the subsequent inquest concluded that no drugs were detected in Mr Hay \u2019s body which might have influenced his behaviour , and the alcohol levels were unlikely to have had a noticeable effect on his behaviour . A firearms expert indicated that the fatal bullet hit the forehead because Mr Hay had started to fall forward due to the impact of CARDINAL of the bullets which had struck his back and that all CARDINAL shots were fired in a short period of time .", "The police investigation into the killing of Mr Hay", "On DATE of the shooting ORG ( ORG ) was asked by the Chief Constable of GPE and GPE \u201c to investigate the incidents culminating in the death of PERSON and all attendant circumstances \u201d . The ORG appointed an investigating officer , Mr PERSON , Assistant Chief Constable of GPE and GPE , to undertake this task .", "The report of the ORG written by Mr PERSON dated DATE contained a number of criticisms of the procedure on DATE . In particular , the report noted :", "a. The failure to establish a \u201c Forward Control Point \u201d .", "The failure to collect information about the individual concerned although \u201c there was both the time and the means by which considerable pertinent information could have been collected \u201d , and a failure to secure the prompt attendance of trained negotiators .", "A failure to get a plan of the layout of the area , and the fact that there was no organised positioning of officers , who were allowed to position themselves , leaving CARDINAL of them exposed . \u201c I find it unacceptable that a senior officer in charge of a firearms operation should only be aware that his officers were exposed TIME at a team debrief . \u201d", "\u201c A level of confusion which should not exist in this type of police operation . \u2026 Regardless of the contribution to this confusion by occasional poor radio reception and the individual errors of operations room staff , the main reason rests with ORG \u2019s failure to take the initial basic step of ascertaining whether or not a Forward ORG existed and its location . The situation was exacerbated by his failure to avail himself of radio communications with the consequence that he travelled to an incident which he knew he was to command completely unaware of developments and without any means of providing any command input \u201d .", "\u201c I am satisfied that [ ORG ] did not engage in adequate planning prior to the deployment of authorised firearms officers at FAC , neither did he direct any other officer to do so and that this failure amounts to a neglect of duty and that there is sufficient evidence that he committed this offence ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . \u2026 Indeed it could well be suggested that ORG \u2019s failure displayed a disregard for the safety of his men and even indirectly the suspect ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "\u201c The failure to call out divisional officers is an important issue as it has been suggested that a larger number of armed officers than was available at ORG may have allowed for a more distant armed containment of Hay . \u201d", "The applicants submitted that the positioning of armed officers in such close proximity to Mr Hay was unnecessary and directly caused the confrontation which ultimately led to his death ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However the report concluded at paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u201c I am of the opinion that given the events at FAC on DATE , the course of action taken by ORG was the only available option . It was essential that < Mr Hay > be contained at the LOC and the geography of the immediate vicinity meant that the officers conducting the containment must inevitably assume positions closer to < Mr Hay > than might otherwise be desirable . I also acknowledge that the position in respect of the limited availability of the helicopter lent an urgency which had to be acknowledged .", "I have already expressed the view that ORG \u2019s failures amount to an offence against discipline and that there is sufficient available evidence to prove them . These are serious failures and whilst < Mr Hay \u2019s > death can not be attributed to them that does not lessen their degree of importance . \u201d", "Disciplinary proceedings", "On DATE Chief Inspector PERSON was served with papers under LAW making allegations that as the tactical firearms officer he failed to ensure that adequate planning was carried out prior to the deployment of authorised firearms officers involved in the incident .", "On DATE , the full ORG report was presented to the Chief Constable of Devon and ORG , which recommended that disciplinary proceedings were brought against both Chief Inspector GPE and Superintendent PERSON for neglect of duty , although he did not recommend any criminal proceedings . Specifically , it was alleged that ORG had :", "\u201c Failed to plan properly the armed containment of GPE and in particular:-", "a. Failed to take into account the local geography of the area ;", "Failed to consider the available knowledge in respect of PERSON with respect to its relevance to an armed containment ;", "Failed to liase properly with ORG . \u201d", "Following the inquest verdict on DATE , there was some correspondence between the Chief Constable and the ORG . In the view of the Chief Constable , there should not have been any disciplinary charges against either of the CARDINAL officers concerned . On DATE he stated the following :", "\u201c [ G]iven the failures of Superintendent PERSON in this operation it is difficult to criticise Chief Inspector PERSON . This point becomes even more poignant when it is unlikely , in my view , that Superintendent PERSON will return from sick leave and face discipline for this neglect . \u201d", "On DATE the ORG wrote back invoking its statutory powers to recommend that the charge of neglect be brought against Chief Inspector PERSON . The letter identified CARDINAL areas of concern , all of which were explained in detail in the ORG report :", "a want of initial planning and intelligence ;", "a failure to acquire the information necessary for containment of the deceased ;", "an unauthorised change of role during the operation ; and", "a failure to consult the deceased \u2019s mother before deploying the firearms team .", "On DATE , the first applicant wrote to the ORG asking that the family be represented at the disciplinary hearing . This application was refused by PERSON , the Deputy Chief Constable of GPE and GPE , on the basis that they had not lodged a formal complaint . The first applicant therefore attempted to lodge a complaint to remedy this situation .", "On DATE , DATE before the scheduled hearing , the Chief Constable accepted the advice of police doctors that there was a likelihood that Superintendent Mechan \u2019s appearance before the disciplinary hearing would hasten his complete mental breakdown and permitted the Superintendent , who had been on sick leave since the shooting , to retire due to ill - health . According to the medical evidence , the Superintendent was suffering from a mental illness , and had been at the time of the incident . The disciplinary charges against him were therefore withdrawn .", "On DATE , Mr Portlock , formally requested the ORG not to pursue the charges against his officers . That request was refused . On DATE , the Deputy Chief Constable refused to allow the first applicant to lodge a further complaint of police negligence .", "In the light of the withdrawal of the charges against Superintendent Mechan , the Chief Constable amended the charges against Chief Inspector PERSON . At the disciplinary hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the presiding Chief Constable of GPE , PERSON , granted the Chief Inspector \u2019s application to dismiss the proceedings as an abuse of process , on the grounds that the late notice of the amended charges , combined with the delay in the disciplinary hearing ( DATE after the incident ) , had prejudiced his defence . A press release from the ORG DATE described the proceedings as \u201c unnecessary and wholly inappropriate given the lack of evidence to support the charge \u201d .", "The ORG and the applicants separately applied for judicial review of the decision of Mr Girven to dismiss the charges against Mr ORG and the applicant sought review of CARDINAL other matters , including the decision of the Chief Constable to allow Superintendent PERSON to retire . On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON held that the decision to allow the Superintendent to retire had not been properly taken , but that he would not interfere with it . He further held that Mr GPE had been wrong in law to dismiss the charges against Chief Inspector PERSON , as there had not been any prejudice arising out of the delays . He made an order of mandamus directing the Chief Constable to hear the charges against the Chief Inspector on their substantive merits .", "The disciplinary proceedings against Chief Inspector PERSON were eventually heard in DATE , after a delay caused by the challenges to the inquest proceedings , and in DATE ORG was cleared of neglect of duty ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
