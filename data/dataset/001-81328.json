The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and are resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the province of GPE ( GPE ) pronounced the adoption of the second applicant , then aged DATE and previously declared abandoned , by the first applicant . The judge listed the various stages of the adoption procedure which had been completed in accordance with the legal conditions . By the judgment the child acquired the status of daughter of the first applicant , ceased to belong to her blood family and henceforth bore the forenames and names PERSON In accordance with the legal conditions and the agreement drawn up between the technical secretariat for adoptions in GPE and ORG , the latter was declared responsible for monitoring the child and , if necessary , for the legalisation of the adoption in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of ORG of the province of PERSON was declared enforceable \u2013 according to the certificate issued by that court on DATE and entered in the civil status register of AyacuchoHuamanga .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant , who lived alone in GPE with the adopted child , gave birth to a daughter . On DATE her lawyer stated that she was now the mother of CARDINAL children attending school and still lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought proceedings against the Attorney General 's Department before ORG . They requested the court to declare that the NORP judgment was enforceable in the Grand Duchy as though it were a judgment ordering full adoption delivered by the competent GPE court ; they stated that the purpose of the application for enforcement was to ensure that the child could be registered in the civil status register in LOC , acquire the nationality of her adoptive mother and be granted definitive leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the application for enforcement admissible as it had been properly submitted by originating summons . In that regard , the court stated the following :", "\u201c An application for enforcement of a foreign judgment is a principal legal claim different in nature from the application that gave rise to the foreign judgment . The court dealing with the application for enforcement does not examine the merits of the application submitted to the foreign court , but confines itself to verifying that the decision satisfies the relevant international procedural requirements . The application for enforcement of an adoption judgment , which is different in nature from the application to adopt , is not subject to the objection procedure in [ the relevant article ] of LAW , under which applications to adopt may be made by petition ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court decided that a court dealing with an application for enforcement of an adoption judgment delivered by a foreign court must first of all ascertain whether the foreign court was competent by reference to the rules determining its jurisdiction . On that point , the court concluded that the adoption had been pronounced by the court that was competent according to LAW .", "CARDINAL . As for the law applicable to the merits of the case , the court first of all recalled the positions taken by the parties to the proceedings .", "Thus , the Attorney General 's ORG maintained that the court should ascertain whether the foreign court had applied the law designated by the GPE system of private international law . As the adoptive parent was of GPE nationality , the conditions for adoption were governed by GPE law ; and LAW did not permit full adoption by an unmarried person . The Attorney General 's Department concluded that in pronouncing full adoption by the first applicant , as an unmarried person , the NORP court had failed to apply GPE law .", "The applicants were of the view that the court should confine itself to examining whether the adoption pronounced in GPE had been made according to the procedures prescribed by the laws of GPE . They submitted , in particular , that the final paragraph of LAW must be interpreted as meaning that \u201c the GPE international rule on conflict expressly recognises as valid an adoption made abroad by an authority competent under the laws of that country , ... provided that the local procedure and local provisions were complied with \u201d .", "The court decided that the final paragraph of LAW introduced a rule on jurisdiction and also maintained its rules on the conflict of laws . It added that according to LAW the adoption by the first applicant , of GPE nationality , was governed by GPE law with respect to the requisite conditions for adoption . The court concluded that the court dealing with an application to enforce the decision must ascertain whether the adoption had been pronounced in accordance with GPE law with respect to those conditions .", "CARDINAL . The court then stated that it had adjourned the deliberations on DATE to enable the parties to submit their observations on the following preliminary questions which it proposed to refer to ORG :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The law on adoption , more particularly LAW , allows a married couple to adopt a child fully and prohibits full adoption by an unmarried person . Is that law consistent with LAW , which provides that ' the ORG guarantees the natural rights of human beings and the family ' and LAW , which states that ' PERSON are equal before the law ' ?", "CARDINAL . NORP Is the right to found a family a natural right of human beings and the family ?", "CARDINAL . Is the right to found an adoptive family a natural right of human beings and the family ?", "CARDINAL . Does the right to found a family include the right to found a single - parent family ?", "CARDINAL . Is the right to found a family a right of only married human beings ?", "CARDINAL . Does the principle of equality before the law allow full adoption to be authorised for married persons to the exclusion of unmarried persons ?", "CARDINAL . Do Articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW establish rights of an unmarried person to full adoption on the same terms as those applicable to a married couple ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court confirmed that it must examine the correct application of LAW and its conformity with LAW before adjudicating on the application for enforcement . In order to do so , the court requested the applicants to clarify their actual family situation , on the following grounds :", "\u201c By submissions of DATE PERSON representative maintained that the PERSON family existed in fact and in law and that it was not a single - parent family . He also submitted that nowadays ' the more general acceptance by society of unmarried cohabitation has led to an increase in the number of children living in a single home with a father and mother who are not married . It is less and less certain that the parents need to be married in order for the child to grow up in a home with a father and a mother ' .", "If those submissions have any meaning , PERSON is living as part of a couple without being married .", "... The assertion of the existence of a family which is not a single - parent family is new and not substantiated by any evidence .", "The social inquiry report of DATE , which was submitted to the court on DATE , states that PERSON gave birth to a daughter in DATE . That report on the adaptation of the adopted child in her new family in GPE examines only the relationship between the mother and the child . It does not mention the existence of a man in PERSON home or any relationship between the adopted child and PERSON partner .", "The pre - adoption report drawn up on DATE , also by social worker [ B. ] , states as the general reason for adopting the conviction that ' children are the purpose of life ' . PERSON was approaching her thirtieth birthday and decided ' not to wait to meet the ideal man in order to have children but to adopt a child on her own , in the knowledge that her family would help her ... '", "As the reason for adopting a NORP child , the social worker observed that in GPE PERSON encountered many obstacles , mainly the fact that she was not married . ' The only country which has an agreement with GPE and which consents to adoption by an unmarried woman is GPE and thus PERSON contacted ORG and prepared the file through that association ' . The social worker recommended that the adoption should be approved , as the child found a welcoming home ' within that \u201c single - parent \u201d family ' .", "The reports filed by the applicant therefore mention only a family consisting of the mother and CARDINAL children .", "It is important to refer to the ORG questions which are appropriate to the adoptive parent 's actual family situation . Adoption by a family consisting of an unmarried couple may receive a different reply from that given to adoption by an unmarried mother living alone . It is therefore for the adoptive parent to establish her actual family situation and to establish that her family is not a single - parent family . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The hearing was resumed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , the court first of all set out the views expressed by the applicants in relation to the proposed preliminary questions . Thus , the applicants , first , emphasised that the court was dealing with an application for enforcement and not an application to adopt and , second , took issue with the proposed questions because they emphasised the rights of the mother , whereas the real issue was the rights of the child adopted following the NORP judgment . The applicants also observed that the first applicant had given birth to a child in DATE , and proposed the following preliminary questions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Is the right to secure from the GPE courts recognition of a family relationship validly established abroad for the purposes of securing recognition that the adopted child has the same political and civil rights as a biological child of the adoptive mother a natural right of the human being , and more particularly of an adopted child ?", "CARDINAL . NORP In so far as LAW must , in spite of the substance of LAW , final paragraph , be considered to constitute an obstacle to the recognition of a full adoption lawfully made abroad by an unmarried mother of GPE nationality , and must be so considered in spite of the substance of DATE of the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE , as approved by the PERSON of DATE , does not the principle of equality before the law set forth in Article PERSON ) of the LAW require recognition of that full adoption in so far as such recognition is necessary in order for the adopted child to be able to enjoy all her political and civil rights to the same extent as her biological collaterals ?", "Does the principle of equality before the law allow a difference in treatment to be created by the law , in particular with respect to the entry of the adoption in the civil status register , the issuing of the certificate of nationality and the situation regarding succession , in complete legal certainty between a non - marital child and an adopted child of the same mother ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then gave judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c The court must ascertain whether the conditions prescribed by GPE law for adoption were satisfied at the time when the adoption was pronounced by the NORP judge . In fact , PERSON is an unmarried woman who , according to LAW , can not undertake a full adoption . The question that arises is therefore whether the prohibition on full adoption by an unmarried person is compatible with the constitutional rights in LAW , that is to say , any rights enjoyed by the mother , and not by the child .", "When ensuring that the decision to be enforced satisfies the relevant international procedural requirements , the court must examine whether the foreign court was in a position to pronounce the adoption by reference to the conditions on adoption provided for by the relevant GPE legislation .", "The establishment of a constitutional right to adopt without discrimination between married persons and unmarried persons does not preclude the specific assessment of the physical and mental situation of the persons wishing to adopt and of their capacity to raise and contribute to the development of a child . It may be that the right to family life is not recognised where the best interests of the child would be in danger . The existence of a right is distinct from its actual exercise .", "As PERSON is an unmarried woman not living as part of a couple , the questions which correspond to her family situation relate to a single - parent family .", "The questions envisaged by the court on DATE are therefore relevant to the outcome of the dispute .", "Examination of the existence of \u201c a right to secure recognition \u201d in GPE \u201c of a legal parent - child relationship validly established abroad \u201d assumes that the valid creation of an adoptive parent - child relationship within the meaning of GPE law is established . The first preliminary question proposed by PERSON is irrelevant , as the lawfulness of the NORP adoption has not been established .", "Examination of the second question proposed must be reserved . As matters now stand , the questions envisaged by the court on DATE should be referred . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the questions numbered CARDINAL to CARDINAL ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) inadmissible . As for the first question , it decided that LAW was not contrary to LAW , for the following reasons :", "\u201c Regarding Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW :", "... Article PERSON ) of the LAW states that the ORG guarantees the natural rights of human beings and the family ;", "... natural rights are those flowing from human nature and exist , even without a legislative text ; ... applied to the family , they include the right to procreate and the right to live together ;", "... , in parallel , the legislature has established , by adoption , a substitute legal parent - child relationship which , while it demands proper motives on the part of the adoptive parents , must above all be advantageous for the person adopted ;", "... [ adoption ] has its basis in positive law and not in natural law ; ... it is therefore for the legislature to put in place all the conditions and limits necessary for its proper functioning and satisfying the interests of society and of the adoptive family ;", "Regarding Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW :", "... Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that ' all PERSON are equal before the law ' ;", "... that constitutional principle , which is applicable to every individual affected by GPE law if personality rights are concerned , is not to be understood in an absolute sense , but requires that all those in the same factual and legal situation be treated in the same way ;", "... the specific treatment is justified if the difference in condition is effective and objective , if it is in the public interest and if the extent of its application is not unreasonable ;", "... the specific treatment is lawful in the present case as it is based on a genuine distinction resulting from the civil status of the persons , on an increased guarantee in favour of the adopted child as a result of the number of persons holding parental authority in the case of married persons and on reasonable proportionality owing to the fact that simple adoption remains available to an unmarried person in compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements provided for by law ; \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district court dismissed the application for enforcement , on the ground that the NORP adoption judgment had been delivered contrary to the GPE law applicable according to the rule on the conflict of laws set forth in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court upheld the argument of the Attorney General 's ORG that the NORP judge had not applied GPE law by pronouncing full adoption by an unmarried GPE woman .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court concluded that there was no need to consider whether the NORP decision was contrary to public policy . In that regard , however , it made the following observation :", "\u201c ... according to the pre - adoption social inquiry report of DATE , PERSON chose to adopt in GPE , through ORG , since GPE permits adoption by an unmarried woman , whereas she encountered various obstacles to adoption in GPE , mainly because she was not married .", "PERSON therefore decided to obtain indirectly , by enforcement of the adoption in GPE , what she was unable to obtain directly by an application to adopt in GPE . However , a judgment obtained by circumventing the statutory requirements can not be enforced . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then dealt with the second preliminary question which had been proposed by the applicants at the earlier hearing :", "\u201c The judgment of DATE reserved the alternative preliminary question proposed by PERSON . In the event that LAW precluded full adoption , PERSON proposed that ORG should examine whether the principle of equality allowed a difference in treatment to be created by law , notably with respect to the entry of the adoption in the civil status registers , the issuing of a certificate of nationality and the situation regarding succession between the non - marital child and the adoptive child of the same mother . In her submissions lodged after the decision of ORG , PERSON maintained that proposal for a preliminary question ..", "Under [ the relevant section ] of ORG , a court before which a party has raised a question relating to the constitutionality of a law is not required to refer the matter to the [ Constitutional ] Court if the question is wholly unfounded or if the [ Constitutional ] Court has already ruled on a question having the same subject - matter .", "... As the [ Constitutional ] Court decided [ in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ] that adoption was not a constitutional right but was a matter for legislation , and on the basis that the law may introduce a distinction between persons having different civil status , the preliminary question proposed by PERSON is wholly unfounded .", "The question also seeks to secure a review of the compatibility of the law on adoption , which prohibits full adoption by an unmarried person , with the principle of equality and the right to family life . The [ Constitutional ] Court held that biological filiation and adoptive filiation were different in nature , the former coming under natural law protected by LAW and the latter created by the legislature . It also decided that the principle of equality applied to those in the same factual and legal situation .", "As an adoptive child is in a legal and factual situation distinct from that of a non - marital child and as the principle of equality assumes that the situation of the persons is the same , the proposed question is unfounded .", "There is thus no reason to refer the question to ORG .. \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court rejected the argument put forward by the applicants on the basis of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , for the following reasons :", "\u201c PERSON maintains that public policy and ORG require that the adoption decision be enforced . As the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration , in application of LAW , the adopted child should have the same rights as her ' biological ' sister , the mother 's non - marital child .", "The interests of the child may be assessed by the legislature . GPE law accepts that it is in the interests of children to be fully adopted by a married couple and not by an unmarried person . The court must therefore apply that statutory provision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the judgments of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . They requested ORG to declare the judgment of ORG of DATE enforceable in GPE and to order that the forthcoming judgment be entered in the civil status registers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of their appeal , the applicants maintained first of all that LAW a rule of strictly territorial application determining the conditions of an application for full adoption coming within the jurisdiction of the GPE courts DATE was not a reason to dismiss an application for enforcement of a foreign decision , since the court dealing with the application to enforce the decision had no power of review and was not empowered to alter the effects of the adoption pronounced by the NORP court . They further maintained that under LAW , final paragraph , of LAW a foreign adoption decision could be enforced in GPE provided it had been delivered by a competent court according to the rules on the conflict of laws and the procedures of the country of origin . Thus , the final paragraph of LAW was not a simple rule on jurisdiction but a rule on the conflict of laws .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also maintained their request that the preliminary question which they had formulated before the district court be referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a section entitled \u201c Public policy implications \u201d , the applicants contended that the procedure for securing recognition of the effects of a full adoption pronounced abroad differed from the procedure for pronouncement of an adoption in GPE , so that the impact of the questions of public policy arose in different terms and did not have the same weight . Next , relying on the Convention on the Rights of the Child , they submitted that the best interests of the child consisted in favouring the effects of a full adoption , in particular the right to acquire GPE nationality and to share in the succession of the adoptive family on the same basis as a legitimate or non - marital child . While they acknowledged that a new simple adoption could be made in GPE , they emphasised that it would grant less substantial rights to the child , particularly in relation to succession and the acquisition of GPE nationality . In the applicants ' submission , it was specifically public policy that required enforcement , so that the adoptive child would be granted the same rights as her biological sister and so that legal calm rather than uncertainty would reign in the families . They cited a decision of the district court , which , in a different context , had held that an interference with the right for the father and mother to maintain relations with their children was not justified by CARDINAL of the objectives set forth in LAW . They contended that in this case the judgment at first instance DATE which gave priority to GPE law over an international convention as a ground for refusing to order enforcement \u2013 penalised the minor child and was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE the applicants ' appeal was declared unfounded . ORG held , in the first place , the following :", "\u201c By way of preliminary point , it should be observed that while foreign judicial decisions on the status of persons enjoy immediate substantive effectiveness in the Grand Duchy of GPE , provided only that they satisfy the relevant international procedural requirements , they none the less may and even must be enforced in order to render them incontestable and enforceable by execution and to enable the acts necessary to enforce them to be carried out .", "In this case , recognition of the NORP adoption decision is sought , not only to ensure that the adopted child has the same succession rights as those recognised by GPE law to a legitimate or non - marital child , but also to avoid problems arising in the future as a result of the fact that the child has not lost NORP nationality by the effect of her adoption in her country of origin and , in the absence of a decision recognising the foreign judgment , does not acquire GPE nationality , at least for the time being , and can not in those circumstances benefit from the advantages conferred on nationals of the countries of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then analysed the scope and significance of the final paragraph of LAW and reached the following conclusion :", "\u201c The [ ORG was correct to take the view that the GPE court dealing with the application to enforce the NORP judgment must ascertain whether the adoption was made in conformity with the GPE rules on the conflict of laws , as provided for in LAW , and to dismiss the application on the ground that the NORP judgment pronouncing full adoption in favour of an unmarried GPE national is in flagrant contradiction with the GPE law on the conflict of laws , which provides that the conditions for adoption are governed by the national law of the adoptive parent .", "It is therefore unnecessary to examine further the other conditions required for enforcement , namely conformity to international public policy and circumvention of the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also concluded that the applicants were wrong to rely on the Convention on the Rights of the Child , for the following reasons :", "\u201c LAW , approved by LAW DATE , provides in paragraph CARDINAL that the child is to be registered immediately after birth and is to have the right from birth to a name , the right to acquire a nationality and , as far as possible , the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents .", "Article CARDINAL provides that GPE Parties that recognise and/or permit the system of adoption are to ensure that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration , and sets out the obligations placed on GPE in that regard ( paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) of that article ) .", "The ORG agrees with the Attorney General 's representative , who maintains ... that Articles CARDINAL and DATE can not be applied directly in order to secure recognition of a foreign full adoption decision pronounced in breach of our national laws .", "...", "The [ applicants ] are wrong to rely on the abovementioned Articles of the Convention to secure recognition of a foreign adoption made in compliance with its legal rules , which , it is emphasised , are very strict , but in breach of GPE law , which rightly or wrongly maintains the principle that full adoption by an unmarried person is prohibited , since DATE does not require the GPE Parties to alter their national legislation in that sense , a fortiori because it is not established that such a change in the legislation would be in the paramount interest of the child , quite apart from any political or moral considerations which influence the legislative choices according to current thinking .", "Article CARDINAL , on which the applicants rely , concerns at most only the effects of the adoption , but has no bearing on whether an adoption decision satisfies the relevant international procedural requirements . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Last , ORG considered that the first - instance court had been correct not to deem it appropriate to refer the preliminary question formulated by the applicants to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed on a point of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , for the following reasons :", "\u201c The first ground of appeal ,", "alleging \u201c breach , if not misapplication of the law , in the present case of LAW , final paragraph of LAW , which provides that in the event of conflict between the rules of competence prescribed respectively by the national law of the adoptive parent and by that of the adopted child , the adoption is validly concluded according to the procedure prescribed by the law of the country in which the adoption took place and before the authorities competent under that law , in that the judgment considered that the word ' procedure ' had only the meaning of ' procedural rule ' and did not include the substantive conditions whereas , first part , the text of LAW speaks in unequivocal terms of ' procedures ' and not restrictively of ' procedural rules ' , so that the scope of the legislative text can not be restricted by the implicit addition thereto of words which it does not contain , in this case the word ' rule ' ; second part the word ' procedure ' employed by the legislature in the specific context of the final paragraph of LAW is not limited to procedural rules in the strict sense , but covers both the latter and the substantive rules , and therefore legal ' procedures ' in the broad , flexible and general sense , the legislature having clearly displayed its intention to properly encompass in the word ' procedure ' both the substantive conditions and procedural conditions properly so called \u201d ;", "But ... in agreeing with the court of first instance that the NORP full adoption decision was delivered in contradiction to the GPE law on the conflict of laws , which provides in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW that the conditions that must be satisfied in order to adopt are governed by the national law of the adoptive parent , ORG made a correct application of the law without being in breach of the legislative text referred to in the CARDINAL parts of the ground of appeal ;", "... it follows that the ground of appeal can not be upheld ;", "The second ground of appeal ,", "alleging \u201c misapplication , if not violation of LAW ] , which provides that there is to be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others , and of LAW , which provides that every judgment must state the reasons on which it is based , in that the judgment did not even examine the appellants ' plea based on LAW ] , when the best interests of the child ought to have led the decision under appeal , on the assumption that LAW , final paragraph , of LAW is not to be interpreted as meaning that an adoption lawfully concluded abroad can not be repudiated , to refuse to apply the GPE domestic rule , which prevents an unmarried woman of GPE nationality from fully adopting a minor child , in such a way as to apply GPE law to her , and that the intention of the GPE legislature to require an unmarried woman to marry if she wishes to undertake full adoption of a child , in such a way as to ensure that that child enjoys all the privileges attached to GPE and Community nationality constitutes an unnecessary interference with family life ... \u201d", "But ... first , ORG was not required to respond to the ground of appeal set out in the document initiating the appeal under the heading \u201c Public policy implications \u201d , as that question had become devoid of purpose by the very effect of its decision not to apply the foreign law ;", "... , second , owing to their dubious , vague and imprecise nature , the arguments relating to LAW contained in the document initiating the appeal did not constitute a ground of appeal requiring a response ;", "Whence it follows that the plea can not be upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested the Minister for ORG and Youth to take the necessary measures to enable the adoption pronounced by the NORP judgment of DATE to be entered as a full adoption recognised by the GPE authorities in the civil status register with competence ratione territoriae in application of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister declared that the provisions of LAW were not applicable to the applicants ' request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review of that decision .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE the administrative court of first instance ( ORG administratif ) annulled the ministerial decision , for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... the [ LAW DATE ] was adopted by GPE law on DATE and entered into force on DATE in the Grand Duchy of GPE , on which date it is common ground that the LAW was already in force with respect to GPE ;", "... from DATE LAW has therefore been in force between the CARDINAL countries concerned by the present case : GPE , the ORG of origin , and the Grand Duchy of GPE , the receiving ORG , as defined in LAW ;", "... the LAW states in LAW that it is to ' apply in every case where an application pursuant to LAW has been received after the LAW has entered into force in the receiving ORG and the ORG of origin ' ;", "...

The idea behind the proposal was to give a rule to answer the question as to the validity of adoptions already made in GPE when a ORG becomes a ORG to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some participants considered that proposal ambiguous and suggested its deletion or its clarification , at least , but others sustained it . The Observer for ORG observed that it was unnecessary and dangerous , because the formulation might permit a wicked conclusion , if interpreted a contrario , since the natural consequence of a ORG becoming a ORG to the ORG is to recognise adoptions already made in GPE . Therefore , the \u201c declaration \u201d provided by the second paragraph could be interpreted as permitting the non - recognition of such adoptions and , for this reason , the proposal was rejected ' ; ...", "... for the purposes of application ratione tempore it is appropriate to distinguish the situation of the application properly so called of the Convention in the words of LAW concerning adoption procedures to be initiated and that relating to adoptions previously carried out , which by definition no longer have to follow the procedure provided for in LAW , and raising more particularly aspects of recognition and re - entry on the competent registers of civil status ;", "... although the text of LAW gives rise to no doubt concerning the applicability of the LAW in all cases where an application referred to in LAW , in initial act of the procedure there referred to , was received after the entry into force of the LAW in the receiving ORG and in the ORG of origin , reliance on that LAW for other aspects relating more particularly to the recognition and entry of adoptions previously carried out in the ORG of origin do not fall directly under the wording of LAW ;", "... the fact that two GPE , by definition the ORG of origin and the receiving ORG , have become parties to the LAW and have adopted it in such a way that it has entered into force in both GPE means that these GPE have thereby adopted the provisions of the LAW as being henceforth required to be the general law , at a superior level , having to govern the respective relationships concerning the nationals of both GPE in adoption matters ;", "... the adoption of such a superior general law in adoption matters consists by the very organisation of the LAW , in the light of the objectives which it pursues , a favor adoptioni to which these CARDINAL States have thus subscribed in the best interests of the adoptive children concerned ;", "... it follows that an application for recognition and entry in the relevant registers of civil status of an adoption carried out before the entry into force of the Convention in the ORG of origin is governed by the provisions of the LAW contained more particularly in LAW , entitled \u201c ORG and effects of the adoption \u201d , from the time when the relevant application , submitted not with a view to adoption but with a view to recognition and entry of an adoption which has already taken place , was submitted after the entry into force of the LAW in the receiving ORG and the ORG of origin ;", "... the applicant has also placed on the file a certificate issued by the competent authority of ORG in which the adoption took place , capable of being read as being consistent with the LAW ;", "... it follows from all the foregoing developments that the contested ministerial decision was wrong ... to refuse to undertake a more thorough examination of the abovementioned application of DATE by rejecting the application of the provisions of LAW of DATE , which had been in force between GPE and the Grand Duchy of GPE since DATE ;", "... the contested ministerial decision must therefore be annulled for violation of the law ;", "... since preference should be given to any solution found at a non - contentious level and since the Minister did not afford herself the opportunity to examine the merits of the application in question more thoroughly , the case should be sent back to the Minister for further consideration ... ; \u201d", "CARDINAL .
