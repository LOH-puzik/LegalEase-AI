Subsequently , on DATE , they became engaged to be married .", "On DATE it was confirmed that ORG was pregnant . Shortly after this the relationship between the applicant and PERSON broke down and they ceased co - habiting . On DATE PERSON gave birth to a daughter PERSON of whom the applicant was the father . The applicant visited PERSON at a private nursing home and saw the baby when it was DATE . DATE he visited ORG \u2019s GPE home but was not permitted to see either ORG or the child .", "CARDINAL . ORG During her pregnancy ORG had made arrangements to have the child adopted and on CARDINAL DATE she had the child placed by a registered adoption society with the prospective adopters . She informed the applicant of this in a letter dated CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant subsequently instituted proceedings before ORG to be appointed guardian under section CARDINAL , sub - section CARDINAL , of the Guardianship of Infants Act DATE , which would have enabled him to challenge the proposed adoption . He also applied for custody of the child . Pursuant to LAW , an adoption order can not be made , inter alia , without the consent of the child \u2019s mother and the child \u2019s guardian ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . While a married man is a guardian of his children , an unmarried man is not unless so appointed by the court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On CARDINAL DATE ORG appointed the applicant guardian and awarded him custody .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following an appeal against the judgment of ORG by ORG and the prospective adopters , ORG found in DATE that the applicant was a fit person to be appointed guardian and that there were no circumstances involving the welfare of the child which required that the father \u2019s rights be denied . Mr Justice PERSON of ORG stated :", "\" I am of the opinion that in considering the applications both for custody and guardianship I must have regard to circumstances as they presently exist and that in considering the welfare of the child I must take into account the fact that she has been placed for adoption . Each application must be taken as part of a global application and not as a separate and distinct one . The test therefore is :", "( CARDINAL ) whether the natural father is a fit person to be appointed guardian , and , if so :", "( CARDINAL ) whether there are circumstances involving the welfare of the child which require that , notwithstanding he is a fit person , he should not be so appointed .", "In the present case , I am of the opinion that he satisfies the first condition and that unless the welfare of the child is to be regarded as the sole consideration , he satisfies the second condition ...", "In my opinion , having regard to the purposes of LAW DATE , the rights of the father should not be denied by considerations of the welfare of the child alone , but only where - and they do not exist in the present case - there are good reasons for so doing . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG After the conclusion of the ORG proceedings Mr ORG acceded to an application by ORG and the prospective adopters to state a case for the opinion of ORG . The questions put to ORG by the judge were as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Am I correct in my opinion as to the manner in which section CARDINAL of the Guardianship of Infants Act DATE , as inserted by CARDINAL of LAW DATE , should be construed ?", "( CARDINAL ) If not , what is the proper construction of that section and what other , if any , principles should I have applied or considered whether in relation to guardianship or custody which derive either from law or from the provisions of the LAW ? \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Delivering the majority judgment of ORG on DATE , Chief Justice PERSON stated that ORG had incorrectly construed section CARDINAL of the DATE Act as conferring on the natural father a right to be a guardian . He considered that the LAW only gave the natural father a right to apply to be guardian . It did not equate his position with that of a married father . The first and paramount consideration in the exercise of the court \u2019s discretion was the welfare of the child , and the blood link between child and father as merely one of the many relevant factors which may be viewed by the court as relevant to that question . He added , inter alia :", "\" ... although there may be rights of interest or concern arising from the blood link between the father and the child , no constitutional right to guardianship in the father of the child exists . This conclusion does not , of course , in any way infringe on such considerations appropriate to the welfare of the child in different circumstances as may make it desirable for the child to enjoy the society , protection and guardianship of its father , even though its father and mother are not married .", "The extent and character of the rights which accrue arising from the relationship of a father to a child to whose mother he is not married must vary very greatly indeed , depending on the circumstances of each individual case .", "The range of variation would , I am satisfied , extend from the situation of the father of a child conceived as the result of a casual intercourse , where the rights might well be so minimal as practically to be non - existent , to the situation of a child born as the result of a stable and established relationship and nurtured at the commencement of his life by his father and mother in a situation bearing nearly all of the characteristics of a constitutionally protected family , when the rights would be very extensive indeed ... \"", "He concluded that :", "\" ... regard should not be had to the objective of satisfying the wishes and desires of the father to be involved in the guardianship of and to enjoy the society of his child unless the ORG has first concluded that the quality of welfare which would probably be achieved for the infant by its present custody which is with the prospective adoptive parents , as compared with the quality of welfare which would probably be achieved by custody with the father is not to an important extent better \" .", "The matter was then referred back to ORG for the case to be decided in light of this interpretation .", "CARDINAL . ORG resumed its examination of the case in DATE . It heard , inter alia , the evidence of a consultant child psychiatrist who considered that the child would suffer short - term trauma if moved to the applicant \u2019s custody . In the longer term she would be more vulnerable to stress and be less able to cope with it . She would also have difficulty in forming \" trust \" relationships .", "CARDINAL . ORG In his judgment of CARDINAL DATE Mr ORG recalled that the applicant wished bona fide to have custody of his daughter and that he felt the existence of an emotional bond .", "He had also noted that if the child remained with the adopters she would obtain the benefit of a higher standard of living and would be likely to remain at school longer . However , he considered that differences springing solely from socio - economic causes should not be taken into account where CARDINAL of the claimants is a natural parent . In his view \" to do otherwise would be to favour the affluent as against the less well - off which does not accord with the constitutional obligation to hold all citizens as human persons equal before the law \" .", "Applying the test laid down by ORG in the light of the dangers to the psychological health of the child he allowed the appeal of the natural mother and the prospective adopters and concluded as follows :", "\" The result , it seems to me , is this . If the child remains where she is , she will if the adoption procedures are completed become a member of a family recognised by LAW and freed from the danger of psychological trauma . On the other hand if she is moved she will not be a member of such a family and in the short and long term her future is likely to be very different . The security of knowing herself to be a member of a loving and caring family would be lost . If moved , she will I am sure be a member of a loving and caring unit equivalent to a family in her eyes . Nevertheless the security will be lost and there will be insecurity arising from the several factors which have been enumerated .", "In my view these differences and the danger to her psychological health are of such an importance that I can not hold that the quality of welfare likely to be achieved with the prospective adopters would not be to an important extent better than that likely to be achieved by custody with the father . That being so , his wish and desire to be involved in the guardianship of and to enjoy the society of his child is not a factor which I am to take into account . In these circumstances , the welfare of the infant requires her to remain in her present custody . Accordingly the application for relief must be refused . \"", "CARDINAL .
