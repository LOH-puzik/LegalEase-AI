On DATE the ORG carried out a reform consisting of CARDINAL major amendments to the electoral legislation : an increase of the electoral threshold from MONEY back to MONEY , a ban on all forms of electoral blocks and coalitions and a ban on persons with dual or multiple nationality becoming members of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The latter amendment to the electoral legislation ( Law no . CARDINAL ) was adopted in its first reading by ORG long before that date , on CARDINAL DATE . According to the draft law prepared by ORG , only persons having exclusively NORP citizenship were entitled to work in senior positions in the government and in several public services and be candidates in legislative elections . This provision was not applicable to persons living in GPE . In an explanatory note to the draft the Vice - Minister of ORG stated :", "\u201c Having analysed the current situation in the country in the field of citizenship , we observe that the tendency of Moldovans to obtain citizenships of other countries is explained by their desire to obtain privileges consisting of unrestrained travel in ORG , social privileges , family reunion , employment and studies .", "At the same time , persons holding other nationalities have political and legal obligations towards those states . This fact could generate a conflict of interest in cases in which there are obligations both towards GPE and towards other states , whose national a particular person is .", "In view of the above , and with a view to solving the situation created , we consider it reasonable to amend the legislation in force so as to ban holders of multiple nationalities from public functions ...", "This will not mean , however , that those persons will not be able to work in GPE . They will be able to exercise their professional activities in fields which do not involve the exercise of state authority ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the debates in ORG numerous opposition members requested that the draft be sent to ORG for a preliminary expertise . However , the majority voted against this proposal . In exchange , the opposition was invited to challenge the new law before LAW . No such challenge was made . Numerous MPs from the opposition argued that the proposed amendment was contrary to LAW but the Vice - Minister of ORG expressed a contrary view and argued that , in any event , it was open to ORG to denounce that ORG if there were any incompatibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the draft law in question was adopted by ORG in a final reading ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; however , later the President of the country refused to promulgate it and returned it to ORG for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . The draft law was further amended and the list of positions in the government and in the public service closed to holders of multiple nationality was reduced . The provisions concerning legislative elections were also amended in the sense that persons with dual or multiple nationality are allowed to be candidates in legislative elections ; however , they are obliged to inform ORG about their other citizenships before registering as candidates and give them up before the validation of their MP mandates by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG against Racism and Intolerance ( \u201c ECRI \u201d ) made public a report dated DATE in which it expressed concern in respect of the amendments concerning dual and multiple nationalities :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ECRI notes with interest that LAW , in full accordance with LAW , which has been ratified by GPE , provides that NORP citizens who are also citizens of another ORG and who have their lawful and habitual residence in GPE enjoy the same rights and duties as other NORP citizens . In this respect , ORG would like to express its concern about a draft law on the modification and completion of certain legislative acts adopted in its first reading by ORG on DATE . According to this draft law , only persons having exclusively GPE citizenship are entitled to work in senior positions in the government and in several public services . From the information it has received , ORG understands that if this draft law enters into force as it stands , NORP citizens with multiple citizenship would be seriously disadvantaged compared with other NORP citizens in access to public functions . It thus appears that , if the law enters into force as such , this could lead to discrimination , i.e. unjustified differential treatment on the grounds of citizenship . ECRI understands that a wide - ranging debate is occurring within GPE at the time of writing this report as far as this draft law is concerned and that many sources both at the national and international level have stressed the need to revise the text thoroughly before its final adoption in order to ensure its compatibility with national and international standards .", "...", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , the establishment of \u201c electoral blocs \u201d \u2013 joint lists submitted by a coalition of political parties - was prohibited . These measures have raised concern and the committee decided at short notice to hold an exchange of views with the GPE delegation on DATE . The electoral legislation should not be changed every DATE according to political imperatives .

The ORG , having conducted a comparative review of the legislations of CARDINAL countries , members of ORG , noted that the majority of them permit dual or multiple nationalities .

There are CARDINAL countries in which beside a ban on dual nationality , there is a supplementary provision in the electoral laws or Constitutions banning persons with other nationalities from being elected to ORG .
