GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . When lodging his application , he was detained in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr J. Rieger , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Following his criminal conviction the applicant was detained from DATE until DATE in the ORG prison . DATE and DATE he was remanded for TIME per day in a cell which measured QUANTITY together with CARDINAL further persons . The cell \u2019s window could not be opened . From DATE until DATE he was detained in a different cell which measured QUANTITY with CARDINAL more persons , but could leave that cell for TIME every day . There was hardly any space to walk , as both cells were equipped with beds , a table , chairs , a wardrobe and a wash basin . The toilet was located within the cell and was merely separated from the room by a curtain . There was no ventilation and insufficient airing .", "The applicant claimed to have lodged CARDINAL motions with the SuhlGoldlauter prison to be transferred to a single cell . In reply , the prison staff explained to him that he did not have a right to be transferred .", "On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid so as to lodge before ORG an official liability action for payment of damages against the Land of GPE according to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law and ORG , below ) . He claimed that the conditions of his detention in the ORG prison , notably the lack of space and airing and the constant deprivation of privacy even when using the toilet , had been degrading and had disregarded human dignity and ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . These circumstances had further led to health problems such as constant stress , eating and sleeping disorders , stomach troubles and strong headaches .", "The applicant argued that it had not been possible for him to avert the damage incurred as prescribed by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code while he was being detained in the ORG prison by applying for judicial review . Upon his complaints to the prison staff about his conditions of detention he had been informed that these were lawful , and he had not been instructed that he could lodge a motion for judicial review . He had not had sufficient means to mandate a lawyer while in prison .", "On DATE the Land of Thuringia requested the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s motion to be granted legal aid . It submitted that the applicant \u2019s detention together with CARDINAL further persons in one cell had been lawful . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act , read in conjunction with section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act ( see \u2019Relevant domestic law and ORG , below ) , a temporary placement of several persons in one cell was permitted if this was indispensable , as was the case at the time of the applicant \u2019s detention . According to the defendant , the cells measured QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively , and as their length was QUANTITY the toilet was QUANTITY away from the dining table . The Land further contested that the applicant had been obliged to stay in the cell for TIME per day .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to be granted legal aid . It found that the applicant \u2019s intended action for payment of damages had no sufficient prospects of success and appeared wanton . A possible damages claim was excluded pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant had failed to avert the alleged damage by lodging a motion for judicial review of his conditions of detention under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law and ORG , below ) while detained in the ORG prison , if necessary after having obtained legal advice .", "On DATE the applicant , meanwhile represented by counsel , lodged an appeal . He argued in particular that a motion for judicial review to ORG under section CARDINAL of LAW would have had no prospects of success . Prior to the decision of ORG of DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see \u2018 Relevant domestic law and ORG , below ) the regional courts in GPE had dismissed all motions for judicial review concerning the refusal of prison authorities to transfer detainees to a single cell for lack of space in the GPE prisons . The applicant could not have averted the damage incurred , not least because the proceedings before ORG would have taken DATE during which he was being remanded in the impugned conditions of imprisonment .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It agreed with ORG that the applicant had lost his damages claim in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW as he had failed to avoid the alleged damage by lodging a motion for judicial review under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG found that there would be no causal link between the failure to lodge a motion for judicial review and the damage incurred where such a motion clearly had no prospects of success . It conceded that , at the relevant time , the regional courts had repeatedly dismissed motions for judicial review concerning the placement of several detainees in one cell . However , it was crucial how the applicant \u2019s motion under section CARDINAL of LAW should have been correctly decided , having regard to the particular circumstances of his case . In ORG view , a motion for judicial review lodged by the applicant during his detention , assuming that the alleged particular conditions of detention proved to be true , would have had prospects of success . It had been lawful to place the applicant in a cell together with other detainees ( section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act ) . However , the conditions of his detention in the cell suggested that there had been a violation of his personality rights . Therefore , it was possible that a prompt motion for judicial review , in accordance with the case - law of ORG , would have resulted in a finding that his conditions of detention disregarded human dignity which in turn would have led to a change in these conditions .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He complained in particular that ORG had conceded , on the one hand , that at the time of his detention the regional courts had repeatedly dismissed motions for judicial review lodged against similar prison conditions . On the other hand , ORG had found that the regional courts might have granted a motion lodged by the applicant for judicial review and therefore considered his claim for damages to be excluded . This was arbitrary . It was uncontested that there had not been any space in the ORG prison to transfer the applicant to a single cell . Therefore , a motion for judicial review would not have had any prospects of success . Moreover , the applicant claimed that he had been treated less favourably than other prisoners who had been detained in comparable conditions . He argued that the civil courts in other ORG had granted actions for payment of damages without the plaintiffs having previously brought a motion for judicial review of their imprisonment conditions while in detention .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as it had no prospects of success . The ORG impugned decision was not based on a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights guaranteed by LAW .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code , taken in conjunction with LAW of LAW , an individual has the right to be compensated by the ORG for any damage arising from a breach of official duty committed by an official . However , the obligation to afford redress shall not arise where the injured party has wilfully or negligently omitted to avoid the damage by means of a legal remedy ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act ( Strafvollzugsgesetz ) provides that a motion for judicial review may be lodged ( with ORG , see section CARDINAL of the said Act ) against measures concerning the conditions of detention .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act a detainee may only temporarily and for compelling reasons be placed in the same cell with other prisoners during the rest period . Section CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act contains transitional arrangements for prisons the construction of which was started before DATE . In particular , according to section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act and in derogation of section CARDINAL , the placement of several prisoners in one cell during the rest period is permitted if this is necessary in view of the limited space available in prison .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure representation by counsel is compulsory for the parties in civil proceedings before ORG , ORG and ORG .", "The conditions for legal aid are laid down in section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . According to that section , a party who in view of his or her personal and economic situation can not afford the costs for conducting the proceedings is granted legal aid upon application if the intended legal action offers sufficient prospects of success and does not appear wanton ( mutwillig ) . A party who has been granted legal aid is officially appointed a lawyer of his or her choice who is ready to represent him or her if representation by counsel is compulsory ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) . It is the court having jurisdiction to deal with the intended action itself which is called to decide on motions for legal aid ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) . An appeal lies against a decision refusing legal aid ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "In its decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG quashed the decisions of the criminal courts reviewing a prisoner \u2019s conditions of detention . The petitioner had been placed for DATE during TIME per day together with another person in a cell measuring QUANTITY . The toilet was located in the cell without any partition from the remainder of the room . The court found , in particular , that it was irrelevant that , possibly , the petitioner had not complained about his temporary placement in the said cell while in detention , as the authorities had to respect his human dignity irrespective of whether or not he complained about his treatment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
