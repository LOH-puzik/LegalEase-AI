The applicants appealed .", "It appears that the proceedings are currently pending before ORG ( ORG pravosu\u0111a ) , as the second - instance administrative authority .", "On DATE the heirs of GPE brought a civil action against the applicants and GPE in ORG ( PERSON ) . They asked the court to declare the above contract of sale null and void as being contrary to peremptory rules . They argued that under LAW , confiscated flats were not to be sold to their tenants but awarded to their former owners . Only if the former owner \u2019s request for restitution had been dismissed or declared inadmissible were the tenants allowed to purchase such flats . They plaintiffs explained that on DATE they had submitted a request for restitution of the entire building in which the flat in question was located with ORG of GPE , and that this request had not been dismissed or declared inadmissible by the time the impugned contract of sale had been concluded . On the contrary , on DATE and DATE that ORG had adopted decisions awarding them ownership of the building with all the flats and business premises in it . Therefore , GPE had not been allowed to sell the flat while the request for its restitution was pending . The applicants replied that it was the same ORG which in its letter of CARDINAL DATE had informed them that no request for restitution had been lodged in respect of their flat . They had therefore acted in good faith when they had concluded the contract of sale and should not suffer the consequences of the mistake made by the authorities .", "On DATE the court declared the impugned contract of sale null and void ab initio , endorsing the arguments adduced by the plaintiffs . In doing so it noted the applicants\u2019 main argument that they had been misinformed by the authorities , but did not expressly address that argument . It confined itself to stating that the contract was in breach of peremptory rules and therefore null and void from its inception . The applicants appealed .", "On DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) dismissed an appeal by the applicants and upheld the first - instance judgment endorsing the reasons given therein . It added that ORG had obviously made a clerical error when on CARDINAL DATE it had informed the applicants that no request for restitution had been submitted as regards the building in which their flat was located . However , since it had been established beyond doubt that the plaintiffs had indeed submitted such a request , GPE had breached peremptory rules when later on it sold the flat to the applicants .", "The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint , alleging violations of their constitutional rights to property and equality before the law .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG constitutional complaint and served its decision on their representative on CARDINAL DATE . It agreed with the findings of the lower courts and added that the letter of ORG of CARDINAL DATE could not be considered a certificate or an extract from the official records , that is , a public document in respect of which it could have been presumed that the information it contained was correct .
