The resulting proposed peace agreement was signed by the NORP delegation but not by the NORP delegation .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The partial collapse of the ORG building caused the deaths of CARDINAL people , including the CARDINAL relatives of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants brought an action in damages in the GPE ORG under Article CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code . The other CARDINAL applicants applied to be joined to the proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants believed that civil liability for the deaths of their relatives lay with the NORP Prime Minister \u2019s ORG and with ORG in LOC ( ORG ) .", "They argued that the NORP courts had jurisdiction to hear the case . In particular , on the basis of the wording of LAW , they submitted that the unlawful act that had caused the alleged damage should be regarded as having been committed in GPE inasmuch as the military action had been organised on NORP territory and part of it had taken place there . They based this argument on the extent of GPE \u2019s commitment \u2013 involving substantial political and logistical support DATE to the military mission in question . Specifically , GPE , unlike other ORG members , had provided the air bases from which the aircraft that had bombed GPE and the ORG had taken off . They also relied in support of their claim on LAW and on LAW of DATE and LAW to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The defendants argued that the NORP courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case . The proceedings against ORG were discontinued by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The Prime Minister \u2019s Office and ORG subsequently sought a preliminary ruling from ORG on the question of jurisdiction ( regolamento preventivo di giurisdizione ) under LAW .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The claim seeks to impute liability to the NORP ORG on the basis of an act of war , in particular the conduct of hostilities through aerial warfare . The choice of the means that will be used to conduct hostilities is an act of government .

In a judgment of DATE ( no . PERSON ) , ORG , sitting as a full court , established the rule that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases against the authorities relating to political acts .", "A trade union had brought an action against the Prime Minister , ORG and ORG on the ground that the government had failed to comply with their undertakings . ORG noted , inter alia , that such a failure could only engage the government \u2019s political responsibility , but could not create a right .

It concerned the jurisdiction of the NORP civil courts to hear claims for compensation for damage sustained by a person who had been captured by the NORP military in DATE and deported to work for NORP industry . GPE had pleaded State immunity and the courts of first instance and appeal had held that they had no jurisdiction to make an order against it . ORG carried out a very extensive examination of the international treaties on international crime , imprescriptibility , the international responsibility of GPE , immunity from jurisdiction and of the case - law of various international tribunals . In holding that the immunity plea failed and the NORP courts had to decide the claim , it stated inter alia :", "\u201c ... In a decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , this full court did indeed rule that acts performed by the ORG in the conduct of hostilities escape all scrutiny by the courts , as they are acts through which \u2018 political\u2019 functions are carried out . The nature of these functions \u2018 precludes any claim to a protected interest in respect thereto , so that there may or may not be a specific content to the acts through which they are performed\u2019 . Pursuant to this principle , the NORP courts were held to have no jurisdiction to hear a claim against the NORP Prime Minister \u2019s Office and ORG for compensation for the destruction of a non - military objective during ORG air strikes against ORG or for the resultant civilian deaths . It is readily apparent , however , firstly , that the fact that the court can not contest the manner in which the actions of the supreme head of the res publica are conducted does not prevent it from finding that a criminal offence has been committed or that there is related liability under the criminal or civil law ( Articles CARDINAL of the LAW ; section LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ; and LAW no . DATE ) ; secondly , by virtue of the principle of adaptation established by LAW , the \u2018 generally recognised\u2019 principles of international law which govern the fundamental values constituted by the freedom and dignity of the human being and characterise the most serious assaults upon the integrity of those values as \u2018 international crimes\u2019 have \u2018 ORG been integrated into our system and are entirely apt for use as a standard whereby the injustice of damage caused to others by intentional or negligent \u2018 acts\u2019 may be gauged . It is evident , therefore , that the principles referred to in this decision can not be taken into consideration in the instant case . ...", "CARDINAL Granting immunity from jurisdiction to GPE who have been guilty of such wrongdoing is in manifest contradiction with the aforementioned normative rules because it constitutes an obstacle to the defence of values whose protection , like these norms and principles , must on the contrary be considered essential for the entire international community , even to the point of justifying forms of mandatory response in the most serious cases . Nor is there any doubt that the antinomy must be resolved by giving priority to the highest ranking norms , as the judges in the minority ( CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) stated in their dissenting opinion appended to the judgment in PERSON [ v.
