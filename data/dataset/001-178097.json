NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lived in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON ORG , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG . ORG did not make use of their right to intervene under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and ORG are the parents of PERSON , born on CARDINAL DATE out of wedlock . The parents were married on CARDINAL DATE and PERSON thereby acquired the status of having been born in wedlock with both parents having joint custody of him . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for sole custody of PERSON and announced that she was planning a divorce . She stated that the child \u2019s best interests would not be guaranteed if she stayed with the applicant . ORG then moved out of the flat , together with PERSON The parents were divorced on DATE . After the divorce the parents maintained joint custody of their child , even though PERSON was living with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application seeking that he be awarded sole custody of PERSON He argued that ORG tried to alienate the child from him and that she actually failed to fulfil her parental duties . On DATE ORG appointed an expert in respect of the question of custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert submitted her report . She concluded that , provided that adequate contact between PERSON and the applicant was ensured , it was in the interests of the well - being of PERSON that custody of him be awarded to ORG In the event that the court were to grant joint custody , the principal residence of PERSON should be with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG reached an agreement on the applicant \u2019s contact rights in respect of PERSON before ORG . That agreement was modified on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON reiterated her application for sole custody , stating that the applicant avoided any communication with her and that she could not see how DATE given this fact DATE joint custody was practicable or feasible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG awarded ORG sole custody and based this decision on the recommendation of a psychological expert . Moreover , the court referred to the fact that PERSON , who was living with his mother , had stated that he wished to continue to do so and had shown a strong emotional link to her . ORG furthermore noted that the applicant had not respected the agreement on contact rights and had on various occasions visited PERSON at DATE conduct which could increase the psychological strain on PERSON and could entail a risk to the wellbeing of the child if joint custody were to be maintained . Since it was not possible under LAW to maintain joint custody after a divorce if the parents did not agree on it the court had to award sole custody , which , for the reasons set out above , had to be granted to ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He argued that the proceedings had been defective because an additional expert report should have been ordered . He furthermore argued that Article CARDINALa of LAW was unconstitutional and in violation of his LAW rights and asked ORG to apply to ORG for judicial review of the constitutionality of this provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the reasoning of ORG . It held in particular that there was no indication of a risk to the child \u2019s best interests if ORG were to hold sole custody of PERSON The applicant had not submitted sufficient reasons for custody not to be granted to ORG , as the mere fact that she was assisted in caring for PERSON by her mother and the fact that PERSON was having difficulties in adapting to his new kindergarten did not cast any doubt on the capacity of ORG to care for PERSON In so far as the applicant made further allegations of misconduct on the part of the mother without offering any evidence , such allegations were not sufficient to necessitate the supplementing of the expert report in the file . The court furthermore held that there were no concerns in terms of constitutional law regarding the fact that it was not possible to maintain joint custody after a divorce if the parents did not agree on it ; thus , it held that the transfer of custody rights was only possible in the event that the child \u2019s best interests were at risk . The court noted , moreover , that the present case was not comparable with the case of ORG v GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , since PERSON had been born in wedlock and the parents had held joint custody in the past . In such a case neither of the parents held a privileged position as regards the award of custody , and LAW was therefore not discriminatory . In any event there was no room for dismissing the application for sole custody lodged by ORG , as the applicant himself had also lodged an application for sole custody and the court therefore had to decide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal since it did not raise any important questions of law . Moreover , ORG found that the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v GPE had to be distinguished from the present case because the underlying facts were fundamentally different . ORG had concerned custody of a child born out of wedlock ( in which case LAW did not provide for joint custody but granted sole custody of the child to the mother ) ; in the present case , PERSON had been born in wedlock , so the parents had initially had joint custody , but that arrangement had failed and as a consequence the courts had had to grant sole custody to CARDINAL of the parents . That decision was served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE amendment to LAW , which entered into force on DATE , the applicant did not lodge an application for joint custody of PERSON According to a statement by the local youth office ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant no longer availed himself of his right to visit PERSON as he had moved to GPE on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , as in force at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the marriage of the parents of a minor legitimate child is dissolved or annulled , the custodial rights of both parents remain intact . However , they may present an agreement to the court DATE even modifying an existing agreement \u2013 regarding custodial responsibility . In this connection it may be agreed that CARDINAL parent alone or both parents shall have custody . Where both parents have custodial powers , those of CARDINAL parent may be limited to specific matters .", "( CARDINAL ) Where both parents have custody , they must submit an agreement to the court regarding the parent with whom the child is to stay primarily . This parent must always be put in charge of all custodial matters .", "( CARDINAL ) The court must approve the agreement of the parents if it serves the interests of the child . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If an agreement in accordance with LAW on the main domicile of the child or on custodial powers is not reached within a reasonable period after a marriage is dissolved or annulled , or if it is incompatible with the interests of the child , the court must decide which parent shall henceforth have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If both parents have custody under LAW after their marriage has been dissolved or annulled , and if one parent applies for the withdrawal of that custody , the court must decide which parent shall have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
