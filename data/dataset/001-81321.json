The applicant was placed in preliminary detention on DATE under an order of an investigator on the suspicion of having raped a minor on DATE , DATE . The arrest was undertaken on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim whereby she had identified the applicant as CARDINAL of the persons who had raped her . On DATE , the preliminary detention of the applicant was extended until DATE by order of a prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Based on the complaint filed by the victim and the evidence collected by the police , a preliminary investigation was opened against the applicant on DATE . On DATE , he was charged with aggravated rape of a defenceless minor perpetrated on CARDINAL occasions on DATE together with another CARDINAL individuals . By virtue of the same order , confirmed by ORG later in DATE , the applicant was detained on remand . He was presented with the aforesaid order and countersigned it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant filed appeals against his detention , which were examined and dismissed by ORG by decision of DATE . The court found that because the applicant was charged with a serious intentional offence there was a risk that he might abscond .", "CARDINAL . NORP The charges against the applicant were amended on DATE and DATE . On both occasions the detention on remand was maintained on the grounds of the applicant 's personality and the seriousness of the offence .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the victim joined the proceedings as a civil claimant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against his detention claiming , inter alia , that he had a permanent address and that the worsening financial situation of his family would preclude any possibility that he might abscond . With a resolution of DATE ORG decreed that the appeal would be examined at the next court hearing .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It considered that there were no new circumstances following his previous appeal of DATE , that he was still charged with a serious intentional offence and , therefore , that there was still a risk that he might abscond , attempt to intimidate the victim and the other witnesses , and obstruct the discovery process in the proceedings . The lack of employment of the applicant was considered a contributory element to the risk that he might abscond . The court did not consider the length of the detention to be a reason onto itself which might justify a reassessment of the justification of the applicant 's deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on appeal by the applicant of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court 's decision on similar grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another appeal against his detention .", "CARDINAL . At the court hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal as it considered that the seriousness of the offence still inferred that he might abscond and re - offend . The court also considered that the length of the applicant 's detention could not in itself warrant his release . At the end of the hearing , the court withdrew to deliver its judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG found the applicant and his CARDINAL accomplices guilty as charged . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and ordered to pay damages to the victim .", "CARDINAL .

There had been CARDINAL wooden beds covered with worn and torn mattresses , blankets and pillows . There had been fleas , cockroaches and mice .", "There had been no windows and the only fresh air entering the cell had come from the corridor through a grate above the door . There had been only artificial light which had been constantly switched on .", "The applicant had to satisfy the needs of nature in a bucket inside the cell , the contents of which were removed twice a day .

In addition and contrary to some of his complaints , he stated that he had been allowed to have visitors , that the food had consisted of meat or fish several times a week , that he had the ability to watch television , listen to the radio and read books and newspapers . The applicant also stated that he had access to other pastimes at this detention facility , that the sanitary facilities had been situated in the cell itself and that pest extermination activities had been undertaken on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , in his declaration , corroborated the applicant 's statements .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) and the NORP courts ' practice before DATE are summarised in the ORG 's judgments in several similar cases ( see , among others , ORG v.

On the basis of the relevant law before DATE , when ruling on appeals against pre - trial detention of a person charged with having committed a \u201c serious \u201d offence , the domestic courts generally disregarded facts and arguments concerning the existence or absence of a danger of the accused person 's absconding or committing offences and stated that every person accused of having committed a serious offence must be remanded in custody unless exceptional circumstances dictated otherwise ( see decisions of the domestic authorities criticised by ORG in the cases of NORP and PERSON , both cited above , and PERSON v. GPE , no . PERSON , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

In respect of the regime of detention and conditions of detention , the relevant domestic law and practice under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG has been summarised in the cases of PERSON v.

The Pazardzhik Prison was visited by the ORG in DATE , while ORG was visited both in DATE and in DATE . The report from the latter visit has not yet been made public .", "CARDINAL . There are also general observations about the problems in all ORG detention facilities in the DATE , DATE and DATE visit reports .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that most , albeit not all , of the ORG detention facilities were overcrowded . With the exception of CARDINAL detention facility where conditions were slightly better , the conditions were as follows : cells did not have access to natural light ; the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently ; ventilation was inadequate ; the cleanliness of the bedding and the cells as a whole left much to be desired ; detainees could access a sanitary facility twice a day ( morning and evening ) for TIME and could take a DATE shower ; outside of the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilets , detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in buckets inside the cells ; although according to the establishments ' internal regulations detainees were entitled to a \u201c DATE walk \u201d of TIME , it was often reduced to TIME or not allowed at all ; no other form of out - of - cell activity was provided to persons detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity . In particular , the DATE 's \u201c hot meal \u201d generally consisted of a watery soup ( often lukewarm ) and inadequate quantities of bread . At the other meals , detainees only received bread and a little cheese or halva . Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu . Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery \u2013 not even a spoon was provided .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG also noted that family visits and correspondence were only possible with express permission by a public prosecutor and that , as a result , detainees ' contacts with the outside world were very limited . There was no radio or television .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the NORP authorities had failed in their obligation to provide detention conditions which were consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that \u201c almost without exception , the conditions in the ORG detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading \u201d . In reaction , the NORP authorities agreed that the ORG delegation 's assessment had been \u201c objective and correctly presented \u201d but indicated that the options for improvement were limited by the country 's difficult financial circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG recommended to the NORP authorities , inter alia , that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided , that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly , that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products ( soap , toothpaste , etc . ) , that custodial staff be instructed that detainees should be allowed to leave their cells during DATE for the purpose of using a toilet facility unless overriding security considerations required otherwise , that the regulation providing for TIME exercise per day be fully respected in practice , that cell lighting and ventilation be improved , that the regime of family visits be revised and that pre - trial detainees be more often transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed . The possibility of offering detainees TIME outdoor exercise per day was to be examined as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . The ORG established that ORG had CARDINAL cells , situated in the basement , and at the time of the visit accommodated QUANTITY detainees , including QUANTITY women in a separate cell .", "CARDINAL . Six cells measuring QUANTITY were designed to accommodate CARDINAL detainees ; the other CARDINAL , intended for CARDINAL occupants , measured CARDINAL - and - QUANTITY . This occupancy rate was being complied with at the time of the visit and from the living space standpoint was deemed acceptable by the ORG . However , all the remaining shortcomings observed in the other ORG detention facilities \u2013 dirty and tattered bedding , no access to natural light , absence of activities , limited access to sanitary facilities , etc . \u2013 also applied there . Even the TIME exercise rule , provided for in the internal regulations and actually posted on cell doors , was not observed .", "CARDINAL . In this report the ORG found , inter alia , that the prison was seriously overcrowded and that prisoners were obliged to spend most of DATE in their dormitories , mostly confined to their beds because of lack of space . It also found the central heating to be inadequate and that only some of the dormitories were fitted with sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that new rules providing for better conditions had been enacted but had not yet resulted in significant improvements .", "CARDINAL . In most investigation detention facilities visited in DATE , with the exception of a newly opened detention facility in GPE , conditions of detention were generally the same as those observed during the ORG 's DATE visit , as regards poor hygiene , overcrowding , problematic access to toilet / shower facilities and a total absence of outdoor exercise and outofcell activities . In some places , the situation had even deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG detention facility , as well as in CARDINAL other places , detainees \u201c had to eat with their fingers , not having been provided with appropriate cutlery \u201d .", "DATE . During DATE visit some improvements were noted in the country 's investigation detention facilities , severely criticised in previous reports . However , a great deal remained to be done : most detainees continued to spend DATE on end locked up in overcrowded cells TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . Concerning prisons , the ORG drew attention to the problem of overcrowding and to the shortage of work and other activities for inmates ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
