At the time of the events giving rise to their application , the applicants and their families were living in the town of ORG in GPE ( south - east GPE ) .

Section E ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) contains excerpts of the summary of the evidence given to ORG Delegates by PERSON and PERSON . Section F ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) sets out the documents submitted by the parties to the Commission and the ORG relating to the assessment of damage .", "CARDINAL . Lice was a small town with a population of , very approximately , CARDINAL people . Following an earthquake in DATE many of the houses had been rebuilt in materials which , if set alight , burned easily . Many of the citizens had built stables close to their houses out of mud ; these offered greater protection from fire . The official buildings were more substantial . ORG was built on a hillside , the northernmost part of the town being significantly higher than the southern side .", "CARDINAL . There had previously been considerable ORG activity both within and in the vicinity of ORG . Attacks within ORG were directed against ORG buildings and occurred at TIME . In the surrounding area , attacks were not confined to TIME of darkness . A short time before the events at issue there had been an operation outside ORG which resulted in the bodies of CARDINAL dead terrorists being brought to ORG for the necessary administrative formalities to be carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a large scale , pre - planned operation was carried out in ORG by security forces , notably gendarmes , who opened fire indiscriminately . Before firing commenced , artillery had been placed across the ORG road , people in coffee shops had been instructed by gendarmes to go home and children whose parents were in the security forces had been collected from school . Soon after the firing started , helicopters arrived . Some of these were combat helicopters , rather than troop carriers , and machine guns operating out of them were used to fire into the town . Shots were also fired from , notably , the police headquarters , the gendarme commando unit compound , the gendarme station and the regional boarding school where military units were stationed . There was no ORG presence in the town and there was no incoming fire , which explains why these security buildings sustained little or no damage .", "CARDINAL . Any clashes between the ORG and the security forces that took place on DATE occurred to the south and south - east of ORG . In the morning , a police vehicle had come under attack on the ORG road as it made its way to a petrol station . DATE , the ORG commando unit which had left town early in the morning to conduct an operation elsewhere was attacked as it attempted to re - enter ORG near the creek which runs from north to south to the east of Lice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The residents of the north - westerly neighbourhood of ORG , where the houses of all applicants except PERSON were situated , heard the sounds of bullets impacting on the walls of their homes and stables . They saw members of the security forces driving round in armoured vehicles , firing randomly , and they also saw them on foot \u2013 the security forces were not being fired at . They saw and heard helicopters and heard explosions close by , just after the helicopters had passed overhead .", "CARDINAL . PERSON house in the ORG neighbourhood in the south - east of ORG was deliberately set alight by security forces on DATE . The houses of the other applicants were deliberately burned by security forces the following morning , after the shooting had stopped . At TIME people were ordered out of their houses by security forces without being given the opportunity to gather their possessions . The first group , consisting of the households of the applicants PERSON and PERSON ORG and their neighbours , was gathered in an open area opposite their homes . The security forces broke down doors and/or windows and set fire to the houses with the use of a weapon in the shape of a long tube . The houses situated lower down in the neighbourhood were already on fire by the time the households belonging to the family of the applicant PERSON were ordered out of their homes and taken to join the others . The family of the applicant PERSON were made to leave their home later and by that time the group gathered in the open area had already left for the square near the police headquarters .", "CARDINAL . A large number of people were made to wait in that square for TIME for the arrival of the Provincial Governor . The Governor , speaking in NORP , told the people that the ORG was responsible for the destruction . A middle - aged man and a young woman protested that the soldiers had set fire to the houses ; the man was taken away and beaten up , the woman was arrested . Following the Governor 's speech a curfew was imposed . Upon returning to their houses the applicants found nothing but a pile of ashes . After the curfew was lifted they left ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained to the public prosecutor . He did not formally record their complaints but he did make arrangements for damage assessment reports to be drawn up . The applicants received no compensation . No investigation was launched into the actions of the security forces until the notification of the present application to the Government by the ORG , despite the applicants ' complaints and allegations of a similar nature being widely reported in the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the ORG launched an attack on ORG which continued until TIME . The security forces had to respond . Despite the precautions taken by the security forces , CARDINAL of their members were killed and CARDINAL was injured . Among the civilian population CARDINAL people died and CARDINAL were injured . In the course of the ORG attack and the defence by the security forces certain houses and shops were damaged .", "CARDINAL . The ORG acted immediately in support of the inhabitants of ORG . Tents were distributed . Buildings and shops that had been damaged were repaired after the damage had been assessed . Money was paid to shop owners whose merchandise had been damaged . Houses were repaired ; however , no money was paid to house owners .", "CARDINAL . In the town of ORG a large part of the population lived in prefabricated housing , erected after an earthquake . These dwellings were made of materials which , if set alight , burned easily .", "CARDINAL . In DATE there was a sizeable security force presence based in ORG . There was a police force and a central gendarmerie . The district gendarmerie headquarters was also based in ORG , sharing a building with the central gendarmerie . There was also a commando unit , attached to the gendarmerie and stationed in its own compound . According to the commander of that unit , PERSON , that compound also housed a mechanised infantry company . In addition , there appeared to have been an infantry battalion billeted at or near the regional boarding school at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . The evidence obtained concerning the frequency of attacks carried out on ORG by the ORG was contradictory . Most of the Government witnesses stated before the Delegates that official buildings were attacked by terrorists on a regular basis and they named a number of buildings which had been destroyed by terrorists . A number of the applicants and their witnesses , however , contended that no clashes had taken place in or around ORG , or that such clashes had been confined to the surrounding areas and the mountains . In their final observations to the Commission , the applicants , referring to newspaper cuttings , submitted that the ORG had avoided attacking ORG for DATE in order to spare the civil population . Although this tallied with the testimony of LOC , who said that there had been clashes in the past but that they had stopped , PERSON Delidere and PERSON PERSON told the Delegates that there had been clashes , tension and violence in ORG prior to DATE , Delidere adding that no one in ORG would go out after dark .", "CARDINAL . From other cases that the ORG had dealt with concerning events in south - east GPE , it had become clear that ORG activity was rife in DATE . The evidence with which it was presented in the instant case did not persuade the ORG that this level of ORG activity would have been significantly different in ORG . The ORG further found credible the evidence \u2013 offered by both the applicants ' and the Government 's witnesses DATE that ORG attacks mainly took place at TIME . ORG also found it established that about a fortnight prior to the events at issue there had been an incident outside ORG during which CARDINAL terrorists were killed and their bodies taken to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission was prepared to accept , however , that those applicants and witnesses who professed to have no knowledge whatsoever of ORG activities in ORG or its vicinity may well have done so out of fear , and it considered that this did not necessarily affect the credibility of the rest of their testimony . It noted in this respect that police chief constable GPE and the gendarme officers PERSON and PERSON indicated that the voicing of accusations against the ORG could well have adverse consequences for the individual concerned .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that according to the applicants , the town of ORG was not attacked by the ORG on DATE but was deliberately destroyed by security forces in a pre - planned operation . In their view , the most likely motive for this action , given previous incidents in the town , was to terrorise the local population and to ' teach them a lesson ' for their alleged sympathy for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Also according to the applicants , there was no evidence , either in the form of casualties or damage to security buildings , of any ORG presence in the town on DATE . They nevertheless conceded that the attacks on the police vehicle and subsequently on the returning commando unit which , they submitted , took place outside the town , to the south - east , could plausibly be attributed to terrorists .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the position of the petrol station where the police vehicle was shot at was not indicated on the map provided by the Government ( PERSON to the ORG 's report ) . On the map submitted by the applicants it featured ( as \u201c Garage \u201d ) just outside ORG ( Appendix III to the ORG 's report ) . Neither map containing an indication of scale , it was difficult to assess how far outside the town the petrol station was situated . Nevertheless , it did not appear to be in dispute that the shots fired came from the LOC rather than the town .", "CARDINAL . The Commission was less inclined to accept , however , that the attack on the returning commando unit also occurred outside the town . It observed that according to the gendarmerie incident report of CARDINAL DATE , the armoured vehicle which was to collect the commando unit was sent to an area in the vicinity of the ORG neighbourhood , that \u015eahap PERSON 's report described this area as situated \u201c in the south of the district and to the south of the commando unit compound \u201d and that in his oral testimony Mr PERSON stated that he had instructed the commando unit to enter ORG through the creek bed in the ORG neighbourhood to the south of the commando unit compound . Again , in the absence of an indication of scale on the maps it was difficult to place this event with accuracy , but it would appear that the creek mentioned ran quite close to the inhabited area of the ORG neighbourhood . More importantly , Mr PERSON added that shots had been fired from houses facing the creek . The ORG found that the evidence before it thus pointed to a presence of ORG members or militiamen [ Nota : Militiamen : term used to describe members of the civilian population who provide the ORG with food , shelter and/or information . ] in at least some part of the town .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also argued that the availability of helicopters very soon after the shooting started served as a further indication of the planned nature of the operation . The ORG noted that a considerable number of witnesses , including members of the security forces , testified to the presence of helicopters . Both in his report and in his account to the Delegates , \u015eahap ORG related how helicopters had been used to transport injured persons , including General PERSON , to hospital in GPE and how armed Cobra helicopters had been deployed . It was only police chief constable PERSON according to whom just CARDINAL helicopters had briefly flown over GPE around TIME : CARDINAL a troop carrier and CARDINAL with fire - power which had been sent in order to enable the first helicopter to land but which had returned to ORG upon learning that that first helicopter had been forced to put down at PERSON . The Delegates found PERSON an evasive and rather reluctant witness who was unwilling to acknowledge pieces of information unless these were directly put to him from the various incident reports . Although his ignorance of the actions of the various gendarmerie units appeared genuine and he might therefore not have had direct knowledge of the request for helicopters emanating from the gendarmerie , the Commission considered it scarcely credible that he would not have become aware of the presence of these helicopters as events unfolded .", "CARDINAL . As to the time of arrival of the various helicopters , GPE told the Delegates that he had seen CARDINAL helicopters arrive from the direction of ORG TIME after the shooting had commenced . ORG stated that helicopters had been flying around throughout DATE . The Commission observed that it appeared from PERSON account that CARDINAL helicopter , with General PERSON on board , had landed at the commando unit compound TIME and also that the commando unit 's single helicopter had been sent to ORG early on in DATE . Although there had , therefore , been helicopters flying over ORG at an early stage , the helicopters used to transport the wounded and the armed Cobra helicopters did not arrive until later . The Government denied that any orders had been given to the helicopter forces prior to the events . However , they failed to comply with the ORG 's request to submit the operational orders for these forces . The ORG found this regrettable , given that the orders would presumably have been able to clarify at what time the helicopters had taken off .", "CARDINAL . Although PERSON was adamant that no shots or bombs had been fired from helicopters , the Commission found it established that armed helicopters were deployed and that shots were fired from them . However , it remained in dispute whether this shooting was at all directed at populated areas or , as Mr PERSON maintained , confined to the areas to the north of ORG . The ORG found some strength in the argument that indiscriminate gunfire from helicopters over the town would have endangered the security forces on the ground , especially if , as the applicants alleged , members of these forces were moving around on foot .", "CARDINAL . In spite of the above , the ORG considered that no clear picture of events emerged from the account , given both in writing and orally , by members of the security forces . In this context it noted in the first place the diverging recollections of the police on the one hand and the gendarmerie on the other . The differing accounts relating to the presence and number of helicopters had already been addressed . In addition , whereas police chief constable GPE estimated that CARDINAL terrorists had been ensconced in the mosque , gendarme officer PERSON put this number at CARDINAL and reckoned that in the town as a whole a maximum of CARDINAL terrorists had been present . The ORG was struck by the apparent lack of communication and coordination between the police and gendarmerie which the oral testimony of PERSON in particular brought to the fore : even after the events , this official , who was in charge of the local police force , appeared to be in the dark about many aspects of what had transpired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The successful escape of all terrorists allegedly present in the town was also rather surprising , as this was said to have occurred at a time when the security forces would by far have outnumbered the terrorists . Even if the ORG accepted that the terrorists ' escape route , northwards through the creek to the west of the ORG neighbourhood , was impossible to secure , it was not clear how they would have reached that part of the town . This question was even more pertinent in respect of the terrorists allegedly hiding in the mosque and who only had CARDINAL gates available to them to make their way out of an otherwise walled - in area .", "CARDINAL . The Commission further observed that no satisfactory explanation had been provided for the limited amount of damage sustained by buildings belonging to the security forces , despite the fact that these were said to be the terrorists ' main targets . It noted that the police headquarters was not even included in the report of determination of damaged buildings . Given that these buildings were allegedly not only subjected to gunfire but also to rocket attacks , the ORG was not convinced that the mere fact that these buildings were made out of more solid materials than most of the houses could account for this .", "CARDINAL . Although the ORG was thus of the opinion that a disturbing amount of relevant questions remained unanswered , it considered this an insufficient basis for a conclusive finding that no clash whatsoever took place on DATE , particularly given that it had similarly not been able to rule out a terrorist presence in some part of the town .", "CARDINAL . PERSON submitted that on DATE his house and his barn situated in the ORG neighbourhood were deliberately set alight by soldiers .", "CARDINAL . It was not in dispute that his house was damaged and that an assessment of the damage was carried out . PERSON told the Delegates that he had not obtained a copy of the relevant documents relating to the assessment , but the Government provided the file number under which his request for an assessment had been registered . Moreover , PERSON property was listed in the report on determination of damaged buildings as having sustained medium damage . While the foregoing allowed the ORG to find it established that PERSON property was damaged , the parties did not agree on whether the security forces or the ORG caused the damage , and the Commission therefore had to assess the evidence relating to this issue .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it had serious doubts about the accuracy of the record of the search of a house dated DATE according to which a number of empty PERSON cartridges were found in Mr PERSON 's house . In this respect , it noted in the first place that PERSON told the Delegates that it would have been impossible to find anything amongst the burned remains of his property . More importantly , it appeared that PERSON was at no stage questioned by the authorities about these cartridges : neither in DATE following DATE despite the facts that a considerable number of people had been arrested , that PERSON had been staying near his home and that he had in fact remained in ORG longer than many other people \u2013 , nor on the occasion when he was asked to make a statement to a public prosecutor DATE after the event . Indeed , the assertions that cartridges were found in his house struck the Commission as implausible or at least very doubtful .", "CARDINAL . It was true that there were some discrepancies between PERSON statement to the ORG branch of ORG ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) and his testimony before the Delegates , notably with regard to the question whether he attended the speech given by ORG on DATE . According to the statement to the ORG this had been the case , but before ORG said that he was not aware of any such speech having been made and he had not attended it .", "CARDINAL . The wording of the part of PERSON statement to the ORG that related to the Governor 's speech was very similar to the wording used in the statements of PERSON and PERSON and it seemed likely that parts of CARDINAL statement were copied and used in respect of other applicants . ORG , recalling that it had previously had occasion to remark critically on the accuracy of statements taken by the ORG branch of the ORG , stressed that it could not be expected to guess at possible explanations for inaccuracies encountered in such statements .", "CARDINAL . The Delegates ' general assessment of PERSON oral evidence was that it was somewhat confused but , nevertheless , frank and convincing . In their observation of PERSON demeanour the Delegates obtained the impression that he was sincere in his testimony and that he was a credible witness . The Delegates were of the opinion that any discrepancies between PERSON oral evidence and his statement to the ORG were due more to a lack of attention to particular detail than indicative of any untruthfulness in his account . ORG was prepared to accept that this might explain why PERSON told the Delegates that his daughter PERSON had been in his house on DATE whereas according to his statement to the HRA NORP was married and living in GPE . It appeared in any event from his oral evidence that after the lifting of the curfew PERSON family had left ORG and had moved in with his daughter in ORG so that , regardless of whether NORP was in ORG or not on DATE , it did not appear in dispute that her home was in ORG .", "CARDINAL . While the Commission found that it could not be excluded that on DATE a clash took place between the ORG and the security forces and that there could well have been a presence of either ORG or militiamen in the ORG neighbourhood where PERSON house was situated , it did not consider the possibility of such a clash having occurred to be sufficient to cast doubt on the veracity of PERSON affirmations regarding the origin of the damage to his property . Moreover , his account was on this point entirely consistent with the allegations made by the other applicants in regard to the destruction of their property .", "CARDINAL . Making a global assessment , the ORG found it established that PERSON property and possessions were deliberately burned by security forces on DATE . As a result of this destruction Mr PERSON 's family moved to ORG , followed some time later by PERSON PERSON himself .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it was not in dispute that on TIME DATE the shooting had come to an end . It was , moreover , not in dispute that the houses of the applicants PERSON , PERSON , GPE and PERSON in the NORP neighbourhood were destroyed \u2013 this was confirmed by the report on determination of damaged buildings .", "CARDINAL . According to the eye - witness accounts of events on DATE given by the applicants PERSON and PERSON and the witnesses T\u00fcrkan , PERSON and PERSON , GPE and PERSON , soldiers came to the LOC neighbourhood that morning , ordered the people out of their homes and proceeded to set the houses alight . Most of these witnesses also described how the houses were set alight either by a pipe - shaped instrument or by something being thrown into the houses , GPE mentioning both methods . PERSON saw his own house being set on fire by soldiers and PERSON and PERSON had witnessed this as well . Moreover , ORG and T\u00fcrkan , PERSON and PERSON saw PERSON house on fire . These witnesses , except for PERSON , also saw PERSON house burning . T\u00fcrkan and PERSON saw GPE house on fire . Moreover , T\u00fcrkan Ekmek\u00e7i saw soldiers surrounding the house of PERSON the moment this caught fire . PERSON and PERSON saw that PERSON house was on fire .", "CARDINAL . Several witnesses told the Delegates that the soldiers who burned the houses had operated in groups . The Commission observed in this respect that teams made up of members of various commando units were active inside the town on TIME DATE . According to the commando unit commander PERSON these teams carried out searches .", "CARDINAL . Most of the applicants and witnesses concerned stated that before they were made to go to the square in front of the police headquarters , where they were to be addressed by ORG , they had been gathered in an area near the school except for the PERSON family who were the last to leave the neighbourhood . Upon their return to the ORG neighbourhood they found their houses burned down .", "CARDINAL . The Delegates found these applicants and witnesses convincing , even if the evidence of the more elderly ones was at times somewhat confused . The ORG considered that their accounts were detailed and on the whole consistent .", "CARDINAL . The Government 's witnesses maintained , however , that no houses were set alight on DATE but that houses had burned down DATE as a result of fighting between the ORG and security forces . Yet those inhabitants of the ORG neighbourhood who appeared before the Delegates and who had been in ORG on CARDINAL and DATE were adamant that their houses had still been intact at daybreak of that DATE . In this respect the Commission found significant the assumption expressed by the police chief constable PERSON that the people of Lice would have slept in their own homes in TIME CARDINAL DATE or perhaps , because they were scared , in the house of a neighbour or of relatives . He appeared to discount the fact that if CARDINAL houses had been destroyed in the course of DATE it would have been impossible for people to stay in their own homes or those of most of their neighbours and relatives . This also led the Commission to make the observation that in all likelihood there would have been many more casualties and injured if all of the CARDINAL houses that ended up damaged or destroyed had caught fire on DATE since this implied that a very large number of people would have been out in the open , looking for shelter , perhaps attempting to put out the fires , amidst the heavy gunfire of DATE . The testimonies of the afore - mentioned applicants and witnesses before the Delegates , on the contrary , contained convincing accounts of how they had spent TIME of CARDINAL DATE sheltering from gunfire rather than fire . At no stage had this evidence been disputed or any kind of suggestion made as to where these people would have spent TIME if they were not where they said they were .", "CARDINAL . The Commission thus accepted that ORG , for instance , spent TIME CARDINAL DATE in her brother PERSON 's house . PERSON and PERSON Ekmek\u00e7i took shelter in their barn on DATE and spent TIME either in that barn or , as PERSON stated , in their house \u2013 PERSON not specifically mentioning where she spent TIME . Consequently , the destruction of GPE house and PERSON house and barn , as documented in the report on determination of damaged buildings must have taken place after DATE . While this element deprived the account presented by the ORG 's witnesses of credibility , it rendered that of the CARDINAL applicants concerned all the more probable .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the evidence as a whole , the ORG found that the property and possessions in ORG of the applicants PERSON , PERSON , GPE and PERSON were deliberately burned by security forces on DATE . This led to these applicants and their families leaving the town .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that no investigation was lodged into allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the security forces until the present application was referred to the respondent Government , despite the fact that a number of Government witnesses told the Delegates that , not long after the incident , they had become aware of the existence of allegations that houses had been burned deliberately by security forces . Police chief constable PERSON had read reports to that effect in the newspapers and judge PERSON had heard women voice such accusations while he was carrying out damage assessments , but neither man appeared to have seen any cause to inform the public prosecutor . PERSON had also been apprised of these allegations through newspaper- and television reports . In the light of this evidence , PERSON statement that no newspapers were available appeared untrue .", "CARDINAL . The applicants PERSON and PERSON stated that they went to the public prosecutor 's office but that they did not receive any help . However , public prosecutor PERSON told the Delegates that he had not received any complaints of security forces deliberately having burned down houses . Even though the Commission could not rule out the possibility , put forward by PERSON , that people had in fact gone to the judge of the Magistrates ' Court rather than to him , it found it nevertheless peculiar that PERSON would not have read about allegations of wrongdoing by the security forces in the newspapers whereas PERSON and PERSON had . It is clear that various newspapers reported the allegations and the ORG was less than impressed with PERSON statement that he would have made enquiries into the underlying facts of such reports had he read them .", "CARDINAL . The Commission further observed that the investigation launched after the present application was brought to the attention of the ORG , and which ended with a decision of non - prosecution being taken by ORG , still did not address the complaints of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL applicants , namely that their houses had been burned on CARDINAL rather than DATE . Finding that he lacked jurisdiction , ORG public prosecutor PERSON referred the investigation to ORG , after having obtained statements from CARDINAL of the applicants . PERSON , who was in charge of the subsequent investigation , requested the police to take statements from the applicants but it appeared that he drew up his report on the matter at a time when a statement from CARDINAL of the applicants , PERSON , had in fact been taken . The Commission noted that although this statement contains a very clear accusation of wrongdoing on the part of the security forces , Mr PERSON did not judge it necessary to hear any security force personnel . From the text of his report and his testimony before the Delegates , it seemed to the Commission that his attitude towards the complaints brought by the applicants was seriously prejudiced and that these complaints did not receive serious consideration .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG found that no effective investigation was carried out .", "CARDINAL . The following are excerpts from the summary of the oral evidence as set out in the ORG 's report ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , given to ORG Delegates by PERSON , a judge in ORG at the relevant time :", "\u201c CARDINAL applications for damage assessment had subsequently been filed . Such an assessment could only be carried out if a person requested it , and the findings of the on - site inspection would serve as the basis for any future law - suit .", "...", "The owners of the property had received a copy of the damage assessment report . Such a report constituted evidence . A claim for compensation could subsequently be filed with the administrative courts . Not all the people had understood this . Some had thought that they were going to receive material assistance or money directly from him . Although he had not been obliged to do so , he had usually attempted to explain that they had to apply to the administrative courts .", "He did not know if any other teams had collected evidence as to the cause of the fires . He did , however , think that a team came from the office of the Provincial Governor to establish the extent of the destruction to property . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The following are excerpts from the summary of the oral evidence as set out in the ORG 's report ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , given to ORG Delegates by PERSON , Governor of GPE province at the relevant time :", "\u201c He had gone to ORG a little after TIME on DATE . He had informed the security forces TIME beforehand that he wanted to find out about the problems of the citizens and determine in what way they could be helped . ... He had ... found a group of CARDINAL people waiting for him in an open area near the police headquarters . He assumed that they had been told by the security forces that they could ask him for assistance . ...", "Using a car microphone he had then made a speech in which he had emphasised the harmfulness of terrorism . He had assured the people that the ORG would compensate all the damage they had suffered .", "All the people had asked for was for their damage to be repaired . He had sent CARDINAL technical committees to ORG to have the damage suffered by each and every person determined . He had ordered for the shops to be repaired . In order to secure normal living conditions he had given priority to the shops . ...", "The damage assessment which he had ordered only concerned buildings and not the contents of those buildings . Within the limits of the budget of the province he had provided the necessary help . He had subsequently sent the assessments to GPE and had asked the Government for assistance . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before the ORG , the applicants submitted a \u201c Report on Determination of Damaged Buildings \u201d , which had been given to the ORG by the ORG public prosecutor . The third section of this report lists CARDINAL owners of CARDINAL private homes and/or stables and the extent of damage sustained by these properties ( the preceding sections of the report concern commercial premises and public buildings ) . According to this section of the report , the houses of PERSON ( spelled PERSON ) , Nadir Doman ( spelled PERSON ) and PERSON were destroyed , the house and stable of PERSON were destroyed , and the house of PERSON sustained medium damage .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before the ORG the applicants , apart from PERSON , also submitted experts ' reports relating to the inspections carried out at their request by a judge of ORG and an independent expert . These inspections were aimed at establishing that the roof and walls of their houses had burned down and collapsed , that their possessions inside the houses had burned , as well as at the identification of the remains .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and again on DATE , the ORG submitted the documents of this damage assessment procedure \u201c in relation to the properties of PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , serious confrontations have occurred in the south - east of GPE between the security forces and members of the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) . This confrontation has claimed the lives of CARDINAL of civilians and members of the security forces .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL principal decrees relating to the south - eastern region have been made under the PERSON on ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . The first , Decree no .

Under LAW b ) and ( d ) of the LAW , all private and public security forces and ORG are at the disposal of the Regional Governor .", "CARDINAL . The second , Decree no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) , reinforced the powers of ORG , for example to order transfers out of the region of public officials and employees , including judges and prosecutors , and provided in LAW", "\u201c No criminal , financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this Decree , and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end .
