On DATE the Cheryomushkinskiy District Court of GPE dismissed the authorities\u2019 claim and granted the applicant \u2019s counterclaim , recognising her as the legitimate owner of the flat .

On DATE criminal proceedings against an \u201c unidentified perpetrator \u201d were instituted on suspicion of fraud in the process of privatisation of the flat . The applicant requested to be granted victim status in these proceedings , but this was refused on the grounds that the damage resulting from the fraud was caused to ORG , not to the applicant . The decision refusing the applicant victim status was taken by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the privatisation of the flat by PERSON . had been fraudulent . It established , in particular , that the civil act registration authority had found no record of a marriage between PERSON and PERSON . and concluded that their marriage certificate had been forged . Therefore PERSON . had had no right to be registered at PERSON \u2019s address or to privatise his flat after his death . In respect of the applicant , it found that she was a bona fide buyer , within the meaning of LAW . However , it found that the flat , having been fraudulently privatised , had left the possession of GPE , its lawful owner , without that body having the intention to divest itself of it . Thus , by application of LAW ruling ORG of DATE , the case fell under CARDINAL of the CARDINAL exceptions to the protection of a bona fide buyer \u2019s title , which required that precedence be given to the previous owner . The applicant \u2019s title to the flat was accordingly revoked and GPE declared the flat \u2019s lawful owner . The court ordered the applicant \u2019s eviction without compensation or an offer of alternative housing . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Ombudsman wrote to the Mayor of GPE , asking him to consider offering the applicant a social tenancy of the flat . However , on DATE ORG replied in the negative , stating that this would undermine the order of priority on the waiting list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating authority decided to grant the applicant victim status in the criminal proceedings and questioned her in this capacity . On DATE , however , they overruled that decision as unfounded , following an order by the prosecutor that they should do so .", "CARDINAL . The criminal investigation of the suspected fraud was then suspended on the grounds that no culprit had been identified . The file , however , contained certain material on the basis of which the courts were able to establish that the privatisation had been carried out improperly . It included , in particular , the finding that all acts relating to PERSON . \u2019s registration as a resident of the flat , its privatisation and sale to ORG had been carried out using PERSON . \u2019s passport , which had been declared lost in DATE . It also contained a reply from the municipal authorities of PERSON that they had no record of PERSON . \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s marriage having been registered in DATE . The PERSON passport authorities had replied to the investigator that PERSON . had been previously registered as a resident of PERSON , and her registration there had not been removed until her death in DATE . There was also a reply from public notary NORP that she had had no records of PERSON \u2019s application in her register and she denied having certified it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was rejected in the final instance by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested a suspension of the execution of the judgment in so far as it concerned the eviction . On DATE the court granted her request and adjourned the eviction until DATE . This term was later extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General requested ORG to examine the applicant \u2019s case in supervisory review proceedings . He considered the revocation of her ownership of the flat unlawful and unjustified . First , he argued that the rule contained in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code ordering reinstatement of ownership of the property which was removed from its owner \u2019s possession without the owner \u2019s intention to divest itself of it was inapplicable in her case . He pointed out that ORG was a party to the transaction in which the flat had been privatised and could not be unaware of it ; the ORG had never claimed that the official in charge of the privatisation had gone beyond her authority or acted contrary to instructions . Hence it could not be said that the flat had been privatised without the ORG having that intention . Therefore , the applicant , as a bona fide buyer , should not have been required to return the flat to its earlier owner , GPE . Secondly , the Deputy Prosecutor General considered that the judicial decisions had not balanced the interests of the municipality against the lawful rights and interests of the applicant , whereas the protection of individual citizens should have taken priority , in accordance with LAW . As a result of a third - party fraud , a single mother and her child faced eviction without compensation and without an offer of alternative housing . He noted that she had no other housing and that all her savings had been put into the purchase of the flat and the costly litigation . Finally , he pointed out that the courts had exceeded their responsibility in applying LAW , in lieu of LAW on which the plaintiff had relied , and had thereby granted the award beyond the scope of the claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request by the Deputy Prosecutor General , declining to reconsider the case in supervisory - review proceedings . It noted that the applicant \u2019s status as a bona fide buyer had not been in doubt at any stage . However , the courts had correctly applied the law and granted the plaintiff \u2019s lawful claims . It added that the applicant remained free to sue PERSON for damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s application for further suspension of the execution of the judgment of DATE , noting that there had already been CARDINAL extensions and there were no grounds for another .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City Ombudsman wrote to the Mayor of GPE , alerting him to a growing number of cases of flats being repossessed by GPE against bona fide buyers on account of irregular privatisation by the previous owners of the flats ; all of them were being denied any compensation or substitute housing . In his view , the incidents of fraudulent privatisation should not have been treated by courts as cases where property was removed from possession \u201c without the owner \u2019s intention to divest \u201d within the meaning of LAW . He pointed out that privatisations were transactions entered into by the ORG , represented by its public officials , whose duty was to make all the necessary checks and to ensure the procedural integrity of the transaction . The responsibility of the ORG was thus engaged wherever they failed in this task . In any event , failure to identify documents as forged could not in such circumstances be classified as passage of title without the owner \u2019s intention to divest . He referred to the applicant \u2019s case as CARDINAL flagrant example of a wrong and unjust outcome of the erroneous interpretation adopted by GPE courts in such cases . On DATE he sent letters to ORG and the head of ORG of the Interior , citing the applicant \u2019s case , calling for the thorough investigation of fraud cases of this type , and requesting that the applicant \u2019s victim status be reassessed in the relevant criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s latest submissions , she has not yet been evicted but considers it imminent .", "CARDINAL . The Civil Code provides for CARDINAL different avenues by which one \u2019s property title may be challenged by a previous owner :", "\u201c CARDINAL . An invalid transaction shall not entail legal consequences , with the exception of those connected with its invalidity , and shall be invalid from the moment of its conclusion .", "CARDINAL . NORP If a transaction has been recognised as invalid , each of the parties shall be obliged to return to the other party all it has received as part of the transaction , and if return is impossible in kind ( including where the transaction concerns the use of property , work performed or services rendered ) , its cost shall be reimbursed in money - unless other consequences of the invalidity of the transactions have been stipulated by law .", "CARDINAL . If it follows from the content of the disputed transaction that it may only be terminated for the future , the court , while recognising the transaction as invalid , shall terminate its operation for the future . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the property has been purchased for a price from a person who had no right to alienate it , and the acquirer is unaware and could not have been aware ( the bona fide acquirer , or the acquirer in good faith ) , the owner shall have the right to reclaim this property from the acquirer , if the said property was lost by the owner or by the person into whose possession the owner has passed the property , or if it was stolen from CARDINAL or the other , or if it has left their possession in another way , in the absence of intention on their part to divest themselves of it .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the property has been acquired without consideration from a person who had no right to alienate it , the owner shall have the right to reclaim the property in all cases .", "CARDINAL . Money and securities in respect of the property shall not be reclaimed from the bona fide acquirer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By its ruling of DATE , DATE , ORG interpreted LAW as not allowing the first owner to reclaim his property from a bona fide buyer unless there is a special legislative provision to this effect . Instead , a claim vindicating prior rights ( \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u043a ) could be lodged under LAW if the conditions indicated in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL are met , in particular if the property has left the owner \u2019s possession in the absence of intention on the part of him or her to divest themselves of it , or if the property has been acquired without consideration .", "CARDINAL .
