He said that the applicant had taken her underpants off , possibly before her injuries , but had not put them on again before leaving the toilet ; he had therefore collected them and put them in his pocket . She had already started to bleed between her legs . He said he had then followed the applicant into the women \u2019s toilet , but nothing had happened between them because the doorman had been so quick to follow them in there and had thrown him out of the bar . He said he had waited outside and that the plaintiff had come out shortly afterwards and had sat down on the steps . He had called a taxi and asked the plaintiff if she was going to come home with him which she had done . In his house they had begun undressing each other , and she had been completely naked . He had seen that there was blood coming from her genitals , and he had thought she was starting her period .

J. said that before he had left the men \u2019s toilet he had taken her underpants and put them in his pocket .", "When confronted with doorman PERSON \u2019s statement , J. commented that he could not remember having told the doorman that there had been a slight accident , but he could remember that the applicant was bleeding between her legs , the causes for which he had ignored .", "Officer ORG then asked J. what he had meant when he had said that there had been a slight accident , to which J. responded that he could not remember having said these words when the doorman had told him to open the door .", "Nor could J. remember that the doorman had offered to call an ambulance or the police .", "Officer ORG then informed J. of the applicant \u2019s injuries and of the assessment made by ORG , where the applicant had been examined immediately after leaving his home , that she had received these injuries from very rough sexual intercourse . In response to this , PERSON denied having had sexual intercourse with the applicant either at the bar or after they had gone to his home . He could not offer an explanation regarding the injuries described to him .

In the investigation of the case , blood and urine samples were taken from the plaintiff , and it was requested that these be tested for alcohol and for drugs which can affect judgment . No common drugs of this type were found , but the assessment by ORG includes the following statement : \u2018 The concentrations of ethanol in the blood and urine indicate that the person in question was substantially under the influence of alcohol TIME before the blood sample was taken.\u2019", "From the description given by the doorman at [ the bar ] , who on CARDINAL occasions had to deal with the plaintiff and the accused , first in the women \u2019s toilet and then in the men \u2019s toilet of the bar , the only conclusion to be drawn is that the plaintiff had by then already suffered the injuries to her genitals which you mention in your letter . The plaintiff made no complaints regarding her dealings with the accused when the doorman spoke to her ; this happened on CARDINAL occasions , and amongst other things he offered to call an ambulance or the police , but his offer was rejected . No signs of sperm were found in the samples taken from the plaintiff , which can corroborate the statement by the accused that he did not have sexual intercourse with the plaintiff . On the other hand , he admitted that other sexual acts had taken place between them at the bar , but did not admit to further sexual acts with the plaintiff after they arrived at his home . \u201d", "The applicant underwent aesthetic surgery in DATE on the injuries sustained to the outside of her genitals . In this connection the surgeon stated that the damage could not be repaired perfectly .

The request was accompanied by documents testifying to the psychological treatment the applicant had undergone since the incident and certificates regarding the mental and physical consequences of the alleged rape . On DATE the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the applicant \u2019s request . In his letter the Director explained the legal conditions for a case to be reopened , namely , that a case could not be reopened unless significant new evidence had come to light or was likely to come to light . He further described the evidence and the facts of the case . After describing the materials accompanying the request , he stated :", "\u201c The materials accompanying the request for reopening of the case contain , first and foremost , further descriptions of [ H. \u2019s ] emotional and mental state following the incidents to which the investigation materials of the case refer , as is discussed above .", "[ H. \u2019s ] emotional and mental suffering , to which the new materials bear witness , are doubtless the consequences of what happened to her in TIME of DATE . On the other hand , these materials are not considered as further illuminating what really happened in the dealings between her and the defendant on the night in question . From this it follows that the conditions for the reopening of the case under the third paragraph of LAW [ in force at the relevant time ] have not been met . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative wrote a letter to the Minister of Justice marked \u201c Confidential \u201d in which he criticised the way the authorities had handled the case .
