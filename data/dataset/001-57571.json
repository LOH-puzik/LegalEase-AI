ORG Mr. PERSON , an NORP businessman born in GPE Aires in DATE , had for DATE been resident with his wife and their CARDINAL children in GPE ( GPE ) . He was arrested in GPE with a view to being extradited but objected to his extradition and applied for provisional release , as described below .", "CARDINAL . ORG On instructions from ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) , the GPE cantonal police arrested the applicant in GPE during TIME and immediately transferred him to LAW prison in GPE .", "The authorities of GPE had sent radio - telegrams to the authorities of ORG on DATE asking for help in identifying the CARDINAL persons thought to be responsible for kidnapping a NORP banker , K , in GPE Aires on DATE . The kidnappers had demanded a ransom and had required ORG wife and sister to go first to GPE , then to GPE - where the money was placed by them in an account opened in their name with the ORG - and then to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a radio - telegram dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG requested the provisional arrest of the suspects with a view to extradition . On DATE , the ORG accordingly issued a warrant for Mr. PERSON GPE \u2019s arrest , and this was served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG in GPE confirmed ORG \u2019s request for the arrest of the CARDINAL NORP nationals . In \" notes verbales \" dated DATE , DATE and CARDINAL May , it produced various supporting documents . Together , these notes and documents constituted a formal extradition request .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG forwarded the documents received to the GPE authorities , for consideration at the hearing of the applicant . Copies were sent to the latter \u2019s lawyer and to ORG ( \" the Public Prosecutor \" ) . On DATE , ORG suggested that the ORG officially inform the NORP authorities of offences of receiving stolen goods which Mr. PERSON - GPE was charged with having committed in GPE , but he pointed out that they had not given rise to any penalties in that country . He refused to institute proceedings in GPE , and on DATE ORG of the GPE decided that there were no grounds for opening an investigation there .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing held in the meantime , which was attended by his lawyer , the applicant had indicated his refusal to be extradited . In a letter of DATE , the ORG gave the lawyer until DATE to state the reasons for his client \u2019s objections . It extended this time - limit to CARDINAL DATE and subsequently to DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG submitted letters rogatory to the ORG concerning the kidnapping of an NORP financier , C , in GPE Aires on DATE , for which the same group of persons was thought to have been responsible . The letters rogatory were executed in GPE on DATE . By \" notes verbales \" dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , the ORG formally submitted a second request for the extradition of Mr. PERSON - GPE , among others .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG instructed the GPE cantonal authorities to hold a second hearing on the applicant \u2019s extradition , this time on the basis of the documents relating to the kidnapping of C. At the hearing the applicant continued to resist extradition .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON - GPE \u2019s lawyer sent the ORG a memorandum setting out the reasons for the applicant \u2019s objection to being extradited ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The reasons included the following : the documents submitted in support of the extradition request did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down in the Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , since they contained no description of the offences with which the applicant was charged ; as regards the CARDINAL kidnappings of which he was accused by the NORP authorities , which were moreover of a political character , Mr. PERSON - GPE was innocent ; if extradition was granted , it would be contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of LAW , as it would expose the applicant to inhuman treatment and he would have no guarantee of a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ( CARDINALst ORG ) accepted Mr. PERSON GPE \u2019s objection and accordingly decided not to authorise his extradition . It was of the opinion that \" the overall circumstances [ gave it ] serious reason to fear that the treatment which might be accorded to the objectors by the requesting ORG , either before judgment or during the enforcement of sentence , would violate the rules governing respect for human rights \" . The ORG further decided that the offences mentioned in the extradition request should , with CARDINAL exception , be the subject of a prosecution and trial by the appropriate GPE cantonal authorities , pursuant to Article PERSON , first paragraph , of ORG . Lastly , it directed that the applicant be kept in detention with a view to extradition until the GPE authorities had ruled on his detention on remand in the criminal proceedings that were to be instituted .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ordered that a criminal investigation be opened against Mr. PERSON - GPE and the investigating judge preferred charges of , inter alia , attempted extortion against him . As a result , the detention with a view to extradition was transformed into detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG of ORG instructed the GPE cantonal authorities to prosecute the applicant and bring him to trial .", "On DATE , the applicant admitted the charges of attempted extortion and blackmail in the K case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , ORG of the GPE of GPE ( CARDINALst ORG ) sentenced him on these charges to imprisonment for DATE and DATE , subject to deduction of DATE he had spent in detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . ORG Having been put under a regime of semi - liberty , the applicant absconded in DATE . During his detention with a view to extradition , he had on CARDINAL occasions applied for release .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON - GPE and his wife , who had been arrested at the same time and for the same reasons as he had , had requested the ORG to order their provisional release . On DATE , the ORG accepted the request submitted by Mrs. PERSON - GPE on payment of a surety of CARDINAL GPE . In order to facilitate his wife \u2019s release , the applicant had withdrawn his own request .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON - Reisse made a fresh request to the ORG , arguing : that for DATE he had been detained with a view to his extradition , whereas he had objected to the latter measure ; that he was not guilty of the offences with which he was charged by the NORP authorities ; that the evidence submitted by them was manifestly inadequate ; and that his state of health had seriously worsened as a result of his detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that it had decided not to grant the request , which would consequently be passed to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It considered , in the light of information provided by the medical service of Champ - Dollon prison , that the medical supervision and psychiatric treatment being undergone by the applicant were compatible with his remaining in custody . It drafted a CARDINAL-page report for ORG on the CARDINAL NORP suspected of the kidnapping of K , together with an aide - m\u00e9moire .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG forwarded the request for release to ORG , together with the CARDINAL documents referred to above , \" so that a decision could be given by a court in accordance with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW \" . At the same time it expressed a negative opinion on the request since release did not seem to it to be \" required by the circumstances \" , within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG rejected the request . Mr. PERSON - GPE was notified of the operative provisions of the decision on the following day and of the reasons therefor on DATE . ORG took several factors into consideration : the extradition request submitted by the NORP authorities concerned not only the kidnapping of the NORP banker K but also that of the NORP financier C , and the possibility that the applicant had been involved in CARDINAL of these cases could not be ruled out ; there was a real risk that he might abscond since he resided in GPE and not in his country of origin ; he had not shown that he was unfit to undergo detention and , furthermore , he could obtain the assistance of a doctor in case of need .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , on DATE , Mr. PERSON - Reisse had written to the Presidents of ORG and to ORG requesting immediate release . On DATE , a President of ORG said that it was for ORG to give a ruling on requests for release submitted by a person who was detained with a view to extradition . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer replied that the proceedings in ORG were entirely in writing and that the ORG had taken DATE to reach a decision . The requirements of LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) had not been complied with : in particular , the detainee had not appeared in person and a decision had not been rendered speedily . The lawyer therefore confirmed the request for release and asked ORG to give an interpretation of the provision in question . In a letter dated DATE , the CARDINAL presiding judges of ORG stated that it was not competent to deal with the applicant \u2019s release as he had been detained with a view to extradition under a Federal arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON - GPE submitted a further request for release to the ORG ; he claimed that release was justified because of his deteriorating health and he supplied CARDINAL medical certificates . Although the first of these , dated DATE , stated that he could still be cared for by the prison authorities , the second , dated DATE , reported progressive deterioration : \" The lack of a frame of reference in < the applicant \u2019s > current surroundings is conducive to the development of his paranoid ideas and problems in evaluating reality . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The request was received by ORG on DATE , DATE It had just finished investigating the extradition request and therefore passed the complete file to ORG on DATE . It did not enclose any opinion , but on DATE the ORG requested it to submit CARDINAL within DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The President of the CARDINALst ORG also informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the ORG had been asked for information about the request for release .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG rejected the request , as the ORG had recommended in an opinion of DATE : the ORG took the view that Mr. PERSON - Reisse had provided no new material important enough to warrant making a decision different from that of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This decision was notified on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The procedure for extradition between GPE and GPE is governed in the first instance by a bilateral treaty and , subsidiarily , by municipal law .", "The Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between GPE and GPE , signed on DATE , has been binding on both countries since DATE . It lays down the formal and substantive conditions applying to extradition between the CARDINAL countries but does not , either expressly or tacitly , deal with the methods to be used by the courts for supervising detention with a view to extradition . It is therefore NORP law which applies on this point . At the time of the facts in question and until DATE , the instrument applicable was an Act of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW of DATE on ORG ( \" LAW \" ) instituted a sharing of powers in the field in question between ORG ) ( which , for obvious practical reasons , had delegated its powers to ORG ) and ORG , the only judicial authority in GPE with jurisdiction in extradition matters .", "CARDINAL . ORG It was to the ORG that requests for provisional arrest with a view to extradition and formal extradition requests were addressed . The ORG corresponded directly with the accredited diplomatic missions in GPE - without necessarily going through ORG - and with ORG and the national central offices of ORG . It decided whether there was a case for arresting the wanted person and , if so , served on that person a \" warrant for arrest with a view to extradition \" , which was immediately enforceable throughout NORP territory .", "Once the person had been arrested , it was the ORG which conducted the proceedings . It ordered that he be heard by the appropriate cantonal authorities on the extradition request , appointed counsel to represent him if necessary , corresponded with the lawyers involved and informed them of the time - limits to be observed , checked the detainee \u2019s mail and granted or refused him the right to be visited , authorisation to make telephone calls , and so on .", "Above all , it was the ORG itself which , in most cases , ruled on extradition requests and requests for provisional release .", "The former power ( to rule on extradition requests ) was conferred by LAW and was exercisable where \" the arrested individual [ had ] indicated his consent to his being handed over without delay and ... there [ was ] no legal impediment to his extradition , or ... he [ had ] opposed it only on grounds not based on [ DATE ] Act , on the LAW or a declaration of reciprocity ... \" .", "The second power ( to rule on requests for provisional release ) was conferred by LAW , second paragraph , and was exercisable in all cases where the matter had not been referred to ORG . The ORG could grant release if this appeared to be required by the circumstances ( section DATE , first paragraph ) .", "Furthermore , whenever ORG was to give a ruling , the ORG carried out the requisite investigations . If the ORG refused to authorise extradition , the ORG was bound by that decision . On the other hand , if the ORG authorised extradition , the ORG could still , for important reasons of political expediency , refuse to extradite the person concerned .", "Lastly , it was for the ORG to give instructions for the handing over of the person extradited , arrange the practical details and inform the foreign ORG of the action taken on its request .", "CARDINAL . ORG was involved in extradition proceedings in CARDINAL sets of circumstances .", "If the arrested person protested against the extradition itself by raising an objection based on the LAW , a treaty or a declaration of reciprocity ( section CARDINAL ) , ORG was competent to rule on the merits of the extradition ( section CARDINAL ) , if necessary after ordering additional investigations ( section CARDINAL , second paragraph ) and the personal appearance of the detainee ( section CARDINAL paragraph ) . In the latter event - which was very rare - , the hearing took place in public , unless there were serious reasons to the contrary ( section CARDINAL paragraph ) , and the detainee could be assisted by a lawyer , assigned by the court if need be .", "Where the case had been referred to it ( section CARDINAL , second paragraph ) , i.e. if an objection related to the extradition itself , ORG was also responsible for ruling on any request for provisional release lodged by the person who was detained with a view to extradition . It could authorise his release if it appeared that the circumstances so required ( section CARDINAL , first paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a report to ORG in DATE , ORG drew attention to a number of shortcomings in GPE from the point of view of LAW which it was contemplating ratifying :", "\" Persons provisionally arrested on the orders of ORG and Police , in compliance with the wishes of the requesting ORG , have no right of appeal to a court against the decision to arrest them . LAW is , however , being revised , and it is planned to take this opportunity to provide for an appeal to a court against arrests , in accordance with LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . \" ( Federal Bulletin , DATE , vol . II , pp . DATE )", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG ratified the Convention on DATE . Although declared inadmissible by ORG on DATE ( ORG and Reports no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , the GPE v. GPE application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) revealed that the extradition law fell short of the requirements of LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) . The Government considered that , pending the entry into force of a new LAW on international mutual assistance in criminal matters , it should adopt a solution that would meet any difficulty encountered . Taking as its basis the fact that Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) was directly applicable in GPE , ORG and Police took the initiative of exchanging views with ORG . By an exchange of ( unpublished ) letters dated DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the CARDINAL institutions agreed to interpret sections CARDINAL of the Act , in particular the second paragraph of LAW , in such a way as to establish the general and exclusive jurisdiction of ORG ( CARDINAL ) to rule on any objection lodged against arrest with a view to extradition ( from then on this legal remedy was expressly mentioned on the back of the arrest warrant , receipt of which had to be acknowledged in writing by the person concerned ) , and ( CARDINAL ) to rule on any request for provisional release , even when , by reason of the absence of any objection to the request for extradition , ORG had no jurisdiction over the merits of the matter .", "CARDINAL . ORG The transitional arrangements introduced as a result of the exchange of letters were enshrined in LAW of DATE on ORG ( \" the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE , that is after the conclusion of the proceedings at issue in the present case .
