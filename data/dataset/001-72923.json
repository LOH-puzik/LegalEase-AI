GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Ms PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr C. Lenz , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is mentally disabled since her birth . A curator has been appointed in DATE to take care of the administration of her property .", "Following the death of the applicant \u2019s parents in DATE and DATE respectively , the tax authorities found out that her parents had not declared certain assets in the property tax returns concerning themselves and the applicant . Thereupon , ORG reassessed the property tax payable by the applicant , being their heiress , for DATE and fixed the default interest due pursuant to section ORG of LAW ORG , see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) . The decision became final .", "On DATE ORG rendered a leading decision concerning section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW ( Verm\u00f6gensteuergesetz ) , which fixed the rates of property tax payable . It declared that the said section , in all its versions since DATE , was incompatible with the principle of equality before the law laid down in LAW . However , in order to secure budgetary planning and an equal tax assessment for past periods of time , it decided that the provisions of LAW continued to apply until DATE . The legislator was obliged to adopt a new regulation until then at the latest .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant in her position as heiress to pay CARDINAL ORG ) in interest on the property tax evaded by her late parents DATE . It based its decision on section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) . The default interest already paid pursuant to section ORG of LAW for an overlapping period of time was deducted from the amount of interest charged ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the said Code ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objections against this decision .", "On DATE ORG fixed the tax payable by the applicant at DEM MONEY and dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s action . It found that pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW the applicant was liable to pay interest on property tax evaded by her deceased parents DATE . It found that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s parents had committed a tax evasion with in the meaning of section FAC of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) within that period . As regards the property tax return for DATE , the court found that there was no proof of an intentional evasion of property tax . The declaration was returned by the applicant \u2019s curator , who had not intentionally made wrong statements and the applicant , being mentally disabled , did not participate in filing these submissions .", "ORG further argued that interest on evaded property tax could still be fixed despite the fact that ORG , in its decision dated DATE , considered section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW to be unconstitutional . As ORG had ordered that the impugned section nevertheless continued to apply until DATE , the tax authorities could still fix property tax and order interest to be paid if such tax was evaded before that date .", "ORG also found that ordering a heir to pay interest following the death of the testator who was guilty of tax evasion did not violate LAW . The heir was the beneficiary of this tax evasion because the testator \u2019s property , including the profits made on the offence , had passed to him or her . It argued that charging interest on evaded taxes pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW could not be considered as a criminal sanction . The said section was merely aimed at absorbing profits obtained by the belated payment of the taxes evaded . Interest rate advantages were absorbed for the total period of time in which the amount of tax evaded was not yet paid . This was a longer period of time than the relevant period for which default interest had to be paid according to section ORG of LAW . However , the interest already fixed pursuant to section ORG of LAW was deducted from the amount of interest due under section CARDINAL of the said PERSON ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "According to ORG , the present case was also distinguishable from the case of GPE , GPE and ORG v. GPE , in which this ORG rendered judgment on CARDINAL DATE ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) . That case concerned a fine , that is , unlike the interest in the present case , a criminal sanction imposed on the heir for a tax evasion committed by the testator .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . It endorsed the reasoning of ORG concerning the implications of ORG decision dated DATE . It further agreed with ORG view that interest on evaded property tax was not a criminal sanction . This was illustrated , in particular , by the fact that the rate of interest payable on evaded tax pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW and the rate of interest payable pursuant to section ORG of LAW was the same . Consequently , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention were not applicable to interest payable on evaded property tax .", "On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "The rules on interest payable on tax claims are laid down in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW .", "Pursuant to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , default interest is payable on supplementary claims of , inter alia , property tax . The period for calculation of the interest due starts DATE after DATE in which the tax arose and ends with the date on which the tax assessment takes effect ( section ORG \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Taxation Code provides that interest is payable on taxes intentionally evaded by the person to whose benefit the tax has been evaded . The time limit for calculation of the interest payable starts already when the tax evasion takes effect and ends only with the payment of the evaded taxes ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that interest already fixed pursuant to section ORG for an overlapping period of time is to be deducted from the interest payable .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW the rate of interest due pursuant to , inter alia , sections ORG and CARDINAL is MONEY of the amount of supplementary taxes charged per month .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW provides that tax evasion , when committed intentionally , is a criminal offence which is punishable with up to DATE imprisonment or a fine ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
