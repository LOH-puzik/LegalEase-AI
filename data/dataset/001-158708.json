The defendant has a possibility to retain an advocate or another person . Therefore , the possibility to find and retain a defender is wider as compared to the situation of a suspect or accused in criminal proceedings ...", "Unlike in criminal cases , the person concerned does not bear any procedural costs ... Therefore , the decision not to prosecute for an administrative offence or a favorable decision following the prosecution for such offence may entail reimbursement of the expenses relating to legal assistance ...", "ORG previously acknowledged the need for a heightened level of protection of the ORG rights and freedoms in the areas entailing administrative or another type of public liability ... The relevant legislative regulations should comply with the requirements of fairness , proportionality and legal certainty ...

Unlike criminal cases , which include , as a rule , pre - trial proceedings , the cases under the ORG are focused on and processed by way of the non - judicial procedure . It has a more simplified and expedited nature , thus normally not requiring an investigation . Therefore , these proceedings are fit for the person to defend himself and are less financially burdensome as regards recourse to assistance from an advocate or another person ...", "Therefore , the federal legislator should not be deprived of the choice in favour of a differentiated approach when putting in place specific modalities concerning legal assistance , with due regard to the type of offences , the severity of penalties , procedural specificities of the procedures and other legitimate criteria ...", "In view of the above , as well as the case - law of ORG , the ORG \u2019s positive obligation to ensure provision of legal assistance , with recourse to public funding , primarily concerns the need to protect vulnerable groups ... and has a special significance in the criminal procedure , in particular on account of the importance of the consequences that may result during or after this procedure ...", "The issue of free legal assistance in ORG cases may acquire constitutional significance in situations where the degree of actual intrusion into constitutional rights and freedoms , by way of prosecution under the ORG , becomes comparable to measures prescribed by criminal law ...", "In substance , the applicant alleges a violation of her constitutional rights on account of the lacunae in LAW that allowed the courts to reject her request to use free of charge the services of the lawyer that would be appointed .
