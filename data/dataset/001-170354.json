According to the latest information in the ORG \u2019s possession , he was serving a sentence in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant wrote to ORG and ORG ( \u0160vietimo ir mokslo ministerija , hereinafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) , requesting information about the possibility of enrolling at university . He mentioned having graduated in DATE from ORG . The applicant stated that he wished to pursue studies via distance learning to acquire a second university degree ( studijuoti neakivaizdiniu b\u016bdu auk\u0161tojoje mokykloje ) , this time in \u201c law with a specialisation in human rights \u201d ( teis\u0117s studijos su \u017emogaus teisi\u0173 pakraipa ) . The applicant mentioned that he was a prisoner and thus could not physically attend the place of study .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE sent to the applicant at FAC , ORG and ORG wrote that information about the study programmes could be found on the website < www.aikos.smm.lt>. This website states that it belongs to ORG and ORG , and is administered by a public entity , ORG in Education ( NORP informacini\u0173 technologij\u0173 centras ) , which is a public institution founded by ORG and ORG . The website contains information about learning and study possibilities in GPE . The website states the following about the aims of the \u201c ORG \u201d system :", "\u201c ORG is an open system for providing information , consultation and guidance , the main aim of which is to provide information about opportunities for learning in GPE .", "ORG provides the possibility of searching information about professions , qualifications , studies and study programmes , educational and science institutions and rules of admission ...", "ORG allows users to submit a question to a consultant and to receive a reply ...", "The information provided in the central part of the ORG website under the sections \u2018 I wish to learn\u2019 , \u2018 I wish to study\u2019 , \u2018 I wish to improve my ORG reflects only the current and most pertinent information relevant to DATE and is aimed at those who wish to enter university , vocational school , or a secondary school , or who wish to improve their qualifications . The site also contains historical data regarding education ...", "ORG provides information to CARDINAL groups of users : adults , children ( DATE ) and NORP speakers . The users may use more functions after they have registered on this site .", "The ORG website is refreshed DATE , to reflect information about education and science institutions , study and learning programmes and the qualifications a person receives upon graduating from those programmes , ... programmes for improving qualifications ... It also provides information from ORG about job vacancies and unemployment . The latter information on the ORG website is renewed DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG authorities , noting the reply by ORG and asking to be granted Internet access to a website \u201c where there was information from the Ministry about studies , as well as to [ the applicant \u2019s ] email accounts hosted on the Internet sites < www.one.lt > and < www.yahoo.com > \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG governor replied that the prison authorities did not consider the ORG \u2019s reply to be comprehensive . In particular , ORG had not taken into account the applicant \u2019s particular situation \u2013 namely that he was in prison . The prison considered that the ORG should have provided a comprehensive reply in writing . According to the prison governor , \u201c given that the ORG \u2019s reply did not satisfy [ the applicant ] , the latter should write to ORG again , so that he is provided with a comprehensive reply \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The prison governor also informed the applicant that the request to have Internet access could not be granted because at that time none of the legislation allowed the prisoners to use the Internet or to have a mailbox . For that reason , ORG authorities were unable to grant the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint with ORG ( GPE departamentas ) , arguing that none of the laws prohibited him from obtaining information from a ORG institution electronically . The applicant referred to the ORG \u2019s reply and asked to be granted Internet access .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG responded that the legal instruments regulating the execution of sentences did not permit prisoners to use the Internet . It was suggested that the applicant again ask the Ministry to provide the information he sought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started court proceedings , referring to his correspondence with the Ministry and challenging ORG decision not to grant him access to Internet .", "CARDINAL . In their written response to the court , ORG authorities noted that , although prisoners had a right to address requests and complaints to the ORG authorities under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this meant correspondence by regular post and not via electronic communication . Furthermore , the use of mobile phones in prisons was prohibited so that prisoners could not continue their criminal activity whilst serving a sentence . According to ORG authorities , a number of fraudsters had already cheated people of large sums of money with the help of mobile phones . If the prisoners had the right to use Internet , they could pursue criminal activities and could also coordinate the activities of criminal organisations . Lastly , given that postal correspondence between prisoners was not permitted , providing prisoners with access to the Internet would make that prohibition pointless . The same was true regarding the prohibition in the CARDINALst Annex of the LAW of the ORG possession of topographic maps ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also asked the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s complaint , arguing that although LAW permitted prisoners to use computers ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this did not encompass the right to Internet use . There was no right under NORP law for a prisoner to be provided with Internet access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . Having reviewed the legal provisions regulating prisoners\u2019 conditions of detention , the court pointed out that the prisoners could communicate with ORG institutions by postal correspondence and that their letters had to be sent via the prison authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Giving Internet access to prisoners would not be compatible with those legal norms . However , as the Internet was not an object , it was not possible to list Internet among the \u201c objects \u201d which the prisoners were not allowed to have in prison . At the same time , from the existing ban on telephone and radio communication devices in prison it was obvious that this ban included the Internet . Such prohibition was aimed at preventing crimes being committed in prison . The court also observed that the requirements were set by order of the prison authorities and were therefore mandatory for the applicant , as he was under an obligation to obey prison orders .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , disputing the lower court \u2019s interpretation of domestic law . He also argued that the lower court had ignored the fact that the core of his complaint was the restriction of his right to education and the right to obtain information . The applicant relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG authorities replied , indicating that there was \u201c a secondary school ( vidurin\u0117 mokykla ) in the prison where students could access all the literature necessary for their studies . The secondary school graduation exams showed good results \u201d . Furthermore , the prisoners could pursue computer literacy studies organised by the ORG ( Elektr\u0117n\u0173 profesinio rengimo centras ) , and that institution had not asked for Internet access . The prison thus considered that Internet access , or the lack thereof , had no impact on the quality of studies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The court noted that , for its users , the Internet provided very wide opportunities to use email , to obtain information , to download files , and to sell or buy things . The Internet could be used for more than merely educational purposes . However , the right to use the Internet was not absolute and this right could be restricted to certain social groups . This stemmed from LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . There was no legal provision in GPE permitting prisoners to use the Internet . Even so , the ORG right to have computers could not be interpreted so widely as to encompass the right to have Internet access . ORG lastly noted that if prisoners had access to the Internet , the prison authorities would be hampered in their fight against crime by being unable to fully monitor the ORG activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Elektr\u0117nai Vocational Educational Centre ( Elektr\u0117n\u0173 profesinio mokymo centras ) awarded the applicant a diploma in computer skills .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in DATE the applicant had attended LANGUAGE language courses and computer literacy courses organised by a secondary school in GPE region .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant started court proceedings , arguing that in DATE he had been held in FAC for DATE in degrading conditions . Among other things , he also argued that FAC authorities had seized the personal computer which the applicant had brought with him into prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim by the applicant as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG concluded that the computer had been unlawfully seized by FAC authorities . However , the court found that the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention had been satisfactory overall , except for a few minor details , and that the gravity of those violations was not such as would amount to inhuman or degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG authorities granted the applicant \u2019s request for an extended visit by his parents . However , the applicant later committed a disciplinary offence , and for that reason the extended visit was denied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the refusal of the extended visit as legitimate .", "CARDINAL . By a final ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
