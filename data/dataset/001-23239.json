{"ITEMID": "001-23239", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "RIEKWEL v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr L.C.M. PERSON , a lawyer based in GPE who is not licensed to practise but who provides legal assistance and representation in cases where representation by a licensed advocate is not prescribed by law .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , at QUANTITY , police officers in GPE stopped a motor car and tested the driver \u2019s breath for alcohol . There being an indication that the driver \u2019s breath might contain more alcohol than was legally permitted , the driver was taken to a police station and subjected to a more precise test . This second test showed that the driver \u2019s breath did in fact contain a higher proportion of alcohol than permitted .", "The driver of the car gave the applicant \u2019s name . It appears from a police report dated after the event , which the applicant claims is inaccurate , that the driver of the car was found in possession of a driving licence or other identity document in the applicant \u2019s name containing a photographic likeness of the bearer .", "The driver of the car confessed that he had drunk CARDINAL glasses of beer . He was sent home with a summons to appear on DATE before the single - judge chamber ( politierechter ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on a drink - driving charge .", "No one appeared at the hearing on DATE . The applicant was convicted in absentia of drink - driving and sentenced to pay a fine of MONEY ( NLG ) . The applicant claims , essentially , that he only became aware of this when he was ordered to pay the fine . He lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence to ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "ORG decided to consider the drink - driving charge and the charge of driving an uninsured car \u2013 of which the applicant had been convicted in separate proceedings \u2013 jointly . It held hearings on DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE , at which , for various reasons not relevant to the case before the ORG , the applicant did not appear . At the hearing on DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel , who was present , pleaded on the applicant \u2019s behalf that another person had in fact been arrested on DATE and had fraudulently pretended to be the applicant . He invited the police officers who had been called as witnesses to identify the applicant from a series of photographs . ORG , however , decided that the applicant \u2019s presence in person was required to establish whether or not he was in fact the person arrested on DATE .", "A further hearing was set for DATE . By letter of DATE , the applicant informed ORG that he did not intend to appear . He stated that he did not trust the police officers to make a correct identification except in a confrontation attended by sufficient safeguards , for example a line - up of himself and other persons of similar appearance .", "The hearing proceeded on DATE in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE . It declared the applicant \u2019s appeal against the first - instance conviction of drink - driving inadmissible as out of time . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c In the opinion of ORG the original summons for the [ single - judge chamber of ORG ] hearing of DATE was handed to the suspect in person on DATE . It follows that the suspect should have appealed within DATE of the judgment delivered on DATE . However , the suspect only appealed on DATE , so the suspect \u2019s appeal must be declared inadmissible .", "ORG is of the opinion that it was the suspect to whom the original summons was handed . ORG considers it relevant in this respect that , as appears from the official report drawn up on DATE by Police Sergeant S. ... , the suspect identified himself to the reporting police officers by means of an identity document bearing a photographic likeness resembling the suspect . ORG has further found that the [ record of ] the interrogation of the suspect , to which he was subjected on DATE , is signed with a signature which in ORG opinion is sufficiently similar to the CARDINAL which the suspect has placed on the letter of authority with which he has authorised the lodging of an appeal ... and on the receipt belonging to the official record of the delivery of the notification of the pronouncement of the judgment of the single - judge chamber of ORG ... \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s counsel , a licensed advocate , lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) to ORG ( PERSON ) on the applicant \u2019s behalf . Mr PERSON took over the applicant \u2019s representation from the advocate , it being possible at the time for any person duly authorised in writing to act before ORG in criminal cases , and gave his own address as the applicant \u2019s elected domicile for correspondence .", "The Advocate General ( advocaat - generaal ) to the ORG court submitted an advisory opinion to ORG on DATE . A copy was transmitted to the last known address of the applicant . However , as appears from the public records , the applicant had already moved to another country on DATE .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the Registrar of ORG wrote to PERSON PERSON in the following terms :", "\u201c In the above case , in which you act as the representative of the suspect pursuant to a specific letter of authority , the Advocate General PERSON submitted an advisory opinion ( enclosed ) on DATE . This advisory opinion was sent to the suspect by letter of CARDINAL DATE , the latter being offered the possibility to respond . This possibility was not made use of . Subsequently , ORG dismissed the appeal by its judgment of DATE .", "You have rightly pointed out to the administrative staff of ORG that you were not sent a copy of the advisory opinion , as was required by ( former ) Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . This lapse is regretted and I offer you my apologies for it . Now that ORG has given its irrevocable judgment ( onherroepelijk uitspraak heeft gedaan ) , it would be entirely pointless to give you the opportunity to react at this stage . That will therefore not be done .", "Unfortunately , there is now nothing more to be done than to acknowledge that a mistake was made towards you which should not have been allowed to occur . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
