ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG \u201c the Fund \u201d ) granted to a limited liability company wholly owned by the applicant a state guarantee , as it was exporting its products to GPE . On CARDINAL DATE the company transferred all its rights related to the above - mentioned guarantee to a bank . The transfer was confirmed by ORG on DATE . Later the bank set off the amount of the guarantee from the company \u2019s account without the applicant \u2019s approval . Civil proceedings were instituted against the bank in relation to the state guarantee in question . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) gave a final decision in which the set off was approved by the court .", "The applicant apparently learned about the above - mentioned ORG decision for the first time on DATE . He immediately requested that the proceedings be reopened as ORG had failed to communicate to him a statement which it had received from the ORG during the first part of the proceedings . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on DATE , finding that even though the court had indeed failed to communicate the document in question , the proceedings had been in conformity with the law as in force at the time .", "On DATE the applicant and another person gave a directly enforceable guarantee to cover the debt of the applicant \u2019s company . The debt fell due on DATE and was not paid .", "On DATE the creditor bank initiated civil proceedings in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) requesting the company , the applicant and the third person to pay the debt .", "On DATE the creditor bank requested that the applicant \u2019s assets be sequestrated . ORG granted the sequestration order on DATE .", "On DATE ORG asked the defendants to indicate clearly in writing whether or not they contested the claim at the risk of a default judgment . The applicant and his co - defendants filed their statements of reply on DATE respectively but failed to indicate clearly their position . On DATE the ORG gave a default judgment in which it ordered the applicant and his co - defendants to pay the debt . The judgment was served on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant and his co - defendants lodged an appeal against the default judgment with ORG requesting a stay of execution and that the default judgment be quashed and the claims of the creditor bank be rejected . On DATE ORG ordered a stay of execution of the default judgment .", "Meanwhile , the applicant also lodged a procedural complaint with ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the default judgment be quashed . On DATE ORG stayed the execution of the default judgment . On DATE the court dismissed the complaint without considering the merits as the case was still pending before ORG . The stay of execution given by the court on DATE expired .", "The ORG proceedings comprised CARDINAL different sets of civil proceedings , namely the applicant \u2019s claim for a refund of benefit by unjust enrichment , the appeal against the default judgment and an action for damages , which was subsequently withdrawn . ORG asked the creditor bank to submit its replies by DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The applicant was asked to give his reply by CARDINAL DATE but this time - limit was extended several times until DATE . A preparatory hearing was scheduled for DATE but it was cancelled as the applicant had brought a criminal action for aggravated abuse of public office against the presiding judge . These charges were subsequently found manifestly ill - founded .", "Another judge was appointed to the case . In DATE the creditor bank proposed that , in order to avoid partiality issues , the matter be adjudicated in a formation of CARDINAL judges instead of CARDINAL and that the judges be appointed jointly with ORG . Later on the parties , however , gave their consent to the single judge composition . The CARDINAL sets of civil proceedings were joined on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant requested that an oral hearing concerning the criminal proceedings , which related to the bankruptcy proceedings of the company and which were pending before the same court , be held before an oral hearing in the civil proceedings . Despite this request , the preparatory hearings in the civil proceedings were held on DATE and DATE . On DATE the applicant indicated that if no oral hearing was held in the criminal case before an oral hearing was held in the civil case , he would bring a criminal action against the presiding judge . On DATE he brought such action for abuse of public office against the presiding judge which he later , however , abandoned . A continued preparatory hearing and the oral hearing in the civil case were held in DATE .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the default judgment and rejected the creditor bank \u2019s claims as far as the applicant was concerned . As far as the company was concerned , the court rejected its appeal and upheld the default judgment . The stay of execution given by the court on DATE expired .", "In DATE all parties to the case appealed to ORG . The applicant \u2019s appeal only concerned costs and expenses . The company requested that the default judgment be quashed and that the claims of the creditor bank be rejected .", "On DATE ORG stayed the execution of ORG judgment . In DATE and DATE the applicant was asked to supplement his appeal , which he did on DATE and DATE respectively . DATE and DATE the applicant continually submitted letters to the court at DATE intervals .", "The court held a preparatory hearing on DATE . On DATE , DATE before the scheduled oral hearing , the applicant entered a disqualification plea against the presiding judge of the court . This plea was rejected as manifestly ill - founded during the oral hearing on DATE .", "On DATE ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and he was freed from the obligation to pay costs and expenses . For the rest , the court upheld ORG judgment . The stay of execution given by the court on DATE expired .", "The applicant and the company appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
