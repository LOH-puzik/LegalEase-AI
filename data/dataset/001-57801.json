On DATE the applicant addressed - as he was required to do under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) - a preliminary claim for compensation to the Minister for ORG .

The hearing in ORG was held on DATE . DATE the court dismissed PERSON claims on the following grounds :", "\" ...", "Mr [ X ] claims that the ORG is liable on account of alleged negligence on the part of the Minister responsible for ORG in exercising the powers of health policy vested in him pursuant to the combined provisions of Articles L. CARDINAL and L. CARDINAL of LAW ; in support of his submissions the applicant argues that the Minister delayed prohibiting the distribution to haemophiliacs of blood products contaminated with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) although , DATE , the process of heat- treating blood made it possible to inactivate the virus ; he further complains that the relevant ministry did not inform the haemophiliac community of the serious risks incurred through the use of such products ; the ministerial authority is also criticised for having , in the exercise of its powers of health policy , on DATE , postponed until DATE the ending of reimbursement by health insurance funds of the blood products used by the haemophiliacs , a measure which it is agreed amounted in fact to a prohibition owing to the high cost of the products known as ` factors ORG and GPE ;", "In a new pleading filed on DATE , Mr [ X ] argues in the alternative that the ORG is also liable on the ground of liability for presumed negligence in the organisation and functioning of the public service of blood transfusion ; he further alleges that the ORG is liable on the basis of the risk arising from the reckless activity of the public blood transfusion service ;", "The liability of the ORG", "The public blood transfusion service in GPE is run by private associations , having none of the prerogatives of a public authority , which are moreover exclusively exercised by the ORG as holder of the specific powers of health policy ( as indicated above ) ; the ORG is , however , neither prescriber , nor manufacturer , nor supplier of the offending blood products [ ; ] accordingly its liability may be incurred only on account of negligent acts committed in the exercise of its regulatory powers and it is for the applicant to prove that such negligence occurred ;", "The investigation shows that progress in scientific knowledge concerning HIV , whose first pathological manifestations appeared DATE , from the point of view both of its transmission and of the techniques for its inactivation , was very slow and was the subject of controversy within the scientific community itself ; in particular , although the process of heat - treating blood was approved by the NORP health authorities as early as DATE , this technique was developed to combat the hepatitis virus ; its effectiveness against HIV remained purely hypothetical for DATE ; moreover , some researchers feared that the use of this technique would be likely to have an adverse effect on the ORG clotting and auto - immunising property ; although such fears proved unfounded , an assessment of the liability incurred must necessarily be made on the basis of the scientific knowledge available at the time ; in confining itself to issuing , by way of a circular on DATE , a recommendation concerning the selection of blood donors , for the information of donors and doctors at transfusion centres about the potential risks of infection , the administrative authority did not therefore commit a negligent act such as to render it liable ; the same applies , for identical reasons , to the lack of information furnished to the haemophiliac community concerning the risks to which they were exposed ;", "However , after this date scientific knowledge constantly progressed ; the ORG , which was moreover an ex officio member of ORG , could not fail to have been aware both of such progress and of the spread of the epidemic , and it could not plead the lack of availability of reliable HIV screening tests in order to justify its \" wait - and - see \" policy once cases of AIDS in the haemophiliac community had revealed the existence of a statistically significant causal relationship between the administration of blood product derivatives and HIV infection ; even granted that there remained some uncertainties concerning hypothetical side effects of the heat - treatment technique at DATE , the revelation of the scale of the predicted health catastrophe demanded that the distribution of contaminated blood products be halted rigorously and without delay ;", "The investigation , and in particular the report of ORG , shows that the ministerial authority was informed at the latest and in unequivocal terms on DATE of the very strong probability that in the GPE region \" all blood products prepared from pools of NORP donors [ were ] currently contaminated \" ; the author of the report appositely noted that the importance of this message did not seem to have been perceived ; in failing to adopt immediately a measure prohibiting the distribution of such products , either by legislation or taking appropriate practical measures , the authority responsible for health policy thus committed a negligent act such as to render the ORG liable ;", "Moreover , when on DATE the authority correctly assessed the danger to health in deciding that non - heat- treated blood products should no longer be reimbursed , it saw fit to postpone the date on which its decision was to take effect until DATE ; given the certainty established at that time that all blood products were contaminated , it can not , in order to justify opting for a transitional period , plead either the consent of the haemophiliac community , which had in any case not been accurately informed of the scale of the catastrophe , or an alleged need to maintain CARDINAL self - sufficiency , while decontaminated products were available on the international market ;", "On the other hand , the physiological consequences of re- infection of those who were already HIV positive on DATE , made possible through the shortcomings of the ORG referred to above , are entirely hypothetical in the present state of scientific knowledge ; consequently , the alleged damage from re - infection is purely contingent and can not give rise to a right to compensation ;", "It follows from all the foregoing that the ORG is liable in respect of haemophiliacs who were infected by HIV in the course of transfusion of non - heat - treated blood products , during the period of liability defined above , DATE and DATE ;", "Although the ORG , as indicated above , is neither the prescriber , nor the manufacturer , nor the supplier of the offending blood products , and although it is for the courts alone to assess whether the blood transfusion centres have incurred liability , nonetheless the task of such centres is to provide a public service , and accordingly there are grounds for the administrative court to order the ORG to pay compensation for the whole of the damage suffered ;", "The causal relationship between the damage suffered by Mr [ X ] and the liability of the ORG", "Even if Mr [ X ] , who received for the treatment of his haemophilia not clotting factors ORG or ORG , which it has been established above were negligently distributed , but A cryoprecipitates , may validly claim that the ORG is liable , the case - file shows that he was found to be HIV positive on DATE , a condition , which , taking into account an irreducible period of seroconversion , must be regarded as having actually arisen prior to the beginning of the period of the ORG \u2019s liability defined above , and consequently the submissions of his application must be dismissed ;
