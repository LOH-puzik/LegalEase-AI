SLOVENIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG ( PERSON ) , is a juristic person whose seat is in GPE , GPE . It is represented before ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG , acting through its legal representative , lodged with ORG a claim for restitution of castle PERSON , its outbuildings and surrounding estate together with related movables and works of article It based its claim on sections DATE of the Denationalisation Act DATE . The castle and its estate are located on the territory of DATE GPE and were purchased in DATE by ORG . They were nationalized after the Second World War by NORP authorities . In DATE , the castle and part of the estate were classified as NORP cultural and natural monuments .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the claim for restitution on the ground that section CARDINAL of the Denationalisation Act DATE gave the right to restitution of expropriated property to \u201c churches and other religious communities , their institutions and orders , operating on the territory of GPE \u201d on DATE , the date of the entry into force of the LAW . It was generally known , however , that at that time ORG exercised its activities in GPE . ORG was therefore not entitled to restitution . Further , ORG separated and transferred a part of the claim concerning a part of the surrounding land and certain movables to GPE as the competent authority .", "On DATE the applicant instituted administrative litigation with ORG , asserting that the claim for the restitution of the property emanated from ORG as part of ORG and the catholic religious community . It was clear that , regardless of its internal organisation , ORG was entitled to restitution under LAW DATE . Moreover , the NORP parish , located on NORP territory , belonged , in ecclesiastical administrative terms , to ORG . This meant that ORG was \u201c operating on NORP territory \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE and was therefore entitled to restitution .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's claim and upheld the decision of ORG , holding that section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , with special reference to the concept of \u201c churches and other religious communities , their institutions and orders , operating on NORP territory \u201d , should be interpreted narrowly .", "It transpired from that provision that it was not the universal ORG but its constituent juristic persons operating on the territory of GPE and registered as religious communities under LAW in GPE DATE that were entitled to restitution . ORG , as a much wider entity , did not therefore satisfy this criterion .", "ORG also rejected ORG argument that the presence on NORP territory of a single parish belonging to the applicant in accordance with the internal organisation of ORG justified its claim to be operating on NORP territory . It held that this was not sufficient for the applicant to qualify as a NORP juristic person , since the greater part of its activities took place in another ORG where its seat was located and to the jurisdiction of which it was subject .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG , alleging that ORG was a part of ORG and that its internal organisation was regulated by the Code of canon law ( ORG iuris canonici ) , promulgated on DATE . According to the provisions of this code , the supreme authority regulating the ownership of property was vested in the Pope . Since DATE NORP LAW provided for the separation of ORG and ORG and recognised their equality , this implied recognition of the internal organisation of ORG under the Code of canon law . There can consequently be no doubt that ORG was entitled to restitution . The decision of ORG , moreover , violated the right to own property , as protected by LAW .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's constitutional appeal inadmissible , on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to review application of the law by ordinary courts . It found that the applicant essentially contested ORG refusal to take into account the Code of canon law in determining the applicant 's right to restitution . ORG interpretation of the law was reasoned and there was no indication that its conclusions were arbitrary or in breach of human rights and fundamental freedoms . The decision was served on the applicant 's lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The LAW ( PERSON , ORG no . CARDINAL )", "\u201c The ORG and religious communities shall be separate . Religious communities shall enjoy equal rights ; they shall pursue their activities freely . \u201d", "\u201c The manner in which property is acquired and enjoyed shall be established by law so as to ensure its economic , social and environmental function . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Denationalisation Act DATE ( Zakon o denacionalizaciji , ORG no . CARDINAL , with amendments )", "At the time of the adoption of the LAW , its sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL limited the right to restitution of expropriated property to natural persons . The only exception were churches and religious communities , which were expressly recognised as beneficiaries under section CARDINAL of the Act ( see below ) . By ORG decision of DATE ( see below ) , the right to restitution was extended to all domestic juristic persons .", "\u201c ( ... )", "The conditions and the mode of denationalisation are determined by this LAW . \u201d", "\u201c The right to recovery of property is hereby given to churches and other religious communities , their institutions and orders operating on the territory of GPE at the time of the coming into effect of this LAW . \u201d", "\u201c ( ... )", "CARDINAL . ORG shall decide on denationalisation of objects specified in ( ... ) of this LAW ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court 's case - law", "On DATE ORG adopted a decision in a case brought by CARDINAL legal persons ( not party to the proceedings in this case ) who challenged the constitutionality of several provisions of LAW DATE ( U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It declared that the restriction of the right to restitution to natural persons and only certain legal persons was unconstitutional . By altering the wording of sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , ORG extended the right to restitution to all NORP legal persons . It held that section CARDINAL thus acquired a new meaning . ORG reasoned that :", "\u201c ... the provision of section DATE is no longer contrary to the LAW , because it does no longer have the function of providing a legislative basis for denationalisation claims of churches and other religious communities , their institutions and orders . With the annulment ( ... ) of the pertinent legislative provisions , this provision was given a different content . It only means that under this legislative provision the right to restitution of property is accorded only to those churches and other religious communities , their institutions and orders , that were operating on NORP territory at the time of the adoption of LAW CARDINAL ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
