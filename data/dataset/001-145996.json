NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner and manager of a local radio station in GPE . DATE he was also President of ORG . In that capacity , he reported to the relevant ORG authorities some irregularities in the operation of company NORP , a cable TV broadcasting company owned by Mr PERSON According to the applicant , on account of that criticism , PERSON had threatened on several occasions to kill him . As established in the criminal proceedings described below , in a reported incident of CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON issued verbal threats against the applicant . Other alleged incidents , the latest dated DATE , were not reported to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor indicted Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON for the attempted murder of the applicant . The charges concerned an incident occurring on DATE in which PERSON , a member of the special military forces known as the Wolves , and PERSON , had allegedly assaulted the applicant with the intention of killing him . Both accused had allegedly worn black masks and used metal clubs to beat the applicant . The applicant sustained head and body injuries . CARDINAL of his fingers were broken . In the assault , PERSON allegedly fired a shot , which did not hit the applicant . As stated in the indictment , PERSON , who had threatened on DATE to kill the applicant , had incited PERSON and PERSON to carry out the attempted killing .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were conducted before ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) . At the trial , the court heard oral evidence from the accused and several witnesses and confronted the applicant with PERSON PERSON It also admitted a considerable volume of documentary evidence , including several expert reports ; lists of temporarily seized objects ; detailed lists of calls on mobile phones confiscated from the accused ; reports on identity parades set up during the trial ; excerpts from several DATE newspapers , and other items of evidence . On DATE the trial court delivered a judgment acquitting the accused . The applicant was instructed to pursue possible compensation claims against the accused by means of a separate civil action for damages . In the judgment , the trial court examined the available evidence . It did not give weight to an expert report according to which strands of textile found on CARDINAL of the metal clubs used in the attack matched fibres from jeans like those confiscated from Mr PERSON It further disregarded an expert report which stated that a residue of saliva on a cigarette butt found at the scene of the incident immediately after the assault was consistent with blood group A , which was PERSON blood group . It did so because a DNA analysis of the saliva had excluded the possibility that the cigarette butt belonged to PERSON Because of some irregularities in the identity parade held by the police , the court also disregarded the fact that the applicant and CARDINAL witnesses had identified PERSON PERSON as one of the assailants . Lastly , it had not been confirmed that PERSON PERSON had threatened the applicant . The confrontation between the CARDINAL men had not supported the applicant \u2019s allegations in that respect . According to the receipt slip , this judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the public prosecutor and upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment . It found that the lower court had established the facts correctly and had provided sufficient reasons for its judgment . Further to the assessment of the evidence carried out by the trial court , ORG examined evidence regarding the bullet found at the scene after the incident . Forensic ballistics tests confirmed that its calibre corresponded to ammunition used by an NORP - produced gun of a type that had been reported stolen from a military unit in GPE in which Mr PERSON had served at CARDINAL time . That finding , coupled with the fact that the gun from which the bullet had been fired had not been found , had been insufficient , in the court \u2019s opinion , to attribute any guilt to Mr ORG concluded that the lower court had given a clear and lawful judgment . The Government provided a copy of a receipt slip according to which the applicant was served with this judgment on DATE . In the comments submitted in reply to the ORG \u2019s observations , the applicant did not contest the date of service of this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor challenged the lower courts\u2019 judgments by lodging , of his own motion , a request for the protection of legality ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the request and stated that the lower courts had violated section QUANTITY ) , paragraph CARDINAL , and ( CARDINAL ) read in conjunction with section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL LAW ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) in favour of the accused . Referring to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , it stated that its judgment would not affect the final judgment . ORG found that , on the basis of the evidence in the case file , the reasons given in the trial court \u2019s judgment had been unclear and contrary to the evidence adduced . The lower court had erred on the facts and had assessed the available evidence incorrectly , in particular evidence provided by the applicant and other witnesses who had identified the accused as the perpetrators of the crime . It stated that the trial court had established the facts solely on the basis of the evidence in favour of the defence . Evidence against the accused had been disregarded , with reasoning which lacked any substantiation . ORG further criticised the way in which the trial court had assessed the expert evidence . It also observed that ORG had upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment despite being vested with jurisdiction to ascertain of its own motion whether there had been any procedural flaws . The applicant was served with this judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG seeking protection of his right to freedom of expression , which had allegedly been violated owing to the failure of the ORG to identify and punish those responsible for the incident . Since ORG judgment had no bearing on the final judgment acquitting the accused , he alleged that he had also been denied the opportunity to claim compensation from the accused . The applicant reiterated that the incident of DATE had been connected to his criticism of company NORP and had been intended to silence him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected ( \u043e\u0442\u0444\u0440\u043b\u0430 ) the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the criminal courts had been required to establish whether any liability could be attributed to the accused . They had neither adduced any evidence nor established the facts in respect of whether the assault had been intended to restrict the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression . The intention to commit the crime was of importance for identifying the perpetrators and determining the penalty . Furthermore , the protected interest damaged by the alleged crime was the right to life and not freedom of expression . The assault in question had happened at a time and place that could not be directly linked to the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression . ORG accordingly found that the judgments of the first and second - instance courts had not been of any relevance to the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression . It further stated that ORG had no jurisdiction , in view of the proscription of reformatio in pejus set forth in DATE ) of LAW , to remit the case for re - examination or decide it on the merits . The ORG could not therefore be held responsible for failing to punish the perpetrators . Lastly , it had been open to the applicant to claim monetary compensation in civil proceedings as he had been instructed to do by the criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , the courts were responsible for establishing the relevant facts correctly and completely and assessing with equal diligence the evidence against and in favour of the accused .", "CARDINAL . LAW ) , paragraph CARDINAL , and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act provided that there was a substantial procedural flaw if a judgment contained no reasoning or the reasoning was incomprehensible or inconsistent , or if the court did not apply a statutory provision or applied it incorrectly .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL provided that the public prosecutor could lodge a request for the protection of legality ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) against final court judgments . ORG determined such requests .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , ORG was limited to examining the violations alleged in the request for the protection of legality . If such a request was lodged in favour of the convicted person , ORG could not amend the lower courts\u2019 judgments to his or her detriment regarding the legal classification of the crime and the penalty imposed .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , if ORG granted the request for the protection of legality it could issue the following judgments : it could overturn the final judgment ; it could annul the first and second - instance courts\u2019 judgments or only the second - instance court \u2019s judgment and remit the case for re - examination ; or it could merely acknowledge the violation . Under sub - section CARDINAL of that provision , if a request was lodged to the detriment of the accused and the court found the request well - founded , it would acknowledge that there had been a violation of the law . The judgment of ORG would not affect the final judgment .", "CARDINAL .
