P. had been used as an instrument in conflicts arising between the parents and the applicant father \u2019s adoptive parents . Her development did not correspond to that of the average for her age and it seemed that the child was at a stage of her development where it was crucial that she should be attached to stable and secure persons without risking her further development .

In its submissions of CARDINAL DATE ORG maintained that the access prohibition had been necessary on account of the GPE resistance both against the public care and the activities of the officials of ORG . ORG annexed copy letters and cards which the grandparents had sent to the children and which mentioned the foster family in negative terms . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the GPE resistance had influenced the children and was capable of jeopardising their positive development .

It found that there was no need for a hearing or an inspection and that the GPE negative feelings towards the public care situation and the children \u2019s placement in a foster home had been transmitted to the children , thereby clearly jeopardising their development and rendering the access prohibition necessary .

In response to a petition lodged by the parents , the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman ( eduskunnan apulaisoikeusasiamies , riksdagens bitr\u00e4dande justitieombudsman ) , on DATE , found that the children \u2019s placement in public care had been justified . In general terms , she nevertheless underlined that the grounds relied upon in a public care order should be factual and not speculative . For instance , sexual abuse of the child could not be relied upon as a fact in the absence of any expert findings corroborating such a statement . Although the issuing of a public care order could well be justified already on the basis of such suspicions , the grounds relied upon should refer to the symptoms from which the child has been found to suffer . As for the access restrictions , the Deputy Ombudsman stressed , again in general terms , that ORG must actively support access arrangements between the children and both their parents and others who are close to them . Such access should not hamper the foster family \u2019s DATE work . The access arrangements should normally be agreed upon when the public care plan was being drawn up . If an agreement could not be reached , an appealable decision was to be made and any restrictions were to be limited in time .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG rejected the applicant father \u2019s request for an oral hearing and upheld ORG decision in regard to the justification of the care order .

On DATE social welfare officials drew up a care plan . It mentions the first applicant \u2019s wishes , indicates measures to be resorted to for the benefit of the children , i.e. that the children be supported to find activities corresponding to their age and talents and that , if need be , they be provided with individual therapy . It states that the care will continue until further notice since conditions for its termination are not , for the time being , at hand . The applicant father objected to the plan , considering that it did not comply with domestic law . It did not , for instance , specify the conditions in his home which should be improved before the care orders could be revoked .
