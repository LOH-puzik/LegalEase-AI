On DATE the applicants lodged proceedings before the competent Tribunal of Latina , requesting the registration of their marriage in the light of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see relevant domestic law below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 claim . It noted that the registration of the marriage was not possible , because if such a marriage had been contracted in GPE it would not have been considered valid according to the current state of the law , as it failed to fulfil the most basic requirement , that of having a female and a male . In any event , the marriage contracted by the applicants had no consequence in the NORP legal order in so far as a marriage CARDINAL persons of the same sex , although validly contracted abroad , ran counter to international public order . Indeed same - sex marriage was in contrast with GPE \u2019s history , tradition and culture , and the fact that so few ORG ( GPE ) countries had provided such legislation went to show that it was not in line with the common principles of international law .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicants was rejected by a decision of ORG , filed in the relevant registry on DATE . ORG noted that such registration could not take place , given that their marriage lacked one of the essential requisites to amount to the institution of marriage in the domestic order , namely the spouses being of different sexes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL applicants appealed to ORG . In particular they highlighted , inter alia , that public order referred to in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , had to be interpreted as international public order not national public order , and thus it had to be established whether same - sex marriage was against that order , in the light of international instruments .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) ORG rejected the appeal and confirmed the previous judgment . Noting the ORG \u2019s case - law in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) it acknowledged that a marriage contracted abroad by CARDINAL persons of the same sex was indeed existent and valid , however , it could not be registered in GPE in so far as it could not give rise to any legal consequence .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation referred to its case - law , to the effect that civil marriages contracted abroad by NORP nationals had immediate validity in the NORP legal order as a result of LAW and international private law . This would be so in so far as the marriage had been contracted in accordance with the laws of the foreign state in which it had been contracted , and that the relevant substantive requirements concerning civil status and the capacity to marry ( according to NORP law ) subsisted , irrespective of any non - observance of NORP regulations regarding the issuing of the banns or the subsequent registration . The former were subject solely to administrative sanctions and the latter were not conducive of any legal effects \u2013 since registration had the mere significance of giving publicity to a deed or act which was already valid on the basis of the locus regit actum principle . Thus , had the marriage been contracted by persons of the opposite sex , in the absence of any other fundamental requirements it would have been valid and conducive of legal effects in the NORP legal order . In that case the Civil Status Officer would have no option but to register the marriage . However , the case - law had shown that the opposite sex of the spouses was the most indispensable requirement for the \u201c existence \u201d of a marriage as a legally relevant act , irrespective of the fact that this was not stated anywhere explicitly in the relevant laws . Thus , the absence of such a requirement placed in question not only the validity of the marriage , but its actual existence , meaning that it would not be conducive to any legal effects ( as opposed to a nullity ) . It followed that according to the ordinary law of the land , CARDINAL same - sex spouses had no right to have their marriage contracted abroad registered .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the said refusal could not be based on the ground that such a marriage ran counter to public order ( as dictated by the relevant circulars ) , but that the refusal was simply a consequence of the fact that it could not be recognised as a marriage in the NORP legal order .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to note that the social reality had changed , yet the NORP order had not granted same - sex couples the right to marry as concluded in ORG judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( which it cited extensively ) . Indeed the question whether or not to allow same - sex marriage , or the registration thereof , was not a matter of ORG law , it being left to regulation by ORG . However , the NORP legal order was also made up of LAW as interpreted by ORG in PERSON and PERSON ( cited above ) ; in that case the ORG considered that the difference of sex of spouses was irrelevant , legally , for the purposes of marriage . It followed that , irrespective of the fact that it was a matter to be dealt with by the national authorities , it could no longer be a prerequisite for the \u201c existence \u201d of marriage . Moreover , ORG noted that persons of the same sex living together in a stable relationship had the right to respect for their private and family life under LAW ; therefore , even if they did not have the right to marry or to register a validly contracted marriage abroad , in the exercise of the right to freely live with the inviolable status of a couple , they could bring actions before the relevant courts to claim , in specific situations related to their fundamental rights , treatment which was uniform with that afforded by law to married couples .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG found that the claimants had no right to register their marriage . However , this was so not because the marriage did not \u201c exist \u201d or was \u201c invalid \u201d but because of its inability to produce ( as a marriage deed ) any legal effect in the NORP order ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
