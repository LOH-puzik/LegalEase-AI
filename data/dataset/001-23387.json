In DATE the applicant \u2019s neighbour , PERSON , applied for a building permit for a new barn . On DATE the Mayor ( B\u00fcrgermeister ) of PERSON granted the building permit . In the following following DATE built the barn .", "On DATE , after a hearing , the Mayor granted both a retroactive permit for certain modifications of PERSON project and the permit to use the building ( Ben\u00fctzungsbewilligung ) .", "On DATE the applicant , who had not been summoned to this hearing , appealed against the permit to use the building and submitted that the new building did not comply with the building permit . In particular she submitted that , because the barn was too close to her land , more rainwater and snow than before was deposited on her land which had adversely affected the soil and her house .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The applicant filed a further appeal ( PERSON ) against this decision .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision for procedural reasons .", "On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .

It found that the applicant had locus standi as the proceedings were also related to a modification of the building permit . Furthermore , it found that the neighbour \u2019s building did not comply with the building permit and that the permit to use the building was therefore unlawful . Finally , it stated that PERSON had to apply for a new building permit as regards the parts of the barn which had not been built in conformity with the building permit granted .", "On DATE ORG , implementing ORG decision , allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE .", "On DATE PERSON applied for a new building permit .

It found that LAW CARDINAL ( GPE ) would be applicable to PERSON application for a building permit and not the previous version of the building act . Moreover , it found that PERSON \u2019s application was insufficient and , therefore , the building permit unlawful . On that basis ORG had to dismiss PERSON \u2019s application . If PERSON would not properly apply for a building permit , proceedings for a demolition order had to be considered . Moreover , it stated that it was not necessary to deal with the complaint about the unfairness of the proceedings as ORG decision should be quashed following this decision .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against this decision .
