He is represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG , a firm of lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . He arrived in GPE in DATE , at DATE , with his father , step - mother , uncle and siblings , having spent DATE in a refugee camp in GPE immediately prior to his arrival . He was , together with his family , granted refugee status on DATE and indefinite leave to remain on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant made an allegation of child abuse , claiming that since he was DATE , his father had regularly beaten him and deprived him of food . He was placed with foster carers but , as the local authority \u2019s investigations into his allegations were inconclusive and the applicant \u2019s father agreed not to use force against him , he was returned home DATE . However , following further allegations of violence against his father , the applicant was placed with foster carers in DATE . He returned home for DATE but , following further allegations , was placed with foster carers in DATE . He absconded , and in DATE was placed in a residential children \u2019s home . A medical examination conducted on DATE indicated that the applicant had old injuries consistent with his account of abuse at the hands of his father and was extremely thin . He went to live with his uncle in DATE , until DATE when his uncle stated that he could no longer care for him and the applicant was placed back in a residential children \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the period DATE there were problems with the applicant \u2019s behaviour . He used drugs , including crack cocaine , and stole to finance his drug use , accumulating CARDINAL criminal convictions as a minor . He frequently absconded from his residential placements and was excluded from school . In DATE the residential children \u2019s home terminated his placement , on the grounds that his behaviour was beyond their control , and in particular that he was bullying residents and threatening staff . At DATE , he moved into bed and breakfast accommodation . In the Autumn of CARDINAL the applicant persuaded his father to pay for him to travel to GPE to visit his grandmother , where he remained until DATE ( by which time he was aged CARDINAL ) . Thereafter he received support , including with accommodation , from the social services \u201c leaving care team \u201d , although from DATE he spent substantial periods in custody .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was convicted of CARDINAL offences , including theft , affray , common assault , possession of Class A and \u0412 drugs , burglary , robbery , handling stolen goods and failing to surrender to bail . In DATE he received a DATE custodial sentence for robbery . In DATE , whilst still under supervision by the probation service following his release , he committed further offences and on DATE he was convicted of robbery and offering to supply a Class \u0412 drug and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The applicant had forced the DATE he was supplying with drugs to strip and was verbally and physically aggressive towards him because he was unable to pay . On his release , in DATE , the applicant failed to attend probation appointments and was recalled to prison . He was re - released on DATE . On DATE he committed a further robbery , for which he was convicted on DATE . He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff based on a determinate sentence of DATE , but on appeal this was reduced to a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In the course of that period of detention he received CARDINAL in - prison adjudications for misconduct , including fighting and disobeying orders . The applicant was released on DATE , but was recalled to prison on CARDINAL DATE following a fight with another resident of the hostel where he was living .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that the Secretary of ORG had decided to deport him to GPE , as conducive to the public good . However , this decision was subsequently withdrawn as the applicant \u2019s refugee status had not been considered . On DATE the applicant was informed that the decision had been taken to revoke his refugee status . On DATE , his prison sentence ended , and he was immediately transferred into immigration detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against both the decision to revoke his refugee status and the decision to deport him , and his appeal was heard by the then ORG on DATE . The ORG took note of the applicant \u2019s claims to have been drug - free since DATE , and to have been let down by social services in failing to investigate the abuse he had suffered at the hands of his father and in failing subsequently to provide him with adequate support . However , the ORG found that , while the local authority should have investigated the applicant \u2019s allegations of abuse more rigorously , he had , in fact , received considerable support from social services and had on occasion abused this help by running away from care homes or failing to attend appointments . In his evidence to the ORG , the applicant claimed not to believe in God and not to be a practising NORP but , undermining his credibility , this contrasted with his complaint to the local authority that he was placed in a drug rehabilitation unit which did not meet his cultural needs as a NORP . According to a forensic psychiatric report , the applicant presented a moderate risk of violent recidivism , which would be increased if he returned to substance abuse or was subjected to negative peer influences . It appeared to the ORG that , if released , the applicant was likely to return to the same area where he had previously committed crimes ; that he had no employment prospects ; and that he had previously failed to comply with supervision in the community . Given these facts and the seriousness of his offence , particularly when combined with his \u201c appalling record \u201d of previous convictions , the ORG concluded that the applicant was a danger to the community and that deportation was appropriate . The ORG considered a number of recent country guidance cases and the expert reports submitted by the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and concluded that the revocation of his refugee status was also appropriate . There was evidence that his father had been born in GPE in GPE , which meant that the applicant would be allowed entry by the NORP authorities . He was of the PERSON clan , which was the majority clan in GPE , and would be able to seek clan protection . The objective evidence indicated that the situation in PERSON was reasonably stable . The grant of asylum to the applicant was no longer necessary . The tribunal also rejected the applicant \u2019s claim to protection under LAW , concluding :", "\u201c There is no evidence to support the appellant \u2019s view that he faces a real risk of illtreatment upon return to NORP . The appellant is a young single male with no dependants who would be able to establish himself in northern GPE and obtain protection from his clan . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought reconsideration of the ORG \u2019s decision , which was refused by a Senior Immigration Judge on DATE . Pending his application to ORG he was granted bail by ORG on DATE , on conditions including twice DATE reporting . The applicant failed to comply with the bail conditions and did not report at all during DATE . His application for reconsideration was refused by ORG on DATE . ORG found that the ORG had been entitled to hold that the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE would not breach LAW and that his deportation would not amount to a disproportionate interference with his LAW . The ORG had plainly had regard to all the applicant \u2019s arguments and there was no realistic possibility that another ORG would reach a different conclusion .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant was arrested on a charge of theft and remanded to prison . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment , and , following completion of his sentence , a decision was made to detain him under immigration powers . On DATE , while in immigration detention , the applicant was involved in a fight with another detained person , and on DATE he was convicted and fined for resisting or obstructing a person assisting a constable , which incident had taken place on DATE . In DATE the applicant was , with others , involved in a serious disturbance whilst in immigration detention , resulting in injury to a number of individuals , including staff . He was placed in a segregation unit , and transferred to prison on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A report published by ORG on CARDINAL DATE , \u201c Eligibility Guidelines for assessing the international protection needs of asylumseekers from GPE \u201d , stated as follows :", "\u201c The self - declared Republic of NORP , which has not been recognized by the international community as an independent sovereign state , has been relatively peaceful and secure with the exception of the problematic presidential elections process ...", "ORG considers that a situation of generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order does not exist to the extent that an individual present in either GPE or PERSON would be at risk of serious harm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a report published on DATE , \u201c Human Rights Challenges : NORP \u201d , ORG observed :", "\u201c While overall human rights and humanitarian conditions have continued to worsen in southern and central GPE , as well as in GPE , a stable NORP has devoted attention to democratization , institutional capacity - building , stability and development in its CARDINAL-year pursuit of international recognition of self - declared independence . While ORG takes no position on GPE \u2019s claim to independence , the international community should provide the de facto authorities of the Government of NORP with necessary support to promote the rights of its people , and to ensure its capacity to firmly establish broad human rights protections . \u201d", "In their DATE Report on GPE , published on CARDINAL DATE , ORG found in relation to NORP that :", "\u201c Presidential elections were held on DATE in GPE . PERSON , a former opposition politician , was declared the new President in DATE . According to independent observers , the elections were generally free , fair and peaceful . However , media freedom organizations reported some instances of restrictions on journalists in the lead - up to the elections .", "Tensions flared in the border areas of NORP and PERSON claimed by GPE . A new armed group clashed with NORP security forces from DATE . CARDINAL of people were reportedly displaced by the clashes .", "Displaced people from southern and central GPE continued to live in difficult conditions .", "Minority groups continued to suffer discrimination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a report published on DATE , \u201c Hostages to Peace : Threats to ORG in NORP \u201d , ORG reported as follows :", "What PERSON has accomplished over DATE is both improbable and deeply impressive . While much of south / central GPE remains mired in chaos and bloodshed , GPE has built a hard - won peace that it has now maintained for DATE . That peace has sheltered PERSON from the horrific abuses that have destroyed so many lives across GPE . At the same time , GPE has done much to build the foundations of democratic governance grounded in respect for fundamental human rights . In DATE and DATE it held competitive and credible national elections , including parliamentary polls that put the territory \u2019s ORG firmly in the hands of the political opposition . There is a vibrant print media and an active and independent civil society . NORP has accomplished these things primarily on its own , in one of the world \u2019s most volatile regions . \u201d", "ORG \u2019s more recent \u201c World Report DATE GPE \u201d , published on DATE , stated :", "\u201c After DATE of delay , NORP finally held its presidential election on DATE . International observers deemed the polls reasonably free and fair despite an isolated incident in the NORP region , where CARDINAL person was killed . The incumbent President PERSON accepted defeat and peacefully ceded power to an opposition candidate , further advancing hopes for stability in the northern region .", "The situation remains unstable in the contested regions of NORP , Sanag , and PERSON , which lie between GPE , in GPE \u2019s northwest , and the autonomous state of GPE in the northeast . CARDINAL of civilians were displaced by clan - based clashes and conflicts over resources in the disputed area in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The most recent Operational Guidance Note on GPE , published on DATE , provided :", "\u201c NORP and GPE , are in general relatively safe . A long - standing dispute exists over the territories of PERSON , NORP and Sanag , with both PERSON and GPE claiming them and the Sool - Sanag - Cayn alliances fighting to remain part of the original state of GPE . General insecurity resulting from armed violence continues to be the main protection concern in the LOC regions of GPE and there has also been an increase in violence and assassinations in GPE , since DATE , mostly in GPE , PERSON and areas around GPE .", "There are major protection concerns around [ internally displaced person ] settlements both in GPE and GPE , which include overcrowding , severe levels of malnourishment , economic exploitation of children and a lack of physical security , rapes , gang rapes and other instances of sexual and gender - based violence .", "The authorities in GPE will only admit failed asylum seekers returning from NORP countries who originate from their territory or those who have close affiliations to the territory through clan membership . In the case of majority clan affiliates , this means those associated with the GPE in GPE . In NORP taxis and CARDINAL vehicles can easily travel from GPE , ORG and PERSON . The main transportation between GPE and LOC is by lorry . People travel by air between GPE and PERSON . The ORG in ORG and others ... also found that a person from GPE will not , in general , be able without real risk of serious harm to travel overland from FAC to a place where he or she might be able to obtain an unofficial travel document for the purposes of gaining entry to NORP , and then by land to GPE . This is particularly the case if the person is female . A proposed return by air to PERSON , GPE ( whether or not via FAC ) will in general involve no such risks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP ( PERSON ) v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) , heard by ORG on DATE , reference was made to a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of GPE and the NORP authorities concluded in DATE and renewed in DATE , which dealt with the question of returns . The Memorandum of Understanding provided that the NORP authorities would accept the return of persons who had no right to remain in GPE and had a right of return to NORP . Such return might be voluntary or enforced as regards the individual , but required the prior consent of the authorities . Such consent would be granted only after the provision of bio - data to satisfy the NORP authorities that the individual in question had a sufficient connection to GPE , which would generally entail that the person came from a clan with a sizeable representation in the region , and/or had been born or had parents who had been born in the region , and/or had family currently residing there . If a returnee were to be rejected by the NORP authorities at the point of entry , he or she would be brought back to GPE at the Government \u2019s expense .", "CARDINAL . During the domestic proceedings and in his application to this ORG , the applicant relied on CARDINAL reports , dated DATE and DATE , by PERSON , from ORG . Mr H\u00f6hne had learnt the NORP language and had carried out research on NORP history , culture and politics since DATE , including extensive field research throughout DATE in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his first report , Mr H\u00f6hne gave an overview of events in GPE from DATE onwards . He noted that warlord rule prevailed in southern GPE , but that in LOC the situation developed differently , since ORG , a guerrilla organisation predominantly supported by the PERSON clan , seized control early in DATE . The guerrillas entered into peace negotiations with the various other clans in the region and NORP was declared a secessionist republic in DATE . Over DATE PERSON developed as a peaceful de facto State , with a clan - based political system . In DATE , democratic reforms had been introduced and elections were held in DATE and DATE . However , the effectiveness of ORG was limited by lack of resources , non - recognition by the international community and military challenges from other clans , who opposed a separate NORP .", "CARDINAL . Mr H\u00f6hne referred to the ORG \u2019s conclusions in PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE that individuals without ties to NORP would risk being turned back at the airport or subjected to harassment and abuse by the authorities . Although it appeared that the applicant originated from NORP , it was unclear from which clan he descended , and without any contacts to arrange his reception and arrival at FAC , he might face rejection by the authorities . If he were allowed to enter , he might face severe problems in finding proper accommodation and meeting his other basic needs . Individuals who stood out because they dressed or spoke differently from the general population were subject to verbal harassment on the street , possibly escalating into physical attacks . NORP was strictly NORP and any person who failed to conform to NORP norms would be stigmatised and excluded from access to work , health care and other basic services . There was no welfare state or free access to health care , and people with serious illnesses had to rely on their families for support . Educational facilities were poor and unemployment was high . In most cases , it was necessary to rely on assistance from relatives in order to get a job . The reaction of the local population to the applicant would , therefore , depend on his ability to conform to the local culture . If he did become stigmatised because of his inability to fit in , he would face exclusion from employment and basic social services .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his DATE report , Mr H\u00f6hne referred to a report by ORG that the ongoing instability and armed conflict in southern and central GPE had had an impact in GPE . There were CARDINAL camps for displaced persons in PERSON , populated by refugees from elsewhere in GPE and GPE , and members of minority groups originating in GPE . Living conditions in the camps were harsh , with no running water or electricity and problems with security . Religious extremism had increased in NORP in DATE , due in part to radical NORP groups such as ORG increasing their following , with the result that much of the population took great pains to follow NORP rules and norms in all areas of DATE life , and practices which had previously been tolerated , particularly in the urban centres of the region , were now completely unacceptable . Such practices included the wearing of light clothes or even trousers by women , and smoking by men . The applicant \u2019s lack of knowledge of and adherence to the principles of ORG would , in the light of the increasingly strict and intolerant religious context , be an even more worrying issue for him . Furthermore , the fact that it had now emerged that the applicant was from the majority ORG clan did not alter Mr PERSON \u2019s view that , without contacts or family connections in GPE , the applicant would face severe difficulties in establishing himself . Housing , employment and other services were usually organised within family networks ; unemployment was high and it was extremely hard to find a job without good qualifications and family support . An individual would need detailed knowledge about clan relations and other social structures in order to find his way through daily life ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
