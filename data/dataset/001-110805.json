The applicants are NORP nationals . They are all civil servants employed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a petition with their employer , PERSON , a ORG agency , asking to have their entitlement to certain wage - related rights acknowledged . More specifically , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL on the status of civil servants , they asked for CARDINAL allowances to be added to their basic salary , namely a grade supplement and a supplement related to their salary step . The applicants quantified each of these supplements at PERCENT of the basic salary .", "The aforesaid allowances were to be paid retroactively , starting from DATE , but also in the future , until the ORG contracts ended .", "At the same time , the applicants requested that these entitlements be noted in their employment record books .", "On DATE their employer dismissed the petition as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants contested that decision before the Cara\u015f Severin County Court . They contended that even though , in accordance with Government Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the application of the provisions granting them the rights in question had been suspended until DATE , this did not mean that they were not due for payment starting from DATE , when the suspension had ended , as the suspension of a right was not equivalent to the extinction of that right .", "In any event , they considered that the suspension was in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , and that the allowances claimed were therefore to be paid retroactively , from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . The court acknowledged that , according to the provisions of LAW applicable to the case , the employer was obliged to pay its employees all the allowances derived from the law and from the employment contract . Therefore , the applicants , civil servants , were entitled to receive , in addition to their other salary entitlements , the CARDINAL supplements in question \u2013 the grade allowance and the allowance corresponding to the salary step \u2013 as provided for by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) .", "The CARDINAL supplements were first provided for by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , but without any indication as to the exact amount . In fact , none of the subsequent legal texts on civil servants\u2019 salary rights made any reference to a method or criterion for determining the amount of any of the supplements .", "Hence , even though PERSON no . CARDINAL expressly stated that a civil servant \u2019s salary was also composed of the grade supplement and the salary - step supplement , the determination of these rights was left to the executive , which was entitled to set out rules for the application of the law . Consequently , the court held as follows :", "\u201c In the absence of a legal act issued or adopted by the executive in which the amount of the CARDINAL allowances claimed is defined , the court does not have jurisdiction to determine by itself the amounts , as this would undermine the separation of powers principle by encroaching on the powers of the administrative authorities .", "The court therefore holds that in the above - mentioned circumstances , the respondent can not be ordered to pay the allowances claimed before their amount has been determined . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment to ORG , reiterating the arguments they had submitted before the first - instance court . In addition , they stated that under LAW the acquired rights of employees could not be made subject to any limitations . Furthermore , they contended that it was a basic legal principle that laws were made in order to produce effects , it being inconceivable that a legal text would have only a superficial value and not be applicable . They asserted that their right to the allowances they had requested was protected by LAW . CARDINAL to the Convention , in so far as it was a right provided for by law .", "The applicants alleged that the interpretation of the applicable legal provisions given by the court in refusing to allow their claims rendered those texts completely ineffective and thus devoid of any substance .", "Moreover , such an interpretation was discriminatory and in breach of LAW , in so far as there was consistent national case - law granting other claimants ( also civil servants ) the right to the supplements in question . The discrimination was even more disturbing given that another person , PERSON , employed by the same institution as them , had obtained the allowances following a decision of DATE given by the same first - instance court , the Cara\u015f Severin County Court . That decision had been upheld by ORG on DATE , when it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Timi\u015foara ORG dismissed the ORG appeal .", "The court noted that there was no legal justification for claiming the allowances in an amount of PERCENT of the basic salary , and consequently for allowing such a claim , as the figure in question was not laid down anywhere in the law .", "In that connection , in order to be able to determine the exact amount of the allowances in question , additional legislation was needed , either in the form of legal provisions adopted by the legislature designed to regulate the application of LAW , or in the form of instructions issued by the Government in a separate legal text designed to explain how the law should be applied .", "ORG also referred to ORG case - law to the effect that :", "\u201c The courts do not have jurisdiction to repeal or to refuse to apply specific normative acts which they consider to be discriminatory , and thus to replace them with norms created by judicial intervention or with provisions contained in other normative acts . \u201d", "Therefore , the court considered that it could not allow the ORG claims , in so far as those claims had not been determined by the competent authorities .", "Regarding the divergent case - law referred to by the applicants in their arguments , the court held that in the NORP legal system , legal precedents were not a source of law and therefore could not be taken into consideration .", "On the applicability of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , the court mentioned that the applicants had not proved the existence of a \u201c possession \u201d , or at least of a \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d , since the case - law on the matter was not well - established .", "Furthermore , the court held that LAW was not applicable to civil servants , as they were appointed to their posts on the basis of PERSON no . CARDINAL . The appointments were thus made by means of individual administrative acts which did not make any reference to the allowances in question and , in any event , had not been contested by any of the applicants at the time of their appointment .", "In conclusion , the applicants\u2019 claims were dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . LAW entered into force on DATE , once PERSON no . CARDINAL had been enacted . On DATE section CARDINAL of the Statute was amended to provide that , starting from that date , certain allowances were to be included in the salaries of public servants .", "\u201c CARDINAL . For discharging their activities public servants shall have the right to a salary composed of the following :", "( a ) the basic salary", "( b ) seniority allowance", "( c ) grade allowance", "( d ) step allowance", "CARDINAL . Public servants shall be granted bonuses and other salary entitlements , in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The remuneration of public servants shall take place in accordance with [ the criteria ] set forth in the law on the implementation of a uniform remuneration scheme for public servants . \u201d", "On DATE , point ( d ) was amended to read \u201c allowance corresponding to the salary step \u201d . With effect from DATE , section CARDINAL became section CARDINAL , while no amendments were made to the content .", "The application of these provisions was suspended from DATE until DATE , first by LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , then by Government Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , enacted as PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and then by Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , enacted as LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "With effect from DATE the CARDINAL allowances , namely the grade supplement and the allowance corresponding to the salary step , were abolished by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted CARDINAL other judgments given by ORG of PERSON , in which the PERSON requests had been granted . In CARDINAL of the judgments , given on DATE by the same panel as the one which sat in the applicants\u2019 case , it was stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c It is irrelevant that the legal text did not lay down the exact amount of the salary entitlements in question , as this can not constitute a well - founded reason for dismissing the claims ; such an interpretation would render ineffective the legal provisions concerned , which are part of the positive law , and this would be inconceivable . \u201d", "In another judgment submitted by the applicants , ORG held on DATE in a similar case that the claimants , employees of ORG , were entitled to the allowances in question , as the corresponding rights were provided for by the law , it being irrelevant whether their amount was determined or not .", "CARDINAL . The Government contended that , of the QUANTITY courts of appeal across the country , a number had dismissed similar claims relating to salary entitlements even before DATE , when ORG and ORG had ruled on an appeal in the interests of the law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . These included ORG , ORG and ORG , as well as the courts of appeal in GPE , GPE , PERSON and GPE . The reasons given for dismissing the claims had been identical , resembling those subsequently given in the ruling on the appeal in the interests of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , noting that since DATE a divergence of case - law had emerged across the country concerning the granting of certain allowances to public servants , ORG applied to ORG and ORG in accordance with the provisions of LAW of ORG , in order to ensure the uniform interpretation and application of the law .", "ORG delivered its judgment on DATE , confirming the existence of a divergence in the case - law concerning the interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) of Law no . CARDINAL , while also setting out guidelines for a uniform interpretation of the text , as follows :", "\u201c For the uniform interpretation and application of LAW ( c ) and ( d ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG holds that , in the absence of a legal determination of their amount , the grade allowance and the allowance relating to the salary step can not be granted by the judiciary . \u201d", "ORG further held that the entitlements claimed by the public servants did not constitute a \u201c possession \u201d , as , in the absence of criteria for their calculation , they were only \u201c virtual rights \u201d .", "According to LAW , ORG interpretation of the provisions in question is binding on all the domestic courts . A decision delivered on an appeal in the interests of the law can not alter the outcome of cases already decided .", "Following the adoption of the above - mentioned judgment , the divergent case - law on the issue ceased and the domestic courts followed ORG guidelines ( see also PERSON and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report states in its relevant parts that , in order for the principle of legal certainty , essential for maintaining confidence in the judicial system and the rule of law , to be achieved , the State must make the law easily accessible and must also apply the laws it has enacted in a foreseeable and consistent manner . As the existence of conflicting decisions within the highest courts may be contrary to this principle , it is therefore necessary for these courts to establish mechanisms to avoid conflicts and ensure the coherence of their case - law .", "CARDINAL . In her preliminary assessment on the independence of the NORP judiciary following the visit to GPE in DATE , the Rapporteur stressed that the practice of the domestic courts had been undermined by the absence of a stable legislative framework , resulting in a lack of uniform interpretation and application of the law . The lack of predictability of judicial decisions and the lack of acceptability of judicial decision - making were structural factors that needed to be addressed .", "CARDINAL . In its relevant parts , the ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . While recognising the judges\u2019 power to interpret the law , the obligation of the judges to promote legal certainty has also to be remembered . Indeed legal certainty guarantees the predictability of the content and application of the legal rules , thus contributing in ensuring a high quality judicial system .", "CARDINAL . ORG will apply the interpretative principles applicable in both national and international law with this aim in mind . ... In civil law countries , they will be guided by case law , especially that of the highest courts , whose task includes ensuring the uniformity of case law .", "DATE .
