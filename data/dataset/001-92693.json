The report concluded that although the autopsy report dated DATE had stated that the entrance hole had been in the back , as following the chemical examination no nitrite and nitrate ions had been found on PERSON clothes , this should indicate that the bullet must have entered from the xiphoid process .

After making an analysis of the available documentary evidence , PERSON concluded that the presence of a small circular gunshot wound in the back and a larger gunshot wound in the front of the abdomen was suggestive of the entrance wound being in the back . The presence of nitrate - nitrite ions on the skin taken from the back of the body and their absence on the front would provide confirmatory evidence that the back contained the entrance wound . However , it was also stated that these findings were inconsistent with the fact that no gunshot residue was identified anywhere on the clothing . In sum , Professor PERSON concluded that the evidence supported the theory that the entrance wound was in the back ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
