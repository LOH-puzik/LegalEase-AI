These are considered to be CARDINAL for prisoners in shared accommodation and CARDINAL for a prison cell . These minima are , related however , to wider analyses of specific prison systems , including studies of how much time prisoners actually spend in their cells . These minima should not be regarded as the norm . Although the ORG has never laid down such a norm directly , indications are that it would consider QUANTITY as a desirable size for a cell for CARDINAL prisoner . This is an area in which the ORG could make an ongoing contribution that would build on what has already been laid down in this regard . What is required is a detailed examination of what size of cell is acceptable for the accommodation of various numbers of persons . Attention needs to be paid to the number of TIME that prisoners spend locked in the cells , when determining appropriate sizes . Even for prisoners who spend a large amount of time out of their cells , there must be a clear minimum space , which meets standards of human dignity . \u201d", "In its Guidance the ICRC outlined the following principles :", "\u201c Shared or dormitory accommodation : QUANTITY per person , including where bunk beds are used .", "...", "As previously mentioned , space alone is a limited measure of the quality of life and conditions of detention .
