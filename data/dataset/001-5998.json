The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the tax authorities levied municipal and ORG tax on the applicant for DATE including , as part of the municipal income tax , a church tax to ORG . Not being a member of that ORG , the applicant was entitled to a reduction of the church tax in accordance with LAW Not Members of ORG om viss lindring i skattskyldigheten f\u00f6r den som icke tillh\u00f6r svenska kyrkan , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) . Accordingly , he was charged MONEY ( SEK ) , or MONEY of his taxable income , in church tax , which was paid to the relevant parish in ORG . This amount corresponded to MONEY of the amount he would have had to pay had he been a member of ORG .", "Upon review , the tax authorities upheld its decision on DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that the levying of church tax on someone who is not a member of ORG contravened , inter alia , LAW and LAW . He requested the court to hold an oral hearing in the case .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court rejected the applicant 's appeal and his request for an oral hearing .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE which , on DATE , refused to hold an oral hearing and , on DATE , rejected the appeal against the tax decision , finding it to be in conformity with LAW and LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "According to LAW , CARDINAL ) , the parishes within ORG are obliged to construct and maintain public burial - grounds , unless the Government decide in the case of a specific municipality that this task shall be performed by the municipality itself ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The right to be buried in a public burial - ground is not dependent on the deceased being a member of a particular religious community ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . However , the responsible organ , whether it be the local parish or the municipality , is obliged to provide for separate burial - grounds for those who are not members of any NORP community . The construction and maintenance of such burial - grounds are done in consultation with the religious communities concerned ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Decisions taken under the LAW by the parish or the municipality may be appealed against to ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) ( previously regulated in chapter LAW , now in LAW ) . In the municipality where the applicant was liable to pay tax \u2013 as in most parts of GPE \u2013 the burial administration remains with the local parish of ORG .", "When the responsibility for the keeping of population records was transferred from ORG to the local tax authorities in DATE ( see further below ) , it was decided that the parishes should take care of population records made before that date until these old records have been transferred to the ORG archives ( section CARDINAL of LAW ; GPE om inf\u00f6rande av folkbokf\u00f6rings - lagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . It was estimated that it would take DATE before all old records had been so transferred .", "LAW , DATE ) also specifically stipulated that a parish may , inter alia , use its financial means to acquire and maintain church buildings and other ecclesiastical property .", "At the material time , a church tax was collected together with the ordinary municipal tax . LAW , LAW referred in this respect to the provisions of LAW ( ORG , MONEY ) . The rate was determined by the local parish council which , under the transitional provisions of LAW ( Regeringsformen ) , had a status similar to that of the municipalities , including the right of taxation . This system had a long tradition , based on the fact that ORG is the established church . In DATE the rates applied by the parishes varied between CARDINAL and MONEY of the taxpayer 's taxable income . The lowest rates were applied by the parishes of GPE where it is the municipality DATE and not the parishes \u2013 that has the responsibility for the burial administration ( cf . NORP kyrkans ekonomi , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , a report on the economy of ORG made by ORG ) .", "LAW stipulated that a person who was not a member of ORG should pay a reduced church tax , the so - called dissenter tax . The reduction was motivated by the fact that non - members , referred to as dissenters , should pay the share of the tax that corresponded to the costs relating to the civil , i.e. non - religious , activities of the parish . The dissenter tax , like the church tax , was collected by the local tax authority and forwarded to the relevant parish .", "Originally , the dissenter tax amounted to MONEY of the ordinary church tax . In DATE it was reduced to MONEY of what the members of ORG had to pay . The rationale behind this change was that the share of the costs for the civil tasks performed by ORG the keeping of population records and the maintenance of churchyards and public burial - grounds \u2013 amounted on average to MONEY of the ORG 's total costs ( cf . Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the responsibility for the keeping of population records was transferred to the local tax authorities . With effect as from DATE , the dissenter tax was consequently further decreased , this time to MONEY of the amount paid by the members of ORG . It was considered that this percentage corresponded to the average costs of the parishes for the burial of the deceased ( cf . Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , appendix CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Reference was made to the above - mentioned report on the economy of ORG , according to which MONEY , or MONEY of the ORG 's total costs , related to the burial of the deceased .", "Under LAW of LAW the tax revenue of the different parishes was to a certain extent equalised through payments to and subsidies from the so - called ORG . Poor parishes received a general equalisation subsidy which was not ear - marked for any particular purpose . They could also be granted extra subsidies for specific purposes .", "On DATE the relations between the NORP State and ORG were changed , involving in practice a separation between the ORG and the ORG . LAW and LAW were abolished .", "The parishes ' right of taxation , previously regulated in LAW and LAW , was replaced with an obligation , laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW on ORG ( ORG om svenska kyrkan , GPE ) , on persons belonging to the ORG to pay a church fee .", "According to the new chapter CARDINAL of LAW , every person who is registered as resident in GPE has to pay a burial fee to defray the costs of the burial of the deceased ( section CARDINAL ) . The fee is based on the taxpayer 's taxable income ( section CARDINAL ) and is paid to the organ CARDINAL parish or municipality DATE responsible for burials at the place where the individual is registered ( section QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In the municipalities where the local parishes are responsible for burials , the fee of the members of ORG is to be included in the church fee ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . According to LAW ( F\u00f6rordningen om begravningsavgift , CARDINAL ) , the burial fee of non - members is fixed by ORG and Funds ( NORP ) following a proposal by ORG . ORG and the municipalities responsible for burials are obliged to provide the tax authorities and \u2013 in the case of ORG with the information needed to calculate and collect the fees . Under the new chapter CARDINAL of LAW , the relevant ORG supervises the parishes ' burial administration in respect of persons who are not members of ORG .", "As the parishes continue to be responsible for the care and maintenance of church buildings and other ecclesiastical property of historic value , ORG is to receive certain financial compensation from the ORG for the performance of this task ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
