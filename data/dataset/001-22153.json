ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) . He has double nationality ( NORP and NORP ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE in execution of a warrant issued by ORG on DATE . The applicant had been sentenced in GPE to DATE months\u2019 imprisonment for drug smuggling and money laundering .", "A hearing before ORG was scheduled for DATE . On that occasion the applicant was assisted by a lawyer and an interpreter .", "By an order of DATE , ORG validated the applicant \u2019s arrest and placed him in detention with a view to extradition . It observed that the NORP authorities had declared their intention to apply for the applicant \u2019s extradition according to LAW between GPE and GPE ( signed on DATE and ratified by NORP law n CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) . Taking into account the fact that the applicant had absconded for DATE , ORG considered that a restrictive measure was necessary to prevent him from fleeing pending trial . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE in its NORP version only .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was heard by a magistrate of ORG . He declared that he did not accept extradition to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant personally introduced a claim for immediate release before ORG . This claim , drafted in NORP , was based on LAW , according to which the provisional arrest of a person to be extradited should be revoked if an extradition request was not lodged with the competent executive authority within DATE time - limit .", "By an order of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It observed that on DATE the NORP authorities had filed with ORG a request for the applicant \u2019s extradition . The time - limit laid down in Article PERSON of LAW had therefore been complied with . This order was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . He alleged that the term \u201c executive authority \u201d contained in LAW could not be understood as a reference to ORG , and considered that the request for his extradition should have been lodged with ORG or with ORG itself . He also maintained that there was no evidence that the extradition had actually been requested .", "The result of this appeal is not known .", "On CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE , as well as on DATE , DATE and DATE , the applicant personally lodged a number of claims , drafted in LANGUAGE , with ORG . Invoking inter alia LAW , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , QUANTITY ( a ) and ( d ) of the LAW , he alleged that his arrest and detention were tantamount to torture or inhuman treatment , that none of the official documents concerning his deprivation of liberty had been translated into LANGUAGE and that he should be immediately released . He also observed that the doctor attached to the prison was unable to deal with his nerve , back and chronic ulcer problems and requested a visit from a specialised doctor , assisted by an interpreter , or a transfer to a private hospital for clinical tests . The applicant also requested the attendance and examination of a number of witnesses who could have testified that GPE wished to punish him by reason of his political beliefs .", "On DATE the applicant , relying inter alia on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) , ( c ) and ( e ) and CARDINAL of the Convention , requested permission to defend himself in person , to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence , to have the free assistance of an interpreter and not to be discriminated against on grounds of language and national origin .", "By an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s claims inadmissible as they had been drafted in a foreign language . It observed that , according to the relevant provisions of LAW ( hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a person should be assisted by an interpreter at the trial hearing and that the only material which should be translated was that addressed to the person to be extradited or made in front of him or her by the authorities . No free translation was provided when , as in the present case , the person to be extradited was addressing , almost on a DATE basis , various different claims to the judicial authorities . In any case , the person to be extradited was entitled , under NORP law , to the assistance of an NORP - speaking lawyer and/or to the consular assistance of his or her own ORG . On DATE this decision was served on the applicant in its NORP and LANGUAGE versions .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law to ORG against the order of CARDINAL DATE , which he considered to be discriminatory in nature and based on a misinterpretation of the ORG and the Convention . He also alleged that he had never been offered consular assistance from ORG . The result of this appeal is not known .", "In the meantime , on DATE the applicant personally introduced a claim , drafted in NORP , before ORG . He requested the appointment of a lawyer , the assistance of an interpreter and the translation of LAW ( hereinafter , the \u201c CC \u201d ) , of the ORG and of all the documents received up to then .", "By an order of DATE , ORG rejected this claim , pointing out that the applicant had already been provided with an LANGUAGE translation of all the relevant legal acts and that an interpreter had been appointed for the hearing on extradition scheduled for DATE . It also observed that the applicant was already assisted by a lawyer of his own choosing , who had a thorough knowledge of the NORP language . NORP law did not provide for the translation of the ORG or the ORG . This decision was served on the applicant in LANGUAGE .", "The hearing scheduled for DATE was postponed . On DATE , ORG requested the NORP authorities to provide evidence showing that the charges against the applicant were not time - barred .", "The hearing on the extradition request before ORG was scheduled for DATE . A copy of the summons for trial was served on the applicant in its LANGUAGE version . At the public hearing the applicant declared that the real aim of the extradition was to persecute him because of his political opinions .", "By a judgment of DATE , filed with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG ruled in favour of the applicant \u2019s extradition in relation to the charge of financial transaction of goods originating from drug trafficking . It observed that the applicant had been convicted in GPE ( on the basis , inter alia , of his confession ) only for that crime and not , as wrongly indicated in the order of DATE , for drug trafficking . As to the merits of the request , ORG noted that , according to the relevant provisions of LAW , the NORP authorities had provided a copy of the applicant \u2019s conviction and of the subsequent warrant for his arrest , a full description of the facts for which the extradition was requested and of their legal qualification in the NORP system . Moreover , nothing in the file showed that the extradition was aimed at persecuting the applicant on racial , religious or political grounds . As regards the alleged time - bar on the charge , it appeared from the documents produced by the NORP authorities that GPE law prohibited the execution of a penalty only if the formal accusation was made DATE after the date on which the offence had allegedly been committed . However , the crime for which the applicant \u2019s extradition was requested had been committed on DATE , while the formal indictment had been issued on DATE . Therefore , the DATE time - limit had not expired .", "On DATE , this judgment was served on the applicant in its NORP and LANGUAGE versions .", "The applicant appealed on points of law .", "By an order of DATE , ORG scheduled the hearing for DATE and appointed a legal representative . This order was served on the applicant in NORP on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to appoint an interpreter for the hearing of DATE . The proceedings were subsequently adjourned until DATE . The applicant alleges that on that date he was refused the assistance of a lawyer and/or of an interpreter .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to declare that the extradition procedure was null and void , as he had been denied the assistance of a legal representative and an interpreter . The result of this claim is not known .", "On DATE ORG granted the GPE extradition request .", "On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE , where he was imprisoned until DATE , having served his sentence with remission ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
