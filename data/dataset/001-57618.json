Counsel for the Government submitted that the case had become devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its judgment of DATE dismissing the appeal , ORG first rejected these submissions by ORG and counsel for the Government and then concluded as follows on the merits :", "\" ... Having reviewed the criteria relating to the complexity of the case and to the conduct of the judicial authorities and the parties , the ORG must examine the consequences of the trial for the rights and interests at stake . This is one of the factors to be considered , as has often been pointed out by ORG ( PERSON judgment ) . In its claim for compensation , the appellant company has given no indication of any consequences of the delay other than the precautionary entry which , in order to cover itself against the outcome of the trial , it had made [ in the land register ] against security at the time of the civil proceedings , so as to provide for possible compensation of the defendants if they should succeed at trial . Nothing was said about the practical consequences of the length of the trial for the rights and interests of the plaintiff . The latter confined itself in its submissions to noting the aforementioned effect of the precautionary step provided for in LAW of LAW and \u2018 non - pecuniary damage\u2019 , about which it remained vague . It thus appears that the time factor was not of primary importance in the instant case . Seeing that only court costs and the amount of the security were involved , it does not seem that this case before the GPE court merited any priority . If other , more urgent cases were pending , nothing precluded giving them priority and provisionally postponing the decision which is the subject of the present appeal .", "Consideration must also be given to what is regarded as the norm in respect of a court \u2019s level of activity and output in the light of the number of cases to be dealt with . This was the factor to which counsel for the Government referred when he set out the position not only of the court which had to deal with the case under appeal but also of the other GPE courts dealing with ordinary - and other - cases within their jurisdiction . He stressed the temporary backlog of cases and saw that as CARDINAL of the reasons for the length of the trial in issue . ORG must consider that factor , just as ORG has done , which has given judgment , under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , on delays found to have occurred in different types of trial . The PERSON judgment may be cited as an example .", "The length of an ordinary trial of a case which is complex and much disputed but does not merit any priority must be assessed on the basis of all these factors and in the light of the total time taken up by the trial . Inasmuch as the right to a trial without undue delay is not the same thing as strict compliance with court deadlines and does not necessarily mean that there is no abnormal situation , the delays during the civil proceedings in issue are not sufficient to warrant the conclusion that there has been a breach of LAW para . CARDINAL of the LAW ... \" ( PERSON Constitucional no . DATE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the judges , however , dissented :", "\" ...", "In the absence of any justification duly advanced by the trial court , we must ascertain whether or not the dilatoriness of which it is accused amounts to \u2018 delay\u2019 within the meaning of LAW . Even accepting the relevance of the criteria adopted in the judgment of this Court , the signatory of this separate opinion does not approve the manner in which they have been applied . The action was brought on DATE and judgment given on DATE . A total duration of CARDINAL and a half years is in principle excessive if we take into account ... the \u2018 total time taken up by the ORG and particularly if we remember that the trial court did not indicate to us any special feature of the case justifying such dilatoriness . In the absence of any detailed justification , it is likewise not possible ... to consider \u2018 what is regarded as the norm in respect of a court \u2019s level of activity and ORG . Since normality is what corresponds to the norm and not what departs from it , even if the norm is more often honoured in the breach than in the observance , the traditional slowness of the system of justice can not be regarded as \u2018 normal\u2019 . Furthermore , if the length of trials were to continue to grow longer , if the failure to comply with the norms of \u2018 output of the system of justice\u2019 were to become widespread and if such \u2018 abnormal\u2019 , but commonplace , circumstances always had to be taken as a basis for assessing whether or not the right to a trial without undue delay had been respected , the protection of this fundamental right would by that very fact be reduced to nought ... \" ( ibid . , p.

DATE , however , the new appointee left the post , which again remained vacant . Until DATE , when the new incumbent took up his duties , the judge of ORG no . CARDINAL , acting as a substitute , dealt with the cases assigned to ORG no . CARDINAL , and he it was who gave the judgment in the instant case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Similar difficulties prevailed in ORG , to the point that the ORG ( ORG ) devoted a chapter of his report for DATE to them .

CARDINAL ) .", "DATE the volume of cases to be dealt with by the CARDINAL chambers had increased by PERCENT .
