Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and PERSON , both NORP citizens , were detained on remand in DATE in connection with separate criminal proceedings brought against them before ORG ( PERSON , \" ORG \" ) . The present case is not concerned with the proceedings against the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON , an investigating judge at the said court , issued a warrant for Mr PERSON \u2019s arrest .", "He was suspected of having committed various offences , including aggravated fraud , professional burglary , forgery and suppression of documents , receiving stolen goods and unlawful possession of firearms . The reasons cited by the judge in support of his detention were the danger of his absconding and the risks of collusion and repetition of offences ( LAW ) , sub - paragraphs DATE , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was arrested in GPE on DATE . On DATE he was brought before Judge PERSON , the duty judge ( GPE , LAW ) , who informed him of the reasons for his arrest . On being questioned in the absence of his lawyer , he admitted unlawful possession of firearms , but denied having committed any other offence . The judge remanded him in custody .", "CARDINAL . Also on CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON ordered the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE , where ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) had on DATE issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of having taken part in an armed robbery in GPE . The GPE proceedings were joined to those instituted in GPE , and PERSON remained in the GPE remand prison from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were severed on DATE and ORG recovered jurisdiction over the proceedings which are the subject of the present case .", "The case was assigned to Judge PERSON , who on DATE opened a judicial investigation ( Voruntersuchung ) and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention to be continued ( LAW ) , sub - paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL , of LAW ) . ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) twice authorised the extension of his detention on remand , for a maximum period of DATE in all .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON challenged the investigating judge , alleging bias , but on CARDINAL May the challenge was held to be unsubstantiated by the President of ORG . On DATE the applicant brought a criminal complaint against Mr PERSON for abuse of public powers , on the ground that he had refused to allow a visit by Mr PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . As the public prosecutor \u2019s office had decided not to bring a prosecution , PERSON brought an alternative private prosecution himself ( PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the main proceedings , counsel for PERSON had submitted a memorial on DATE . On DATE the public prosecutor filed an indictment , in which the only charges were receiving stolen goods and illegal possession of firearms . An objection ( PERSON ) by the applicant against this indictment was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was sent for trial before ORG , composed of CARDINAL professional judges , PERSON ( the presiding judge ) and PERSON , and CARDINAL lay assessors ( Sch\u00f6ffen ) .", "On DATE , Judge PERSON summoned him to inform him that he had acted as investigating judge in the case until DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and was accordingly prevented from sitting in the trial under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . In the course of the interview PERSON waived his right to lodge a plea of nullity on this ground ( LAW , first sentence , of the LAW ; see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE , the presiding judge informed him that Judge PERSON was also disqualified under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , since he had , as duty judge , questioned him on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON likewise waived his right to lodge a plea of nullity on this point .", "In both cases , the relevant records were signed by him in the absence of his counsel , who had not been summoned on that occasion ; the applicant had stated that he did not think it necessary to consult him .", "CARDINAL . The hearings took place on DATE and DATE with the participation of the CARDINAL above - mentioned judges .", "Defence counsel did not object to the composition of ORG or challenge Judges PERSON and PERSON .", "Neither did he draw the court \u2019s attention , at the hearing of DATE , to the fact that , in the criminal proceedings instituted against Judge PERSON , the third investigating judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant had on DATE challenged all the judges of ORG , including Judges PERSON and PERSON . This challenge was eventually allowed by ORG on DATE , the judges concerned having declared themselves disqualified . The case was therefore referred to ORG and later discontinued .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the court convicted PERSON of aggravated receiving of stolen goods ( LAW ) and unlawful possession of firearms ( section CARDINAL of LAW , GPE ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a plea of nullity ( PERSON ) and an appeal against sentence ( GPE ) , which were dismissed by ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) on DATE .", "On the plea of nullity , the court observed that the defence had not raised at the proper time the issue of the participation of Judges PERSON and PERSON , who had been challenged in earlier proceedings , otherwise ORG would have been obliged to give an interlocutory decision . The fact that the challenge relating to the other case was subsequently allowed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) did not justify the conclusion that the CARDINAL professional judges were also biased in the criminal proceedings against PERSON . Furthermore , the latter could no longer argue that Judges PERSON and PERSON should in principle have withdrawn under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , because prior to the trial he had expressly waived his right to challenge them on this ground .", "ORG also confirmed the sentence .", "CARDINAL . During their detention on remand the applicants corresponded with each other . In DATE , the investigating judge censored a letter from PERSON to PERSON by crossing out and making illegible certain passages . They were not reconstructed in the national proceedings , but their content was said to have been as follows ( translation ) :", "\" I wonder whether there is anybody left in this monkey house who is still normal ... In life they are nobodies , here they think they are gods . Some of the officers are guests like us . They are always spying on the women , these monkeys are proper peeping toms ! I hate it ! \"", "CARDINAL . PERSON complained to ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG . She claimed that the form of censorship used was unlawful , since LAW authorised the stopping of letters , but not making them illegible . Besides , it allowed censorship only in respect of letters likely to interfere with the purpose of detention , or giving rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence where the offender could be prosecuted ex officio , with or without the victim \u2019s authorisation . The relevant passages contained remarks critical of prison officers but were not , in her opinion , such as to fall within the scope of the above rules .", "CARDINAL . The complaint was considered in camera in the absence of the applicant and her counsel . After hearing the prosecution and studying a report by the investigating judge , ORG rejected her complaint on DATE .", "The crossing out of part of a letter was in its opinion a less severe measure than stopping the letter . It was therefore within the investigating judge \u2019s powers under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and did not infringe PERSON rights . It had moreover been justified , because the passages in question , described in the report as \" jokes of an insulting nature against prison officers \" , had constituted defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) of officials in the exercise of their duty ( LAW in conjunction with LAW ) , an offence capable of justifying a censorship measure under LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . After the Commission had communicated the application to ORG , the Attorney - ORG ( PERSON ) brought a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) before ORG . CARDINAL grounds of appeal were submitted .", "It was argued , firstly , that the rendering illegible ( GPE ) of certain passages and ORG decision thereon were not covered by LAW . Under that provision all letters from a person detained on remand to a private individual had to be stopped if they gave rise to the suspicion of a criminal offence subject to public prosecution ex officio ( PERSON wegen ) . This was not the case with the passages in question . If they were to be regarded as an offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) or CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , in principle only the victim could act , and public prosecution ( with the victim \u2019s authorisation and that of his superior authority ) under LAW was possible only if the insults were made \" person to person \" and not if they were in a letter .", "Secondly , LAW ) authorised only the stopping of letters , not the deletion of specific passages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a public hearing , ORG dismissed the first ground of appeal but upheld the second .", "( a ) On the assumption that the passages in issue contained \" jokes of an insulting nature against prison officers \" , the court considered that there were grounds for suspecting the applicant of insulting behaviour ( Beleidigung - Article CARDINAL of LAW ) rather than defamation ( LAW . Such an offence , if committed against an official in the exercise of his duty , required public prosecution with the victim \u2019s authorisation ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the present case , the offence resulted from the handing over by PERSON of an unsealed letter to a prison officer for the purpose of transmitting it to the investigating judge . It had thus been possible for the letter \u2019s content to become known to several prison or court officers in the exercise of their duty . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW being applicable , the measure in question was covered by LAW .", "( b ) The investigating judge and ORG had , however , misapplied this provision , which authorised the stopping of letters but not the deletion of passages from them . The investigating judge had in fact not taken a \" less severe measure \" under an implied power , but a different measure which interfered with the interests of the prosecution authorities and the prison officers concerned , as they had the possibility of bringing criminal proceedings against PERSON on account of her remarks in the letter . The law had been violated in this latter respect , but PERSON had not been injured thereby and could therefore not complain of the dismissal of her complaint by ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW :", "\" A person shall be disqualified from participating or deciding in the trial proceedings if he has acted as investigating judge in the same case ... \"", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW govern the disqualification ( PERSON ) of judges :", "\" A judge is obliged to bring circumstances which disqualify him to the immediate attention of the president of the court of which he is a member ... \"", "\" From the moment when grounds for his disqualification come to his knowledge , every judicial officer ( ORG ) shall refrain from all judicial acts , on pain of nullity of such acts . The judicial officer concerned may carry out judicial acts which are urgent , but only where there is danger in delay and if another judge or registrar can not be appointed immediately ... \"", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , under LAW the parties to the proceedings may challenge ( ablehnen ) a judge if they can show that there are reasons for doubting his complete impartiality . Although LAW refers expressly to grounds other than disqualification , it is the practice of the courts to apply LAW also in cases where a party raises an issue relating to a judge \u2019s disqualification . In fact , the disqualification of a first - instance judge can not subsequently be pleaded in nullity proceedings unless he was challenged before or at the trial or immediately after the ground for disqualification became known to the party ( LAW , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ) . The procedure applicable in this respect is the following :", "\" An application by a party to challenge a judge shall be submitted to the court of which the person challenged is a member or declared orally before the registrar , at any time but not later than TIME before the start of the hearing in the case of a challenge to a member of the trial court , and not later than three days after service of the summons to appear at the hearing in the case of a challenge to the whole court . In the application the grounds of challenge must be stated precisely and , as far as possible , supported by evidence . \"", "CARDINAL . The control of correspondence of remand prisoners is governed by LAW , which provides :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Remand prisoners may ... correspond in writing with all persons , provided that there is no danger that such persons may interfere with the purpose of the detention ...", "( CARDINAL ) ... Letters from detainees which give rise to the suspicion that an offence , not being an offence which can be prosecuted only at the request of a person concerned , is being committed by means of them , are always to be stopped , unless they are addressed to a national general representative body , a national court or other national authority , or to ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) ... \"", "Decisions concerning the persons with whom the detainee may correspond and the surveillance of correspondence are the responsibility of the investigating judge . A complaint against such a decision lies with ORG ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of LAW ) , public prosecution offences ( PERSON ) may justify the stopping of a letter , whereas private prosecution offences ( Privatanklagedelikte ) may not . In addition , it follows from ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that such measures may also be justified in the case of offences qualifying for public prosecution with the authorisation of the injured party ( Erm\u00e4chtigungsdelikte ) , for instance offences committed against officials in the exercise of their duty . In this latter respect LAW provides :", "\" Where an offence against honour is committed against an official ... during the exercise of his duties ... , the public prosecutor shall , with the authorisation of the injured party and his superior authority , institute proceedings within the time - limit which would otherwise be available to the injured party for the lodging of a request for prosecution . The same shall apply where such an offence against [ an official ] in connection with one of his professional activities is committed in a printed publication , in a broadcast , or in some other manner whereby it becomes accessible to the general public . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
