THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Afghanistan)", "JUDGES": "Branko Lubarda;George Nicolaou;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They have been residing in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant entered the GPE and applied for asylum on DATE , submitting the following account to the immigration authorities . He stated that he was a single NORP national of NORP origin , that he had never joined a political party , and that he had worked from DATE for the NORP security service ORG Dowlati / PERSON Dowlati ( \u201c ORG / WAD \u201d ) of the former communist regime in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he had reported for compulsory military service . In response to his request to be posted close to home , he had been assigned to the ORG in GPE . After his basic training , which had lasted DATE , he had started to work for Department CARDINAL of the ORG in GPE , which DATE under President ORG \u2019s national reconciliation policy sought to establish peaceful relations with the mujahideen and their reintegration into NORP national institutions \u2013 did not combat the mujahideen opposition but sought to try to negotiate with and persuade mujahideen groups to conclude peace agreements . These agreements entailed remunerated cooperation with the ruling communist ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and as a conscript , he had performed guard duties and certain administrative tasks , such as making propaganda posters for the ORG \u2019s national reconciliation policy , taking TIME of meetings , copying information from reports into books to be held in the central archives , and collecting and recording neighbourhood reports .", "CARDINAL . After having worked for DATE for the ORG as a conscript , he had agreed to become a professional soldier . He had been appointed to the rank of Second Lieutenant ( \u201c Doham Bridman \u201d ) . His activities had consisted mainly of administrative duties relating to the processing of information gathered by more senior officers about mujahideen commanders . He had worked for the ORG until DATE , when he left work after the communist ORG regime was overthrown by the mujahedin . Shortly after they had seized power , the mujahideen proclaimed an amnesty for persons who had worked for the ORG . He had returned to work , had been given other tasks and had worked for the mujahideen until DATE , when the ORG seized power in GPE . Until that moment , GPE had been governed by a commander who , like the applicant , was of NORP origin . DATE after the arrival of the ORG in GPE in DATE and fearing for his life , the first applicant had fled to GPE from where he had travelled by air to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the asylum claim then made by the first applicant , holding that he had failed to establish personal circumstances warranting a decision to grant him asylum . The mere fact that he belonged to the NORP ethnic minority did not suffice in that respect . Although the Deputy Minister acknowledged that it was not unlikely that former ORG staff members might experience problems from the new Government in GPE , she found this not to be the case as regards the first applicant , as he had continued working for the NORP authorities during the rule of the mujahideen from DATE to DATE without experiencing any problems . The Deputy Minister further considered it unlikely that the ORG were or would become aware of the first applicant \u2019s past professional activities for the former communist regime .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister of ORG did , however , grant the first applicant a conditional residence permit ( voorwaardelijke vergunning tot verblijf ) , valid for DATE from DATE , on the basis of the unabated bad situation ( \u201c onverminderd slechte situatie \u201d ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant submitted an objection ( bezwaar ) to the Deputy Minister against the decision to reject his asylum request . On DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the objection . Although the first applicant could have appealed to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , he did not do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant made a second asylum claim , which pursuant to article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) had to be based on newly emerged facts and/or altered circumstances ( \u201c nova \u201d ) warranting a reconsideration of the initial refusal . The new elements on which the first applicant based his fresh asylum request were his relationship with a woman in DATE in GPE out of which a child might have been born , his past work for the LAW , and various documents , including a copy of a judgment handed down in DATE in which a ORG in GPE - in proceedings held in absentia \u2013 had convicted the first applicant and CARDINAL others of conspiracy against the ORG and sentenced them to death . For identification purposes , photographs of the convicts , including the first applicant , were appended to this judgment . The first applicant had only learned about the existence of this judgment on DATE , thus after his flight from GPE , when his mother had sent him the judgment by mail from GPE , where she had gone for medical reasons . The first applicant did not know how or when his mother had obtained the judgment , but he assumed that it had been put up around his neighbourhood at some point in time , as local custom prescribed . The first applicant had also been informed , in a letter from his mother , that his brother had been captured and tortured in order to locate him . The first applicant further submitted on DATE a detailed written account of his activities for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE , the situation in GPE not having sufficiently improved , the first applicant \u2019s conditional residence permit was ex lege converted into an indefinite residence permit after he had held it for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In her decision of DATE , after the first applicant had been interviewed again by the immigration authorities during which he stated inter alia that he had held the rank of First Lieutenant in the ORG , the Deputy Minister rejected the first applicant \u2019s second asylum claim and , considering that there were serious reasons for believing that the first applicant was guilty of acts referred to in LAW DATE LAW ) , applied this asylum exclusion clause .", "CARDINAL . Referring to an official report , drawn up on DATE by ORG on \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ) and concerning in particular the question whether , and if so which , former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations ( see ORG v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , the Deputy Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the ORG , its lawless methods , the grave crimes it had committed such as torture , murder , arbitrary executions and other human rights violations , and the climate of terror which it had spread throughout the whole of NORP society , including the army .", "CARDINAL . Having established , on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international documents , that those involved in the ORG / WAD were likely to fall within the scope of LAW , the Deputy Minister proceeded to an analysis of the first applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under that Convention . She noted that the ORG was considered to be an elite unit of the communist regime , and that only those whose loyalty was beyond doubt were eligible for recruitment to the service . Furthermore , newly recruited officers were initially placed in departments of the ORG specifically responsible for investigating \u201c elements of ORG security \u201d , where DATE in order to prove their loyalty unequivocally DATE they were directly involved in the human rights violations . In the light of the above , and noting that ORG \u2019s Directorate CARDINAL , for which the first applicant had worked in GPE , had CARDINAL interrogation centres in GPE , the first applicant \u2019s plea that he had never been involved in any human rights violations and had worked his whole career for CARDINAL department only was dismissed . The Deputy Minister dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim that he had only performed tasks of an administrative nature . The Deputy Minister found , on the basis of the first applicant \u2019s statements , that he had actually been involved in activities of an operational nature : persuading enemies of the regime to cooperate by accompanying his superiors on field missions and taking TIME of meetings that had taken place between the ORG and those enemies , namely the mujahideen . The Deputy Minister did not attach credence to the first applicant \u2019s claim that he had been ignorant of the human rights violations committed by the ORG / WAD . In this regard it was held that the first applicant had worked directly for the commanders in chief of his ORG and had accompanied them on field missions . It was therefore highly implausible that he would have had no knowledge whatsoever of the human rights violations for which the ORG was responsible . The Deputy Minister held that it should be concluded from the first applicant \u2019s functions and work effected for the ORG / WAD that he had been specifically implicated in the human rights violations committed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister underlined that the application of LAW did not require proof of personal commission by the first applicant of the alleged crimes ; it sufficed that serious reasons existed to consider that the first applicant had , or should have had , knowledge of those crimes and that he bore responsibility for them , which responsibility he had voluntarily assumed . Accordingly , LAW was held against the first applicant , and as a consequence his application for a residence permit for asylum purposes was denied .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister also revoked the first applicant \u2019s residence permit , which he had obtained by the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . It was held in this regard that the first applicant had not given a correct and full insight into his past activities , which , had he done so , would have stood in the way of issuing him the residence permit he had been granted .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Deputy Minister further requested ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) , by letter of DATE , to examine the possibilities of prosecuting the first applicant in the GPE for the crimes imputed to him on the basis of LAW . The Deputy Minister sent another letter to the same effect on DATE . No further information about the follow - up to these letters has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant submitted an objection ( bezwaar ) to this decision . On DATE , the first applicant was heard on his objection before an official board of enquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) . On DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) rejected the objection . The Minister upheld the Deputy Minister \u2019s previous decision and proceeded , in addition thereto , to an analysis of the first applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under LAW on the basis of the prescribed and so - called \u201c knowing and personal participation test \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u201c knowing \u201d element , the Minister found , relying on the aforementioned official report of ORG , that the first applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the ORG / WAD . Basing himself on LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) , the Minister held that , according to a letter of the Deputy Minister of Justice of DATE , knowing participation was in principle to be assumed in cases of persons who had worked for certain categories of organisations , to which the ORG belonged . Having regard to the official report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and other international materials , the Minister considered that the systematic and large - scale commission of human rights violations by ORG under the ORG \u2019s rule was a fact of common knowledge and that therefore the first applicant could not have been ignorant of those acts . The first applicant \u2019s argument that , given his low rank , he had had no knowledge of and could not be held responsible for human rights violations attributed to the NORP / WAD , was thus not accepted by the Minister , who emphasised that the first applicant had declared that everyone had feared the regime and that he had successfully found an administrative post during his mandatory military service . The Minister found that , by admitting to the ubiquitous fear of the regime , the first applicant had admitted to having known of atrocities committed by that regime . As regards the first applicant \u2019s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to ORG , the Minister found that he had failed to establish that he had not committed the alleged crimes himself or that his conduct , by act or omission , had prevented those crimes from being committed . The Minister held , therefore , that the first applicant had personally participated in the crimes imputed to him .", "CARDINAL . Although the Minister considered that it could not be ruled out that the first applicant would run a risk of treatment contrary to LAW if he were expelled to GPE , it was nevertheless held that he was under an obligation to leave the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister lastly found that the first applicant was not eligible for a residence permit under the DATE policy ( this was a policy entitling asylum - seekers to a residence permit if their asylum requests had not been finally determined within DATE , provided that there were no contraindications such as , for instance , a criminal record ) as LAW had been held against him , which constituted a contraindication .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s objection to the refusal to grant a residence permit under the DATE policy was rejected by the Minister on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the second applicant had joined the first applicant in the GPE . She was granted a residence permit for the purpose of residing with her husband on DATE , thus at a time when the first applicant still held his provisional residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG also revoked the second applicant \u2019s residence permit , as it was linked to the first applicant \u2019s residence permit , which had been revoked . The second applicant submitted an objection to this decision . The Minister of ORG rejected the second applicant \u2019s objection on DATE . Meanwhile , on DATE , the second applicant had given birth to the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . Both the first and second applicants appealed to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE against the decisions taken against them , namely , as regards the first applicant , the Minister \u2019s decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and , as regards the second applicant , the Minister \u2019s separate decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG joined both applicants\u2019 appeals and , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , agreed with the Minister \u2019s decision and underlying reasoning to hold LAW against the first applicant and the consequential decisions to revoke the residence permits held by the first and second applicants . However , as regards LAW and with reference to case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG , it held that the Minister should , wherever possible , avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker was refused a residence permit but could not be expelled to his or her country of origin for reasons based on LAW . For that reason , the decision should demonstrate that the Minister had examined whether LAW would lastingly ( duurzaam ) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned . This , ORG found , the Minister had failed to do in the present case , for which reason it quashed all decisions appealed against as regards both the first and second applicants , and remitted the case to the Minister in order for her to take a fresh decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with the court \u2019s judgment and after the first applicant , in view of the changed situation in GPE , had been heard once more before an official board of enquiry on DATE , the Minister took a fresh decision on the objections submitted by the first and second applicants . She maintained her decisions that LAW should be held against the first applicant and that both applicants were accordingly ineligible for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the Minister noted that , according to an official report on GPE issued by ORG in DATE , certain categories of former officials \u2013 who were identified with human rights abuses committed during the communist regime , including ORG officials DATE continued to be at risk in GPE , not only from current power holders but more so from the population ( families of victims ) and the mujahideen , unless they enjoyed protection by virtue of good contacts with influential NORP and political parties and/or tribes . To determine the level of risk , the official report enumerated a set of factors which would need to be balanced in each individual case : the extent to which the person in question was likely to be identified with NORP ideology , his or her rank in the former regime , and the existence of any ties which family members might have with the former communist regime . The Minister noted that mere membership of the PDPA did not suffice to establish a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Minister went on to hold that the first applicant had not attracted the particular attention of any groups or individuals in the period prior to the coming to power of the ORG . The Minister underlined in this regard that , after the fall of the ORG regime , the first applicant had easily obtained a job in the local police headquarters for the mujahideen governor of GPE , PERSON , who was currently the Minister for Energy in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s fear of the ORG , the Minister held that the general situation in GPE had improved since DATE and that any ORG insurgents were concentrated mostly in areas outside GPE . As to the first applicant \u2019s fear of execution of the death sentence pronounced against him by the ORG , the Minister held , basing herself on the most recent official report of ORG , that the population register , which had already been inaccurate , had not improved during ORG rule due to illiteracy or a lack of interest in maintaining it . Furthermore , many courts of law had been destroyed during armed conflict . It was , therefore , not likely that the present authorities would be aware of the judgment against the first applicant . Moreover , judgments delivered under the ORG rule were not executed without prior verification by a court of law of their compliance with current NORP law . In this light the Minister did not attach much credence to the first applicant \u2019s submissions that his mother had not been allowed to collect her possessions in GPE due to her son \u2019s conviction by the ORG court . In addition , the Minister considered that it was unlikely that the first applicant would again be sentenced to death by GPE \u2019s present courts , in view of the fact that the conviction had been based on an alleged conspiracy against the ORG . The first applicant \u2019s submission that his being branded an infidel in the judgment could still have value before DATE \u2019s NORP courts was dismissed by the Minister , who found that , under the ORG regime , the mere denunciation of the ORG government in itself already constituted infidel status .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister further noted , basing herself on a person - specific official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) issued by ORG on the first applicant on DATE , that in DATE he had obtained an NORP passport through GPE \u2019s diplomatic representation in GPE . Since GPE had not recognised the ORG as GPE \u2019s lawful government , the NORP embassy in GPE still represented the Government of President PERSON , who had been president from DATE , thus until the capitulation of GPE to the ORG . The Minister took note of the fact that Mr PERSON \u2019s political party , the Jamiat - e - Islami , was currently well represented in the present ORG . As the first applicant had successfully applied for a passport from an embassy represented by that party , the Minister held that he could not have come to PERSON negative attention . Moreover , the passport had been issued DATE after the death sentence had been handed down . In addition , as it did not appear that the first applicant had converted to another religion or had in other ways offended ORG , the Minister did not find it likely that he would be deemed an infidel again in DATE \u2019s GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s identification in DATE GPE with NORP ideology , the Minister \u2019s finding that this did not pose him any problems during the mujahideen rule over the country led to the conclusion that he was unlikely to encounter such problems in the future . Furthermore , the first applicant had not made any mention , in the course of the interviews held with him , of any ties that members of his family may have had to the communist regime , nor of any problems he expected to encounter upon return as a result of any such ties .", "CARDINAL . The Minister therefore concluded that the first applicant had not demonstrated that he would be exposed to a real of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The appeal by the first and second applicants was rejected on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . It concurred with the Minister on all points . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the first and second applicants\u2019 separation and divorce , the second and third applicants submitted a fresh asylum request , which was granted on DATE , based on the position that the second applicant , as a single woman , and her child would find themselves in on returning to GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
