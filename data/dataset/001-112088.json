De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She is a journalist working for the newspaper DV . In DATE , a Mr A contacted the applicant about a story which he asked to be published by DV . According to Mr A \u2019s account Mr B , a person known for being violent and whose acts of violence had recently been commented on in the press , had attacked him at his strip club , called Strawberries . He had allegedly done so on the order of the owner of a rival strip club . The applicant responded that she would look into the story and would contact Mr B in order to hear his account and also the owner of the rival strip club . Being dissatisfied with the applicant \u2019s reply , Mr A insisted that his version of events be published . The applicant refused to do so and decided to carry out research in relation to Mr A \u2019s account . She interviewed him and recorded the interview on tape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE DV published a news report by the applicant entitled \u201c Strip Kings Battle \u201d , on the subject of Mr A \u2019s accusations against Mr B with regard to the alleged assault at the NORP strip club . The article referred to interviews with PERSON A , PERSON and Mr Y.", "CARDINAL . Mr A was reported to have stated that on TIME DATE , Mr B had been among the patrons of LAW accompanied by CARDINAL other men . He left the club in the course of the night , but returned just before closing time , when he allegedly attacked the employees of the restaurant . Following this Mr A had tried to show him out . Suddenly Mr B attacked Mr A and struck him with his fist , as a result of which he sustained a cracked skull and severe injuries to his eye . Mr A reported the incident to the police .", "CARDINAL . Mr B. , whose interview with the applicant was published in the same news coverage , was reported to have denied all the accusations made by Mr A. According to Mr B , he and his CARDINAL friends had been out partying and had decided to visit the NORP club . They had only been there for a short while when PERSON A insisted that they leave . As they refused , the doormen forcibly removed PERSON In the commotion both he and PERSON A had been injured .", "CARDINAL . Mr A instituted defamation proceedings against the applicant before ORG , arguing that the following statement made by Mr B amounted to unlawful defamation in breach of LAW , CARDINAL and/or CARDINAL of LAW and requested that it be declared null and void ( dau\u00f0 og \u00f3merk ) under LAW :", "\u201c He [ the plaintiff ] has been spreading all around town the rumour that no one with an attitude would come to Strawberries , because he has the NORP mafia in there , and that I was just taken and beaten up in there . I do n\u2019t really get this . He really needs to make up his mind whether he thinks I was beaten up or he was . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He also submitted that the following sub - heading amounted to unlawful defamation and should be declared null and void :", "\u201c Rumour about the mafia \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr A in addition sought CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ORG ) ( corresponding MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) plus interest in compensation for damages , an order under LAW ) to pay him ISK QUANTITY to cover the costs of publication in the press of the court \u2019s reasons and conclusion in the defamation case , plus legal costs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her pleadings before ORG , the applicant prayed in aid the freedom of expression guaranteed under LAW and LAW as well as the ORG \u2019s caselaw . She further relied on LAW no . MONEY , according to which the author of a statement was responsible for the publication of its content . The article had indicated the identity of the author of the disputed statements and the transcripts of the interview had shown that they had been quoted from their named author , PERSON Accordingly the applicant could not be regarded as the author of the allegations . In so far as the sub - heading was concerned , she pointed out that this had only paraphrased PERSON remarks .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further disputed that item CARDINAL was defamatory . The first part of that remark had consisted of Mr B \u2019s account that the plaintiff had himself spread the rumour that no one came to the FAC club with an attitude , because the NORP mafia was present there . PERSON remark did not amount to an allegation that the NORP mafia was present at FAC , but that PERSON A wanted the rumour to be spread . In fact , it was clear from the interview that those interviewed by the applicant thought that no NORP went to the club but that this was a false rumour that the plaintiff wanted to have spread around town . When considering the remark in its true context , it was clear that in no way did it contain Mr B \u2019s claim that the plaintiff was involved in criminal conduct . Whatever could be said about mafia operations , the remark contained no allegation regarding the plaintiff \u2019s activities that could be singled out as mafia related , i.e. criminal conduct . The main point was whether the plaintiff had been accused of such conduct . This had clearly not been the case . Accordingly , there was no basis for considering that the remarks were covered by the provisions in LAW on protection of reputation . Moreover , the word \u201c mafia \u201d had no defined meaning in the NORP language .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second part of the remark , Mr B had stated that PERSON A was spreading the rumour that Mr B had been taken and beaten up inside Strawberries . As could be gathered from the interview and the remark itself , it was nowhere stated that the plaintiff had beaten up Mr B or anyone else . However , the interview and the above - mentioned remark stated that the plaintiff had mentioned in many places the story that Mr B had been beaten up inside the club . That statement was true , as Mr B had been in a fight inside the club and the plaintiff had taken the initiative to contact DV and had provided information regarding that incident .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant stressed that the whole dispute had originated in Mr A \u2019s own initiative to have the story published . It would have been reasonable for him to expect that the journalist would seek to provide information about both versions of the events and that the person against whom he had levelled serious accusations would have a different version .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG found for the plaintiff Mr A and against the applicant , giving the following reasons .", "\u201c The defendant bases her claim for acquittal mainly on lack of involvement , as the remarks have been quoted word for word from their named author , [ Mr B ] .", "The defendant admitted in court to have written the said article and stated that she believed she had been the author of the disputed sub - heading .", "According to an audio recording of the [ applicant \u2019s ] interview with [ Mr B ] , the disputed statement made by [ Mr B ] went as follows : \u2018 He has been spreading rumours all around town about it . That no - one really enters Strawberries with an attitude you see . \u2018 Cause he has the NORP mafia and I was just taken and beaten up in there , you know.\u2019 A slight change in wording has been made in the [ applicant \u2019s ] article , not affecting the contents and only involving removing the emphasising words you see and you know . The remark was published within MONEY in the paper .", "Having regard to ORG judgment in case No . CARDINAL , the [ applicant ] is found to be the article \u2019s and sub - heading \u2019s author for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW No . GPE , regardless of whether Mr B can also be found to be the author of the remarks quoted verbatim after him , and the [ applicant ] is responsible for remarks presented there , as well as sub - headings .", "It is clear that the interview with the plaintiff , [ Mr A ] , whether he initiated it or not , had been taken with his consent and wishes , even though he was dissatisfied with the article when it was published in the paper , where also the opinions expressed by other persons in interviews conducted by the [ applicant ] had been published . In her interview with the plaintiff he had accused [ Mr B ] of various matters . It ought to have been clear to him that his remarks would be shown to the person concerned and that this person would be given an opportunity to state his version of events . The words that the article \u2019s author had quoted directly from [ Mr B ] , which had been the cause for the plaintiff \u2019s action , are intended to give the article \u2019s readers the impression that the plaintiff is in charge of an organised , international criminal organisation . The journalist has not demonstrated or sought to ascertain that the allegation , which rendered [ Mr B ] \u2019s words , is true . The allegation contained a defamatory innuendo , see Article CARDINAL of LAW , and should , in accordance with the plaintiff \u2019s claim , be declared null and void , as should the sub - heading \u2018 Rumour about the mafia\u2019 , which referred to the remark .", "By virtue of the statements declared null and void the [ applicant ] has unlawfully injured the plaintiff \u2019s honour . She is therefore obliged to pay him damages in accordance with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW No . CARDINAL . In the present case the amount of ORG CARDINAL [ approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL at the time ] is deemed a reasonable level of compensation . ...", "With reference to LAW No . CARDINAL the plaintiff \u2019s request that the [ applicant ] be punished for the statements is rejected .", "The plaintiff is found to be entitled to the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the publication of the motives and conclusions of the judgment , as he requested under LAW . The plaintiff has not presented any particulars in support of his claim as to the size of the amount requested nor supported it with any arguments . This item will therefore be determined on the basis of the court \u2019s own assessment and the amount of ORG CARDINAL is considered reasonable .", "In light of the foregoing , the [ applicant ] is required to pay the plaintiff \u2019s legal costs , which it is considered reasonable to assess at ORG CARDINAL ( inclusive of GPE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought to appeal to ORG but on DATE the latter refused her leave to appeal . This was on the ground that the financial value of what was at stake in the appeal ( legal costs not being relevant ) did not reach the statutory minimum level for grant of leave to appeal and that there were no special circumstances warranting an exception being made to this requirement in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL .
