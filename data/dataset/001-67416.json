SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Ms I. GPE , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for asylum on DATE .", "An initial interview with the applicant was conducted by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on DATE . At that interview the applicant stated , inter alia , that he had travelled to GPE with a false passport which he had obtained through a friend of his father 's who worked at the NORP passport authority . As agreed with that person , he had sent back the false passport after having entered GPE . His own genuine passport remained in GPE with his parents . Asked about his professional background , the applicant responded that he was an architect by profession and had been employed by the state for DATE at \u201c ORG for the educational sector in the district of LOC . However , he had stopped working in DATE . The applicant stated that disturbances had erupted in LOC at DATE . He had openly participated in the protests against the presence of ( sub - Saharan ) NORP in the country , mainly by distributing leaflets . In DATE he had been arrested by the security office in GPE and accused of participating in the uprising against the NORP . On this occasion he had been questioned and held in detention for DATE . Following the interview , the record of it was read out to the applicant who declared that it was correct and that he had understood the interpreter well .", "A second interview was held by ORG on DATE . On this occasion the applicant was heard , inter alia , about the contents of CARDINAL documents which he had received from GPE after his arrival in GPE and submitted to ORG on DATE : ( CARDINAL ) a birth certificate , ( CARDINAL ) an international driver 's licence issued in GPE on CARDINAL DATE after he had left for GPE , and ( CARDINAL ) a document showing that he had completed his national military service . Asked about his passport , the applicant stated that it was impossible for him to obtain it as it was held by the security service which had taken it at DATE \u201c for reasons identical to his grounds for seeking asylum \u201d .", "Describing his activities during the disturbances in his hometown , the applicant stated that he had participated by writing and distributing leaflets , encouraging people to force the Government to resign . In the leaflets , he had mentioned that , since coming to power in DATE , PERSON had treated the applicant 's clan harshly . The clan had been politically influential before DATE . The uprising had lasted for DATE in DATE and most of those living in PERSON had taken part . The security services had been sent to PERSON to deal with the problem . They had first targeted the applicant 's clan . They had had no information regarding the names of the persons who had participated but had acted arbitrarily and arrested a large number of young men . In DATE the applicant had been arrested by the security service at his work place and held in detention for DATE awaiting a hearing concerning his detention . On DATE the persons in charge of his interrogation had released him pending further questioning . Upon his release , the applicant had gone to PERSON , a small town west of LOC , where he had stayed in hiding with a friend for DATE before leaving for GPE . Throughout this period he had been searched for by the security service .", "Asked about what would happen to him if returned to GPE , the applicant first stated that it was difficult to say exactly but that he would consider himself fortunate if he were given life imprisonment . Slightly later during the interview , however , he stated that the media had reported that death sentences had been handed down against the leaders of the revolt and that his own name had been among those that had been mentioned . He also asserted that a friend in GPE had informed him that he had been sentenced to death in absentia . According to the applicant , this type of judgment was not issued by a court but by a kind of popular conference entitled LOC . No appeal lay against it . The applicant further stated that it was possible that news about his sentence could have been published in either of CARDINAL named government - controlled NORP newspapers .", "The applicant declared that he had understood the interpreter well . The record of the second interview further stated that it had been read out to the applicant who had approved it .", "In written observations submitted to ORG on DATE , the applicant 's counsel , who had not been present at the interviews , stated that the record of the second interview had not been read out to the applicant or approved by him . Counsel further mentioned that , while in hiding in PERSON , the applicant had been unable to communicate with his parents by telephone . Instead , the friend who had been hiding him had visited the parents a couple of times and had then received information and the applicant 's allegedly false passport .", "ORG noted that in DATE the NORP ORG in GPE had received an application for an entry visa in the applicant 's name , which contained a copy of a passport in the same name . The application had been rejected .", "On DATE , in reply to this information , the applicant 's counsel noted that the copy of the passport was a copy of the same , allegedly false , passport the applicant had used to enter GPE . The name , address and place of birth were correct in the application . The applicant had not made the visa application himself and therefore assumed that it must have been made by the head of the passport authority , who was the person who had issued the false passport and had made the arrangements for the applicant 's journey to GPE . The applicant was now in a position to name this person , as he had , for unknown reasons , left his position at the passport authority . Counsel further stated that the applicant 's brother had sought to obtain a copy of the newspaper in which the applicant 's death sentence had been reported but the brother 's motives had been questioned and he had failed to obtained the copy due to fear .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request for asylum and ordered that he should be expelled from GPE . It considered it remarkable that the applicant had been able to leave detention unconditionally , without for example any obligation to report or to put up bail . Moreover , it found that the fact that the applicant had remained in the country for DATE after his release indicated that he did not perceive his need for protection as pressing . It also found it remarkable that he had been able to leave the country with a passport that he had acknowledged contained correct personal data , especially since he alleged that the NORP authorities were searching for him . Against this background , ORG found that the applicant 's involvement in the riots as well as the possible consequences thereof were exaggerated .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE he submitted what he stated was a copy of a document which his brother had been able to obtain \u201c via an acquaintance with contacts in the congress \u201d . The document had been sent to an acquaintance in GPE who , in turn , had sent it to the applicant by fax . Issued by ORG in PERSON on DATE , it called for the search and arrest by the security service of CARDINAL named persons , including the applicant . It stated that a decision had been taken that the QUANTITY persons should be executed on account of acts committed against the security of the state . While the applicant did not at this stage specifically claim that this document was a \u201c judgment \u201d issued by ORG , he asserted that it unambiguously demonstrated that he had been sentenced to death in GPE and was being sought for execution of the judgment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It noted that there had been violent riots in DATE resulting in the death of many of its participants . Most of the people accused of involvement in the riots had been sentenced to death . It considered that the applicant had not shown that he would risk the death penalty upon return to GPE . If he had been of interest to the NORP authorities he would not have been able to leave the country the way he claimed . Even having regard to the alleged copy of the judgment , ORG found reasons to question that he was of any particular interest to NORP authorities . He had , thus , not shown that he was in need of protection .", "In DATE the applicant filed a new application for a residence permit with ORG , arguing that the previous decisions had been based on misunderstandings , misinterpretations and mistrust . He provided further details regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest and subsequent escape from GPE . He thus stated , inter alia , that he had been one in a group of CARDINAL persons who had cooperated in writing and distributing leaflets in order to demonstrate their discontent with the regime . However , the security services had begun a campaign of arrests , torture and detentions without trial . CARDINAL in their group had been arrested and , before being executed , had been forced under torture to reveal the identity of the others . When learning of the arrest the other members of the group had tried to hide or escape , but the applicant and CARDINAL others had been arrested . He had been held in detention for DATE at a local police station but had eventually been able to bribe a police officer to let him escape . He had paid the officer the equivalent of MONEY and had handed over his genuine passport . He had thereafter hid in another town for DATE . By bribing the head of the passport authority his family had been able to obtain a false passport for him . This passport was in fact a \u201c real \u201d and new passport but it was not \u201c registered with the passport authority \u201d and did not contain a bar code used for computer control or his \u201c real name \u201d . The passport also erroneously stated that he was married . The same person had arranged all other details regarding his journey , including his application for a visa and his ticket .", "The applicant further stated that during the time when he was in hiding in GPE the authorities had sent summonses for his appearance to his home , to the office where he worked and to the engineers ' labour union of which he was a member . When this had not succeeded the authorities had tried to put pressure on his family . His father had been arrested and detained for DATE , like his brothers who had been tortured to disclose his whereabouts . To avoid exposing his relatives to further torture , he had decided to escape abroad . However , after his arrival in GPE his youngest brother had been imprisoned and had informed the authorities that the applicant was living in GPE . The applicant also stated that he had stayed in GPE for DATE before leaving as the journey had required careful preparation . After a period of time in GPE the applicant had learned that he and CARDINAL others in his group had been sentenced to death and that orders had been issued to all police units to arrest and execute them . Several attempts had been made to obtain this judgment . His brothers had finally managed to get in touch with \u201c someone who has the key to the cupboard where the judgments are kept \u201d . By bribing this person with QUANTITY they had managed to obtain a copy of the judgment . The applicant claimed that CARDINAL of the persons in his group had been granted asylum in GPE and in GPE .", "In support of his new application the applicant submitted what he claimed were copies of CARDINAL summonses for him to appear for questioning issued by the NORP authorities in DATE and DATE and DATE , respectively .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application stating that it contained no new circumstances which would give reasons to change its previous assessment . The new documents , which were copies , were not of such a character as to influence the assessment of the applicant 's need for protection .", "The immigration authorities have contacted ORG in GPE in order to obtain travel documents for the purpose of enforcing the expulsion order against the applicant .", "By a decision of DATE , following the ORG 's indication under LAW , ORG stayed the enforcement of the applicant 's expulsion until further notice .", "On DATE the applicant submitted to the ORG copies of documents purportedly issued by NORP authorities . CARDINAL document , dated DATE , is a communication from \u201c the Secretary to ORG of the ORG \u201d in old PERSON to \u201c the Secretary to ORG for ORG and General Security \u201d , in which the latter is requested to agree to the notification of all airports , seaports and border - controls to prevent CARDINAL named individuals , among them the applicant and a Mr PERSON , from leaving GPE . Another document , dated DATE , is a communication from the first - mentioned official to \u201c the Secretary to ORG \u201d , informing the recipient that CARDINAL individuals mentioned in the first document , including the applicant but not Mr ORG , had fled the country and calling for their capture and return to GPE by the external security organs . A third document records a decision of CARDINAL DATE to detain the applicant 's younger brother for failure to disclose the applicant 's whereabouts . Another document contains a summons for the applicant 's father to appear on DATE for questioning in relation to the applicant 's escape from GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
