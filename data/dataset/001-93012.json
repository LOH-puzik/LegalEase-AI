The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested and placed in detention on DATE on suspicion of having stolen some mobile telephones .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , immediately after his arrest the police started to ill - treat him DATE during lunch breaks and in the evenings in order to try to force him to confess to numerous other offences which he had not committed . Although he was being detained on suspicion of stealing mobile telephones , he was interrogated by police officers from the homicide squad who tried to make him admit to having committed a murder . Since he refused to make any confession and denied the accusations , he was taken on DATE to an office in ORG , where CARDINAL police officers tortured him for TIME . His hands and legs were tied together behind his back and he was suspended on a metal bar . The police officers put a gas mask on his head and periodically closed the air tube . CARDINAL wires were placed under the gas mask and attached to his ears and he was given electric shocks . He was beaten on his head with QUANTITY plastic bottles filled with water and was hit on his ears . Periodically , the applicant lost consciousness . After reviving him the police officers continued the acts of torture . They attached wires to his hips and administered electric shocks to him and beat him . He was later taken off the metal bar and laid on the floor . A weight of QUANTITY was placed on his back and he was left lying on the ground for TIME . The applicant \u2019s hands and feet were subsequently untied ; he felt severe pain in the region of his lower back and was unable to move his feet . He was made to sit on a chair ; however , he fell down . He was put back on the chair by CARDINAL police officers , who kept telling him something , but he could not hear them . He was then taken to his cell . His cellmates put him on a bed , where he was left lying for DATE . The allegations of beatings are disputed by the Government .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the applicant could not stand up , he was visited by CARDINAL doctors on DATE . They were accompanied by CARDINAL of the police officers who had allegedly tortured him . The police officer told the doctors that the applicant had fallen from his bed . The doctors diagnosed the applicant with hysteria and recommended that he be seen by a neurologist . The applicant was then taken to another room , where he was allegedly told by a police officer not to tell anybody about the acts of torture . He was allegedly threatened with death or imprisonment for DATE . A police officer wrote a report on behalf of the applicant stating that nobody had beaten him up and that he had fallen from his bed and had caught a cold ; he allegedly forced the applicant to sign the report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father employed a lawyer , who immediately lodged a complaint with the prosecutor \u2019s office alleging illtreatment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was allegedly taken again to an office at the police station . Since he could not walk , he was lifted by QUANTITY police officers . The police officers who had tortured him were in the office along with CARDINAL other police officers . He was made to sit on a chair and was kicked and punched . The police officers allegedly requested that he withdraw the complaint about ill - treatment , and threatened him with death .", "CARDINAL . The ill - treatment was allegedly repeated on several occasions . According to the applicant , he was beaten with bottles filled with water , punched , kicked and told to confess and to withdraw the complaint about ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a forensic doctor who later wrote the following in his report ( no .

In the region of both knees and below the right patella , numerous abrasions covered by dark brown scabs , partly detached from the skin at their edges , ranging in size from QUANTITY to QUANTITY in CARDINAL place ... Conclusions : the neurologist \u2019s findings have not reached us as at DATE , nor have the X - rays of the lumbar section of the spinal column , to which examination certificate no . CARDINAL refers .... It is therefore impossible to determine the reasons why the victim is unable to move unassisted . The abrasions visible in the patellar region of the knee joints and the bruises visible on the left arm could have been caused by a blunt instrument and are not less than DATE at the time of examination .... It is impossible to establish with greater accuracy from how long ago the bruises and abrasions date because of the delay in presentation for medical examination . Hospitalisation of the victim in a specialised medical establishment would enable a more accurate diagnosis to be made and the consequences for his state of health to be assessed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following complaints by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , ORG organised action in support of the applicant by publishing on their Internet site a description of the applicant \u2019s case and an appeal to people from all over the world to write to ORG , ORG and ORG in their country asking them to take action such as conducting a medical examination of the applicant , carrying out an effective investigation into his complaints of torture and allowing the applicant to meet his lawyer in conditions of confidentiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote to the NORP Minister of ORG expressing concern about the situation of PERSON and about the refusal of the authorities to transfer him to a hospital as recommended by doctors . He requested information .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date DATE the applicant was visited by a delegation of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) , which described his case in its report ( see paragraph DATE below ) . It appears that in their reply to the ORG \u2019s report the Government did not comment on the latter \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the Prosecutor General informing him about the allegations of torture against the applicant and the fact that no medical assistance had been provided to him by that date . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that the applicant \u2019s complaint appeared to be illfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE during questioning by a prosecutor CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s cellmates stated that the applicant could not walk and that he had to be helped by his cellmates to go to the toilet . All the prison guards stated that the applicant could walk perfectly well and that they had not noted any signs of beatings on him . CARDINAL guard stated that the applicant was limping . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s cellmates stated that he was faking his condition . Another stated that the applicant could not stand or even sit and that he had to be helped by his cellmates to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was hospitalised and underwent the following medical examinations : radiography of the head and back , echoencephalography , electroencephalography , computerised tomography , ultrasound of the internal organs and functional computerised investigation . The diagnosis following the investigations was the following : consolidated fracture of the cranial bones ( skull broken , without pieces relocated ) ; a CARDINAL x QUANTITY focal cerebral contusion in the left temporal cortical area and dilatation of the ventricular system ( a contusion with augmented volume of the brain ventricular system ) ; a post - craniocerebral trauma state ; cerebral contusion of the left hemisphere ( temporal area ) ; medullar contusion FAC with flask tetraparesis , especially on the inferior limbs ( trauma of the back , CARDINALst and CARDINALnd lumbar spines , damaging the spinal cord and causing partial paralysis , especially of the legs ) .", "CARDINAL .

Did PERSON suffer from diseases of the nervous system before his arrest ?", "CARDINAL . Is it possible that the diseases from which he suffered before his arrest were aggravated during detention ?", "CARDINAL .

If so , what are the after - effects of electric shocks and how long do they last ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL forensic doctors examined the applicant \u2019s medical documents and gave the following answers :", "\u201c CARDINAL and CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s medical history does not contain anything to suggest that he suffered from any diseases of the nervous system before his arrest .", "CARDINAL . At the time of his medical examination on DATE he had bruises on his left arm and scratches on his knee , which are considered to be light injuries ...", "CARDINAL . During further medical investigations of the applicant he was found to be suffering from paralysis of the feet and left arm . The paralysis is not a consequence of a craniocerebral or spinal trauma or of the administering of electric shocks and its gravity is not assessable . \u201d", "The forensic panel added that in reaching its conclusions it had not paid attention to the earlier findings concerning the fracture of the cranial bones and the cerebral contusion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because it had not been presented with the original radiographic images . The panel also added that it could not be ruled out that the applicant was simulating his condition , and that only a psychiatric investigation could exclude that possibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning his allegations of ill - treatment . It relied on the statements of CARDINAL of his cellmates who had contended that the applicant was faking his condition , the statements of police officers who denied having illtreated the applicant , the medical report of CARDINAL DATE and the conclusion of the medical report of DATE to the effect that : \u201c the paralysis is not a consequence of a craniocerebral or spinal trauma or of the administering of electric shocks and its gravity is not assessable ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Starting on DATE the applicant underwent a medical check - up at the \u201c LOC ORG , a non - governmental organisation financed by ORG and a member of ORG of ORG ( ORG ) . He appears to have been subjected there to detailed medical tests and examinations by various medical specialists . In a document entitled \u201c Extract from the medical records \u201d , dated DATE , issued by the ORG , it was stated , inter alia , that the applicant was suffering the after - effects of cranial trauma ( cerebral contusion of the left hemisphere predominant in the temporal area ) , organic cerebral post - traumatic syndrome , post - traumatic bilateral adhesive otitis , post - traumatic cochlear neuritis , bilateral neuro - sensorial deafness , and medullar lumbar contusion FAC with flask tetraparesis of the inferior limbs . A number of psychological conditions characteristic of victims of torture were also found . The ORG also decided to help the applicant to fund surgery in order to \u201c regain his hearing at least partially \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General of GPE , PERSON , wrote a letter to ORG in which he stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c Lately , ORG has been confronted with the phenomenon whereby some NORP lawyers involve international organisations specialising in the protection of human rights in the examination by the national authorities of criminal cases . These organisations are used as an instrument for serving personal interests and for enabling suspected persons to avoid criminal responsibility .", "Examples of such incidents are the case of ORG , triggered by the lawyer PERSON , and the case of GPE , triggered by the lawyer PERSON . The international media coverage of these cases prompted action by the representatives of ORG with a view to safeguarding the rights of the above lawyers\u2019 clients .", "After having examined with sufficient thoroughness the complaints alleging torture and abuse on the part of the police ... the prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the complaints on the ground of lack of proof that offences had been committed . ...", "... In such circumstances the irresponsible attitude and behaviour of the lawyers PERSON and PERSON give rise to concern . They knew that no acts of torture had been committed against their clients . However , they complained to international organisations without first attempting to use the national mechanism for solving such problems . They presented the facts erroneously in order to win their cases ...", "Such practices by lawyers will be investigated by ORG in order to determine whether they have committed the offence provided for in LAW , by making public on an international scale false information about alleged breaches of human rights which gravely prejudice the image of our country .", "Accordingly , ORG is called upon to take account of the facts described above , to bring to the attention of lawyers the situation so created and to prevent as far as possible any prejudice to the authority of GPE . \u201d", "The above letter generated a heated debate in the media . On DATE ORG issued an official statement in which it qualified the Prosecutor General \u2019s letter as an attempt to intimidate lawyers . In an interview to the newspaper PERSON the President of ORG declared , inter alia , that it was an attempt to intimidate lawyers so that they would no longer complain to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the prosecutor \u2019s office did not inform the applicant about its decision of DATE until DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE and argued , inter alia , that the prosecutor \u2019s office had not examined the complaint properly . He argued that the prosecutor \u2019s office had not paid attention to the fact that on DATE , on DATE of his arrest , the applicant had been in good health . The prosecutor \u2019s office had also failed to question persons who had seen the applicant on DATE , when he was brought before a court , including the judge , prosecutor and persons present in the court . The prosecutor had not questioned the doctors who had examined the applicant , or asked the applicant to identify the persons who had allegedly tortured him and the offices where the alleged torture had taken place . The prosecutor had failed to investigate why police officers from the homicide division were questioning the applicant , who had been charged with stealing mobile telephones .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was dismissed by ORG on the ground that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had failed to observe the DATE time - limit for challenging the prosecutor \u2019s decision .

The applicant had a severe weakness in his limbs on the right side . The doctor concluded that the applicant was suffering from severe movement dysfunction on the right side and a less severe dysfunction of the movement of the left foot .

The relevant findings of the ORG during its visit to GPE DATE read as follows ( unofficial translation ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . At the remand centre ( ORG ) of ORG for the fight against organised crime , CARDINAL detainee interviewed by the delegation alleged that , on TIME of DATE , at the LOC police station , he had been punched and kicked in a third - floor office , in order to make him confess to various offences . On DATE , he had been transferred to ORG , from where he had , during the period for which he was held ( until DATE according to the relevant registers ) , been transferred on several occasions , sometimes to the NORP police station and sometimes to ORG ( transfers confirmed by the examination of the relevant registers ) . He alleged that he had been ill - treated on these LOC . In particular , he alleged that , on DATE , in a second - floor office at ORG , he was subjected to several forms of ill - treatment : an attempt to suffocate him by placing a gas mask over his face ; suspension in what is known as the swallow position ; slaps on his ears ; electric shocks administered via electrodes placed behind his ears and on his hips ; placement of a heavy dumbbell weight on his back . As a consequence of the ill - treatment inflicted , he had briefly lost consciousness , and , furthermore , had been unable to move for DATE .", "Furthermore , according to the detainee concerned , he had not been given a form informing him about his rights until DATE , which was when he said that he had met an officially assigned defence counsel . The first judge before whom he had been brought on DATE of his deprivation of liberty was said not to have reacted to his allegations of ill - treatment .", "On DATE he had been brought before a judge who had served a compulsory residence order on him . In spite of this decision , he had been transferred to the ORG of ORG for the fight against organised crime on that same day , on the basis of an arrest warrant issued in DATE , after undergoing a medical examination at a hospital casualty unit .
