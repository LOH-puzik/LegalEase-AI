The applicant was born in DATE . After numerous previous failed attempts , the applicant became the mother of a child , conceived as the result of an in vitro fertilisation ( ORG ) procedure with donated gametes . The procedure was performed in ORG in GPE ; and produced CARDINAL embryos , CARDINAL of which were implanted on DATE .", "The remaining CARDINAL embryos obtained on the same occasion were frozen until the applicant was considered fit by her physician to undergo another pregnancy . A protocol was concluded between the applicant and PERSON , in which the applicant acknowledged that she had been informed that in CARDINAL - CARDINAL % of cases , after thawing , the embryos proved not to be viable , and that if that were the case the embryo transfer would be impossible .", "CARDINAL . According to a document issued by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , on DATE the ORG was authorised to function as a bank for genetic material . However , the circumstances in which that document was issued are currently under the scrutiny of the domestic criminal court , in view also of the fact that it was ORG , and not the ORG , which had exclusive competence to give such authorisations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Directorate for ORG attached to ORG ( ORG ) closed the S. Medical Centre , seized all the genetic material found there and deposited it at ORG ( ORG ) . This decision was not contested before the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant wrote to ORG in her capacity as \u201c owner of the CARDINAL embryos \u201d , expressing concerns as to the state of her frozen embryos and asking to be informed of the practical procedure to be followed in order to urgently retrieve her embryos .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed by ORG that it was not aware of any technical means of identifying the embryos in question , given that an inventory was still being made of all the material seized and no document relating to the applicant \u2019s embryos had been identified .", "In any event , in order to be able to retrieve her genetic material from ORG , the applicant was advised to appoint a doctor specialising in embryology , who would then contact the ORG for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . NORP In attempts to find an embryologist the applicant addressed her request to ORG , ORG and ORG .", "In its reply , ORG gave the applicant a list of the medical institutions accredited as banks for genetic material , by virtue of ministerial Order no . CARDINAL of DATE ; the S. Medical Centre and the ORG were not mentioned in the list . ORG also informed the applicant that it could not intervene in any way in the contractual relationship between her and PERSON , assuming that such a contract existed and included specific provisions as to who could retrieve the embryos and under what circumstances . Referring to the letter of DATE from ORG , ORG suggested that the applicant should contact PERSON and , on the basis of the contract she had concluded with the clinic , ask for support in identifying and retrieving her embryos .", "ORG replied to the applicant on DATE , informing her that an embryo transfer could be performed only by a specialist in assisted reproduction , and that such transfers could not be carried out until the relevant embryos had been properly identified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant finally contacted CARDINAL doctors from ORG in GPE ( QUANTITY from GPE ) . On DATE , in accordance with the legal requirements , ORG requested the authority of the ORG to perform the retrieval , but received no answer . The request was reiterated on DATE ; on DATE the ORG informed ORG that it could not grant the requested authority , since such authority could only be given in respect of a tissue and cell bank accredited by the ORG , which the ORG was not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the ORG \u2019s refusal was not binding on ORG ; the ORG had been appointed as the legal custodian of the genetic material pending a criminal investigation . Once the investigation was terminated and ORG was indicted , the file was to be sent before the criminal courts on DATE . Consequently , an order was issued authorising the applicant to retrieve her embryos by DATE , since after that date ORG would cease to act as a deposit bank appointed by the investigating authorities . The applicant was required to be accompanied by an embryologist and to provide a special container with liquid nitrogen for the transfer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant managed to obtain from a clinic in GPE a special container with liquid nitrogen of the kind required for such transfers and asked the clinic to carry out the transfer .", "On DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the ORG had refused to consent to the transfer for the following reasons : the ORG had never been authorised by the ORG to store such materials and therefore there could be no guarantee as to the quality of the material stored there ( against contamination , deterioration , and so on ) ; moreover , the storage of such material in the ORG did not comply with the legal requirements ( Order of the Minister of Public Health no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the traceability of the genetic material .", "In view of the ORG \u2019s refusal , of the fact that ORG carried out its activities under the authority of the ORG , and in so far as it could not guarantee the quality and security of the genetic material , the clinic informed the applicant that it could not proceed with the retrieval .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote again to ORG , asking it to issue an order allowing the ORG to continue to store her embryos until the ORG had consented to their retrieval . As justification of the need for such an urgent measure , the applicant pointed out that an inability to transfer the embryos would have serious repercussions on the right to life of her embryos and on her right to have a family .", "On DATE , the applicant sent a similar letter to the ORG , asking it to re - evaluate the circumstances of her case and consequently to authorise the transfer of her embryos to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG replied on DATE , informing the applicant as follows : the ORG had been appointed as custodian in complete disregard of the legal provisions of Directive GPE and of Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; the ORG had never been accredited , nor had it been given approval by the ORG to operate as a bank for genetic material ; the S. Medical Centre had been accredited to operate as a bank of genetic material only on DATE , and not in DATE , when the embryos had been frozen and stored ; LAW , invoked by ORG , did not provide any safeguards as to the security and safety of the embryos while they were stored at S. ( for DATE ) and subsequently at the ORG ( for DATE ) .", "The ORG also contended that it did not have any information regarding the way in which the embryos had been transported from S. to the ORG , and was thus unable to guarantee that the minimum sanitary conditions had been complied with .", "The ORG could therefore not authorise the transfer of the embryos from the ORG to another clinic , either within GPE or internationally ; furthermore , according to the provisions of LAW ) of Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC , \u201c all tissue and cells that do not comply with [ the legal ] provisions shall be discarded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to direct the NORP authorities to allow her to retrieve her QUANTITY embryos stored at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated decided , in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , to indicate to the Government of GPE , under LAW , that the embryos should not be destroyed after DATE , for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG .", "The President also decided to request the Government , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG , to submit information as to the legal status of the embryos after DATE and on the domestic law and procedure which would allow the applicant to obtain a court transfer order quickly .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , the Government informed the ORG as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG informed the ORG that it was merely the authorised depository of a receptacle seized by ORG from S. , and that its only obligation was to make sure that the receptacle was preserved at a temperature of -CARDINAL degrees Celsius . The ORG therefore could not dispose of the biological material stored in the receptacle in any way .", "CARDINAL . ORG informed the Government on DATE that they had asked the ORG to take all necessary measures to adequately preserve the applicant \u2019s embryos . ORG also asked the ORG to share with the ORG all relevant information concerning the appropriate procedure for preserving the above - mentioned embryos .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the information required under LAW ( a ) , the ORG appended the letter of DATE from ORG , which stated that the applicant \u2019s request to have her genetic material returned had already been granted by the prosecutor on DATE . The decision had been taken after the applicant \u2019s embryos had been identified on DATE ; the applicant had been given until DATE to retrieve her embryos , the same deadline having been set for CARDINAL other individuals who were in a situation similar to the applicant \u2019s , in view of the necessity of avoiding repeated interferences with the contents of the receptacles and the fact that since an indictment had already been issued , the investigation authorities could no longer pay the ORG the cost of storage .", "ORG also informed the Government that the seizure , transport and handover of the genetic material to ORG had been carried out with the agreement of ORG , whose representative \u2013 the manager of the ORG at that time \u2013 had cooperated directly with the investigation authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP In conclusion , the Government contended that the applicant already had a decision allowing the transfer of the embryos , which could be carried out at any time provided the applicant was accompanied by an embryologist and had the appropriate receptacle .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the Government \u2019s reply , the applicant asked the Court to note that it was not specified whether the applicant would be able to retrieve her embryos in the absence of authorisation from the NTA . In practice , as she had already shown , the embryo transfer was not possible unless the ORG authorised it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant formulated before the ORG civil claims in the criminal proceedings pending before the domestic courts following the indictment issued by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; she thus asked the court to allow an embryo transfer from the ORG to a NORP or foreign authorised clinic .", "The applicant \u2019s request was dismissed on DATE ; the court considered that given that the prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had already granted her claim , the actual implementation and enforcement of the decision exceeded the framework of the criminal trial . The court also held that the applicant had the opportunity , if she so wished , to contest the ORG \u2019s refusal to authorise the embryo transfer before the civil courts .", "The applicant contested this ruling ; on DATE her appeal was dismissed as inadmissible by ORG . In the court \u2019s reasoning it was stated that there was no legal basis to respond to her request within the criminal proceedings , the civil courts having jurisdiction to examine her complaints .", "In his dissenting opinion , Judge PERSON estimated that the applicant \u2019s request was well founded , in so far as , in spite of the prosecutor \u2019s decision ordering the restitution of her embryos , the authorities were refusing to implement the decision . Having regard to the fact that the confiscation of the embryos was carried out within criminal proceedings , it was only natural that the restitution should also be carried out within the same proceedings . At the same time , considering that the applicant could not be held responsible for the confiscation , which had been ordered by the investigating authorities in the absence of any authorisation from the ORG , it was excessive to ask the applicant to pursue yet another set of proceedings in order to be able to obtain authorisation for transfer from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG a request seeking to obtain , in accordance with the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL regulating administrative proceedings , the ORG \u2019s authorisation for the transfer of her embryos to a specialised and authorised clinic , whether in GPE or abroad .", "In their defence , the ORG reiterated their arguments , according to which the fact that the embryos had been deposited firstly at S. , and then at the ORG , where they had been transported under unknown conditions , neither of the CARDINAL institutions being at the time accredited as banks for genetic material , created uncertainty with regard to the safety and quality of the embryos ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In such circumstances , it was not possible to authorise transfer under the relevant legislation . Furthermore , if any clinic from GPE agreed to deposit the CARDINAL embryos , the ORG would have to revoke that clinic \u2019s accreditation for non - compliance with the law .", "The applicant \u2019s request was dismissed as ill - founded on DATE . The court considered that in view of the relevant legislation , requiring specific standards of quality and safety with regard to the genetic material and in so far as neither ORG at the time of the original deposit of embryos nor the ORG , was accredited or authorised to function as banks of genetic material , the ORG \u2019s refusal was justified and in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested this judgment before ORG and ORG , reiterating that according to the Government \u2019s submissions before the ORG , the transfer of the embryos from ORG into the ORG was carried out with the approval of ORG and of the ORG \u2019s manager ; in that respect , the ORG \u2019s refusal to authorise a further transfer appeared unjustified . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s few visits to the ORG for the purposes of checking the state of her embryos revealed that the embryos were being kept in precarious conditions , in the absence of any trained staff able to properly supervise their preservation .", "CARDINAL . The High Court gave its ruling on CARDINAL DATE , allowing the applicant \u2019s request and obliging the ORG to authorise the transfer of the CARDINAL embryos from the ORG to an authorised clinic in GPE or abroad .", "In its reasoning , the court mainly held that in so far as the ORG \u2019s attribution was to coordinate the activities of procurement , processing , preservation , storage , validation and distribution of human tissue and cells in GPE , there was no legal ground for it to interfere in the implementation of the prosecutor \u2019s decision to restore the embryos .", "The fluctuating attitude of the ORG concerning its participation and/or cooperation with the criminal investigation authorities , namely , confirming that the retrieval of the embryos from S. had been done with the approval of the ORG \u2019s manager , while also holding that the transfer had been made without its consent , proved once more that the ORG was confused and uncertain about the scope of its own authority . The ORG \u2019s cooperation with the criminal investigation authorities was certain , as it came out especially from the observations submitted by ORG before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Such cooperation was , in any event , natural , having regard to the specific nature of the confiscated goods . In this context , the ORG should have advised the investigation authorities to deposit the embryos in an authorised clinic , which they did not do . On the contrary , the ORG proved to be excessively formalistic only when it came to the restitution of the embryos to the applicant , considering , unfoundedly , that it was within its competence to intervene in the enforcement of the prosecutor \u2019s decision :", "\u201c This behaviour on the part of the ORG breached the applicant \u2019s right to retrieve her embryos and to make use of them as urgently as possible , in view of the special characteristics of the genetic material and also of the applicant \u2019s age , in the context of her desire to become a mother . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s allegations , that in DATE , when the applicant underwent the ORG , she did not comply with the relevant legal requirements , were not in themselves relevant , in so far as the criminal proceedings regarding the activity of ORG were still pending ; moreover , in DATE , when the applicant deposited her embryos at S. , the clinic was in the process of being accredited , as shown by the inspections organised to that end on DATE , and DATE and DATE by the ORG and ORG , culminating with the accreditation apparently having been granted to the clinic by the ORG on DATE .", "In spite of all these factors , and of the fact that the prosecutor decided that the embryos should be given back to the applicant , the ORG unjustifiably intervened and blocked the restitution procedure ; the ORG unlawfully arrogated to itself an authority it did not have , while also threatening any medical institution which could have received the embryos even without the ORG \u2019s authorisation that in such a case their licence would be suspended or even revoked .", "Furthermore , the ORG could not cite any doubt as to the security and quality of the genetic material because it had been deposited at the ORG , an unauthorised clinic , having regard to the fact that at the moment of the deposit their agreement had been given , and afterwards , following the ORG \u2019s request that the embryos should be preserved and protected pending the proceedings before this ORG , the ORG was expressly solicited by ORG to provide expertise so as to satisfy the ORG \u2019s request .", "Referring to the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG held that when there was no domestic law able to adequately define the specific circumstances in the relationship between an individual and the state , the latter was bound to protect fundamental human rights , such as , in the present case , the right to respect for private life and the right to life .", "For this reason , the court considered that :", "\u201c By its obstructive attitude , the ORG infringed the applicant \u2019s rights and interests linked to the right to a private life and the right to life , by not properly balancing the public interest that the ORG is bound to protect and the legitimate interests of the applicant . \u201d", "It therefore allowed the applicant \u2019s claims as formulated , holding that", "\u201c the ORG was obliged to authorise the transfer of the CARDINAL embryos from the ORG to an authorised and specialised clinic in GPE or abroad , a clinic which would be able to receive the embryos in its bank and which would be able to assist the applicant with the desired embryo transfer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG ruling , on DATE the ORG issued a decision in which it \u201c authorised the transfer of the CARDINAL embryos from the IFM PERSON to an authorised clinic in GPE , in accordance with the relevant legal framework \u201d .", "The ORG further held that the second alternative mentioned in ORG judgment , namely that the transfer could also be authorised abroad , could not be implemented , in so far as the appropriate authorisation for a transfer abroad was not an ordinary authorisation for transfer , but \u201c an authorisation for export \u201d , which was never requested as such by the applicant ; moreover , authorisation for export had a very particular character , and in its absence the export of human tissues and cells was prohibited .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant unsuccessfully attempted to transfer her embryos to the PERSON clinic ( a private clinic in GPE ) . In their response to the Government on why the transfer was not possible , on DATE ORG informed that they could not proceed with the transfer without relevant medical information concerning the embryos and their medical history , including data on how they had been preserved from DATE . Consequently and having regard to the fact that the clinic did not have the special quarantine conditions needed for deposit of the embryos , the transfer could not be carried out in compliance with the applicable legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a ORG prosecutor issued a decision , in which it was held that having regard to ORG ruling and to the fact that the only ORG medical institutions accredited to function as \u201c human cells and/or tissue banks \u201d were respectively the Prof . Dr. ORG and ORG in GPE and ORG in GPE , for reasons of efficiency the first institution was to become the new custodian of the applicant \u2019s embryos . The embryo transfer was to be carried out by a specialist transport company , the costs being borne by the ORG . All documents regarding the maintenance of the embryos were to be transferred to the new custodian .", "The prosecutor \u2019s decision was not contested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with this decision , on DATE the embryo transfer was carried out and the embryos placed in ORG within the Prof . Dr. ORG , the newly appointed custodian . According to a letter sent by ORG to the Government on DATE , the new custodian was accredited as a genetic bank and human cell and tissue bank , and was also authorised to assist the applicant with any procedure related to artificial insemination .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant submitted that the transfer of the embryos had once more been carried out without her consent and even without her being consulted or informed in advance . She further stated that in the Prof . Dr. ORG she had had bad experiences , in so far as in DATE she underwent CARDINAL unsuccessful ORG procedures there and therefore she could no longer trust the professional capacity of those doctors . She considered that she was entitled to be assisted for future ORG by doctors of her choice , in whom she trusted ; therefore the transfer of her embryos into the above - mentioned clinic had denied her that right .", "The applicant requested the opportunity to transfer her embryos to a clinic of her choice , at the expense of the NORP authorities , who were responsible for the situation created and also for the well - being of her embryos .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the Prof . Dr. ORG informed the applicant \u2019s representative that from DATE they could be contacted to set a date on which the applicant , in the presence of an embryologist , could come to take possession of her genetic material in order to transfer it elsewhere , in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations set by the ORG .", "By a letter sent to ORG , the applicant stated that she had found a clinic outside GPE \u201c willing to help \u201d her and that a date of transfer was \u201c hopefully \u201d imminent . In the meantime , she had also tried to set up a new procedure in the hope of a new pregnancy . She further stressed the trauma she had gone through on account of the ORG \u2019s successive interferences with her right to have another child by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant alleged that she had contacted many clinics in GPE regarding the transfer of her embryos , but in spite of the fact that they were open to the idea at the beginning , \u201c after further evaluation , the risk for them seemed to high \u201d and no transfer was agreed .", "CARDINAL . The Government replied that on CARDINAL hand , the applicant \u2019s assertions were too vague and unsubstantiated , and on the other hand , that she had not acted with specific diligence to transfer her embryos from Prof . Dr. PERSON clinic , either to start an ORG procedure or at least to get more information about how her embryos were being taken care of in that clinic .", "On DATE , the Government sent a document issued by the Prof . Dr. PERSON clinic in which it was confirmed that the applicant could initiate an ORG procedure in that clinic , with the assistance of a doctor and an embryologist of her choice , whether from GPE or from abroad , in so far as these two had a license to practice in GPE . Furthermore , a letter from the private clinic ORG in GPE was appended , stating that the clinic was willing to take the applicant \u2019s embryos while its doctors would monitor both the patient and the embryo - transfer .", "On DATE , the applicant met the manager of the ORG clinic ; following their discussion , she wrote a letter to the clinic in which she asked for more information concerning the concrete stages envisaged for the embryo transfer , as well as a precise date on which such a transfer could be accomplished .", "CARDINAL . The Act is divided into CARDINAL titles , covering a wide array of subjects specific to the public health area . Title VI contains provisions covering the procurement and transplant of organs , tissues and cells of human origin used for therapeutic purposes , the donors of organs , tissues and human - origin cells , the donation and transplant thereof and the financing of transplant activity . It transposes into national legislation Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of ORG and of ORG on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation , procurement , testing , processing , preservation , storage and distribution of human tissue and cells . It also defines the role and responsibilities of ORG , as the main competent authority in the field of the procurement and transplant of organs , tissues and cells of human origin , including the accreditation , designation , authorization or licensing of tissue establishments and tissue and cell preparation processes .", "ORG shall be responsible for the coordination , supervision , approval and implementation of any provisions regarding transplant activities .", "( CARDINAL ) Any transplant of tissue and cells of human origin may be processed only from the banks accredited or approved by ORG ...", "( CARDINAL ) ORG or exports of tissue and cells shall be possible only if specifically authorised by ORG .", "CARDINAL . This sets out provisions governing the mechanisms to be put into place to ensure the quality and safety of tissues and cells and their traceability , in compliance with the relevant NORP law requirements .", "CARDINAL . This lists the tissue establishments accredited , designated , authorized or licensed to function as tissue and human cell banks and/or users .
