The first applicant and PERSON had also had a long - running dispute . The move of their mother exacerbated the rift between the neighbours . It appears that their ongoing conflict prompted the police to warn them several times not to harass each other or their families . On various occasions the applicants and PERSON lodged actions and complaints with the competent authorities , alleging harassment and unlawful conduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and her other daughter argued with PERSON over the presence of a brick wall between the QUANTITY . The tension escalated and someone called the police . There is contradictory information regarding the incident but , in any event , the police officers warned ORG not to physically or psychologically harass the applicants .", "CARDINAL . At TIME DATE , DATE , the applicants , the first applicant \u2019s other daughter and CARDINAL grandchildren , who were minors , were walking past ORG house , heading towards the children \u2019s school . The first applicant \u2019s mother was standing at the front door of their house .", "CARDINAL . There is conflicting evidence about the events which followed .

G.M. and PERSON contested this account of the events and maintained that the argument had started when , while having their TIME coffee , they heard the mother murmuring obscenities at ORG and were drawn into an argument with her . In their view , at that point the elderly woman started complaining loudly of harassment .", "CARDINAL . It appears that when they heard the elderly woman \u2019s cries , the first applicant and her daughters rushed back and engaged in a physical fight with PERSON got involved and started hitting the applicants , according to them with something resembling a hoe . The first applicant allegedly started exerting pressure on his testicles . Having heard the commotion , PERSON ran out of the house and joined in the fight , hitting the applicants with a stick .

On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with the GPE district prosecutor .

It appears from the applicants\u2019 submissions that by a decree of an unspecified date the district prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings on the ground that the actions complained of constituted minor bodily harm and proceedings were to be taken on the basis of a private criminal complaint lodged with the court .", "CARDINAL . Following that , on DATE the applicants brought a private criminal complaint before ORG against GPE , PERSON and LAW for inflicting minor bodily harm and insulting them in public .", "CARDINAL .

In a decision of DATE the court discontinued the proceedings and transferred the case to the prosecutor on the ground that the actions complained of constituted hooliganism , a crime which was subject to public prosecution . The parties did not appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor examined the case file in the light of the court \u2019s findings that the legal characterisation of the offence was hooliganism . By a decree of DATE he refused to open criminal proceedings against ORG , PERSON and PERSON , stating once again that the criminal characterisation of the actions complained of was minor bodily harm , to be prosecuted by means of a private criminal complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicants learned about the prosecutor \u2019s decree of DATE on an unspecified date .

Meanwhile , the prosecutor sent his decree of DATE to ORG .

In a decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG findings , in particular its conclusion that the court \u2019s decision of DATE had put an end to the criminal proceedings against ORG , PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , but apparently before DATE , the first applicant sent another complaint concerning the same matter to ORG , which transferred it to the district prosecutor . On DATE , the district prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings . The prosecutor stated that at the time the applicants submitted their complaint to ORG , criminal proceedings had been pending before ORG on the same facts , which prevented the institution of criminal proceedings by a public prosecutor .
