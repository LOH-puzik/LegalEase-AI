She also hoped that in the framework of these proceedings she would be provided with access to all documents about her stored by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her application to institute lustration proceedings , considering that she had not been publicly accused of having been a secret collaborator within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Lustration Act . Firstly , it was not certain that she was the person whose name had been on the list . Even assuming that her name had been on the list , such fact could not be tantamount to an accusation of having collaborated with the security services . The court noted that the media had reported that the list had been only a sort of a catalogue facilitating the use of ORG archives . It contained the names of persons who had been registered by the security services for various reasons ; some had been actual secret collaborators but there were other persons who had been preselected for that role , without necessarily having been aware of that fact .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the impugned decision . The court found that there were no sufficient grounds to consider that the applicant had been publicly accused of having collaborated with the security services . The list of names produced by the applicant indicated that it contained not only the names of agents but also of victims . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant had not established that the inclusion of her name on the list had had any specific adverse consequences for her .

It identified under LAW a distinct category of persons , namely those who applied for the status of the \u201c injured party \u201d and whose applications were refused . The refusal resulted either from the lack of documents concerning a person seeking the status or from the fact that the security services had not collected information on them . The Constitutional Court disagreed with the ORG that the ORG \u2019s refusal to classify a person as the \u201c injured party \u201d had been tantamount to an official declaration that such person had been an officer , employee or collaborator of the ORG security services . At the same time it pointed to the incoherent criteria used by ORG in classifying persons as collaborators of the security services . It also noted that ORG archives contained information which had been , in principle , collected without any legal basis and often unlawfully .

ORG noted that the LAW guaranteed to everyone the right of access to official documents and data collections concerning oneself ( LAW ) and the right to demand the correction or deletion of untrue or incomplete information , or information acquired by unlawful means ( LAW ) .

ORG noted that there was no doubt that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) had been declared unconstitutional . It observed that the Speaker \u2019s request was aimed at supplementing the reasons for the judgment ; however there was no such possibility under LAW . Nonetheless , ORG drew attention to the fact that the sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which both had been declared unconstitutional , had identical content and thus they had concerned the same legal norm although spelled out in CARDINAL different provisions . Both provisions concerned the same group of persons , namely those considered by the ORG security services as a secret informants or assistants in covert gathering of information . ORG noted that the reasons for the finding of unconstitutionality in respect of section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) were equally applicable to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . It noted that an unconstitutional legal norm could appear in part as well as in one or more legal provisions ; however the finding of unconstitutionality of a legal norm and hence its disqualification was relevant for all situations in which such norm may be applied .", "CARDINAL .

What is decisive in such situations is the fact that a legal norm ( included in section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW , and used also in unchallenged section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) was declared unconstitutional in the judgment of ORG . It is also relevant that section CARDINAL of LAW determines solely a form of the decision refusing request for access to copies of documents concerning [ an applicant ] , while the immediately preceding it section CARDINAL speaks of the individual right of access to documents , which is an implementation at the statutory level of the constitutional principle of access of every person to official documents and data collections specified in LAW .
