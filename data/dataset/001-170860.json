The court further emphasised the need to modify the way the father and the child communicated without suspending contact between them , which would lead to breaking the bond between them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON applied to change the access rights of the applicant agreed in the settlement of DATE .

The RODK also proposed that J. should consult a psychologist .

The last meeting took place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the RODK issued another report which stated that the boy had been loyal to his mother and had turned away from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after ineffective mediation , the court modified the contact arrangements by ordering longer meetings with the applicant .

On DATE the applicant brought a claim to enforce the arrangements for meeting his child , as determined by the settlement of CARDINAL DATE , by imposing a fine on the child \u2019s mother . The applicant submitted that PERSON had been making it impossible for him to call his son although that had been provided for by the settlement .
