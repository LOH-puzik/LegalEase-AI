RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits and dismissed (Article 35-1 - Exhaustion of domestic remedies);Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 13 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy);No violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 - Right to free elections-{general} (Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 - Right to free elections)", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik M\u00f8se;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE decided that election of members to ORG , the lower chamber of the NORP federal parliament , would take place on DATE . During this election campaign , CARDINAL electoral associations - political parties and electoral blocs - were registered as standing for election in the federal contest . The pro - government forces in the DATE elections were represented essentially by ORG . The electoral list of GPE included many high - ranking federal officials and regional governors .", "CARDINAL . ORG and the PERSON party put forward their lists of candidates . The third applicant ran on the PERSON ticket . The sixth applicant ran as an independent candidate in a single - mandate electoral district . The eighth applicant ran on the ticket of the political party Soyuz Pravykh Sil ( ORG ) . She also ran in a single - mandate electoral district . All the individual applicants also participated in the DATE electoral campaign as voters . Although the political platforms of the applicants who participated in the DATE elections were different , all of them positioned themselves as opposition parties and candidates .", "CARDINAL . The electoral process was administered by ORG ( the ORG ) . Similar commissions were created at regional level . The ORG \u2019s role was , inter alia , to examine complaints of candidates or voters about breaches of electoral law , and take the necessary measures to prevent or put an end to such breaches . The ORG was also responsible for counting the votes on DATE and announcing the official results of the elections . In DATE the ORG created a ORG , an advisory body which was supposed to assist in overseeing compliance with the rules on allocation of free airtime , publication of opinion polls and illegal campaigning .", "CARDINAL . The voting was held by secret ballot on DATE . On DATE the ORG officially confirmed the election results by Decree No . DATE . According to the official statistics , CARDINAL persons voted in the elections . Thus , the level of participation was MONEY of the registered number of voters . The ORG party obtained a majority of votes ( over MONEY ) and formed the biggest grouping in ORG with CARDINAL seats . In the aftermath of the elections CARDINAL Members of ORG elected on behalf of ORG renounced their mandates , whilst keeping their official positions , and transferred their seats in the PERSON to other candidates on the GPE list ( who otherwise would not have been elected ) . On DATE the ORG approved the forfeiture of CARDINAL mandates obtained by the GPE candidates in favour of other members of that party .", "CARDINAL . ORG won MONEY of votes and obtained CARDINAL seats , and accordingly formed the second biggest grouping in the PERSON . PERSON obtained MONEY of votes . Since this was less than the statutory MONEY minimum threshold , PERSON did not obtain any seats in parliament . Mr PERSON ( the sixth applicant ) obtained CARDINAL per cent of votes in his district and was elected as an individual MP to the PERSON . Mr PERSON and Ms Khakamada ( the third and eighth applicants ) were individual candidates , supported by the PERSON party and ORG party respectively ; they failed to be elected .", "CARDINAL . All the major TV companies in GPE covered the elections . Amongst them were CARDINAL main nationwide broadcasting companies : ORG , PERSON ( ORG and ORG ) , ORG , ORG and ORG . The first CARDINAL companies were directly controlled by the ORG . Thus , the ORG held more than CARDINAL per cent of shares in ORG ; ORG was a federal ORG unitary enterprise ; ORG held MONEY of shares in ORG . The other CARDINAL channels ( ORG and ORG ) were incorporated as limited companies not owned directly by the ORG ; however , amongst their major shareholders were corporations affiliated with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The above CARDINAL channels had a very large audience and covered all geographical zones . Thus , Channel One covered almost all the territory of GPE , PERSON per cent of the territory , and ORG over MONEY . The outreach of ORG amounted to CARDINAL per cent coverage of NORP territory . The outreach of REN TV at the relevant time was not specified by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . During the electoral campaign the parties participating in it received a certain amount of free airtime on TV channels for \u201c electoral campaigning \u201d , that is , direct political advertisement . Thus , each ORG broadcasting company was required to provide the competing candidate parties with TIME of free airtime per working day on each TV or radio channel they controlled . In total , the parties received TIME of airtime . Each of them thus received TIME of free airtime . The time schedule for distribution of free airtime time amongst parties and candidates was defined by the drawing of lots on DATE . The candidates were supposed to use CARDINAL that time for \u201c joint campaigning events \u201d ( such as debates , for example ) . They could use the other CARDINAL as they wished . All the parties used the free airtime provided to them by the broadcasting companies .", "CARDINAL . In addition , parties and candidates could buy a certain amount of paid airtime for campaigning on an equal footing with the others . Broadcasting companies were required to reserve paid airtime for political broadcasting of the candidates . However , the law provided that the amount of time for paid political advertising should not be CARDINAL per cent of the amount of free airtime . Furthermore , at regional level all the ORG - owned regional broadcasting companies also provided free and paid airtime to the candidates according to the same principles as at federal level .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , ORG of GPE did not buy airtime from the federal broadcasting companies , although it had sufficient financial resources to do so . At the regional level the ORG bought airtime only occasionally , in some of the regions . The political party GPE bought time from ORG to show CARDINAL video clips , each lasting TIME . All parties and candidates also bought printed space in some of the federal print media .", "CARDINAL . Besides \u201c campaigning \u201d , all channels were involved in reporting on the elections in various news items , analytical programmes , talk shows and so on ( hereinafter \u201c media coverage \u201d ) . The applicants maintained that media coverage of the electoral campaign of DATE by the CARDINAL TV channels was unfair to opposition parties and candidates , and that in the guise of media coverage these TV channels in fact campaigned for the ruling party , i.e. the United GPE .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG the applicants produced detailed data on the content of major information spots , programmes and shows on the CARDINAL above - mentioned TV channels during the period of the DATE electoral campaign . According to the applicants , the airtime spent by the CARDINAL TV companies was allocated amongst the candidates unevenly . Thus , ORG received TIME of the airtime . The total amount of airtime allocated to the GPE was TIME DATE . In contrast , the reporting on the activities and personalities associated with GPE amounted to TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also argued that the information disseminated through newscasts and informational and analytical programmes was not neutral for the most part . The amount of \u201c positive \u201d media coverage received by ORG during the election campaign did not exceed TIME . In addition , some positive coverage was provided through ORG senior GPE participation in the talk shows aired by ORG , which lasted TIME . In toto positive coverage of ORG amounted to TIME . Negative coverage of ORG amounted to TIME ; most of such coverage was in the information spots . In contrast , positive media coverage of GPE amounted to TIME , whereas \u201c negative \u201d coverage of that party amounted to TIME . Positive coverage of GPE amounted to TIME . Negative coverage of that party amounted to TIME . The applicants specified that the CARDINAL private nationwide channels not directly controlled by the ORG ( ORG and ORG ) provided a more balanced media coverage than the CARDINAL channels directly controlled by the ORG ( such as ORG , ORG , and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also referred to various episodes of tacit electoral campaigning for GPE by various high - level Government officials , notably the then President PERSON . Thus , on DATE Mr PERSON attended the congress of GPE , which was covered by ORG , PERSON and ORG . Mr PERSON delivered a speech to the delegates of the congress , saying , in particular , the following :", "\u2018 \u2018 Your meeting is taking place at a moment which is important for our country , for the electoral campaign has just started . I am not going to hide the fact that I voted for your party DATE . I believe I was right to do so \u2019\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . On DATE when no campaigning is permitted , ORG , ORG , TV ORG , and REN TV broadcast a short interview given by the then President of GPE , PERSON PERSON , at a voting station :", "\u201c Journalist : Who did you vote for ?", "Mr PERSON : I think my answer may be regarded as additional campaigning , so I \u2019d better keep silent . But I think my preferences are well known . \u201d", "That phrase was broadcast CARDINAL times during DATE ; the general airtime allocated to showing that interview amounted to TIME . In addition , all channels disseminated information about the participation of the GPE leaders in the voting which on DATE was broadcast CARDINAL times , the aggregate length amounting to TIME and TIME .", "CARDINAL . After the elections , several international organisations and NGOs made public statements and issued reports in which they criticised the DATE parliamentary elections for unequal access of the candidates to the media . Thus , on DATE ORG in LOC ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) published its election observation mission final report , where it noted that \u201c the main countrywide ORG broadcasters displayed favouritism towards GPE and , in doing so , failed to meet their legal obligation to provide equal treatment to electoral participants , also a fundamental principle of democratic elections \u201d . The report contained the following passages :", "\u201c The ORG TV channels fully complied with legal provisions on allocation of free airtime for all contestants . All CARDINAL ORG - controlled televisions aired regular debates among political parties and blocs , a positive development that helped voters to form opinions of the candidates ... However , outside of the free airtime , the ORG broadcasters monitored by the [ ORG election observation mission ] openly promoted GPE ... ORG - funded broadcasters also produced a number of prime time news discrediting [ the first applicant political party ] ... In comparison , the private broadcasters ... provided more balanced coverage of the campaign with a greater diversity of views ... The print media provided a plurality of views but mainly supported specific political parties or blocs . As such , voters could form an objective view of the campaign only if they read several publications . State - funded newspapers met the legal requirements in regard to free space for each party or bloc , but were biased in the political and campaign coverage in favour of GPE and against [ the first applicant political party ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a GPE - based research affiliate of international ORG published its report on \u201c the abuse of administrative resources \u201d during the DATE electoral campaign in which it identified CARDINAL instances of such abuse . That report , which was based on independently conducted media monitoring , concluded that \u201c media resources had been systematically misused throughout the campaign on behalf of GPE \u201d , and that \u201c the monitoring had clearly documented bias in favour of GPE in terms of the number of biased individual news items broadcast \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , the then deputy chairperson of the second applicant political party ( PERSON ) , wrote a complaint to the chairman of the ORG about unfair media coverage of the campaign . In his reply of CARDINAL DATE the ORG chairman acknowledged that several television broadcasts and press reports contained elements of unlawful electoral campaigning against that political party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE ( the leader of the first applicant , ORG ) complained to the ORG about PERSON PERSON \u2019s speech of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG examined that complaint and prepared a report ; based on that report on DATE the ORG chairman wrote a letter to Mr GPE in which he explained that there had been nothing unlawful in that speech . The chairman explained that mass media could report on official statements of public officials and that such media coverage could not be considered as \u201c campaigning \u201d . The position of the ORG chairman was later confirmed by ORG in judgments of DATE and DATE . A similar complaint to the prosecuting authorities also failed : on DATE the Tverskoy District Prosecutor of GPE refused to initiate administrative proceedings , referring to the ORG \u2019s conclusion that PERSON PERSON \u2019s speech had not violated any electoral regulations . ORG decision was upheld by the GPE Deputy Prosecutor on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON ( the seventh applicant , in DATE a non - voting member of the ORG ) complained to the ORG and to ORG about a television report by ORG of DATE which had stated that GPE was \u201c leading [ in the elections ] having left its competitors far behind \u201d and that ORG was \u201c losing the voters\u2019 support \u201d . In Mr PERSON \u2019s submission , that report constituted illegal electoral campaigning . On DATE ORG refused to institute administrative proceedings in that regard . That decision was upheld by the GPE Deputy Prosecutor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON complained to the ORG about television programmes broadcast on DATE featuring a friendly meeting between the GPE leader and a well - known singer . The ORG found no elements of electoral campaigning in that broadcast , and the seventh applicant was informed accordingly by a letter from a ORG member dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr GPE , Mr PERSON and several other members of ORG complained about the media coverage of the elections by ORG and PERSON period to ORG . On DATE ORG issued a report noting that ORG \u201c had displayed a tendency towards deliberate and systematic dissemination of neutral or positive , or even complimentary , information about the events related to the activities of ORG , while providing mainly negative coverage of the activities of the ORG \u201d . As regards ORG , it found that \u201c ORG displayed a tendency towards deliberate and systematic dissemination of neutral or positive information about the events related to the activities of GPE , while providing mainly negative coverage - or news items accompanied by negative comments - of the activities of the ORG \u201d . ORG called on ORG and PERSON to comply with the provisions of LAW , in particular the principle of fair and impartial coverage of the electoral campaign . It also indicated that violations of the election coverage rules established by LAW were punishable under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent a letter to ORG , PERSON , ORG and ORG indicating that some of the material broadcast on ORG and PERSON displayed a tendency towards dissemination of predominantly positive or , on the contrary , predominantly negative information about the activities of \u201c certain political parties and electoral blocs \u201d standing for election to the PERSON , and indicated that the directors of the ORG broadcasting companies must comply with the provisions of LAW governing election coverage , as interpreted by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON PERSON complained to ORG about unfair media coverage . On DATE the GPE ORG wrote back informing Mr GPE that the management of the leading nationwide television channel had been reprimanded on account of irregularities committed in the course of publication of the results of the public opinion poll .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the seventh applicant lodged a further complaint with the ORG . He relied on the transcripts of programmes broadcast on the leading nationwide television channels between DATE and DATE . In response , on DATE a ORG member advised the seventh applicant in writing to lodge a claim on grounds of defamation if he so wished . On DATE the seventh applicant lodged complaints with ORG against that letter and the failure of the ORG to take action regarding his complaint of CARDINAL DATE . Those complaints were ruled inadmissible on CARDINAL and DATE respectively . ORG declined jurisdiction to examine the merits of those complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE and the seventh applicant again complained to ORG about biased media coverage . Having examined transcripts of TV programmes , ORG issued on DATE a report in which it noted that the situation had slightly improved since DATE . After having received the report by ORG , the ORG sent a letter to ORG . In that letter the ORG noted that the facts revealed by ORG did not require any action by way of administrative proceedings ; however , ORG was asked to start monitoring the content of major information programmes of the CARDINAL nationwide TV channels .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE attempted to contact the directors of CARDINAL leading nationwide television channels directly , but they denied any wrongdoing on their part . He then brought the matter to the attention of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a claim with ORG for invalidation of the results of the DATE electoral campaign as certified by the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG participated in the proceedings as the defendant .", "CARDINAL . In their voluminous submissions , the applicants relied on the results of the monitoring of CARDINAL nationwide television channels in DATE which revealed that opposition parties and candidates received much less coverage than GPE . They further referred to the unlawful electoral campaigning for GPE by the President . They also complained that the CARDINAL main nationwide television channels had waged a wave of negative publicity against the first applicant political party . The applicants submitted to ORG transcripts of all the television programmes , as well as video recordings , numbering CARDINAL videocassettes .", "CARDINAL . The case was tried by ORG Justice PERSON , sitting in a single - judge formation . The first hearing was held on DATE . Before the start of the trial and at the first several hearings the applicants lodged a number of procedural motions , seeking discovery of new evidence , summoning of additional witnesses and experts , obtaining examination of certain written materials , video recordings etc . According to the applicants , nearly all motions lodged by them were refused by the judge without good reason and/or in breach of the domestic procedural rules . The Government contested that ; they stressed that the same judge granted a number of motions introduced by the applicants . Furthermore , according to the applicants , at the first hearing the judge said that by lodging so many motions the applicants tried to protract the proceedings . On CARDINAL occasions the applicants challenged the judge , but he refused to withdraw from the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . ORG found no violations of electoral law capable of undermining the genuine will of the voters . ORG noted , in particular , the following :", "\u201c The court is not in a position to accept the arguments of [ the applicants ] that the information coverage of [ the DATE electoral campaign ] was conducted with such egregious violations of electoral law , namely , preferential media coverage of CARDINAL political party and the candidates put forward by it , that it was not possible to ascertain the genuine will of the voters .", "First , electoral law does not provide for any limitations on the number of election - related events organised by the political parties in the course of the electoral campaign ; the number of such events depends on the political parties themselves . The only exception is the maximum amount of expenditure , which is the same for all political parties taking part in the electoral campaign and stipulated by law . However , the scope of media coverage of the election - related events of the political parties depends on the number of those events .", "Second , [ the applicants ] do not take into account that the coverage in question was conducted not only by CARDINAL television channels but also by other mass media , in particular , radio stations and the printed mass media .", "Third , according to the [ judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , see applicable domestic law below ] , [ the constitutional right to seek , receive , transmit , produce and disseminate information freely ] shall not be unnecessarily interfered with .", "Fourth , the applicants\u2019 arguments that there is an objective link between the amount of information about a political party disseminated by the television channels and the number of voters who voted for this party in the election are based on assumptions and are refuted by their own evidence .", "Fifth , having examined the transcripts [ submitted by the applicants ] , the court concludes that the applicants classified the stories [ related by the journalists on TV ] as information about a certain political party on the basis of their own subjective perceptions , in particular on the basis of their wrongful assumption that all voters undoubtedly know that persons whose activities those stories covered belonged to a particular political party ... ORG of GPE , in its judgment of DATE , explained that a condition sine qua non of electoral campaigning was dolus specialis , that is , a special intention to persuade the voters to support or undermine a certain candidate or political party ... ORG noted that media coverage without that dolus specialis did not constitute electoral campaigning ... The court has examined the transcripts of news and analytical programmes broadcast by CARDINAL television channels over DATE within the time - period from DATE to DATE . Examination of those materials shows that it is not possible to accept the ORG contention that the television channels disseminated materials about candidates and political parties capable of being classified as electoral campaigning in the course of the electoral campaign ... There are likewise no objective data confirming that the television channels had a specific intention to persuade the voters to vote for GPE while covering the pre - electoral trips of the leaders of that party . The same is true in respect of the television coverage of the speech of President PERSON at the [ GPE general meeting in GPE in DATE ] . The court also considers it necessary to note that , pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG , ORG audio - visual media shall include in their DATE informational programmes information about statements , communications and press conferences of the President of GPE as well as other facts about the activities of the federal state bodies which are of public significance . The court disagrees with the applicants\u2019 contention that the President of GPE conducted unlawful electoral campaigning in support of GPE .", "It follows that there have been no violations of electoral law which would prevent the genuine will of the voters from being ascertained ... [ The ORG election observation mission report ] likewise does not contain [ information about ] those violations ... The applicants\u2019 action for invalidation of the election results can not therefore be allowed \u201d .", "In respect of the episode of DATE ( reporting on PERSON voting , see paragraph DATE above ) ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG can not accept the ORG contention that there was unlawful electoral campaigning for GPE on the part of the President of GPE on DATE .", "Thus , having examined during the hearing a video recording of the ORG items reporting on Mr PERSON casting his vote in the PERSON elections , ORG has established that the President of GPE refused to tell the journalist who he voted for . He did not mention any political party , which could have been classified as campaigning .", "It follows that there have been no violations of electoral law which would prevent the genuine will of the voters in the elections from being ascertained ... and could be a ground for invalidating the ORG \u2019s decision approving the outcome of the ballot ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They argued that the first - instance court had examined only a minor part of the evidence adduced by them , in particular around CARDINAL per cent of transcripts and CARDINAL per cent of video recordings . According to the applicants , that approach violated the principle of direct examination of evidence . The applicants further disagreed with other findings of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a court of appeal , composed of Justices PERSON and PERSON , dismissed their appeal . ORG observed , most notably , the following :", "\u201c The arguments contained in the grounds of appeal are unpersuasive .", "Having examined transcripts for DATE ( CARDINAL and DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) and having heard the GPE representatives , the [ first - instance ] court made a decision on the basis of its examination of the evidence adduced . It decided to examine transcripts for DATE proposed by the parties [ to the proceedings ] within the limits defined by the court . This method of examination of evidence did not violate the principle of equality of the parties . It allowed each of them to propose for examination their main transcripts capable of proving clearly , in their view , the violations of electoral law or absence thereof . The court accordingly proceeded to examine transcripts for DATE proposed by the applicants ( DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE DATE and DATE ) and for DATE proposed by the ORG representatives ( DATE and DATE ) . Additionally , the court examined the transcript and the videotape of DATE , that is , DATE . Overall , the court examined recordings of CARDINAL main television channels for DATE , that is , MONEY of those submitted .", "[ Factual ] circumstances as established by [ the first - instance court ] refute the allegations of inequality of the political parties and clear preference for CARDINAL of them in so far as access to the mass media is concerned \u201d .", "The appellate court also agreed with the other findings of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . ORG is composed of CARDINAL members . At the material time CARDINAL members of ORG were elected from the lists of candidates put forward nationwide by the political parties . Those seats were distributed in proportion to the percentage of votes obtained by those political parties which had cleared a threshold of MONEY of votes . The remaining CARDINAL seats were contested in \u201c single mandate electoral districts \u201d ( CARDINAL - seat constituencies ) , on a majority basis in CARDINAL rounds , with candidates being put forward by the political parties or independently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON on basic principles of elections and referendums was enacted ( PERSON no . CARDINAL-FZ , LAW ) . It was amended on DATE and DATE . Further , the DATE elections were governed by LAW of DATE , amended on DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL-FZ , LAW ) . Media coverage of elections was also regulated by the LAW by ORG ( Federal Law No . CARDINAL of DATE , LAW ) . Certain provisions of the law on media coverage of elections were developed in the documents of the ORG , in particular in Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and interpreted by ORG in its judgment of DATE no . CARDINAL ( for more details , see below ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , the ORG - owned audio - visual mass media were obliged to disseminate information about the activities of ORG bodies and officials , in particular reporting on the decisions and acts of the President of GPE provided for by LAW , his declarations and announcements , press conferences and other activities \u201c which are of public significance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW proclaimed the principle of equal access of candidates to the media , including the audio - visual media . The law distinguished between \u201c informing \u201d the population in the course of the electoral campaign and \u201c electoral campaigning \u201d ( or \u201c agitation \u201d , agitatsiya ) .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Electoral campaigning \u201d was an activity undertaken with the aim of encouraging voters to vote for or against a certain candidate . Electoral campaigning on television was permissible as from DATE before DATE and was to be ceased on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Holders of certain higher public offices ( including that of the President of GPE ) and journalists were not allowed to engage in electoral campaigning unless they were formally registered as candidates . In any event it was illegal for them to do so while using the advantages of their official status on pain of administrative fines . The maximum amounts of expenditure were prescribed by law . The fact that an item of information - an article , a video clip and so on - was political campaigning was to be mentioned in the publication , and the source of funding should be indicated .", "CARDINAL . The law enumerated situations which could be characterised as campaigning . They included , inter alia , dissemination of materials in which information about a particular candidate is prevalent and accompanied by positive or negative comments , analysis of the consequences of electing this or that candidate , information about activities of a candidate which were not related to the performance of his official duties , and so on . The law also established a number of requirements of and limitations on the campaigning .", "CARDINAL . The law at the time provided that all candidates and parties had an equal opportunity to obtain a certain amount of free and paid airtime or printed space for their electoral campaigning . The conditions for obtaining airtime were identical for all candidates , and concerned both public and private mass media . Political parties registered at the federal level had a right of equal access to the national mass media , including ORG and radio - broadcasting stations . Individual candidates ( affiliated or not to a political party ) had similar rights in respect of access to the regional mass media .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Electoral campaigning \u201d was distinguished in the law from \u201c informing \u201d . Informing was mainly the task of the \u201c ORG authorities , municipal authorities , electoral commissions , media companies , legal entities and individuals \u201d ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW , section GPE ) of LAW ) . It had to be objective , factually accurate and should not show preference for any candidate . Informing should consist of giving a neutral account of the progress of the electoral campaign , of the candidates\u2019 profiles , platforms and so on , within the \u201c information slots \u201d ( airtime or printed space dedicated to informing ) . Those \u201c information slots \u201d should not be aligned with the position of any candidate and should not contain comments or value judgments . The mass media had to separate objective information from statements of opinion . At the same time the mass media were free in their editorial policy ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) and were allowed to comment on political events and personalities outside the \u201c information slots \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court of GPE has ruled that professional journalists are regarded as involved in electoral campaigning only if they do so with special intent to campaign in favour of or against one or more candidates ( judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . Thus , in order to distinguish between campaigning and informing ( that is , normal journalistic activity ) the courts have to establish whether or not the journalist pursued a specific aim of influencing the voting , dolus specialis . Where there is no such specific aim ( the existence of which should be established by the courts ) , the materials , articles and so on must be considered as \u201c informing \u201d . ORG further stressed that , whilst the law required that information slots on TV and radio be neutral , the mass media were not prohibited from expressing their own opinion about candidates or giving comments outside the scope of the information slots .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the ORG was the central body responsible for organising and overseeing the electoral campaign at the federal level . It was also empowered to consider complaints about breaches of electoral law ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The ORG was entitled to refer such complaints to the law - enforcement and other official bodies for further consideration and reaction . Decisions of the ORG , taken within its competence , were binding on the lower electoral commissions , federal and regional ORG bodies , public officials , local authorities , candidates , parties , organisations , and voters . State broadcasting companies were required by law to provide free airtime to the candidates and parties during the elections and were required to give replies to the requests of the electoral commissions within DATE of receipt .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provided that unlawful acts and omissions of the public authorities and officials were amenable to judicial review . It further established rules of jurisdiction on applications for judicial review of acts and omissions of the ORG and regional commissions . LAW also provided for an appeal to a higher electoral commission against decisions of the lower electoral commissions . ORG of GPE had power to invalidate the results of the federal elections if the violations committed did not permit the genuine will of the voters to be ascertained ( sections CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Administrative Offences ( ORG ) of DATE established sanctions for certain breaches of electoral law , such as the failure by the mass media to comply with the rules of press coverage of the electoral campaign ( LAW ) , or unlawful electoral campaigning through audio - visual and printed mass media by a candidate ( LAW .

ORG Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters also recommended the creation of an effective system of electoral appeals , among other things , to complain about non - compliance with the rules of access to the media ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The standards relating to public service broadcasting were further developed by ORG in the Appendix to Recommendation no . R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL on \u201c ORG ( DATE ) . ORG recommended that \u201c the legal framework governing public service broadcasting organisations should clearly stipulate their editorial independence and institutional autonomy \u201d . Furthermore , \u201c the legal framework governing public service broadcasting organisations should clearly stipulate that they shall ensure that news programmes fairly present facts and events and encourage the free formation of opinions .

Finally , in the Appendix to Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL on \u201c ORG for the Broadcasting Sector \u201d , ORG again stressed the importance for States to adopt detailed rules covering the membership and functioning of such regulatory authorities so as to protect against political interference and influence .", "CARDINAL .
