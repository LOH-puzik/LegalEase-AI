CARDINAL ) against GPE lodged with ORG under LAW ( \u201c the LAW ) by a NORP national , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u201d ) , on DATE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "At the material time the applicant worked at a steel factory owned by a company in which the ORG held PERCENT of the share capital . The company operated under its articles of association and was managed by a director appointed by the general meeting of shareholders , which was the highest authority deemed competent since shareholders represented over PERCENT of the votes . The company \u2019s supervisory board included CARDINAL representative of ORG .", "On DATE the director of the company , noting an increase in instances of staff members presenting for work under the influence of alcohol , and relying on paragraph CARDINAL of the company \u2019s internal regulations , which \u201c forbade attendance at work in a state of intoxication and ... drinking at work \u201d , instructed the departmental factory guards ( \u201c the guards \u201d ) \u2013 who were employees of the company \u2013 to \u201c apprehend , in compliance with the legislation of GPE , anyone appearing to be in a state of alcoholic ( narcotic ) intoxication and take them to [ the GPE ] office for a report subsequently to be drawn up \u201d . Employees who disagreed with the report were to be escorted to a local clinic for an alcohol test .", "At TIME on DATE , a guard at the factory gate suspected that the applicant , who was on his way out after working CARDINAL shifts in succession , was drunk and asked him whether he had drunk alcohol . Following the applicant \u2019s reply that he had drunk \u201c a glass of vodka \u201d , guards PERSON and P. seized the applicant \u2019s badge and would not allow him to leave the LOC of the factory . After TIME the senior guard , ORG arrived , questioned the applicant and drew up a report indicating that the applicant was drunk and \u201c looked untidy \u201d , and that \u201c there was a strong smell of alcohol on his breath \u201d . The applicant , who disagreed with those conclusions and refused to sign the report , was then taken to the office of the chief guard , PERSON , for further questioning . PERSON asked several factory workers to smell the applicant \u2019s breathe and say whether he was drunk . Eventually , the applicant was escorted to a local clinic where at TIME he was given an alcohol test and was found to be sober . Subsequently , at an unspecified time , the applicant was allowed to leave , his badge having been returned to him .", "On an unspecified date , upon the applicant \u2019s complaint , the head of the company \u2019s trade union initiated an internal investigation into the incident . The investigation established that the report drawn up by guard PERSON on DATE had been based on the statements of S. and P. , \u201c external signs of the applicant \u2019s alcoholic intoxication \u201d , and the applicant \u2019s behavior after he had been stopped by PERSON It was also noted that the applicant had consented to undergo an alcohol test at the clinic .", "On DATE , the chief guard of the factory , referring to the findings of that investigation , issued an instruction indicating a number of shortcomings in the conduct of the guards involved in the incident on DATE . In particular , it was noted that guard PERSON had failed to describe the signs of alcoholic intoxication which the applicant had allegedly displayed or to record the statements given by PERSON The chief guard also noted that the guards had failed to draw up a separate report on the applicant \u2019s refusal to cooperate .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG against the company , seeking CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage allegedly caused to him by the unlawful actions of the guards on DATE .", "On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that the guards had acted in line with the company \u2019s internal regulations and therefore their actions had been lawful . Having heard all the eyewitnesses of the incident on DATE , the court concluded that there was no evidence that the guards\u2019 conduct caused damage to the applicant \u2019s reputation , health , lifestyle or working relationships . The court relied on the report of CARDINAL DATE and the internal investigation report , plus the records of the applicant \u2019s alcohol test on that date and statements by PERSON The court invoked Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant .", "The applicant appealed in cassation , stating , in particular , that ORG had failed to verify whether his detention had been compatible with the requirements of the Convention . According to the applicant , his detention on DATE had not been justified by any of the grounds in LAW but no compensation had been available to him , contrary to LAW . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal in cassation on the ground that there was no evidence suggesting that the decisions of the lower courts were unlawful or inaccurate .", "Meanwhile , on DATE at TIME , guards P. and NORP , suspecting the applicant of being drunk , had stopped him as he was leaving the factory . The guards took the applicant to their office and questioned him . The senior guard PERSON drew up a report stating that the applicant was drunk and noting that the latter disagreed with that conclusion . According to the applicant , the guards refused to take him to a clinic for an alcohol test and did not allow him to leave until TIME on DATE . From CARDINAL on DATE to TIME on DATE the guards allegedly pressured and threatened the applicant . According to the Government , the applicant was kept in the GPE office for TIME on DATE .", "On DATE at TIME the applicant , who wished to prove that he was sober , went to a local clinic and at TIME on DATE took an alcohol test . There were CARDINAL reports drawn up following the test , which came to opposite conclusions ; the disparity between the conclusions was explained by the different techniques that had been used .", "The company carried out an internal investigation into the incident of DATE and found no fault in the GPE conduct . The investigation report mentioned , inter alia , that the guards had not taken the applicant to a clinic for an alcohol test because of poor weather conditions .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG against the company , seeking ORG CARDINAL in compensation for the non - pecuniary damage allegedly caused to him by his unlawful detention on DATE .", "On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s claim , relying on essentially the same grounds as in its judgment of DATE ( see above ) . The court also noted that according to the statements of guards P. and ORG , the applicant had been released within TIME of his apprehension .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG , respectively , rejected appeals by the applicant and upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment .", "According to the applicant , the judges of the courts dealing with his complaints were biased and corrupt .", "Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , in force up to CARDINAL DATE , provided that non - pecuniary damage caused to a person or an organization was to be compensated by the person who had caused it unless the latter proved not to be responsible for the damage . Article CARDINAL provided that an employer was liable for harm caused by an employee , in the performance of his or her work duties , to a third person .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provided that unlawful deprivation of liberty or abduction of an individual were punishable by restriction of liberty or imprisonment for DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
