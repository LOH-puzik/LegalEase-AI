The judgment was upheld by a court of appeal and ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal in DATE . A subsequent request for the case to be re - opened was likewise refused .", "On DATE ORG of ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request that the enforcement of his sentence be postponed due to his illness .", "On DATE ORG voted to disqualify the applicant from sitting on the assembly on account of his having been sentenced to over six months\u2019 imprisonment . His appeal was refused by ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG on DATE . His further appeal to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) was apparently likewise refused .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the Chief Enforcement Officer ( kihlakunnanvouti , h\u00e4radsfogden ) of PERSON granted the applicant \u2019s further postponement request in order to enable him to organise certain private matters prior to serving his sentence .
