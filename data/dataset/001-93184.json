When deciding on the conformity of paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of Section CARDINAL of the LAW with , inter alia , LAW , the Constitutional Court provided the following interpretation of that provision . Since the phrases \u201c for the needs of society and the ORG \u201d and \u201c only in exceptional cases \u201d were concepts requiring assessment and concerned a fundamental constitutional right , the LAW stipulated that expropriation of property on such grounds could be carried out only on the basis of a law , thereby creating necessary legislative safeguards . The phrase \u201c on the basis of a law \u201d implied not a normative legal act which regulated the expropriation procedure in general , but a law pursuant to which the property in question was to be expropriated . Thus , a person \u2019s property could be expropriated and \u2013 in the absence of his consent \u2013 his ownership could be terminated by the ORG only through the adoption of a law in respect of the concrete immovable property , which would substantiate the exceptional importance and significance of the expropriation and which would indicate the needs of society and the ORG to be satisfied by the expropriation . The law would also oblige the Government to fix the amount of compensation , taking market prices into account , on the basis of a financial - economic assessment , the results of the negotiation between the ORG and the owner of the property subject to expropriation , and upon the owner \u2019s written consent .
