In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( rechtbank ) convicted the applicant of the transportation of QUANTITY grams of heroin and of CARDINAL counts of people trafficking ( mensensmokkel ) as defined in Article CARDINALa of LAW ( GPE ) , committed jointly with other perpetrators . It sentenced him to a partially suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( gerechtshof ) gave its judgment , upholding the conviction for the offence of transporting heroin and also of CARDINAL counts of people trafficking , and acquitting him on the CARDINAL other counts . It sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment less the time spent in pre - trial detention . Based on the evidence submitted , ORG found established that the applicant and his co - perpetrators had , for purposes of financial gain , DATE and DATE facilitated the unauthorised residence of a total of CARDINAL NORP migrants in the GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal in cassation ( cassatie ) , the scope of which is limited to procedural conformity and points of law , with ORG ( PERSON ) . In his written grounds of appeal of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant raised , inter alia , a complaint regarding the CARDINAL counts of people trafficking of which he had been convicted by ORG . The applicant contended that ORG had convicted him of facilitation of unauthorised \u201c residence \u201d , as defined in Article LAW , whereas the evidence relied on by ORG to uphold that conviction did not prove that the NORP migrants had had \u201c residence \u201d in the GPE , GPE or GPE . Instead , the evidence demonstrated that the applicant had organised and financed the NORP migrants\u2019 transportation to GPE via the GPE and GPE , which had been intercepted on each occasion in GPE . As the ORG stay in the GPE and GPE had only been brief and transitory , and given that they had never even entered GPE , there was , according to the applicant , no proof of \u201c residence \u201d in those countries . In that regard , the applicant referred to ORG law , namely ORG Directive CARDINAL of DATE defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry , transit and residence ( hereinafter \u201c the Directive \u201d ) and LAW of DATE on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry , transit and residence ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . Submitting that Article CARDINALa of the Criminal Code had been amended in order to implement the Directive , the applicant argued that the notion of the facilitation of unauthorised \u201c residence \u201d within the meaning of Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL should be understood as entailing a long - term stay , to be distinguished from \u201c transit \u201d or \u201c entry \u201d as defined in the first paragraph of Article PERSON , which had been added to Article PERSON when the Directive was implemented . The applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal in cassation did not include a request that ORG put a question to the ORG for the purpose of obtaining a preliminary ruling .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his advisory opinion of DATE , the Advocate General ( advocaat - generaal ) to ORG expressed his view that the applicant \u2019s appeal should be dismissed with the exception of the first of the grounds of the appeal , which pertained to the length of the proceedings : the duration of the cassation proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of LAW , for which a reduction of sentence was to be applied . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the evidence did not show that there had been any \u201c residence \u201d of the migrants in the countries at issue , ORG was of the opinion that Article LAW called for a broad interpretation of \u201c residence \u201d , as had been the case prior to the implementation of the Directive and LAW . Since that implementation was intended to broaden the scope of LANGUAGE of LAW , the second paragraph of that provision retained its broad meaning of \u201c residence \u201d , thereby encompassing \u201c transit \u201d . The separate penalisation in the first paragraph of Article PERSON of the facilitation of unauthorised \u201c transit and entry \u201d did not change the broad scope of paragraph CARDINAL . The Advocate General thus concluded that the applicant \u2019s complaint in this matter should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted written comments in reply to the Advocate General \u2019s advisory opinion ( a so - called \u201c PERSON letter \u201d ) in which he made a tentative request for questions to be referred to the ORG for a preliminary ruling about the interpretation of \u201c residence \u201d , \u201c entry \u201d and \u201c transit \u201d within the context of the Directive and whether the Directive contained minimum rules or constituted a general framework of terms , if ORG were to concur with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave its judgment , which read :", "\u201c [ the applicant \u2019s counsel ] have submitted written grounds of appeal . That document is annexed to this judgment , of which it is a component part .", "The Advocate General [ ... ] has advised that the impugned judgment be quashed \u2212 but only as regards the prison sentence imposed , reducing it due to the violation of the right to adjudication within a reasonable time \u2212 and that the remainder of the appeal be dismissed .", "Counsel [ for the applicant ] have submitted a written reply . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to hold that the applicant \u2019s complaint that the cassation proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention was well - founded and that the sentence imposed on the applicant should be reduced as a consequence thereof . ORG further considered :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Assessment of the remaining grievances", "The grievances can not lead to cassation [ of the impugned judgment ] ( de middelen kunnen niet to cassatie leiden ) . Based on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) , this requires no further reasoning as the grievances do not give rise to the need for a determination of legal issues in the interests of legal uniformity or legal development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG thus quashed ORG judgment as regards the imposed sentence , reduced the sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , and dismissed the remainder of the grounds of appeal . No further appeal lay against ORG judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
