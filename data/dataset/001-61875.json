On DATE ORG of GPE , in a judgment on an appeal on points of law , upheld the applicant 's conviction of DATE for illegal financial dealings but quashed his other convictions .

CARDINAL of DATE in ORG of GPE ( \u201c the PERSON High Court \u201d ) on the ground that it had been granted unlawfully . Execution of the pardon was therefore stayed in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ajarian High Court declared the pardon null and void on the ground that the statutory procedure that should have been followed before the President of GPE could exercise his right of pardon had not been complied with .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was quashed on DATE by ORG of GPE , which , in accordance with LAW which was then in force , remitted the case to ORG of ORG .", "In its submissions to that court , ORG again contended that the pardon contravened LAW of CARDINAL DATE establishing the rules governing the exercise by the President of GPE of his right of pardon , added to which the applicant had yet to make good the pecuniary damage the company had suffered .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant was charged with further criminal offences on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed ORG complaints as unfounded . It ruled that the procedural defects pleaded ( the failure to obtain the opinion of ORG and the applicant 's lack of remorse ) did not render the President 's order unlawful , as the right of pardon was an absolute constitutional right vested in the President of GPE . It said that , since the pardon granted to the applicant did not extend to the ancillary award of compensation for pecuniary damage , the company could bring further legal proceedings to enforce that award ; as to the remaining points , the company had no grounds for contesting the appropriateness of the pardon or the legality of the President 's order . ORG also noted that the company was not entitled in law to call for the reopening of the criminal proceedings against the applicant . It stated that it considered the applicant 's detention to be in violation of LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed an appeal on points of law by ORG as unfounded . It noted that the impugned decision to pardon the applicant had left intact both the applicant 's main sentence and the obligation to make good the pecuniary damage caused to the company . This was because DATE of the sentence had been unconditionally suspended , the sentence being commuted to CARDINAL of release on licence for the same period . ORG of GPE said that the sole effect of the presidential pardon had accordingly been to secure the applicant 's immediate release , while leaving intact the main and ancillary sentences . As to the President of GPE 's failure to follow the Rules on the Exercise of the Right of Pardon , ORG found that the decree of CARDINAL DATE contained the working rules and regulations of ORG and that failure to observe them could under no circumstances prevent the NORP President exercising his constitutional right of pardon .", "CARDINAL . Even after DATE the local authorities in GPE continued to hold the applicant in the short - term remand prison of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The question of the legality of the applicant 's pardon was referred by ORG on DATE to the investigation committee of ORG responsible for supervising the lawfulness of civil servants ' activities , which delivered its report on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE issued a decree amending the presidential decree of CARDINAL DATE establishing the Rules on the Exercise of the Right of Pardon . A new LAW vested the President of GPE with the power to pardon convicted persons , as defined by LAW , sub - paragraph DATE , of the LAW , without complying with the additional requirements set out in the decree beforehand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , a close relative of the applicant who had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment by ORG of GPE on DATE , gave an interview on a television channel broadcasting in GPE in which he affirmed that the applicant had been CARDINAL of his accomplices .", "CARDINAL . Following that interview the applicant , who had remained in custody after being pardoned by the President on DATE , was charged on DATE with being a member of a criminal association in DATE and with the attempted kidnapping of ORG , the head of the regional department of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody pending the investigation of the new charges . According to the applicant , the pre - trial investigation into the case ended on DATE and a CARDINAL - volume case file was compiled .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG decided to take no further action , finding that the applicant 's prosecution was not based on an arguable case and that all the circumstances and evidence relating to ORG 's murder had been examined by ORG of GPE in its unfettered discretion at Mr PERSON 's criminal trial in DATE . ORG took the view that , since the exhaustive examination of the file relating to ORG 's kidnapping and murder had not thrown up any evidence whatsoever that the applicant had been a member of the criminal association led by Mr PERSON , there were no grounds for charging him in connection with the same case DATE after the event .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that decision was set aside by ORG on an appeal by the civil party . Consequently , on DATE ORG of GPE ordered the criminal proceedings against the applicant to be reopened . It brought the pre - trial investigation to an end by an order dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was committed to stand trial in GPE , where he denied all guilt . He maintained that this second prosecution was the result of a conspiracy to frame him . He denied ever having had any links with Mr PERSON or his associates , who prior to their arrest had been living as outlaws in the PERSON forests . The applicant also said that he had at no stage hired them to kidnap PERSON , who had been killed by PERSON PERSON gang , and , contrary to what had been affirmed by the CARDINAL prosecution witnesses , kidnapping a ORG official would not have helped the applicant to consolidate his power as mayor of GPE . He asked the judges to find him innocent .", "CARDINAL . The Ajarian High Court found that , even though the applicant had denied helping to organise the kidnapping that had resulted in the victim 's murder , his guilt was established by the depositions of CARDINAL prosecution witnesses : Mr PERSON , the leader of the criminal gang , and CARDINAL gang members , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . On DATE all CARDINAL had been convicted with Mr PERSON , the applicant 's brother , of , inter alia , ORG 's murder .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant 's trial , a confrontation was arranged between Mr PERSON and the applicant , at which the former affirmed that the applicant had supplied him with funds and CARDINAL machine guns to carry out the kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that he did not know the applicant and had never met him . He explained that he had merely caught a glimpse of the applicant when accompanying Mr PERSON to a meeting with him and had heard him instruct Mr PERSON to kidnap V.G.", "CARDINAL . It appears from the judgment that Mr PERSON , the third witness , was unable to appear in court owing to illness and was heard by the judges in the office of the governor of the short - term remand prison of ORG . He stated that he did not know the applicant and had only seen him on television . It was through Mr PERSON that he had learnt that the applicant 's brother , Mr PERSON , had instructed their group to kill PERSON did not want to be involved in murder and had been to see the applicant , whom he was convinced was behind the plot . It was at that meeting that the applicant had told Mr PERSON that there was no need to eliminate V.G. , only to kidnap him . On DATE the CARDINAL members of the group had waylaid the victim in a street in GPE and , on attempting to abduct him in accordance with the applicant 's instructions , had killed him by accident .", "CARDINAL . The Ajarian High Court said that it was not just the CARDINAL witnesses ' depositions which confirmed the applicant 's guilt , but also the fact that they had been convicted by ORG of GPE on DATE . Without elaborating further on that point , ORG said in conclusion that , even if there was a close relation between the applicant 's case and that of Mr PERSON and his co - defendants , it constituted an independent criminal act involving participation in the activities of the criminal gang led by Mr PERSON and the organisation of ORG 's kidnapping . In its view , the applicant was directly accountable under the criminal law for his part in those events .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment to be served in a strict - regime prison .", "CARDINAL . The Ajarian High Court noted that since his arrest on DATE the applicant had remained in custody at all times and had not been released after being granted a presidential pardon on DATE . Accordingly , he was deemed to have begun his sentence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG of GPE . The central authorities made various attempts to secure his transfer from GPE to GPE for DATE of the hearing . The NORP Minister of ORG requested the PERSON authorities through the intermediary of the NORP Minister of ORG and ORG ( PERSON ) to arrange for the applicant 's transfer to the capital , but in vain .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE heard the appeal in the applicant 's absence ; it quashed the judgment of DATE and acquitted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . It said , inter alia :", "\u201c The preliminary investigation and judicial investigation in the present case were conducted in flagrant breach of the statutory rules . The criminal file does not contain incontrovertible evidence capable of supporting a guilty verdict ; the judgment is , moreover , self - contradictory and based on inconsistent conjecture and depositions from persons interested in the outcome of the proceedings that were obtained in breach of the procedural rules .", "The convicted person , PERSON , did not admit the offences of which he was accused either during the preliminary investigation or at trial . He said that he had been charged as a result of a conspiracy against him by persons with an interest in his obtaining an unfavourable outcome to the proceedings .", "ORG notes that there is no evidence in the file to refute his arguments . It has been established that Mr PERSON and Mr Tamaz PERSON [ the applicant 's brother ] were convicted on DATE and that Mr PERSON , who repeatedly said that his accomplice was Mr PERSON , had at no stage implicated Mr PERSON at the material time . It was only on DATE and DATE after the events \u2013 that , in an interview given to PERSON television , Mr PERSON accused Mr PERSON of having been his accomplice . In that interview , Mr PERSON also expressed indignation and outrage at Mr PERSON 's receipt of a presidential pardon and sought to denounce the authorities ' attempts to portray him as an ' innocent lamb ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the investigating bodies and the court that tried the case at first instance had not sought to establish why Mr PERSON had waited for so long before implicating the applicant and had not done so at his own trial . Instead , they had merely affirmed : \u201c Relations between Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were healthy and it is inconceivable that Mr PERSON 's belated allegations were made out of self - interest . \u201d In ORG view , however , the evidence in the case file suggested the contrary and \u201c preclude[d ] finding that Mr PERSON [ had ] no interest in making his allegations against the applicant or that they [ were ] founded and true \u201d . It noted that the applicant had said that relations between him and Mr PERSON had become strained as a result of a dispute over the sharing of a family tomb where their fathers were buried . Mr PERSON had not denied the existence of that dispute at a hearing on DATE . ORG accordingly found that Mr PERSON 's assertion that there was no ill - feeling between them in private did not reflect the truth .", "CARDINAL . It held that the applicant could not be found guilty on the sole basis of affirmations made by Mr PERSON DATE after the events in issue .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to note that , in addition to Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had also belatedly accused the applicant of participating in the activities of the criminal gang led by PERSON PERSON . They too had only implicated the applicant DATE after their trials . However , both men had said that they did not know the applicant and had only learnt of his involvement in the kidnapping through Mr PERSON himself . ORG ruled that in such circumstances Mr PERSON 's and Mr PERSON 's statements could not constitute true and incontrovertible evidence .", "CARDINAL . It was also noted that their assertions that the applicant had provided the gang with money and CARDINAL machine guns to kidnap PERSON were not corroborated .", "CARDINAL . After examining other evidence relied on by the court of first instance in the applicant 's case and comparing it with Mr PERSON 's depositions at his trial in DATE , ORG found :", "\u201c Both [ the applicant 's ] indictment and conviction rely solely on the depositions of persons who have a direct interest in the outcome of the proceedings against him and there is no other evidence of his guilt in the case file . The ORG must therefore find that Mr PERSON has not committed an offence under the criminal law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG found serious procedural defects in the criminal proceedings against the applicant . Among other matters , it noted that on DATE the investigating officer in charge of the case had rejected a request by the applicant for a confrontation with Mr PERSON regarding the kidnapping charge on the ground that it was unconnected with Mr PERSON 's case and intended only to delay the proceedings unnecessarily . In ORG view , the investigating bodies had failed to carry out a thorough investigation into the allegation that the applicant was implicated in the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted : \u201c According to the impugned judgment , despite its connection with the case of Mr PERSON and his co - defendants , the present case concerned an independent criminal act . However , it is stated elsewhere in the same judgment that , in addition to other evidence against him , Mr PERSON guilt was confirmed by the convictions of Mr PERSON and his co - defendants , which have become final . \u201d ORG added that , in making that affirmation , the trial court \u201c [ had ] not PERSON ] any explanation as to how Mr PERSON 's and his co - defendants ' convictions confirmed Mr PERSON guilt , since they [ had been ] convicted of the murder of an official , whereas Mr PERSON was accused of having organised his kidnapping \u201d . Thus , in ORG view , the trial court had not in fact decided whether the applicant 's case should be treated as part of Mr PERSON case or as an independent criminal act .", "ORG therefore found the applicant 's conviction unlawful on other grounds , pertaining to the classification in law of the acts concerned .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , it held :", "\u201c Mr PERSON conviction on DATE by ORG of GPE is quashed and the criminal proceedings against him discontinued , as his acts do not disclose any evidence of an offence .", "Mr PERSON shall be immediately released .", "This judgment is final and no appeal shall lie against it .", "Mr PERSON shall be informed that he has the right to bring proceedings for compensation for the damage caused by the illegal and unjustified acts of the bodies involved in his criminal case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG forwarded the short version of the judgment acquitting the applicant to the Minister of ORG , the director of the department responsible for the execution of sentences at ORG and the governor of the short - term remand prison of ORG for execution . He informed them that they would receive the reasoned version of the judgment subsequently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG sent them the reasoned version of the judgment acquitting the applicant for execution .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was never executed and the applicant remains in custody in the short - term remand prison of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's unlawful detention was denounced on a number of occasions by ORG of Georgia , ORG , ORG and ORG of ORG . They contacted the local authorities concerned in GPE , seeking his immediate release .", "CARDINAL . In letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , ORG Office of GPE informed the applicant 's wife as follows :", "\u201c ... [ I]n response to your letter , I wish to inform you that ORG Office of GPE is making every effort to secure compliance with the judgment of ORG of GPE dated DATE and to bring PERSON PERSON unlawful detention to an end . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the Vice - President of ORG of GPE informed the applicant 's wife that the operative provisions of the judgment of DATE acquitting her husband had been sent by facsimile transmission that day for execution to the NORP Minister of ORG , the director of the department responsible for the execution of sentences at ORG , the governor of the short - term remand prison of ORG and the governor of the long - term remand prison of ORG . He added that the reasoned judgment had been sent to them under cover of a letter of CARDINAL DATE . The Vice - President also said in his letter that on DATE ORG of GPE had received an acknowledgment of receipt slip signed by the governor of the short - term remand prison of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote directly to Mr PERSON , the Head of GPE :", "\u201c ... Your authorities have not yet responded to my recommendation of DATE , even though Mr PERSON remains in ORG prison in flagrant breach of the law . ... Under LAW , it is both an administrative and a criminal offence not to comply with ORG recommendations if ORG is thereby obstructed in the course of his or her duties . ... I would therefore ask you to comply with my lawful demands as Public Defender and to hold both the governor of the short - term remand prison of ORG and the Minister himself accountable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of ORG wrote to ORG of GPE in the following terms :", "\u201c ... In a decision of DATE , ORG of GPE acquitted PERSON PERSON . However , he continues to serve his sentence in a cell at the short - term remand prison of ORG of GPE . ... This constitutes a serious violation of ... LAW . ... I would therefore ask you to take the necessary measures to prosecute those responsible for failing to comply with the aforementioned judicial decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the director of the department responsible for the execution of sentences at ORG advised the applicant 's wife that her husband was fully entitled to lodge an application against ORG with ORG . He stated in his letter : \u201c We consider that the authorities of GPE are acting in flagrant breach of the law and of human rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The central authority 's efforts to secure the applicant 's release were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE the NORP courts martial prosecuting authority ordered certain officials from ORG suspected of failing to execute the judgment of DATE acquitting the applicant to be charged with offences , in accordance with LAW . The police are trying to trace those concerned .", "DATE . In a letter of DATE , the applicant 's son informed the ORG that his father 's health had deteriorated . According to a medical certificate dated DATE , the applicant was suffering from gastritis , cardiac insufficiency and gastro - oesophageal reflux . As this was causing him severe dietary problems , he required appropriate medical attention as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government produced to the ORG a letter of DATE from Mr PERSON to Mr PERSON , Head of GPE , in which he stated :", "\u201c You are a man with the ORG 's interests at heart and I believe that I can count on your understanding in this situation . ... As you are aware , the ORG [ in GPE ] is very shortly due to decide whether to hold a hearing on the merits in the PERSON case . The family is seeking MONEY in compensation . It is almost self - evident that GPE will lose this case and that our ORG will be heavily condemned . There is a solution to this problem . Were PERSON to be released , his family would agree to withdraw the application .", "I am sure that you will play a part in taking the only decision that is just , that which is in GPE 's interests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Ajarian High Court sent a reply to the NORP President . He began by accusing the Head of ORG of harbouring persons of PERSON extraction who had fled PERSON to take refuge in GPE after attempting to organise terrorist attacks on the Head of GPE . He then drew the President 's attention to the parliamentary committee 's report ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) , which highlighted numerous irregularities in the proceedings that had led to the applicant 's pardon and acquittal . Relying on the parliamentary committee 's findings and LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW , the President of the Ajarian High Court suggested to the President of GPE that the applicant 's trial should be reopened so that his case could be reconsidered in the light of the matters set out in the report .", "CARDINAL . He also said in his letter that the applicant 's application to ORG constituted an abuse of his right of application within the meaning of LAW of the LAW and that he had been aided in that task by ORG of GPE , ORG , ORG of GPE and ORG . He added that , as the parliamentary committee was a national authority within the meaning of LAW , the applicant could not be regarded as having exhausted domestic remedies before DATE , the date of the committee 's report . Drawing the NORP President 's attention to this point , he said that ORG had misled ORG in its observations .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the Government informed the ORG that on DATE the investigation committee of ORG responsible for supervising the lawfulness of civil servants ' activities had been requested by ORG to launch an inquiry into the circumstances in which a presidential pardon had been granted in the PERSON case . The committee , which was composed of members of parliament assisted by university lecturers and practising lawyers , produced its report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although its terms of reference were confined to issues relating to the presidential pardon , the committee also decided to examine the circumstances in which the applicant had been prosecuted and acquitted in the second set of proceedings . In the introduction to its report , the committee explained its reasons for so extending its terms of reference . In particular , it stated : \u201c [ T]he presidential pardon did not constitute an isolated act or separate procedure ; in the present case , there was a close relation between all the proceedings and , in order to provide an overall view of the issues , it was considered appropriate to examine the chronology of the various sets of criminal proceedings brought against the applicant , the conduct of those proceedings and the merits of the decisions that were taken . \u201d There were thus CARDINAL separate parts to the report : CARDINAL on the legality of the presidential pardon and the other on the decisions of the domestic courts in the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the question of measures that needed implementing in the prison system . On a proposal by the NORP President , it was decided that he would exercise his right of pardon . The prison authorities were asked to study the cases of convicted prisoners in their custody and to submit to the President any requests for a pardon , together with the files and assessments of the prisoners concerned . Requests for a pardon had to be made in these terms :", "\u201c Dear President , I repent of the crime I have committed and ask you to remit the remainder of my sentence . \u201d", "Requests made in the prescribed terms were examined and the President exercised his right of pardon in a number of cases .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parliamentary committee established that on DATE the applicant had sent a letter to the NORP President asking for the remainder of his sentence to be remitted . Since he had not made his request in the terms referred to above , the committee considered that his pardon did not satisfy the regulatory requirements in force and was therefore invalid . It also noted a number of other failings : \u201c the [ applicant 's ] file \u201d had not been submitted to ORG appointed by the NORP President , the applicant 's name was not on the combined list of convicted persons seeking a pardon that was submitted to the President by the PERSON authorities concerned and no appraisal of the applicant had been furnished by the PERSON prison authorities in support of his request .", "DATE . The committee established that , in breach of the rules in force , the Vice - President of ORG , CARDINAL of the NORP President 's aides , had prepared and submitted to the President a recommendation for the applicant to be pardoned solely on the strength of the applicant 's letter of DATE . The committee said that that request should have been referred to a court under the rules of criminal procedure and not to the President of GPE as a request for a pardon .", "CARDINAL . According to the committee , even assuming that the NORP President had been entitled to grant the applicant a pardon without first complying with the statutory rule requiring requests for pardons to be examined by the competent board in the first instance , the decision had been taken shortly before the general election of DATE and was manifestly influenced by political considerations .", "CARDINAL . The committee considered that the reasons given by ORG and ORG of GPE in their judgments of DATE and DATE respectively did not comply with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , which provide an exhaustive list of the grounds on which administrative acts may be declared null and void . Indeed , their effect was to render LAW , which guaranteed everyone the right to apply to a court to protect his or her rights , meaningless .", "CARDINAL . It noted that under domestic law a presidential pardon was an administrative act for which judicial review lay in the administrative courts . As the applicant 's presidential pardon had been challenged in the courts , it had not become enforceable until DATE , the date of ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The committee criticised the reason advanced by ORG on DATE for dismissing ORG application for judicial review . In particular , it considered that ORG had ruled on matters beyond the scope of the application , as the company had not sought an order reopening the criminal proceedings against the applicant . ORG should not , therefore , have ruled on the lawfulness of the applicant 's continued detention . Since those CARDINAL issues were within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts , not the administrative courts , the committee considered that ORG should have restricted its review to the legality of the contested presidential act .", "CARDINAL . NORP The committee further noted that the presidential pardon concerned only the prison sentence and not the applicant 's duty to pay ORG compensation for the pecuniary damage caused . ORG should , therefore , also have examined the effects of the presidential pardon on that ancillary punishment .", "CARDINAL . According to the committee , the second set of proceedings in which the applicant was acquitted was , like the first , tainted by various procedural defects at both the investigation and trial stages . In addition , the trial courts 's view , those circumstances should have been \u201c treated as evidence by the courts and examined with a view to establishing the truth \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In order to illustrate this point , the committee conducted a detailed examination of various items of evidence and statements obtained in the criminal proceedings against Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and CARDINAL co - defendants , who had been convicted , inter alia , of the murder of ORG official concerned ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . above ) .", "CARDINAL . The committee thus established that at the trial in ORG of GPE in DATE Mr PERSON and Mr Shotadze had \u201c sought to identify \u201d the applicant as CARDINAL of the organisers of the attack on Mr PERSON , the Head of GPE . In its view , instead of \u201c ignoring Mr PERSON 's and Mr PERSON attempts to implicate the applicant in serious offences \u201d , the judges of ORG of GPE who heard the applicant 's appeal on points of law should have brought \u201c new criminal proceedings against [ the applicant ] in accordance with LAW in force at the material time \u201d , that is to say , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The committee considered that , in order to clarify certain details vital to the truth , ORG of GPE should have heard evidence not only from the witnesses who were called , but also from Mr PERSON , who should have been questioned about his informal meeting with the judge who heard his case in DATE , and the judge himself . It should have sought to establish by whom and in what circumstances that meeting \u2013 at which Mr PERSON had accused the applicant off the record of taking part in his group 's activities \u2013 had been recorded , and why the judge concerned had not mentioned it in his judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The committee criticised ORG for not hearing evidence from CARDINAL other people who had also been implicated by Mr PERSON , and the applicant 's son . It considered that ORG judges who heard the applicant 's case should have ordered expert evidence to be obtained to establish when , by whom and how the weapons , the military munitions and technical equipment seized in Mr PERSON 's case in DATE had been purchased . Nor had they sought to ascertain why the prosecutor in the applicant 's case had declined to make an order joining his case with Mr PERSON 's .", "CARDINAL . The committee found , lastly , that ORG of GPE had \u201c failed to remit the applicant 's case to the investigating bodies for further investigation \u201d and should not have taken \u201c a decision to acquit that was illegal , unfair and based on insufficiently investigated facts \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the committee 's view , \u201c the new circumstances revealed in its examination of the case for the purposes of the parliamentary report warranted investigation and analysis \u201d . That proved that \u201c the statutory remedies designed to elicit the truth [ had ] not yet been exhausted \u201d . Referring to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( g ) and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , it suggested that the applicant 's trial should be reopened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE refused a request by the civil party for the applicant 's case to be reopened and re - examined in the light of the parliamentary committee 's findings . It found , inter alia , that the findings did not constitute new circumstances that could warrant a reopening of the applicant 's case . In the absence of new circumstances , a judgment of ORG , which was final and could not be appealed against , could not be challenged under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of GPE submitted to the NORP President his observations on the findings in the parliamentary committee 's report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . He described the report as \u201c tendentious \u201d , \u201c biased \u201d , \u201c unconstitutional \u201d and \u201c erroneous \u201d . He noted , firstly , that the parliamentary committee had acted far outside the scope of its terms of reference and , instead of examining the circumstances in which the applicant had received a presidential pardon , had decided to review a judgment of the highest court of the land . In so doing , the committee had , in his view , contravened the fundamental constitutional rule requiring the separation of powers . The report undermined the notions of democracy and the rule of law . The President of ORG said that under LAW no one had the right to demand an explanation from a judge about a case . Criticism by a parliamentary committee of a final judicial decision against which no appeal lay served only to hinder execution of the decision and to discredit the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . As regards the committee 's findings on the subject of the presidential pardon , the President of ORG of GPE noted , firstly , that the right conferred by LAW on the NORP President to grant a pardon was absolute and unconditional and could be exercised independently of the regulations laying down the principles on which requests for a pardon were to be examined by ORG . He further noted that in many countries there was no right of appeal against a pardon , which constituted the ultimate act of humanity . The fact that the applicant 's request for a pardon had not been examined beforehand by ORG could not render the pardon illegal , especially as , in the applicant 's case , obtaining his file and details from the PERSON prison authorities had been no easy task . The President of ORG of GPE also pointed out that , in the instant case , the grant of a pardon also represented an attempt at restoring justice to a convicted prisoner who had been held for DATE in an unlawful place of detention .", "CARDINAL . He added that the section of the report on ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE declaring the presidential pardon null and void for procedural defects was entirely erroneous . He pointed out that on DATE LAW had yet to come into force and that , in accordance with LAW the statutory provision applicable to contested administrative cases at the time \u2013 ORG had exclusive territorial jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review of presidential acts . The President of ORG of GPE said that it was regrettable that the committee had omitted to mention that the Ajarian High Court had on DATE , in breach of the law then in force , assumed jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial review of a pardon granted by the President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his observations , the President of ORG of GPE noted that , in describing the judgment acquitting the applicant as biased , incomplete and illegal , the parliamentary committee had at no point mentioned the question of the applicant 's interests or his unlawful detention .
