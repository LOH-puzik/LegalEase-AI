The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , while criminal proceedings were pending against a certain Mr GPE , the latter sold a lorry ( \u201c the lorry \u201d ) to a company , M.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Trial Court \u201d ) convicted PERSON of smuggling QUANTITY of sugar , which he had transported in the lorry in DATE . According to the Government , the court dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s application to have the lorry confiscated , given that Mr GPE had stated that he had already sold it . The court considered that the conditions for confiscation of the lorry under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had not been fulfilled : specifically it had not been established that the lorry could be used again to commit an offence ; that the confiscation had been necessary for the protection of safety or for reasons of ethics ; and that the lorry had been specially adjusted for the commission of specific type of offences . On DATE , following separate appeals by ORG and the public prosecutor , ORG found the public prosecutor \u2019s application immaterial ( \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430 ) and quashed all aspects of this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted PERSON in absentia . It fined him and ordered , under LAW , the confiscation of the lorry and the sugar ( \u201c the confiscation order \u201d ) . In the absence of an appeal , the judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company ORG sold the lorry to the applicant , who later registered the lorry in his name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) enforced the confiscation order of CARDINAL DATE against the applicant and issued a record of enforcement ( \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant objected to the enforcement of the confiscation order , arguing that Mr I.A. had died on DATE and that the confiscation order accordingly could not be enforced . There had been no injunction restricting the sale of the lorry . He had been the lawful owner and he had been making his living using the lorry . Lastly , he stated that he had sought , in separate civil proceedings , return of the lorry ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the execution - of - sanctions judge of ORG rejected the objection as inadmissible , finding that the applicant had no procedural standing . It found that the confiscation order had been enforced in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further found that the applicant , as the third person from whom the lorry had been confiscated , could assume his rights under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG dismissed his appeal reiterating that he had no right to object to the enforcement of the confiscation order . However , he had been entitled to claim , in civil proceedings , return of the lorry . Civil courts had jurisdiction , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , to reverse a final confiscation order issued in criminal proceedings and order the return of the confiscated item .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a civil claim seeking that the first - instance court declare him to be the owner of the lorry and to order the ORG to restore it to his possession . In the case of failure of his first claim , he sought that the ORG would reimburse him for the upgrades made to the lorry . In this latter context , he identified the upgrades that he had installed in the lorry . He further maintained that he was the bona fide and lawful owner of the lorry . He argued that the authorities had failed to seize the lorry immediately after the offence had been committed ( \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e ) and to note a ban on the sale of the lorry on its registration certificate . As he was making his living off the lorry , he requested an injunction restricting the ORG from selling or otherwise disposing of the lorry until the final resolution of the dispute .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of DATE and DATE respectively , the first - instance court and ORG ( \u201c the second - instance court \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for an injunction finding no evidence that in the absence of such a measure his claim would be considerably affected or that he would sustain irreparable damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the first - instance court that Mr GPE had died in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It established that Mr GPE , who knew that the lorry could have been confiscated , had sold it to the company QUANTITY At the relevant time , neither the manager of PERSON nor the applicant had known that the lorry had been used in the commission of the offence and that it had been subject to a confiscation order . Relying on Articles DATE and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , the court stated that :", "\u201c Confiscation is a safety measure , the typical aim of which is to remove conditions which are convenient for the commission of offences , and it is a condition for ordering such a measure that the offender has been sentenced , as in the present case . The court considers that it is mandatory to confiscate the [ lorry ] under the afore - mentioned provisions , because this safety measure has a wider influence [ in the sense of ] general deterrence of all future offenders of this type of offences , and otherwise the offenders would be encouraged , after the offence has been committed , to dispose of the means with which they committed the offence and , thus , to even acquire pecuniary benefit ; furthermore that would have a negative influence on the ethics of the wider public , [ that is to say ] on general deterrence ...", "... Given that from the evidence and the above - mentioned statutory provisions it has been established that the [ lorry ] in question was confiscated in favour of [ the respondent ORG ] in lawful proceedings , the court finds that the [ respondent ORG ] has therein obtained ownership of the [ lorry ] in question on the basis of a final and enforceable judgment ... in accordance with sections DATE ) and CARDINAL of the [ Property Act . ]", "For these reasons , the court dismisses the [ applicant \u2019s ] main claim and also the alternative claim , because it concerns upgrades made to the [ lorry ] .", "On the other hand , the court considers that the [ applicant ] , as the bona fide owner , can be indemnified for the value of the entire [ lorry ] , including the upgrades , but solely from the offender , [ Mr GPE ] , in accordance with LAW ] , and not from the [ respondent ORG ] ...", "The court dismisses as groundless the argument that at the moment of confiscation of the [ lorry ] in question it was not owned by [ Mr GPE ] but by the [ applicant ] as the bona fide possessor ( \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b ) , given that from the evidence it was established that when the offence was committed the [ lorry ] was owned by [ Mr GPE ] and the safety measure confiscation of the [ lorry ] was issued on those grounds . The court also considers groundless the [ applicant \u2019s ] representative \u2019s arguments that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the final decision for confiscation of the [ lorry ] could be amended with a decision in civil proceedings if there were a dispute concerning the ownership of the confiscated items , given that this provision would have been applied if the [ lorry ] had been sold to the [ applicant ] before the offence was committed and had , under any legal basis , remained in the factual possession of the convicted [ Mr GPE ] and he , after having sold it , committed the crime ; but in the present case it is vice versa ; firstly the offence was committed and then the [ lorry ] was sold . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also established that the applicant had upgraded the lorry to the value of MONEY ( MKD ) . Furthermore , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s and CARDINAL witnesses\u2019 statements , the court established that the applicant had bought the lorry for QUANTITY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He stated that he had previously requested that the first - instance court obtain evidence from ORG which would confirm that Mr I.A. had died in GPE in DATE . He argued that the domestic authorities had failed to ban Mr GPE from disposing of the lorry or to seize the lorry at the time the offence had been discovered . He also argued that he was the bona fide owner and that he had obtained title to the lorry by adverse possession ( \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0448\u043a\u0430 ) . The first - instance court had incorrectly applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The lorry had been confiscated DATE after the offence had been committed . The ORG had been unlawfully enriched by the value of the upgrades installed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the second - instance court \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and reasons given by the lower court . On DATE this judgment was served on the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
