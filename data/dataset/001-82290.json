The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Brzeg ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) issued a \u201c wanted \u201d notice in respect of the applicant and several other men in connection with an investigation into allegations made by CARDINAL women , some of whom were minors , that a group of several men had raped them , threatened them , beaten them and forced them to take drugs . The warrant for arrest was issued after the prosecution service had established that the applicant had gone into hiding and the police had unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police attempted to arrest the applicant . However he managed to escape trying in the process to run over police officers while driving away . CARDINAL other men sought under the arrest warrant issued in connection with the same investigation were apprehended and arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police . At the time of arrest he was in possession of a firearm and a forged identification document . On CARDINAL DATE the Opole ORG ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the following offences : repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty while acting in an organised criminal gang ; leading an organised gang ; supplying minor victims with drugs ; forging an identification document ; and destroying a police car . The court also found that , given that he had absconded in the past , there was a risk that the applicant might go into hiding again and try to influence the victims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision ordering his detention on remand but his appeal was dismissed on DATE by the Opole ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention relying on the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences and on the complexity of the investigation which had not yet been terminated by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court decided that the applicant 's detention should be prolonged . It considered that , in addition to the strong suspicion against the applicant , the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the risk of his tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses justified holding him in custody . In addition , the court relied on the risk that , given that he had absconded in the past , he might go into hiding again . The court also observed that only detention on remand would secure the applicant 's appearance at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before the Opole ORG . It appears that the first hearing was held on DATE . In DATE the trial court held in total CARDINAL hearings .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG allowed the application and prolonged his pretrial detention . ORG based its decision on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences and on the risk that he might interfere with the course of justice . The court further considered that the complexity of the case constituted a special circumstance justifying his remaining in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided to prolong the pre - trial detention of the applicant , finding that the initial reasons for the detention were still valid . Furthermore , the court examined the course of the proceedings before the Opole ORG and agreed that the case was particularly complex and time - consuming , given the number of accused and the considerable amount of evidence which had to be examined . It considered that the trial court had acted diligently as it had taken evidence from CARDINAL witnesses during the last QUANTITY hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the trial court again applied to prolong the applicant 's detention . On DATE ORG granted the application . However , it criticised ORG for the delay in the case and requested the trial court \u201c to take adequate and more intensive action to finish the trial \u201d . The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time - limits for filing new submissions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . The Opole Regional Court held CARDINAL hearings in DATE and CARDINAL hearings in DATE . On DATE the ORG gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang . The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document . The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The applicant and other coaccused appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment . It amended the first - instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to DATE . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL .
