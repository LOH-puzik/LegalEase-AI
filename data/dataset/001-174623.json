NORP In disputes between the applicants and the domestic pension authorities , the firstinstance courts ruled in their favour , ordering increases of their pensions based on the rise in the average wages in the country since their retirement .", "CARDINAL . The defendant authorities appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , when an appeal arrived at ORG , a judge rapporteur of that court , if he or she believed that it complied with the necessary formal requirements , had to issue a ruling opening appeal proceedings ( \u201c the ruling \u201d ) and send it to the applicants together with a copy of the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The Government and the applicants disagree as to whether those documents were actually sent to the applicants ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On various dates set out in the Appendix , ORG quashed the judgments in the ORG favour , dismissing their claims for pension increases holding that the domestic law did not require the pensions to be increased in case of rise in the average wages in the country following retirement . In the fifth applicant \u2019s case ORG held a hearing in his presence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the other applicants\u2019 cases the court sat in camera without summoning the parties .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicants , the domestic courts did not send them either ( i ) a copy of the GPE appeals or ( ii ) a copy of the rulings opening appeal proceedings in their cases . They therefore had no knowledge of the appeal proceedings prior to ORG decisions in their cases . They learned of those decisions later , notably after their pensions had been reduced based on ORG decisions .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicants were duly informed of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . It can be seen from the material before the ORG that :", "CARDINAL .
