Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first and second applicants , ORG and ORG , used to have as their principal business the purchase and development of land . The first of these companies , which was a wholly - owned subsidiary of the second , was struck off the register of companies on DATE and dissolved on DATE , for failure to file DATE returns for DATE . Since DATE ORG too has filed no DATE returns ; on DATE and CARDINAL DATE a receiver to this company was appointed by CARDINAL secured creditors . The third applicant , Mr PERSON , is the managing director of ORG and its sole beneficial shareholder ; on DATE , by order of an NORP court , he was adjudged bankrupt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had agreed to purchase for ORG \u00a3 QUANTITY of land at GPE . It did so in reliance on an outline planning permission ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for industrial warehouse and office development on the site . This permission , which was recorded in the official planning register ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had been granted on DATE by the Minister for ORG to the then owner , Mr PERSON , on his appeal against the refusal , on DATE , by the planning authority ( ORG ) of full planning permission . CARDINAL of the grounds for that refusal was that the site was in an area zoned for the further development of agriculture so as to preserve a green belt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the detailed planning approval ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for which LOC had applied on DATE in reliance on the outline permission . ORG thereupon sought a conditional order of mandamus , directing the council to grant such approval ; such an order was granted on DATE and was made absolute by ORG by a decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sold the land to ORG for IR \u00a3 MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on appeal by ORG against ORG decision , ORG held that the grant of outline planning permission had been ultra vires and was therefore a nullity . It found that the relevant statutory provision ( section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) did not empower the Minister for ORG to make , on an appeal against a refusal by a planning authority , a decision which - as in the present case - contravened the development plan ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of this decision the land could not be developed and its value was therefore substantially reduced . In DATE it was sold in the open market by the receiver of ORG for IR \u00a3 MONEY .", "CARDINAL . With a view to validating planning permissions and approvals the validity of which came into question as a result of ORG decision , ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) was enacted . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) A permission or approval granted on appeal ... prior to DATE , shall not be , and shall not be regarded as ever having been , invalid by reason only of the fact that the development concerned contravened , or would contravene , materially the development plan relating to the area of the planning authority to whose decision the appeal related .", "( CARDINAL ) If , because of any or all of its provisions , subsection ( CARDINAL ) of this section would , but for this subsection , conflict with a constitutional right of any person , the provisions of that subsection shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that they do not so conflict but shall be otherwise of full force and effect . \"", "The date of DATE was that of the establishment of ORG ( An ORG ) , to which body the appeal functions formerly entrusted to the Minister for ORG had been transferred by ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW also dealt , in section CARDINAL , with the duration of the validity of certain permissions . Its effect was that CARDINAL granted on DATE , as was the outline permission in the present case , expired on DATE . Under section CARDINAL , however , the planning authority could extend the period of validity of a permission provided , inter alia , that substantial works had already been carried out before it expired .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the debate on LAW before PERSON ( ORG of ORG ) the Minister of ORG at ORG was asked the following question :", "\" I understand that certain planning permissions were declared to be null and void by ORG . I agree the law has to be put right , but who is going to declare under subsection ( CARDINAL ) whether a person \u2019s constitutional rights are going to be interfered with ? Does it mean another trip to ORG ? What is the position ? The Minister might tell us exactly what is in his mind . \"", "The Minister replied :", "\" It would be agreed by the court . Subsection ( CARDINAL ) has been included by the parliamentary draftsman , with the agreement of the Attorney General , so as to preserve the rights of parties to any proceedings now before the courts and to assure that no court is deprived of jurisdiction regarding an issue raised in such proceedings . This subsection is also designed to meet the case of any unconstitutional interference with a property right . \" ( Official report of ORG PERSON for DATE , columns DATE )", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE LOC applied to ORG for planning approval ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the basis of the outline permission granted in DATE ; its application contained no reference to LAW . Approval was refused on DATE on the ground that ORG had held in the first LOC case that the outline permission was not valid and on CARDINAL other grounds related to technical planning matters . No appeal was made to ORG against this decision nor was it the subject of any other legal challenge ; the applicants claimed that an appeal would have been to no avail since ORG had to confine itself to matters of proper planning and development ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and could not give an authoritative interpretation of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the ORG \u2019s decision , the applicants set in motion the second LOC case ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . Whilst it was pending , the following steps were taken on their behalf .", "First , on DATE their architect wrote to ORG asserting that LOC was excluded from the benefit of section DATE ) of LAW and asking that the applicants\u2019 position be reconsidered in the light of \" the injustice of the situation \" . The ORG replied on DATE , regretting that it could not be of assistance .", "Secondly , on DATE the ORG solicitors wrote to ORG , requesting it to deal with the outstanding appeal which had originally been dealt with by the Minister for ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in a manner subsequently found invalid . ORG replied on DATE that the appeal in question \" does not remain to be determined by ORG \" . The solicitors asked ORG to indicate the reasons for this decision , but its reply of CARDINAL DATE was confined to saying that the legal advice it had received was confidential and that it could not assist any further than by stating its position .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC brought proceedings - in which ORG and PERSON were joined as plaintiffs on DATE - against the Minister for ORG ( as the successor to the Minister for ORG ) , seeking damages for breach of statutory duty , for negligent misrepresentation and for negligence . The plaintiffs later amended their pleadings to include a claim for damages against the State for breach of their constitutional rights of property .", "With the consent of the parties ORG directed on DATE that the question whether the plaintiffs had a cause of action be tried as a preliminary issue and that the following points of law fell to be determined in this connection :", "( a ) whether an action in damages for", "( i ) breach of statutory duty ;", "( ii ) negligence ; and/or", "( iii ) negligent misrepresentation", "lay at the suit of the plaintiffs against the Minister for the Environment for granting on legal advice the outline planning permission to Mr PERSON ;", "( b ) whether in the circumstances pleaded the ORG", "( i ) had failed to vindicate the property rights of the plaintiffs and , if so , whether an action for damages lay against it ;", "( ii ) had in its laws respected and as far as practicable by its laws defended and vindicated the property rights of the plaintiffs and , if it had not , whether an action for damages lay against it .", "On DATE ORG held that no cause of action lay , whereupon the plaintiffs appealed to ORG . On DATE they entered into an agreement amongst themselves in which ORG and ORG assigned to PERSON , on his undertaking to pay the costs , their entire interest in the proceedings and acknowledged that any benefit resulting therefrom would accrue to him free of any claim by them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG unanimously dismissed the appeal ( [ DATE ] Irish Law Reports Monthly , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In rejecting the claim for damages based on breach of statutory duty , Mr Justice PERSON ( with whose judgment Mr ORG agreed and Mr Justice PERSON concurred ) found that the Minister \u2019s decision to grant outline planning permission contravening the development plan did not fall into any of the categories of ultra vires decisions that would found an action for damages ; in particular , there was no evidence that he had been aware that he did not possess the power he was purporting to exercise .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON based his dismissal of the claims for alleged negligence and negligent misrepresentation essentially on the ground that , when granting the permission , the Minister had acted bona fide and in accordance with the advice he had obtained from his department \u2019s legal advisers .", "CARDINAL . As regards the claim for damages for breach of the GPE constitutional rights of property , Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\" With regard to this submission the first enquiry must , it seems to me , be as to whether there has been an unjust attack on the GPE property rights or whether an injustice has been done to them .", "What the Minister was doing in making his decision in DATE to grant outline planning permission to the then owner of these lands was not intended as any form of delimitation or invasion of the rights of the owner of those lands but was rather intended as an enlargement and enhancement of those rights .", "The purchase of land for development purposes is manifestly a major example of a speculative or risky commercial enterprise . Changes in market values or economic forces , changes in decisions of planning authorities and the rescission of them , and many other factors , indeed , may make the land more or less valuable in the hands of its purchasers .", "I am prepared to accept that prima facie in this instance the fact that the Minister \u2019s decision was ultimately found by this ORG to have been a nullity , probably contributed towards a diminution in the value of the land in the GPE hands . That fact , itself , however , does not , in my view , necessarily mean that an injustice was done to the plaintiffs and I am certain that that does not constitute an unjust attack on the LOC property rights .", "The obligation of the ORG in Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINALo and LAW [ of LAW ] is in the first instance , as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen and , in the second instance , to protect as best it may from unjust attack , and in the case of injustice done , vindicate the property rights of every citizen . In its decision in the case of PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] Irish Reports CARDINAL , this ORG in its judgment delivered by O\u2019Higgins CJ , stated as follows :", "\u2018 It is noted that the guarantee of protection given by LAW is qualified by the words \" as best may be \" . This implies circumstances in which the ORG may have to balance its protection of the right as against other obligations arising from regard for the common ORG", "I am satisfied that it would be reasonable to regard as a requirement of the common good an immunity to persons in whom are vested statutory powers of decision from claims for compensation where they act without negligence and bona fide . Such an immunity would contribute to the efficient and decisive exercise of such statutory powers and would , it seems to me , tend to avoid indecisiveness and delay , which might otherwise be involved .", "I am , therefore , satisfied that there can not be , on the facts of this case , any question of there being a clearcut obligation imposed on the ORG to provide compensation for the plaintiffs in the circumstances which have arisen . I am , therefore , satisfied that the submissions made with regard to a claim for damages for breach of constitutional rights must also fail . It is not necessary for me to decide , and I express no opinion , on the question as to whether an action does lie for failure on the part of the ORG to legislate in protection of personal rights , as distinct from the action to set aside or invalidate legislation which fails adequately to protect or vindicate them . \"", "CARDINAL . In their judgments some members of ORG addressed the question whether the retrospective validation of planning permissions effected by section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) covered the outline permission granted to Mr GPE in DATE . This question was not expressly mentioned in the agreed points of law to be determined ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , nor did the pleadings in the case make it a contentious issue : the GPE plea in their statement of claim that they could not \" by operation of law avail of the retrospective validity afforded by the provisions \" of that section was not denied by the ORG in its defence .", "Mr Justice PERSON stated that LAW contained a \" saver for cases involving constitutional rights of other persons , which would appear to exclude the plaintiffs from the benefit of such retrospective validation \" .", "Mr Justice PERSON ( with whom Mr Justice PERSON agreed ) said that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act effected a retrospective validation , save where it \" would conflict with a constitutional right of any person . This meant that LOC were excluded from the benefit of the section , for they had exercised their constitutional right to litigate the validity of the planning permission in the FAC \" .", "Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\" No doubt it was apprehended that s. DATE ) of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] might operate to reverse retrospectively this ORG \u2019s decision [ in the first LOC case ] and that this might constitute an unwarrantable interference by the legislature in a decision of the courts . It seems probable that it was in these cicumstances that s. CARDINAL ) was enacted with a view to avoiding such interference . And this subsection has been accepted by counsel for both sides in the present case as excluding the appellants from the benefit of s. CARDINAL ) . \"", "CARDINAL . Certain views were also expressed as to the effects of the GPE being excluded from the benefit of the retrospective validation .", "Mr Justice PERSON said :", "\" [ The ] exclusion has been attacked by counsel for ORG as being unfairly discriminatory as far as they are concerned , but in my view , while a discrimination has resulted , the primary and overriding purpose of the section was to avoid an unconstitutional invasion of the judicial domain by attempting to give validity to any planning permission which the ORG may have held to be lacking in validity . It would follow that no injustice has been done to LOC by s. CARDINAL of LAW . \"", "Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\" ... the appellants contend that to exclude them from the benefit of s. DATE ) constitutes ( a ) an unjust attack on their property rights or an injustice done which affects their property rights and ( b ) discriminates unfairly as between them and other persons who had received permissions or approvals of the Minister on appeal under Part IV of the DATE LAW and who were given the benefit of s. DATE ) . In regard to the first contention it seems to me that s. CARDINAL ) was included by the ORG for the purpose of respecting and not interfering with the determination by the courts of the justiciable controversy which constituted the proceedings in [ the first LOC case ] and of respecting the constitutional rights of the parties , both plaintiffs and defendants in that action , to have their controversy determined by the courts rather than by the ORG . It may be that there is to some extent a conflict here between the right of the parties to have their controversy judicially determined by the courts and the present appellants\u2019 property interest . That fact in itself , however , does not in my view , necessarily mean that an injustice was done to the appellants and I am satisfied that it does not constitute an unjust attack on the appellants\u2019 property rights or an unlawful discrimination against them .", "Those persons ( such as the appellants ) who were excluded from the benefits of s. DATE ) by s. CARDINAL ) and the other recipients of planning approval or permission on appeal from the Minister who benefited from s. CARDINAL ) and fall outside the ambit of s. CARDINAL ) constitute CARDINAL groups who were and are differently situated and a valid and substantial reason for the discrimination which has been made by these sections has always existed . \"", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON added that when the outline planning permission in respect of the land was declared invalid , there would have been a breach of the vendor \u2019s covenant for title , which would have given LOC a cause of action for damages against him . Alternatively , it could have recovered from him , in an action for unjust enrichment , so much of the purchase price as was attributable to the permission . Since LOC had not shown that its loss could not be recovered in that way , it had failed to prove that an injustice had been done to it for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW contains the following provisions :", "\" CARDINAL . All citizens shall , as human persons , be held equal before the law .", "This shall not be held to mean that the ORG shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity , physical and moral , and of social function .", "...", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL The ORG guarantees in its laws to respect , and as far as practicable , by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen .", "CARDINAL The ORG shall , in particular , by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and , in the case of injustice done , vindicate the life , person , good name and property rights of every citizen . \"", "\" CARDINAL . CARDINAL The ORG acknowledges that man , in virtue of his rational being , has the natural right , antecedent to positive law , to the private ownership of external goods .", "CARDINAL The ORG accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer , bequeath and inherit property .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL The ORG recognises , however , that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this LAW ought , in civil society , to be regulated by the principles of social justice .", "CARDINAL The ORG , accordingly , may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good . \"", "CARDINAL . In addition to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the principal legislation pertinent to this case was ORG DATE , as amended by LAW of the same title ( \" LAW \" ) .", "The DATE LAW made thereunder provided for the grant by planning authorities of \" permissions \" and \" outline permissions \" for the development of land . Permissions were complete in themselves . PERSON permissions amounted to a favourable decision as to the principle of the proposed development but were granted subject to the subsequent approval , by the authority or on appeal , of detailed plans , without which approval work could not be commenced . The authority had to examine an application for such approval within the parameters set by the outline permission and could not reopen the question of principle . Outline planning permissions could be revoked but only in the event of a change in circumstances relating to the proper planning and development of the area .", "CARDINAL . In dealing with any application for permission or approval a planning authority was restricted , by section DATE ) of GPE , to considering \" the proper planning and development of [ its ] area \" .", "An appeal against a decision of a planning authority lay to the Minister for Local Government or , after DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , to ORG .
