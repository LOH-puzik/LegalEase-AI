On DATE , following proceedings on appeal , ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of attempted homicide and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . In addition , ORG imposed a ORG order ( terbeschikkingstelling ) with confinement to a secure institution ( met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ) . The ORG order took effect on DATE and expired DATE , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE prolonged the ORG order by DATE . It was consequently due to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor filed a request for a further prolongation with ORG , where it was registered on DATE . This prolongation request was based on an advice of DATE by the secure institution where the applicant was being treated . In this advice , a prolongation of the ORG order was recommended because the applicant was still considered capable of being seriously aggressive towards other people .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the request in the course of a hearing held on DATE . The applicant submitted that the public prosecutor \u2019s request for a prolongation should be declared inadmissible since ORG was no longer competent to prolong his ORG order as it had expired on DATE . The applicant further submitted that ORG had failed to comply with LAW ( Wetboek van Strafvordering ; hereinafter referred to as \u201c ORG \u201d ) which provides that a decision on a request for prolongation has to be taken within DATE after the submission of the request for prolongation .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments and prolonged his ORG order with confinement to a secure institution by DATE , taking into account the advice issued by the secure institution where the applicant was being treated and the testimony of an expert witness , recommending that the ORG order should be extended because the applicant was still considered capable of being seriously aggressive towards others . ORG admitted that the examination of the request had not taken place within the time - limit contained in LAW ORG and that the reason therefor was the fact that during DATE it had not been able to hold sufficient hearings with judges having the specialised knowledge needed . However , it held that a failure to observe the time - limit in LAW ORG did not imply that the public prosecutor \u2019s request should be declared inadmissible . It noted that the date of the hearing in the instant case had been fixed on DATE , i.e. within DATE after the submission of the prolongation request . It further noted that , by summons of DATE , the applicant had been invited to appear at the hearing of CARDINAL DATE and that a copy of the summons had been sent to his representative . ORG considered that , if the latter had objected to the fixing of that date , the hearing could have been rescheduled for an earlier date during the recess . ORG concluded that in all these circumstances the general security of persons required a prolongation of the ORG order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG on DATE . In the course of a hearing held on DATE , ORG heard the applicant and a psychologist working in the secure institution where the applicant was under treatment .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG noted that the decision of DATE had been taken DATE after the expiry of the time - limit provided for in LAW . It held that ORG could and should have scheduled a hearing date before the expiry of the time - limit . Moreover , LAW ORG made ORG responsible and not the applicant or his lawyer to see to it that the time - limit was observed . It further held that failure to observe the time - limit entailed neither the inadmissibility of the prosecution \u2019s request , nor the incompetence of ORG to examine this request , nor yet the expiry of the ORG order . On the basis of the failure to respect the time - limit referred to in LAW ORG and the unsatisfactory reasons therefor stated by ORG , ORG decided to quash the decision of DATE and , on appeal , to determine itself the prolongation request .", "CARDINAL . After having noted the advice of the secure institution where the applicant was receiving treatment and an expert opinion concerning the applicant \u2019s medical condition , ORG decided to extend the ORG order with confinement to a secure institution by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s post - sentence confinement , the order was finally terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) enables courts , when dealing with certain serious crimes , to impose a ORG order on a defendant whose mental faculties were inadequately developed or pathologically disturbed as the time of the commission of the offence . If the safety of others or the general safety of persons or goods so requires , the court may further direct that such a person be confined to a secure institution in accordance with Article PERSON of LAW . A ORG order with confinement to a secure institution can also be imposed in conjunction with a custodial sanction if the convicted person \u2019s responsibility was merely diminished at the time of the commission of the offence . In such a situation , the ORG order will take effect after the convicted person has served the prison sentence imposed . A ORG order with confinement to a secure institution is not intended to have a punitive effect , but to protect society from any risk posed by the person concerned . A confinement order is subject to statutory time - limits , but there is in principle no restriction on the number of extensions that can be granted .", "CARDINAL . The provisions relating to the extension of a confinement order are set out in ORG CARDINALo \u2013 CARDINALx of LAW PERSON ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG provides that the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( openbaar ministerie ) may submit a request ( vordering ) for the prolongation of a confinement order no sooner than DATE and DATE before the time at which the ORG order is due to expire . The request must be accompanied by a recent recommendation prepared by the institution in which the patient is being treated ( Article CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) . In accordance with the provisions of LAW ORG , the person concerned must be given a copy of the request as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court competent to decide on such a request is ORG that tried the person concerned at first instance for the crime that gave rise to the ORG order ( Article CARDINALp ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALq CCP , in so far as relevant , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG order shall remain in force as long as no final decision on the request < for its prolongation > has been taken ( \u201c zolang op de vordering niet onherroepelijk is beslist ... \u201d ) . Where the request is granted after DATE on which the ORG order , by passage of time , would have expired had no prolongation request been filed , the new period shall nevertheless start to run on DATE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG must immediately ( onverwijld ) set a date for the examination of the case , and the person concerned must be timely informed of DATE ( Article CARDINALs \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The decision of ORG must be rendered as soon as possible , but DATE from the date on which the request was lodged ( LAW ) . ORG may , however , exceed this time - limit if it wishes to consider refusing the request \u2013 thus terminating the ORG order \u2013 and if it needs more information as to the way in which the person concerned might be released back into society . In such a case , the court has DATE to render its decision ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW CCP , the time - limit referred to in LAW t \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG does not apply where a circumstance has arisen on grounds of which the court can not comply with its obligation pursuant to LAW to hear the person concerned before deciding the request . In such a situation , ORG must decide the prolongation request within DATE after the obstacle for hearing the person concerned has ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision shall be reasoned . If it decides to prolong the ORG order , the decision must be pronounced publicly ( Article CARDINAL t \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . An appeal against a decision on a prolongation request lies with ORG , which must determine the appeal as soon as possible ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG ) . However , no appeal lies against a first decision to prolong the ORG order for DATE ( Article CARDINALv ) .", "CARDINAL . There is no express provision requiring the release of the person concerned if the time - limits laid down by ORG CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL t \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL are not complied with , nor does the ORG impose any sanctions on exceeding these time - limits .", "CARDINAL . According to GPE case - law , summary civil proceedings ( kort geding ) may be instituted in cases where a person subject to a confinement order wishes to obtain a court judgment on the lawfulness of his detention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of ORG ( PERSON ) of DATE ( PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it was held that a confinement order remains lawful even if the decision to prolong it has been taken after the expiry of the CARDINAL months\u2019 time - limit now provided for in LAW , as this time - limit is merely of an exhortatory nature .", "CARDINAL . According to a judgment of ORG of DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , a failure to comply with the statutory two months\u2019 time - limit does not in itself give rise to an obligation to terminate a confinement order and to release the person concerned . Only in certain circumstances would the ORG be obliged to terminate a confinement order after its statutory period had expired and no decision as to its prolongation had been taken . In order to determine whether such an obligation exists , the court should have regard to the extent to which the statutory time - limit had been exceeded , the reasons for which the time - limit had not been complied with and the personal and societal interests involved .", "CARDINAL . In decisions taken on DATE and DATE , ORG held that a failure to respect the time - limit set out in LAW does not affect the validity of the running confinement order since , in accordance with LAW , it remains in force until a final decision has been taken on request for prolongation thereof ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
