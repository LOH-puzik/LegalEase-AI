The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant intended to set up a \u201c specialised television programme \u201d , ORG , limited to a particular subject ( PERSON ) , namely all aspects of car mobility and private road traffic , including news on cars , car accessories , traffic and energy policies , traffic security , tourism , automobile sport , relations between railways and road traffic and environmental issues . The television programme was to be broadcast via cable television in NORP in the NORP - speaking areas of GPE , and in NORP in the LANGUAGE - speaking areas . Initially , the programme was to TIME , to be repeated continuously over DATE and a new one shown once DATE ; later it was to be extended in duration . The applicant was to be the company 's managing director . The programme was to be prepared in close cooperation with industry , automobile associations and the specialist media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed with the government in the name of ORG a request for a licence ( PERSON ) to broadcast the intended programme . ORG replied on DATE , pointing out the lack of prospects of success of such a request . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed ORG that he wished to pursue his request and submitted further documents . From the latter it transpired that ORG would now include in its programme matters concerning the transport needs of non - motorists and set up an independent programme commission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG PERSON ) dismissed the request . ORG noted that there was no right , either under NORP law or LAW , to obtain a broadcasting licence . With reference to the instructions for radio and television listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber ORG \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ; see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) the decision continued :", "\u201c ... The electronic media have the task of conveying content that serves the development of informed democratic opinion . They should furthermore actively contribute to a culture of communication serving as the basis for cultural development and for an integral democratic discourse .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the ORG , a licence shall only be granted if radio and television can achieve the aims mentioned in section CARDINAL ) of the ORG as a whole . It is unnecessary that each venture comply with all aspects of the instructions mentioned . Rather , a positive contribution is required which will further the culture of communication in our country and which will under no circumstances run counter to the aims of the RTA .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive and broad - based democratic discourse is guaranteed first of all by means of programmes which are committed to a public service and can be considered to be comprehensive . These are directed at the entire public and have as their subject matter all aspects of political and social life . Specialised programmes concentrate on particular themes and are directed at particularly interested sectors of the public . The result may be the formation of public opinion influenced by the media by way of specific content , and no longer primarily by way of broad - based , comprehensive programmes . Such a development indubitably has consequences for the culture of communication . Communicative integration via the electronic media is impaired , and leads to a society increasingly shaped by segmentation and atomisation .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , the broadcasting of specialised programmes runs counter to the democratic considerations of the general instructions for radio and television ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) . These instructions are oriented towards the integration and promotion of an integral culture of communication . As a result , stricter conditions must apply to specialised programmes than would be required for a programme with a varied content . Therefore , when examining the conditions for a licence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the ORG , qualified criteria shall be adduced , since the active contribution of specialised programmes towards the culture of communication must generally be called into question .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , granting a licence to specialised programmes continues to remain possible under qualified conditions . A licence shall be considered if the negative effects of the programme are at least compensated by its valuable contents within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of the ORG . This could be the case with programmes in the areas of culture ( music , films , etc . ) or the formation of political opinions ( parliamentary broadcasts , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . The request for a licence by ORG aims at a specialised programme which has car mobility as its content and places the car at its centre . According to the criteria set out in subsections ( CARDINAL ) , it must be considered with the greatest restraint . As a result , granting a licence will only be considered if the disadvantages resulting from a specialised programme are compensated by its valuable contents , offering a particular contribution to the general instructions mentioned in section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the orientation of the programme of ORG is not able to offer the required valuable contribution to comply with the general instructions for radio and television . The programme focuses mainly on entertainment or on reports about the automobile . ORG does not therefore meet the requirements for a licence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
