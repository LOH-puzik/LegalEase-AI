{"ITEMID": "001-68825", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "SCHEPER v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant was charged with having raped CARDINAL drug - addicted street prostitutes , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , and an unrelated count of forgery . He was summoned to appear on DATE before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) in order to stand trial on these charges . In the course of the adversarial proceedings before ORG , the applicant admitted that he had had sexual intercourse with the CARDINAL women , but denied having raped them . The QUANTITY women were not heard before ORG .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of having raped PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and of forgery , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . In addition , having found that the applicant was suffering from a personality disorder and was dangerous , it further ordered his confinement in a custodial clinic ( terbeschikkingstelling met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ) . It also ordered the applicant to pay PERSON , who had joined the criminal proceedings as a civil injured party ( benadeelde partij ) and had filed a claim for compensation of damage incurred , an amount of MONEY ( \u201c NLG \u201d ; i.e. DATE ) .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "On DATE , ORG commenced its examination of the applicant 's appeal and considered the request by the defence to summon PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , as well as CARDINAL ex - girlfriends , in order to give evidence before ORG . After having deliberated , ORG decided to adjourn its examination of this request . It considered , finding that insufficient reasons had been given for this request , that it could not determine the necessity to hear these witnesses . It requested the defence to submit a reasoned request for hearing witnesses well before DATE when it would resume its examination of the appeal .", "ORG resumed the proceedings on DATE . As its composition had changed in the meantime , ORG fully recommenced its examination of the applicant 's case . The applicant submitted that he had been unjustly convicted . He confirmed that he had had sexual contacts with PERSON , PERSON and PERSON but denied that he had raped them . He stated that PERSON was a prostitute and he confirmed having taken her in his car .", "When heard before ORG , PERSON stated :", "\u201c It is correct that I got into the car of the suspect . I did not know the suspect before , also not from the caf\u00e9 . What this man has done is not normal . I had not expected the suspect to be here . This is a shock to me and I do not want to testify now . I have been heard in a detailed manner by the police for DATE .", "I also do not understand that I must now act as a witness . I have received from the public prosecutor 's department a notification for an injured party and that is the reason for my present appearance . I want compensation for what has been done to me . I now first want to consult my mother . \u201d", "After the public prosecutor had informed ORG that it was possible that PERSON had only received the notification for an injured party but not the summons to appear as a witness , ORG suspended the hearing in order to allow PERSON to consult her mother .", "When it resumed the hearing , ORG noted that PERSON was no longer in the court room . Her mother stated before the court :", "\u201c My daughter is now in the hall of the court . She had not expected having to appear as a witness . She no longer lives at home and has not seen the summons . My daughter does not wish to see [ the applicant ] anymore and does not wish to recall what has happened to her . She has tried for DATE to stop taking drugs but unfortunately without success , she is still addicted . She can not face having to recount her story again . \u201d", "The public prosecutor informed ORG that it did not find it necessary to hear PERSON , that the last known address of PERSON was a GPE aftercare organisation and the last known address of PERSON that of an GPE police station . The public prosecutor submitted that summoning these CARDINAL witnesses would be pointless , unless the defence had new addresses for these witnesses . The defence stated that it was important to take oral evidence from these witnesses and that it expected that , if the judicial authorities made the necessary efforts , it would be possible to summon them .", "After having deliberated , ORG ordered the public prosecutor to make all possible efforts to take evidence from PERSON , PERSON and PERSON as well as from CARDINAL male witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , who had been proposed by the defence . It adjourned its further examination until DATE .", "The appeal proceedings were resumed on DATE . As its composition had changed again in the meantime , ORG fully recommenced its examination of the applicant 's case . It noted , inter alia , the submission of a written record of the evidence given by PERSON on DATE before the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) at ORG , and that according to information provided by the investigating judge it had not been possible to hear PERSON , PERSON , PERSON or PERSON The defence stated that it waived its wish to hear PERSON The defence further submitted that , although it understood that it was pointless and superfluous to summon the QUANTITY victims , the taking of their evidence remained important for the defence and that , therefore , it did not formally waive its wish to hear them . The public prosecutor agreed with the defence that summoning the QUANTITY victims would be pointless and proposed that ORG would proceed with its examination of the applicant 's appeal . The public prosecutor further did not find it necessary to hear Mr M.", "After having deliberated , ORG decided that it did not see any merit in ordering fresh attempts to summon the CARDINAL victims as it was unlikely that they would appear within an acceptable delay . It therefore rejected the request by the defence to summon them . Further noting that none of the parties wished to hear Mr M. , it considered that it was no longer necessary to hear this witness .", "It heard the applicant , who admitted having had sexual intercourse with PERSON , PERSON and PERSON but denied having raped them . As regards the charges relating to PERSON he added that he had had chocolate in his car , but denied having inserted chocolate into her vagina .. After having heard the parties ' final pleadings , ORG closed its examination and set a date for judgment .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and convicted the applicant of having raped PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and of forgery .", "As regards the imposition of its sentence ORG took into account that the applicant , in the course of a period of slightly DATE , had on CARDINAL occasions picked up a street prostitute in his car . As from the outset he then subsequently misled the woman by pretending , inter alia , that he could pay by providing drugs . He then committed very humiliating acts , in particular by inserting chocolate bars in the vagina of CARDINAL of his victims . He fully ignored the victims ' feelings and abused the very vulnerable position in which the victims , being street prostitutes , found themselves . Having found that at the material time the applicant was able to understand the unlawful nature of his acts but that his mental faculties were so poorly developed that he could only be held responsible for these offences to a limited degree , whereas there was a considerable danger of recidivism of aggressive sexual offences against women , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment in combination with an order for his confinement in a custodial clinic . It also ordered the applicant to pay the injured party PERSON compensation in an amount of NLG CARDINAL .", "ORG based its conviction of the applicant of the rape of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON on the following means of evidence :", "- the applicant 's statement before ORG that he had had sexual intercourse with PERSON ;", "- the detailed statement given by PERSON to the police in which she related , inter alia , that on DATE in GPE she had seen her colleague and friend Ms X. sitting next to the driver in a car passing by , that shortly thereafter this car had stopped near to the telephone booth in which she had taken shelter from the rain and that Ms X. was no longer in the car , that she had then been picked up by the driver of this car who had subsequently raped her in a brutal and very painful manner in that , before forcing her to have intercourse with him , he had forcibly inserted several chocolate bars into her vagina , and that he had also taken photographs of her before he had allowed her to dress and leave the car ;", "- a report on a medical examination of PERSON on DATE according to which her vagina was considerably soiled by chocolate ;", "- the record of observations and findings ( relaas van waarnemingen en bevindingen ) drawn up by the reporting police officers GPE and GPE , according to which staff of the LOC police region had informed them , after the rape of PERSON had been signalled in a police bulletin , that in DATE both in GPE and GPE \u2013 a man had raped drug - addicted prostitutes in a similar manner , that in the GPE case the perpetrator had also taken similar photographs as in the GPE case , that in all cases the suspect had been heard who had confirmed having had contacts with the victims but that these contacts had been consensual although he had not paid the prostitutes , and that the suspect had been identified as [ the applicant ] ;", "PERSON recognition of the applicant as the driver of the car from a number of photographs of different persons shown to her on DATE , at which occasion she stated that his hair style on the photograph was different than when she had seen him ;", "PERSON recognition of the applicant as her assailant from a number of photographs of different persons shown to her on DATE ;", "- the detailed statement given by PERSON to the police , in which she related inter alia that on or around CARDINAL DATE in the GPE region she had been forced to get into a car driven by a rather aggressive man who had subsequently raped her in a crude manner , and that she remembered the car 's licence plate ;", "- the record of observations and findings drawn up by the police officer who had taken down PERSON criminal complaint on DATE . According to this record the description and licence plate of the car given by PERSON corresponded to a car that was being used by the applicant and PERSON description of her assailant corresponded to the applicant 's features . The record further states that , on DATE , the reporting police officer had been informed by the GPE police that the driver of a car with the same licence plate and whose physical features exactly matched the description given by PERSON , was being searched for having raped , sexually assaulted , threatened and unlawfully deprived of liberty a NORP street prostitute in GPE , PERSON , who had filed a criminal complaint on DATE ;", "- the applicant 's statement to the police in which he confirmed that he had had sexual contacts with a prostitute in GPE and in which he described the car in which he had then driven , the licence plate and description matching the information given by PERSON ;", "- the detailed statement given by PERSON to the police , in which she related , inter alia , that on DATE shortly after TIME in GPE she had been picked up by a client in a car , that her friend had noted down the licence plate of this car , and that she had subsequently been raped in an aggressive and very painful manner by the driver of this car ; and", "- the applicant 's statement to the police in which he confirmed that he had had intercourse with a prostitute whom he had picked up in GPE by DATE , and in which he described the car he had then driven , the description and licence plate matching the information given by PERSON", "The applicant 's subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG found that LAW did not prevent the use in evidence of the statements given by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON to the police despite the fact that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been able to question them as a witness . In this respect ORG accepted as correct and not unreasonable the conclusion of ORG that further attempts to make the CARDINAL victims appear before ORG would serve no useful purpose . ORG also accepted that the respective statements by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were sufficiently corroborated by other means of evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
