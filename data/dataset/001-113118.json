He also suffers from bleeding in his left eye , as shown by a medical certificate of DATE , and arthritis in the neck . In addition , according to a medical certificate issued by a doctor in GPE on DATE , he sustained a fracture in his right hand which was due to be operated on in DATE . The applicant has alleged that , because of the restrictions imposed on him which gave rise to the present application , he was unable to undergo this operation and has continued to suffer from the consequences of the fracture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the CARDINAL DATE bombings by PERSON and members of his network against the GPE embassies in GPE ( GPE ) and GPE ( GPE ) ORG of ORG ( adopted , under LAW , LAW ( DATE ) , providing for sanctions against the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and created a committee consisting of all the members of ORG to monitor the enforcement of that ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , to implement that ORG , ORG ( the federal executive ) adopted an Ordinance \u201c instituting measures against the ORG \u201d ( \u201c the LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which subsequently underwent a number of amendments , including to its title .", "CARDINAL .

It was now also directed against PERSON and the ORG organisation , as well as the ORG \u2019s senior officials and advisers . In both Resolutions CARDINAL ( DATE ) and CARDINAL ( DATE ) , ORG requested ORG to maintain a list , based on information provided by GPE and regional organisations , of individuals and entities associated with PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP government amended the GPE Ordinance in order to implement LAW ( DATE ) .

On DATE , following criticism by ORG for the application of the sanctions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the GPE of GPE revoked the applicant \u2019s special border - crossing permit . ORG had observed , in the course of its inquiry into the applicant \u2019s activities , that he was able to move relatively freely between GPE and GPE .

On DATE the applicant lodged a request with the FAC for leave to enter or transit through GPE for the purposes of medical treatment in that country and legal proceedings in both GPE and GPE . The ORG dismissed that request on DATE as being ill - founded . Moreover , it indicated to the applicant that the grounds put forward in support of his request , namely , the need to consult his lawyers and receive treatment and , secondly , the specific situation related to his residence in FAC d\u2019Italia , were not such as to permit the authorities to grant him an exemption from the measure taken against him .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG ordered ORG either to discontinue the proceedings or to send the case to the competent federal investigating judge by DATE . By an order of that date ORG , finding that the accusations against the applicant were unsubstantiated , closed the investigation in respect of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to delete his name and those of the organisations associated with him from the annex to the ORG Ordinance . He argued , in support of his claim , that the police investigation concerning him had been discontinued by a decision of ORG and that it was therefore no longer justified to subject him to sanctions .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) rejected his request on the ground that GPE could not delete names from the annex to the ORG Ordinance while they still appeared on ORG list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative appeal with ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the ORG dismissed that appeal . It confirmed that the deletion of a name from the annex to the GPE could be envisaged only once that name had been deleted from ORG list , and explained that , for this purpose , it was necessary for the State of citizenship or residence of the person concerned to apply for delisting to ORG institutions . As GPE was neither the applicant \u2019s State of citizenship nor his ORG of residence , the ORG found that the NORP authorities were not competent to initiate such a procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the ORG \u2019s decision . He requested that his name and those of a certain number of organisations associated with him be deleted from the list in ORG to the Taliban Ordinance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FOM ) , which had been created in DATE , incorporating the IMES , granted the applicant an exemption for DATE , DATE , so that he could go to GPE for legal proceedings .

On DATE the applicant sent to the \u201c focal point \u201d of ORG DATE a body set up by LAW ( DATE ) to receive requests for delisting from individuals or entities on ORG lists ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \u2013 a request for the deletion of his name from the relevant list .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG , ruling on the appeal of DATE , referred the case to ORG , finding that the applicant had been subjected to direct restrictions on his right to enjoy his possessions ; also that LAW consequently applied to his request for deletion from the annex to the Taliban Ordinance , and that , accordingly , the case had to be examined by an independent and impartial tribunal .", "CARDINAL . In its observations , the ORG submitted that the appeal should be dismissed , pointing out that ORG DATE ) of DATE allowed persons and organisations whose names appeared on ORG list to apply for delisting on an individual basis rather than through their ORG of citizenship or residence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained his submissions . Moreover , he alleged that on account of the ORG \u2019s evident reluctance to grant exemptions under LAW of the Taliban Ordinance , he could not leave his home in Campione d\u2019Italia despite the lack of adequate medical facilities there , or even go to GPE for administrative or judicial reasons , and that he had therefore effectively spent DATE under house arrest . The addition of his name to ORG list was also tantamount to accusing him publicly of being associated with PERSON , ORG and the ORG , when that was not the case . Furthermore , he argued that the listing , without any justification or any possibility for him to be heard beforehand , breached the principles of prohibition of discrimination , individual freedom , enjoyment of possessions and economic freedom , together with the right to be heard and the right to a fair trial . Lastly , taking the view that ORG sanctions were contrary to LAW and to the peremptory norms of international law ( jus cogens ) , he argued that GPE was not obliged to implement them .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , in which it indicated the remedy available , the ORG dismissed a new exemption request by the applicant . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , once again indicating the available remedies , it refused to examine a letter from the applicant that it regarded as a request for review . In a letter of DATE , the applicant explained that there had been a misunderstanding and that his previous letter had in fact been a new request for exemption . On DATE the ORG again rejected his request , reminding him that he could challenge the decision by lodging an appeal with ORG . The applicant did not appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the focal point for delisting requests denied the applicant \u2019s request of DATE to have his name removed from ORG list ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the focal point also rejected a request for information concerning the country that had designated him for listing and the reasons for that designation , invoking the confidentiality of the process . Lastly , in letters of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the focal point reaffirmed the confidentiality of the process , but nevertheless informed the applicant that a ORG whose identity could not be disclosed had opposed his delisting .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , to which ORG had referred the applicant \u2019s appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , declared that appeal admissible but dismissed it on the merits .", "CARDINAL . It firstly pointed out that , under LAW , the ORG member GPE had undertaken to accept and carry out the decisions of ORG in accordance with the LAW . It then observed that under LAW the obligations arising from that instrument did not only prevail over the domestic law of the member GPE but also over obligations under other international agreements , regardless of their nature , whether bilateral or multilateral . It further stated that this primacy did not relate only to the LAW but extended to all obligations which arose from a binding resolution of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed , however , that ORG was itself bound by the LAW and was required to act in accordance with its purposes and principles ( LAW ) , which included respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms ( LAW of the LAW ) . At the same time , it took the view that the member GPE were not permitted to avoid an obligation on the ground that a decision ( or resolution ) by ORG was substantively inconsistent with the LAW , in particular decisions ( resolutions ) based on Chapter VII thereof ( action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace and acts of aggression ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG then observed that under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it was bound by federal laws and international law . It took the view that the applicable international law , in addition to international treaties ratified by GPE , also included customary international law , general principles of law and the decisions of international organisations which were binding on GPE , including ORG decisions concerning the sanctions regime .", "CARDINAL . However , it observed that LAW contained no rules on how to settle possible conflicts between different norms of international law which were legally binding on GPE , and that in the present case there was such a conflict between ORG decisions on the one hand and the guarantees of LAW and LAW on the other . It took the view that unless the conflict could be resolved by the rules on the interpretation of treaties , it would be necessary , in order to settle the issue , to look to the hierarchy of international legal norms , according to which obligations under LAW prevailed over obligations under any other international agreement ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW , taken together with LAW on the Law of Treaties ; see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . ORG was of the opinion that the uniform application of ORG sanctions would be endangered if the courts of GPE Parties to ORG or LAW were able to disregard those sanctions in order to protect the fundamental rights of certain individuals or organisations .", "CARDINAL . The court nevertheless accepted that the obligation to implement ORG decisions was limited by norms of jus cogens . Accordingly , it considered itself bound to ascertain whether the sanctions regime set up by ORG was capable of breaching the peremptory norms of international law , as the applicant had claimed .", "CARDINAL . ORG then cited , as examples of jus cogens norms , the right to life , protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment , the prohibition of slavery , the prohibition of collective punishment , the principle of individual criminal responsibility and the non - refoulement principle . It took the view , however , that the enjoyment of possessions , economic freedom , the guarantees of a fair trial or the right to an effective remedy did not fall within jus cogens .", "CARDINAL . As regards the consequences for the applicant of the measures taken against him , in particular the ban on entry into and transit through GPE , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL ... These sanctions include far - reaching commercial restrictions for those affected ; the funds necessary for their survival are not , however , blocked ( see Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) , paragraph CARDINAL(a ) ) , as a result of which there is neither any threat to their life or health nor any inhuman or degrading treatment .", "The travel ban restricts the freedom of movement of those concerned but in principle represents no deprivation of liberty : they are free to move around within their country of residence ( see , however , point CARDINAL below regarding the appellant \u2019s particular situation ) ; journeys to their home country are also specifically permitted ( see Resolution DATE ) , paragraph CARDINAL(b ) ) .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further indicated that , generally speaking , sanctions were decided by ORG without individuals or organisations being afforded the opportunity to comment either in advance or afterwards or to appeal against them before international or national courts . It mentioned in this connection that , in particular under the terms of LAW ( DATE ) , the delisting procedure allowing individuals to have direct access to ORG already represented substantial progress , even though the system still had considerable shortcomings from the point of view of human rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG then examined the question of the extent to which GPE was bound by the relevant resolutions , in other words whether it had any latitude ( Ermessensspielraum ) in implementing them :", "\u201c CARDINAL ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) and the subsequent Resolutions regarding sanctions affecting ORG and the ORG on the basis of Chapter VII of LAW , with the express obligation on all member GPE to adopt an integral and strict approach to implementing the sanctions envisaged therein , ignoring any existing rights and obligations under international agreements or contracts ( see paragraph CARDINAL of Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "The sanctions ( freezing of assets , entry - and - transit ban , arms embargo ) are described in detail and afford member GPE no margin of appreciation in their implementation . The names of those affected by the sanctions are also indicated to the member GPE : this is determined by the list drawn up and maintained by ORG ( see paragraph PERCENT of CARDINAL ) ) .", "As regards the possibility of obtaining deletion from the list , ORG has introduced a specific procedure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . of Resolution DATE ) and the directives of ORG dated DATE ) . The member GPE are thus debarred from deciding of their own motion whether or not sanctions should continue to be imposed on a person or organisation appearing on ORG list .", "GPE would therefore be in breach of its obligations under the LAW were it to delete the names of the appellant and his organisations from the annex to the Taliban Ordinance .", "...", "NORP In view of the foregoing , GPE is not permitted , of its own motion , to delete the appellant \u2019s name from FAC to the ORG Ordinance .", "It is to be admitted that in this situation no effective remedy is available to the appellant . ORG may certainly examine whether and to what extent GPE is bound by ORG , but it is not permitted to remove the sanctions against the appellant on the ground that they breach his fundamental rights .", "ORG alone is responsible for the delisting of persons or entities . In spite of the improvements mentioned above , the delisting procedure fails to meet both the requirement of access to a court under LAW , LAW ] and LAW , and that of an effective remedy within the meaning of LAW ] and LAW of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further examined whether GPE , even if it were not authorised to delete the applicant \u2019s name from the list on its own initiative , was nevertheless at least obliged to assist him in connection with the delisting procedure . Its reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The lower courts examined whether GPE was obliged to initiate the delisting procedure on behalf of the appellant . In the meantime , this issue has become irrelevant as , since the amendment of the delisting procedure , the appellant has been able to make an application himself and has indeed availed himself of this opportunity .", "CARDINAL For his application to be successful he nevertheless relies on the support of GPE , since this is the only country to have conducted a comprehensive preliminary investigation , with numerous letters of request , house searches and questioning of witnesses .", "ORG member GPE are obliged to prosecute persons suspected of financing or supporting terrorism ( see paragraph CARDINAL(e ) of ORG DATE ) ) ...", "On the other hand , should the criminal proceedings end in an acquittal or be discontinued , this should lead to the removal of the preventive sanctions . Admittedly , the country which has conducted the criminal proceedings or preliminary investigation can not itself proceed with the deletion , but it can at least transmit the results of its investigations to ORG and request or support the person \u2019s delisting . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG examined whether the travel ban enforced under LAW of the Taliban Ordinance extended beyond the sanctions introduced by ORG and whether the NORP authorities thus had any latitude in that connection . The court found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the NORP Ordinance prohibits the individuals listed in LAW from entering or transiting through GPE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that , in agreement with ORG decisions or for the protection of NORP interests , ORG is entitled to grant exemptions .", "According to ORG , the travel ban does not apply if the entry or transit is required for the fulfilment of a judicial process . In addition , exemptions can be granted in individual cases with the agreement of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL(b ) of Resolution DATE ) ) . This includes in particular travel on medical , humanitarian or religious grounds ...", "QUANTITY Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Taliban Ordinance is formulated as an \u2018 enabling\u2019 provision and gives the impression that ORG has a certain margin of appreciation . Constitutionally however , the provision is to be interpreted as meaning that an exemption should be granted in all cases where the ORG sanctions regime so permits . A more far - reaching restriction on the appellant \u2019s freedom of movement could not be regarded as based on ORG , would not be in the public interest and would be disproportionate in the light of the appellant \u2019s particular situation .", "The appellant lives in PERSON , an NORP enclave in GPE , with an area of CARDINAL sq . km . As a result of the ban on entry into and transit through GPE , he is unable to leave PERSON . Practically speaking , as the appellant correctly argued , this is tantamount to house arrest and thus represents a serious restriction on his personal liberty . In these circumstances the NORP authorities are obliged to exhaust all the relaxations of the sanctions regime available under ORG .", "ORG thus has no margin of appreciation . Rather , it must examine whether the conditions for the granting of an exemption are met . Should the request not fall within CARDINAL of the general exemptions envisaged by ORG , it must be submitted to ORG for approval .", "CARDINAL The question whether ORG has disregarded the constitutional requirements in dealing with the appellant \u2019s applications for leave to travel abroad does not need to be examined here : the relevant orders of ORG have not been challenged by the appellant and are not a matter of dispute in the present proceedings .", "The same applies to the question whether the appellant should have moved his place of residence from the NORP enclave of PERSON to GPE . To date the appellant has made no such request . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , the applicant wrote to the ORG to request it to re - examine the possibility of applying general exemptions to his particular situation . On DATE he lodged a new request seeking the suspension of the entry - and - transit ban for DATE . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG denied that request , stating that it was unable to grant a suspension for such a long period without referring the matter to ORG , but that it could grant CARDINAL - off safe conducts . The applicant did not challenge that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a meeting between the NORP authorities and the applicant \u2019s representative on the subject of the support that GPE could provide to the applicant in his efforts to obtain his delisting , a representative of ORG observed that the situation was rather singular as the applicant , on the one hand , was asking what support the NORP authorities could give him in the ORG delisting procedure and , on the other , had brought a case against GPE before the ORG .", "During the meeting the applicant \u2019s representative explained that he had received verbal confirmation from the ORG to the effect that his client would be granted CARDINAL - off authorisations to go to GPE , in order to consult his lawyer in GPE . The representative of ORG also indicated that the applicant could ask ORG for a more extensive exemption on account of his particular situation . However , she also repeated that GPE could not itself apply to ORG for the applicant \u2019s delisting . She added that her government would nevertheless be prepared to support him , in particular by providing him with an attestation confirming that the criminal proceedings against him had been discontinued . The applicant \u2019s lawyer replied that he had already received a letter attesting to the discontinuance in favour of his client and that this letter was sufficient .", "As to the applicant \u2019s requests to the NORP authorities with a view to obtaining their support in a delisting procedure , ORG representative suggested that the lawyer contact ORG to the United Nations , adding that GPE had , at that time , a seat on ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG that in DATE an NORP military tribunal had sentenced the applicant in absentia to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for providing financial support to the ORG organisation ( see the article on this subject in the DATE newspaper ORG of DATE ) . The applicant did not dispute the fact that he had been convicted but argued that he had never been informed of the proceedings against him and that he had therefore never had the possibility of defending himself in person or through the intermediary of a lawyer . For those reasons , and also taking into account the fact that the trial was held before a military tribunal even though he was a civilian , he claimed that the proceedings in question were clearly in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP government submitted to ORG a request for the applicant \u2019s delisting on the ground that the case against him in GPE had been dismissed . ORG denied that request by a decision of DATE . In the applicant \u2019s submission , ORG had not allowed him to submit his observations to it beforehand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant the right to enter GPE and to remain in the country for DATE , but the applicant did not make use of this authorisation .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that the entry of GPE into LOC , on DATE , did not affect his situation .", "CARDINAL . In their observations before the ORG , ORG stated that , to their knowledge , the applicant \u2019s listing had been initiated by a request from GPE , and that the same ORG had submitted to ORG , on DATE , a request for the delisting of a number of individuals , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with the procedure laid down by ORG DATE ) , the applicant submitted a request to the focal point for delisting requests for the deletion of his name from ORG list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE sent to ORG a copy of a letter of CARDINAL DATE from ORG to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , in which that ORG confirmed that the judicial police investigation in respect of his client had not produced any indications or evidence to show that he had ties with persons or organisations associated with PERSON , ORG or the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s name was deleted from the list annexed to ORG providing for the sanctions in question . According to the applicant , the procedure provided for under LAW ( DATE ) was not followed and he received no explanation in this connection . On DATE the annex to the Taliban Ordinance was amended accordingly and the amendment took effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a motion passed on DATE , ORG of ORG ( lower house of ORG ) requested ORG to inform ORG that from DATE it would no longer , in certain cases , be applying the sanctions prescribed against individuals under the counterterrorism resolutions . It moreover called upon the Government to reassert its steadfast commitment to cooperate in the fight against terrorism in accordance with the legal order of the GPE . The motion had been introduced on DATE by PERSON , a member of ORG ( upper house of ORG ) , and it referred to the applicant \u2019s case by way of example .", "CARDINAL . The Government asserted that even though GPE was not a member of ORG it had , with other GPE , actively worked since becoming a member of ORG on DATE to improve the fairness of the listing and delisting procedure and the legal situation of the persons concerned . Thus , in DATE , it had launched with GPE and GPE a new initiative to ensure that fundamental rights would be given more weight in the sanctions procedure . Pursuing its initiative , GPE had submitted to ORG in DATE , together with GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE and GPE , concrete proposals for the setting - up of an advisory panel of independent experts authorised to submit delisting proposals to ORG . Moreover , in the autumn of DATE GPE had worked intensively with its partners to ensure that the ORG on the renewal of the sanctions regime against ORG and the ORG , scheduled for adoption in DATE , met that need . In the meantime GPE had supported the publication in DATE of a report proposing , as an option for an advisory review mechanism , the creation of an ombudsperson . On DATE ORG adopted DATE ( DATE ) , setting up the office of ombudsperson to receive complaints from individuals affected by ORG counterterrorism sanctions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

In the exercise of that latter power it is necessary for the ORG to attach special importance to the fact that , in accordance with LAW , the adoption by ORG of resolutions under LAW constitutes the exercise of the primary responsibility with which that international body is invested for the maintenance of peace and security at the global level , a responsibility which , LAW , includes the power to determine what and who poses a threat to international peace and security and to take the measures necessary to maintain or restore them .", "...", "CARDINAL .

LAW leaves the members of ORG a free choice among the various possible models for transposition of those resolutions into their domestic legal order .", "CARDINAL . It follows from all those considerations that it is not a consequence of the principles governing the international legal order under ORG that any judicial review of the internal lawfulness of the contested Regulation in the light of fundamental freedoms is excluded by virtue of the fact that that measure is intended to give effect to a resolution of ORG adopted under LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . What is more , such immunity from jurisdiction for a Community measure like the contested Regulation , as a corollary of the principle of the primacy at the level of international law of obligations under LAW , especially those relating to the implementation of resolutions of ORG adopted under LAW , can not find a basis in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
