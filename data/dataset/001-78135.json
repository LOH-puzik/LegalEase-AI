The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( verotoimisto , skattebyr\u00e5n ) requested the applicant , who ran a car - repair workshop , to submit his observations regarding some alleged errors in his value - added tax ( VAT ) declarations ( arvonlis\u00e4vero , merv\u00e4rdesskatt ) for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that there were deficiencies in the applicant \u2019s book - keeping in that , for instance , receipts and invoices were inadequate . ORG made a reassessment of the ORG payable basing itself on the applicant \u2019s estimated income , which was higher than the income he had declared . It ordered him to pay , inter alia , tax surcharges ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) amounting to PERCENT of the reassessed tax liability ( the additional tax surcharges levied on the applicant totalled CARDINAL NORP Marks , corresponding to CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) ( which later became ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) ) . He requested an oral hearing and that the tax inspector as well as an expert appointed by the applicant be heard as witnesses . On DATE ORG took an interim decision inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that an expert statement from an expert chosen by the applicant . The tax inspector submitted her statement of CARDINAL DATE to ORG . The statement was further submitted to the applicant for his observations . On DATE the applicant submitted his own observations on the tax inspector \u2019s statement . The statement of the expert chosen by him was dated and submitted to the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary in the matter because both parties had submitted all the necessary information in writing . It also rejected the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested leave to appeal , renewing at the same time his request for an oral hearing . On DATE ORG refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( arvonlis\u00e4verolaki , merv\u00e4rdesskattelagen ; PERSON no . DATE ) provides that if a person liable to pay taxes has failed to pay the taxes or clearly paid an insufficient amount of taxes or failed to give required information to the tax authorities , ORG ( verovirasto , skatteverket ) must assess the amount of unpaid taxes .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that a tax assessment may be conducted where a person has failed to make the required declarations or has given false information to the tax authorities . The taxpayer may be ordered to pay unpaid taxes or taxes that have been wrongly refunded to the person .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a maximum tax surcharge of PERCENT of the tax liability may be imposed if the person has without a justifiable reason failed to give a tax declaration or other document in due time or given essentially incomplete information . The tax surcharge may amount at most to twice the amount of the tax liability , if the person has without any justifiable reason failed to fulfil his or her duties fully or partially even after being expressly asked to provide information .", "CARDINAL . In , for example , the NORP judicial reference book , ORG , a tax surcharge is defined as an administrative sanction of a punitive nature imposed on the taxpayer for conduct contrary to tax law .", "CARDINAL . Under NORP practice , the imposition of a tax surcharge does not prevent the bringing of criminal charges for the same conduct .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; PERSON no . ORG ) provides that an oral hearing must be held if requested by a private party . An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if a party \u2019s request is ruled inadmissible or immediately dismissed , or if an oral hearing would be clearly unnecessary owing to the nature of the case or other circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory part of the Government Bill ( no . CARDINAL ) for the enactment of LAW considers the right to an oral hearing as provided by LAW possibility in administrative matters to dispense with the hearing when it would be clearly unnecessary , as stated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the said LAW . There it is noted that an oral hearing contributes to a focused and immediate procedure but , since it does not always bring any added value , it must be ensured that the flexibility and cost effectiveness of the administrative procedure is not undermined . An oral hearing is to be held when it is necessary for the clarification of the issues and the hearing can be considered beneficial for the case as a whole .", "CARDINAL . During DATE , ORG did not hold any oral hearings in tax matters . As to the CARDINAL administrative courts , appellants requested an oral hearing in a total of CARDINAL cases . The courts held an oral hearing in CARDINAL cases . There is no information as to how many of these taxation cases concerned the imposition of a tax surcharge . According to the ORG \u2019s written submission of DATE , the administrative courts had thus far in DATE held a total of CARDINAL oral hearings in tax matters . As regards ORG in particular , in DATE it examined a total of CARDINAL cases of which CARDINAL were tax matters . Out of the last - mentioned group of cases , CARDINAL concerned GPE . During DATE ORG held a total of CARDINAL oral hearings of which CARDINAL concerned GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
