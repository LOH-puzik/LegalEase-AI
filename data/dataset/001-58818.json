NORP The applicant is serving a DATE prison term to which he was sentenced by ORG for false imprisonment , among other offences .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG ordered that the applicant should be subject to the special prison regime for DATE . This decree was grounded on public order and security considerations given the dangerousness of the ORG and of the applicant in so far as he was presumed , according to police reports , to have maintained links with ORG circles . Moreover , this decree , in derogation from LAW , imposed the following restrictions :", "\u2013 no access to a telephone ;", "\u2013 no conversation or correspondence with other prisoners ;", "\u2013 no meetings with third parties ;", "\u2013 limits on visits by family members , with a maximum of CARDINAL visit for TIME ;", "\u2013 no sums of money above a fixed amount to be received or sent out ;", "\u2013 only parcels containing clothing to be sent in from outside prison ;", "\u2013 no organisation of cultural , recreational or sports activities ;", "\u2013 no right to vote in elections for prisoners ' representatives or to be elected as a representative ;", "\u2013 no handicrafts ;", "\u2013 no food requiring cooking to be purchased ;", "\u2013 not TIME per day to be spent outdoors .", "CARDINAL .

He objected to being placed under the special regime and complained of its vexatious nature . The court rejected the appeal on an unspecified date in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently transferred several times to prisons in GPE , PERSON , PERSON , GPE , GPE and FAC , often for the sole purpose of allowing him to participate in the hearings of the appeal proceedings taking place in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governor of FAC made an application to ORG and to ORG requesting authorisation to allow the applicant visits by members of his family ( the applicant is married and has CARDINAL daughters ) . The President of ORG granted his authorisation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date an application for censorship of the applicant 's correspondence to be authorised was made by the prison to the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences . On DATE the ORG court responsible for the execution of sentences allowed that application for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to the PERSON and PERSON courts responsible for the execution of sentences . The result of those appeals is unknown .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG ordered that the applicant be placed under the special prison regime again , from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE , on the ground that the conditions justifying that measure continued to exist . The restrictions were the same as those imposed by the previous decree .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decree to the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences . He complained of being placed under the special regime and , in particular , of the restriction on visits by family members .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences rejected the appeal in part , holding that imposing the special prison regime on the applicant was justified and that the decree complained of was based on adequate grounds . As for the restrictions imposed by that decree , the court found that the list of minimal conditions of detention laid down in section DATE of FAC should apply in relation to visits by family members . Consequently , the court struck down the ban on receiving CARDINAL family visit per month and ruled that the applicant would in future be entitled to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law against that decision . He argued that the conditions of detention to which he was subjected were inhuman and that the special prison regime had been extended by decrees based on inadequate grounds . The public prosecutor also appealed against the decision . In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , the appeals were declared inadmissible on the ground that the parties no longer had standing , since the decree of CARDINAL DATE had expired on CARDINAL DATE , before ORG delivered its judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG ordered application of the special prison regime to be extended until DATE , on the ground that the conditions justifying the measure continued to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decree with ORG , to be transmitted , if necessary , to the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences . He complained , inter alia , of the lack of real grounds justifying extension of the special regime and argued that the restrictions placed on visits and time outdoors and the prohibition of the purchase of food requiring cooking were not only contrary to section DATE of FAC and incompatible with the aim of rehabilitation , but also vexatious . He asked for application of the special regime to be countermanded and for permission to receive visits from his wife and his daughters without being separated from them by glass partitions and to make telephone calls . The applicant also emphasised that he was being held far from his family and the place where the trial was taking place . The outcome of that appeal is not known .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG court responsible for the execution of sentences for a date to be fixed for hearing his appeals of CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG once again extended application of the special regime by DATE ; that decision was based on grounds similar to those of the previous decrees . On DATE the applicant challenged the decree in the ORG court responsible for the execution of sentences . The court dismissed the applicant 's appeal in a decision of CARDINAL DATE . Basing its decision on ORG judgment no . CARDINAL , the court held that extension of the application of the special regime to the applicant was justified in the light of the information gathered by the police and judicial authorities . However , it struck down some of the restrictions previously placed on the applicant , namely suspension of the rehabilitation programme ; restrictions on visits by family members ; the prohibition of parcels containing anything other than clothing ; the ban on the purchase of food requiring cooking and the restriction of time spent outdoors to TIME per day . The applicant appealed on points of law against the above decision . The hearing in private was set down for DATE . On that date the appeal was declared inadmissible as being devoid of purpose , the decree 's period of validity having in the meantime expired .", "CARDINAL .

In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG once again extended application of the special prison regime by DATE . That decision was based on grounds similar to those of the previous ones . The applicant challenged the above decree in the ORG court responsible for the execution of sentences , which dismissed his appeal in a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ruling that extension of application of the special regime to the applicant was justified in the light of the information gathered by the police and judicial authorities . However , it struck down some restrictions previously imposed , namely suspension of the rehabilitation programme , restrictions on visits by family members , the prohibition of parcels containing anything other than clothing , the ban on the purchase of food requiring cooking , and the restriction of outdoor exercise to TIME per day . The applicant appealed on points of law against the above decision but in a judgment of DATE his appeal was ruled inadmissible as being devoid of purpose , since the decree 's period of validity had expired in the interim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG judge responsible for the execution of sentences , complaining of the regime under which he had been placed . The judge dismissed that appeal in a decision of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE . He noted that the restrictions the applicant had complained of had been imposed by the prison authorities by means of departmental orders which , without exception , implemented the Minister of ORG 's decrees and were therefore lawful ; he further emphasised that defendants DATE unlike convicted persons DATE were not required to participate in the rehabilitation programme on account of the principles of the presumption of innocence and the freedom to defend oneself .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG extended the special regime for DATE and ordered the governor of the prison to apply to the competent court for authorisation to censor all the applicant 's correspondence . On DATE the governor of ORG applied for authorisation to the GPE judge responsible for the execution of sentences , who informed the judge who had jurisdiction , namely the PERSON judge responsible for the execution of sentences . The latter ordered censorship of the applicant 's correspondence for DATE , starting on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decree of CARDINAL DATE to the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences , which transmitted his appeal on DATE to ORG . ORG returned it to the PERSON court on DATE as jurisdiction over the matter had changed in the interim ( see paragraph CARDINAL below in fine ) . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON court responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG revoked the restriction on outdoor exercise .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG ordered that the applicant should cease to be subject to the special regime .", "CARDINAL . A number of letters and the observations sent by the applicant to the ORG of ORG through his wife arrived with censors ' stamps from the prisons of GPE , GPE , ORG , ORG and ORG Censorship continued until DATE .", "CARDINAL . Letters sent by the applicant to his wife , in particular those of CARDINAL and DATE were censored ; the applicant was informed of this on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The appeals by the applicant to the courts responsible for the execution of sentences were censored by the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL bis of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , gives the Minister of ORG the power to suspend application of the ordinary prison regime as laid down in Law no . CARDINAL of DATE in whole or in part , by means of a decision stating grounds which is subject to judicial review , for reasons of public order and security in cases where the ordinary prison regime would be inadequate to meet these requirements .", "CARDINAL . Such a measure can be applied only to prisoners charged with or sentenced for the offences mentioned in LAW , which includes offences relating to ORG activities .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , application of the section CARDINAL bis special regime was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The measures which may result from application of section CARDINAL bis are the following :", "\u2013 a ban on participating in the preparation of food and organising prisoners ' recreational activities ;", "\u2013 a ban on visits by persons other than family members , a cohabitant or a lawyer ;", "\u2013 a maximum of CARDINAL visits and CARDINAL telephone call per month ;", "\u2013 censorship of all the prisoner 's correspondence except for that with his lawyer ;", "\u2013 not TIME per day to be spent outdoors ;", "\u2013 no extra visits allowed for good conduct ;", "\u2013 restrictions on acquiring or receiving from outside prison personal possessions authorised by the prison 's internal rules ;", "\u2013 CARDINAL parcels per month ;", "\u2013 no sums of money to be received from outside prison or sent out ;", "\u2013 no handicrafts involving the use of dangerous tools .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ter of the Prison Administration Act provides for an appeal ( reclamo ) to the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( tribunale di sorveglianza ) against a decree of the Minister of ORG imposing the special regime within DATE from the date on which the person concerned receives a copy of the decree . Such an appeal does not have suspensive effect . The court must take a decision within DATE . LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE requires an appeal to be lodged with the court responsible for the execution of sentences which has geographical jurisdiction over the prison where an appellant is serving his sentence . An appeal to ORG lies against the decision of the court responsible for the execution of sentences .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having been asked to rule on whether such a system complied with the principle of non - encroachment on matters reserved for the legislature , held ( in judgments FAC . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE ) that section CARDINAL bis was compatible with the LAW . It observed that while the special prison regime within the meaning of the provision in question was in practice laid down by the Minister , an appeal lay against a ministerial decree to the courts responsible for the execution of sentences , which had the power to review both the need for such a measure and the actual measures to be applied to the prisoner concerned , which in any event ought never to entail inhuman treatment .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG held , on the basis of LAW , which provides , inter alia , that restrictions on correspondence may be imposed only by means of a court decision whose grounds are stated , that the power to order censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence belonged to the courts alone . As a result , section CARDINAL bis could not be interpreted to include a power on the Minister of ORG 's part to take measures relating to prisoners ' correspondence .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG has held that the courts responsible for the execution of sentences should confine themselves to reviewing the lawfulness of a ministerial decree as such , and could not usurp the role of the administrative authorities in the choice of the actual measures to be taken . On the other hand , the courts responsible for the execution of sentences have in practice gone so far as to review whether each specific measure is in accordance with the aim pursued by the administrative authorities . The result of this had been that decisions of the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had often remained unexecuted , and this had given rise to conflicts between those courts and the administrative authorities .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE the ORG established the principle that the power of judicial review by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences extended to the practical arrangements for implementation of a measure , regard being had both to the aim pursued and to the fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW . ORG , moreover , changed the line of its case - law on the question even before ORG judgment , by allowing the court responsible for the execution of sentences to strike down , in whole or in part , the application of unlawful measures ( see judgments nos . DATE of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , applying the principles laid down by ORG in the above - mentioned judgment , ORG of ORG sent a circular letter to the governors of prisons regarding organisation of the wings where prisoners subject to the special regime are held . This circular contained , inter alia , the following instructions : prisoners would from then on be allowed to use the kitchens ; they would have access to rooms equipped for sporting activities and to a library ; visits by family members could be replaced by telephone calls ; the use of glass partitions would continue but , as a result , the searching of visitors need not be so strict .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of PERCENT DATE ORG reaffirmed that section CARDINAL bis was compatible with the LAW , while changing and clarifying the interpretation to be given to it . It held , inter alia , that decrees imposing the special regime had to be based on genuine public - order and security grounds , and that decisions to extend application of the regime also had to be based on sufficient grounds which were independent of those which had justified the imposition of the rules in the first place . ORG held that the special regime should not amount to inhuman treatment or hinder the prisoner 's rehabilitation , which would be contrary to LAW . It nevertheless stated that at no time did LAW cease to apply , under which the treatment to which a prisoner is subjected must respect his personality , and a rehabilitation programme must be prepared and adapted on the basis of scientific observation of the prisoner 's personality and with his cooperation .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act also remained applicable . This provided that cultural , sporting and recreational activities should be promoted and organised in prisons \u2013 as should any other activity allowing the expression of the prisoners ' personalities within the rehabilitation programme . These activities had to be organised , of course , in such a way as to prevent any contact between the person concerned and the ORG or criminal environment from which he came . Emphasising that the special regime had to respect the aim of returning the prisoner to normal society , ORG held that the principle of the presumption of innocence was not infringed by the fact that the special regime could be imposed on suspects before a final conviction . In fact , application of the special regime did not stand in the way of early release ( see ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , which presupposed the prisoner 's previous participation in the cultural , sporting and recreational activities provided for in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with the principles laid down by ORG in the above - mentioned judgment , ORG of ORG sent a circular letter to prison governors concerning the organisation of the wings where prisoners subject to the special regime are held . This circular included , inter alia , the following instructions :", "\u2013 outdoor exercise time was to be increased to TIME per day , but care was to be taken to ensure that outdoor exercise did not become an opportunity for meeting or making contact with other persons presumed to be associated with the ORG ;", "\u2013 the outdoor exercise yards in LOC and Pisa Prisons were to be equipped for physical exercise and sport ;", "\u2013 one or more rooms for social , cultural or recreational activities were to be provided in each wing to which prisoners subject to the special regime were permanently assigned or which were occupied by them for medical reasons ;", "\u2013 on the question of work , the circular stated that where it was not possible to equip a prison appropriately prisoners should have access to premises equipped for this purpose in other prisons , with measures in place to exclude any opportunity of meeting or making contact with other persons presumed to be associated with the ORG ;", "\u2013 visits by children DATE could take place without a glass partition ; if the visit took place in the presence of other persons , partition - free access was to be authorised for the children only and was not to exceed CARDINAL of the total duration of the visit in length ;", "\u2013 prisoners subject to the special regime could receive parcels containing foodstuffs apart from those requiring cooking , because they were not to be allowed to use the kitchens except for the purpose of making hot drinks or heating up pre - cooked food .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , provides that the authority empowered to order the censorship of prisoners ' correspondence is the court before which proceedings are pending ( whether the investigating court or the trial court ) until the delivery of the first - instance judgment , and the court responsible for the execution of sentences during any subsequent proceedings . Section CARDINAL also provides that the court with jurisdiction may order the monitoring of a prisoner 's correspondence in a decision stating reasons , but it does not set out the cases in which such a decision may be made .", "CARDINAL . NORP In practice , the censorship concerned means interception of all the correspondence of the prisoner subject to the order , which is then read by the judicial authority which ordered it , by the governor of the prison or by prison staff designated by the governor . The letters are then marked with the censor 's stamp , which serves as proof that they have been read ( see also LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , implementing the above - mentioned PERSON no . CARDINAL ) . This supervisory measure can not lead to the erasing of words or sentences , but the judicial authority may order that CARDINAL or more letters should not be delivered . In such cases , the prisoner must be immediately informed of this . Such an order may also be made provisionally by the governor of the prison , who must , however , inform the judicial authority .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , with regard to the remedies available against censorship of correspondence , ORG has stated in several decisions that it constitutes an administrative act . Moreover , ORG has affirmed in its settled case - law that NORP law does not provide remedies in this respect ; nor can censorship form the subject of an appeal on points of law since it does not concern the prisoner 's personal liberty ( ORG judgments nos . CARDINAL of DATE of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Prison Administration Act provides that prisoners may make sealed applications or complaints to the following authorities :", "\u2013 the governor of the prison , prison inspectors , the Director - General of Prisons and the Minister of ORG ;", "\u2013 the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ;", "\u2013 the judicial and health authorities which inspect the prison ;", "\u2013 the President of ORG ; and", "\u2013 the President of the Republic ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
