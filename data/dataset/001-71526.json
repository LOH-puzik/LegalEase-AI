It found that the applicant \u2019s conviction was disproportionate considering the excessive length of the proceedings , a delay of DATE attributable to the conduct of the lower courts and the relatively insignificant charge and thus violated the applicant \u2019s rights to a fair criminal trial as guaranteed by LAW of LAW in conjunction with the principle of proportionality enshrined in the rule of law .", "ORG found , first , that the overall length of the proceedings as such , which amounted to DATE , was unreasonable . According to ORG , the applicant had considerably contributed to the length of the proceedings by his own legitimate conduct during the proceedings , such as by filing CARDINAL appeals on points of law , by lodging several requests to postpone the hearings , by at first refusing the taking of evidence by blood sample in DATE and by complicating the serving of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . However , neither the delays caused by the applicant \u2019s own conduct nor the delays caused by ORG appeals could justify the overall length of the proceedings . In this respect , ORG noted that the charge of drunken driving was of a relatively minor nature and that the complexity of the case was low and did not necessitate any extensive taking of evidence .", "Furthermore , the Federal Constitutional found that there had been a total delay of DATE which was imputable on the domestic courts . In this respect , ORG confirmed the finding of the lower courts , which had identified delays from DATE ( date on which the driving licence was returned to the applicant ) to CARDINAL DATE ( scheduling of a new date for the main hearing ) , from DATE ( return of the case - file to ORG after the second appeal decision ) to CARDINAL DATE ( scheduling of a main hearing ) , from DATE ( adjournment of the hearing ) to DATE ( scheduling of a new hearing ) and from CARDINAL DATE ( adjournment of the hearing ) to DATE ( decision on the termination of the proceedings ) .", "With respect to the applicant \u2019s complaint about further delays amounting to DATE , ORG found that these did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . It found , notably , that ORG decision to order the taking of evidence by blood sample was comprehensible . The delay between the adjournment of the hearing in DATE and DATE had been sufficiently explained by the competent judge \u2019s illness . ORG further accepted the delay between DATE and the hearing held on DATE .", "ORG further found that those delays which had been caused by the remittal of the case to the first instance courts did not violate the obligation to expedite the proceedings . This could only apply if the judgments of the first instance courts had been flagrantly violating the law , which had , however , not been the case .", "Turning to the consequences the length of the proceedings had on the applicant , ORG noted that , according to a medical attestation of DATE , the applicant had with a high probability developed a psychological disorder which negatively affected his quality of life and necessitated a rapid termination of the proceedings . Furthermore , the applicant had been deprived of his driving license for DATE . ORG finally noted that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against the applicant .", "Taking into account these elements , in particular the minor nature of the charge , the overall length of the proceedings and the hardships on the applicant , ORG found that it was unjustified to impose a criminal sentence on the applicant . It followed that the proceedings had to be discontinued without a criminal conviction . ORG further ordered GPE to reimburse the applicant the necessary expenses incurred by his constitutional complaint .", "On DATE the case - file was returned to ORG .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG judge requested ORG to consent to a termination of the proceedings .", "DATE and DATE the case - file was dispatched to ORG in GPE .", "On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE and requested ORG to consent to a termination of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings pursuant to section CARDINALb of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see relevant domestic law below ) . It further ordered that the ORG fees had to be borne by the ORG and that the applicant was to be reimbursed CARDINAL of the necessary expenses incurred by the proceedings .", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If a less serious criminal offense is the subject of the proceedings , the public prosecution office may dispense with prosecution with the approval of the court competent for the opening of the main proceedings if the perpetrator \u2019s culpability is considered to be of a minor nature and there is no public interest in the prosecution ....", "( CARDINAL ) If charges have already been preferred , the court , with the consent of the public prosecution office and the accused , may discontinue the proceedings at any stage thereof ... \u201d", "Section CARDINALb", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the conditions apply under which the court may dispense with imposing a penalty , the public prosecution office may , with the consent of the court which would have jurisdiction over the main hearing , dispense with preferment of public charges .", "( CARDINAL ) If charges have already been preferred the court may , with the consent of the public prosecution office and of the accused , discontinue proceedings prior to the beginning of the main hearing . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
