PERCENT is owned by the second applicant \u2019s wife and son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively the first applicant concluded CARDINAL contracts with ORG ( PERSON fond za gra\u0111evinsko zemlji\u0161te , poslovni prostor i puteve PERSON ) . Under the first contract the first applicant obtained the right to use ( pravo kori\u0161\u0107enja ) CARDINAL plots of development land ( gra\u0111evinsko zemlji\u0161te ) with a total surface of QUANTITY , on which it planned to build a shopping centre and an office building . The second contract concerned the communal charges for the necessary infrastructure on the land at issue ( naknada za ure\u0111enje gra\u0111evinskog zemlji\u0161ta ) . On an unspecified date thereafter the CARDINAL plots of land were joined into CARDINAL , marked as no . CARDINAL . Pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the first applicant became the owner of the land at issue on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued a decision by which it divided the cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL into CARDINAL , CARDINAL of which kept the number CARDINAL/CARDINAL and had QUANTITY , and another one which was registered as no . ORG and which had QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was further split into CARDINAL , the smaller part of QUANTITY becoming a cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL . The bigger part kept the number CARDINAL/CARDINAL and measured QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant \u2019s plan for the shopping centre and the office building was registered in DATE ( NORP urbanisti\u010dki plan , \u201c DUP \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the DUP for the relevant area was changed , one of the changes being that the cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and an adjacent plot of land of QUANTITY , owned by the Municipality , were joined into CARDINAL urban plot ( urbanisti\u010dka parcela ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the GPE decided to change the relevant DUP further , which decision entered into force on DATE . Construction in the area was prohibited thereby for DATE except in case of those investors who had already obtained a building permit prior to this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another decision was issued , providing that the DUP would be changed within DATE and construction was further prohibited until the adoption of a new DUP but DATE at most . The ban did not apply to the investors who had already obtained a building permit . This decision entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new decision to change the DUP was issued , revoking the previous CARDINAL decisions . As regards its contents it corresponded to the decision of DATE . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new DUP was issued ; it entered into force on DATE . Thereby the adjacent plot of land that had previously been added to plot no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was apparently split into CARDINAL : CARDINAL parts became parts of CARDINAL newly - formed urban plots of land and the third part remained attached to the applicant \u2019s land and would appear to be part of a traffic route ( saobra\u0107ajnica ) . It would also appear that in this urban plot of land the DUP planned the construction of CARDINAL buildings instead of the shopping centre planned by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new decision to change the DUP was issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DUP was changed again , apparently providing for the construction of buildings similar to those initially planned to be built there by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Following the changes of the DUP in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the first applicant contacted ORG ( Direkcija za imovinu ; \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in LOC . It sought to \u201c complete \u201d the urban plot , that is to buy the adjacent cadastral plot of land which had been added to its own land , thus forming CARDINAL urban plot of land ; having received no reply it renewed its request on CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE issued ORG , which stated that the cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was smaller than the relevant urban plot and that it needed to be \u201c completed \u201d ( potrebno je izvr\u0161iti njeno dokompletiranje ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) granted the first applicant a location for the construction of business LOC on plot no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in accordance with the DATE DUP . The decision specified that LAW DATE were a constituent part of this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed , having received no reply from the FAC . DATE the ORG informed the first applicant that no completion of plots could be done given that the revision of the DUP was ongoing at the time , which meant \u201c urbanistic reconsideration of the area \u201d at issue .", "CARDINAL . By DATE there had been CARDINAL remittals , either by the GPE \u2019s Chief Administrator ( as the competent second - instance body ) or ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the course of these proceedings , on DATE the ORG enquired at ORG if the same urban plot of land , as it had existed at the time when the first applicant had first filed a request for completion , could be formed again . On DATE ORG replied that the size of the said plot of land had been changed in the meantime and that there was no basis for re - forming the urban plot as it once had been .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s request again . On DATE the Chief Administrator upheld this decision , considering that due to the changes of the planning documents the completion of the said plot of land could not be done and that therefore the first applicant \u2019s request had been correctly dismissed . On DATE the first applicant instituted an administrative dispute before ORG , which would appear to be still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested ORG ( PERSON izgradnju i ORG ; \u201c the Agency \u201d ) , a legal successor of ORG , to calculate the final communal charges for the urban plot no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG replied that the calculation could not be made due to the construction ban .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the first applicant urged the ORG to make the necessary calculation , submitting that the ban applied only to construction and not to the calculation of charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant made its own assessment of the communal charges in the amount of ORG euros ( ORG ) and made the payment . The payment was returned DATE as it had been made \u201c without cause \u201d ( upla\u0107en bez osnova ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings the applicant repeated its request to the ORG on several occasions , including DATE , submitting that the construction ban as the basis for refusal was unlawful and/or the ban was not in force at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the applicant \u2019s request had been refused by the ORG CARDINAL times on the grounds that construction was banned pursuant to either the decision to change the DUP of DATE or the decision of DATE . The ORG also held that the calculation could not be done as the first applicant had no building permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second - instance body rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal on the grounds that this was not a matter for administrative proceedings . The first applicant initiated an administrative dispute before ORG in this regard but in view of the opinion of the second - instance body it withdrew that claim , and instead pursued the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( GPE sud ) in GPE against the ORG for refusing to calculate the communal charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the first applicant and ordered the ORG to calculate the charges . The court considered in particular that the first decision to change the DUP , which prohibited construction , had entered into force on DATE and expired on DATE , while the next decision had entered into force on DATE . Therefore , there had been no construction ban before DATE or CARDINAL and DATE , when the first applicant requested the communal charges to be calculated and when the ORG was bound to calculate them . The court also noted that the ORG \u2019s reasoning for refusing the first applicant \u2019s request , notably that \u201c the calculation [ could ] not be done as the first applicant had no building permit \u201d was illogical , since the calculation of charges was a pre - condition for getting a building permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG and ORG upheld the previous decision on DATE and DATE respectively . ORG held , inter alia , that the first applicant had been granted the location for construction by the competent Ministry before it was decided that the DUP would be changed and that a decision to change the DUP could not affect the investors who had already been granted a location .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG calculated the charges . It provided for a new contract to be concluded with the first applicant , which specified that pursuant to the DATE contract the applicant had already paid a certain amount and that the remaining amount to be paid was ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon the first applicant \u2019s request , ORG issued an enforcement order , which provided that the ORG would calculate the charges within DATE or it would face a penalty of LAW , and would have to calculate the charges within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant received the above calculation from the ORG . On DATE it requested that the contract specify in accordance with which DUP the construction would be undertaken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG replied that the first applicant \u2019s request was outside the ORG \u2019s competence and that the first applicant should address bodies in charge of urban planning in that respect . On DATE the Agency notified ORG that it had complied with its judgment and the enforcement order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant informed ORG that it did not consider the relevant judgment enforced as it had \u201c serious objections \u201d to the documents submitted by the ORG due to which it had not signed them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed ORG that the first applicant had no objections in respect of the calculation itself , and noted that no statute provided for an obligation or a possibility for the first applicant to sign the calculation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested a building permit for the shopping centre from the Ministry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant notified the Ministry that the ORG was refusing to calculate the charges and asked the ORG to urge that the ORG do so . On DATE the Ministry responded that it had no competence as regards matters relating to the calculation of the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant informed the Ministry that it had done the calculation itself and had made the payment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry dismissed the first applicant \u2019s request on the grounds that it had not paid the communal charges or completed the urban plot pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant instituted an administrative dispute before ORG . It submitted , inter alia , that the requirement to buy an adjacent plot of land had been introduced in addition and was unnecessary given that the shopping centre was planned entirely on the cadastral plot of land no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It also maintained that the refusal to calculate the charges was groundless as the ban related to construction only and not to the calculation of the charges , and that it was a deliberate obstruction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim on the grounds that there was no contract between the first applicant and the ORG concerning the communal charges , that the first applicant had failed to submit all the evidence required by the relevant statutory provision in order to obtain a building permit , and it had failed to obtain an adjacent plot of land as required by LAW . The court did not deal with the first applicant \u2019s explicit submission that the said requirements were unlawful and/or unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the first applicant lodged a request for judicial review before ORG , maintaining that there was a contract between itself and the Agency concluded in DATE . It also submitted that the courts had blamed the first applicant for not paying the charges and completing the plot , even though it had done everything it could to comply with these requests , and had actually complained about the unlawfulness of the relevant State bodies\u2019 refusal to cooperate in these matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the previous decision , considering that the first applicant had indeed failed to submit proof that it had paid the communal charges and completed the urban plot as requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the change of the DUP in DATE , the first applicant requested a building permit for \u201c central activities building \u201d ( za izgradnju objekta centralnih djelatnosti ) . On DATE , after CARDINAL remittals , the proceedings were still pending .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the first applicant filed CARDINAL motions with ORG for the assessment of the constitutionality and legality of the decisions to change the DUP issued on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings ( obustavlja se postupak ) upon the first motion as the impugned decision of DATE was no longer in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG rejected the other CARDINAL motions .", "CARDINAL . The DUP in the area at issue was subject to changes in DATE ( the changes in DATE were done pursuant to the first applicant \u2019s request to that effect ) , DATE ( entered into force in DATE ) , DATE ( entered into force in DATE ) , DATE , DATE and DATE . The purpose of the land also changed over time , from \u201c sports and recreation \u201d to \u201c central activities \u201d ( centralne djelatnosti ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the first applicant obtained a number of permits related to the planned construction of the shopping centre ( electro - energetic , water supply , sanitation , geo - mechanic , urbanistic , as well as those related to fire safety , environmental protection , workplace safety , traffic , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE there were CARDINAL other requests relating to the land in respect of which the DUP was changed ( CARDINAL of which were also for completion of relevant plots of land ) . In all CARDINAL cases the claimants were informed that their requests could not be met in view of the changes which the DUP was undergoing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry sent a letter to the mayors of all GPE . The letter stated , in substance , that \u201c certain local government units \u201d interpreted section CARDINAL of ORG o planiranju i ure\u0111enju prostora ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which provided for a possibility of a construction ban where appropriate , in a way that was incompatible with its contents , essence and meaning . The Ministry further explained that a decision on \u2018 a construction ban\u2019 related exclusively to a ban on issuing a decision granting a location , as a document on the basis of which a building permit was issued , and that in a case where the decision on location had been issued prior to the construction ban , the competent body had a duty to issue a building permit to an investor , provided that the conditions provided in section CARDINAL of LAW ( Zakon o izgradnji objekata ) were fulfilled , regardless of whether the construction ban in the relevant area was in force .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the first applicant was granted a location and was issued urban planning conditions for the construction of a warehouse in another part of GPE . It also obtained other relevant consents ( concerning water supply , electricity , fire protection , traffic , ecology , sanitation , etc . ) and the ORG \u2019s urbanistic consent to technical documentation . On DATE it concluded a contract with the Agency concerning the charges , and on DATE it obtained a building permit for that location . By DATE it had built the warehouse and obtained a permit to use it ( upotrebna dozvola ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the first applicant \u2019s proposal to that effect , a meeting was held between the representatives of the first applicant and the ORG . The ORG undertook to study the first applicant \u2019s submissions in relation to the urban plot of land no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , including the one that it had not been allowed to honour all the obligations . It would appear , however , that the first applicant never received any response from the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
