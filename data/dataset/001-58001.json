He reached FAC on DATE via GPE and the GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG He requested refugee status on CARDINAL DATE and was interviewed on DATE by ORG ) . On that occasion he stated that his uncle had been an active member of ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) and that his father and his brother , though not members of the ORG , had assisted his uncle and been executed on that account in DATE . Since then he and his family had been suspected of belonging to the ORG and taking part in acts of rebellion . His car had been confiscated and he had been assaulted , as was evidenced by a still - visible scar on his left forearm . He had left GPE through fear of being arrested and executed .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG rejected the application , but on appeal by the applicant the Minister of the ORG reversed this decision on DATE and granted refugee status within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He considered that PERSON could not be required to return to his homeland , regard being had to his activities in an opposition group and the general situation in the country concerned . His statements , which appeared credible , gave grounds to fear that , in the event of his return to GPE , he would suffer persecution there within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) in GPE , acting pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ordered the forfeiture of the applicant \u2019s refugee status . This decision followed a judgment of DATE in which ORG ( PERSON ) sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL and a half years\u2019 imprisonment for attempted robbery ( versuchter ORG ) : together with an accomplice , PERSON had struck a passer - by in the face and attempted to steal his wallet .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Minister of the ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant . He pointed out that under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of ORG a refugee lost refugee status if he committed a \" particularly serious crime \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) showed that the legislature considered that expression to mean any offence punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding DATE . Since attempted robbery was punishable by up to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , the applicant had forfeited his refugee status and any other consideration relating to the correctness of his conviction or the situation in GPE was superfluous .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON contested this decision in ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) , which set it aside on DATE . ORG held that the applicant \u2019s conviction for a particularly serious crime had only evidential relevance ; it could not be deduced therefrom that , ipso facto , the applicant constituted a danger to NORP society within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . Such a conclusion , which suspended the protection ( PERSON ) afforded by that LAW in spite of the continuing risk of persecution , could only be reached after the interests of the refugee and those of the host ORG had first been weighed against each other , the result being unfavourable to the former . The measure involved such a restriction of the refugee \u2019s personal rights ( pers\u00f6nliche Rechtssph\u00e4re ) that it had to be really necessary for one of the reasons set out in the provision concerned . In order to determine whether that was so , it was necessary to assess the future conduct of the person concerned , but in the present case the Minister had neglected to do so .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Minister of the ORG again ordered the forfeiture of PERSON refugee status . Referring to the Administrative Court \u2019s decision ( see paragraph DATE above ) , he first noted that the applicant had been found guilty of attempted robbery , a particularly serious crime within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . He went on to mention other measures taken against the applicant , namely a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) for criminal damage ( ORG ) in DATE , a fine of ORG CARDINAL for threatening behaviour ( ungest\u00fcmes ORG ) in a police station in DATE and a complaint by the police to the GPE public prosecutor alleging criminal damage in DATE . Although , taken separately , these offences did not represent any danger to society , taken together they nevertheless revealed a clear tendency to aggression . It could not therefore be excluded that the applicant might commit further offences in future , which made him a danger to society .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG upheld the above decision , holding in particular that in carrying out an assessment of the applicant \u2019s dangerousness ( GPE ) the Minister had validly relied on events prior to his imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , on DATE , ORG ) had issued an indefinite exclusion order ( unbefristetes PERSON ) against the applicant under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and ordered that after serving his sentence he was to be detained with a view to his expulsion ( Schubhaft ) . It noted that in view of the applicant \u2019s convictions and the seriousness of CARDINAL of the offences , namely attempted robbery , it could not be excluded that he would continue to offend . Therefore , in order to preserve public peace , order and security , and to prevent PERSON from committing crimes within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW of LAW , it appeared to be essential to deport him , even though that measure incontestably constituted an interference ( ORG ) in his private life .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against the above decision on DATE , asking the authorities to find , under LAW of LAW , that his expulsion would contravene section DATE of the same Act ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , but reduced the period specified in the exclusion order against him to DATE . It considered that ORG had correctly weighed the conflicting interests and had had valid reasons to form the view that revoking the expulsion would have much more serious detrimental effects on the community than on PERSON . It further noted that the applicant could not yet be regarded as integrated into NORP society , as he had lived there for DATE and had been in prison since DATE . Nor did he have family or other links with the country . As for his occupational activities , these did not require any particular qualification and could therefore also be carried on abroad . Moreover , the applicant had been unemployed at the time of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . ORG After being released on parole ( bedingte PERSON ) , the applicant was taken into custody at the GPE police headquarters on DATE with a view to his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) upheld an appeal by PERSON against the above measure ( Schubhaftbeschwerde ) on the ground that , as ORG had extended the provisional measure indicated under Rule CARDINAL of its Rules of Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , deportation of the applicant before expiry of the DATE maximum period for detention of that type ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) seemed to be out of the question . The applicant was therefore released .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr PERSON appeared before ORG with a view to the possible application of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He asserted that the situation in GPE had deteriorated since his departure in DATE . He was a member of the PERSON clan , which at that time was being persecuted , especially by the generals in power . His clan , who lived QUANTITY to the north of GPE , had supported General PERSON , but had later withdrawn that support and since then had been on the run from him as well . He could therefore not return to the country without risking his life .", "On DATE ORG declared the proposed expulsion of the applicant lawful ( zul\u00e4ssig ) . It took the view that , taken together , the offences he had committed revealed a tendency towards aggressive behaviour and even increasing aggressiveness ( steigendes PERSON ) , which did not stop short of violence against the person . It could therefore not be excluded that PERSON might commit other offences in future , so that he constituted a danger to the community within the meaning of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . That being the case , even the fact that he risked persecution in the event of his return to GPE could not make his deportation to that country unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the ground that there were no solid reasons to believe that on his return to GPE he might suffer treatment prohibited by LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . According to the established case - law of ORG , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) contemplated only dangers and threats emanating from a ORG . Since the overthrow of President PERSON a civil war had been raging in GPE and all ORG authority ( staatliche PERSON ) had disappeared . Moreover , there was nothing to suggest that the applicant might be persecuted in GPE for CARDINAL of the reasons set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) . Lastly , there would not be any breach of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article DATE ) of LAW either , since under section CARDINAL the mere fact that on returning to his home country an alien might be risking his life was not a sufficient bar to expulsion .", "CARDINAL . ORG On appeal by the applicant , ORG set aside the above decision on CARDINAL DATE . Thereupon ORG found on DATE that in GPE PERSON would be at risk of persecution for one of the reasons set out in LAW . On DATE it accordingly stayed his expulsion for a renewable period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW of DATE , as amended by LAW of DATE , a \" refugee \" is defined as any person who \" owing to well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country \" .", "LAW provides :", "\" CARDINAL .
