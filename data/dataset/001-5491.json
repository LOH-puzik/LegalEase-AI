CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP citizens living in various parts of GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "In the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , i.e. until the independence of GPE , the applicants had specially protected tenancies on privately - owned flats . These flats have always been privately - owned , i.e. they have never been taken from the ownership of their owners by acts of nationalisation , confiscation or any other form of expropriation . The applicants still occupy those flats .", "On DATE , the ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) and on DATE , LAW ( Zakon o najmu stanova ) . While the first one regulates the sale of publicly - owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy , the second regulates the conditions of leasing of privately - owned flats , including those previously let under a specially protected tenancy .", "The applicants lodged a constitutional claim with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , arguing that certain provisions of LAW and ORG violated the constitutional guarantees of the right to enjoy their possessions , the respect and protection for family life and discriminated against former holders of specially protected tenancies on privately - owned flats .", "ORG ruled on DATE , and its decision was published in ORG ( ORG novine ) . The ORG quashed several provisions of LAW and dismissed the request to examine the constitutionality of ORG . As to LAW , the ORG quashed LAW , which obliged an owner of a flat let for an unlimited period of time to provide a lessee with another adequate flat before cancelling the lease , if the owner intended to live in the flat himself or intended to install in the flat his children , parents or his dependants . ORG also quashed LAW , point CARDINAL , which excluded from the right to \u201c protected rent \u201d a lessee who had ceased to use the flat during DATE preceding the enactment of the LAW in question . Furthermore , the ORG quashed ORG DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL restricted the lessor 's right to terminate the lease of a lessee who does not pay the rent and charges , and is over DATE of age or receiving social security benefits , only to cases where the municipality provides such a lessee with another adequate flat with a right to \u201c protected rent \u201d in an amount affordable to the lessee . LAW provided in substance the same as the above - mentioned LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL .", "B. Relevant domestic law before amendments by ORG", "The Specially Protected Tenancies ( Sale to Occupier ) Act regulates the conditions of sale of flats let under specially protected tenancies . In general , the LAW entitles the holder of a specially protected tenancy on a publicly - owned flat to purchase it under favourable conditions of sale . However , the LAW excludes from such favourable treatment the holders of specially protected tenancies on most privately - owned flats .", "The provisions of the LAW challenged by the applicants before ORG provide as follows .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL point QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that the LAW does not concern privately - owned flats let under specially protected tenancies .", "Article CARDINAL provides that where the tenant of a publicly - owned flat has not applied to purchase it under LAW , the tenant of any privately - owned flat may lodge a request to buy it . Furthermore , this provision establishes the criteria for priority in the purchase of such flats .", "Article CARDINAL regulates the spending of the funds collected through the sale of flats let under specially protected tenancies . It requires PERCENT of such funds to be used , inter alia , to provide flats for the former holders of specially protected tenancies of privately owned - flats , while PERCENT of the funds must be used to help provide flats for families with CARDINAL or more children . If the funds originate from the sale of flats in culturally protected buildings , PERCENT of those funds must be used for the maintenance and reconstruction of such buildings while the rest is to be used according to the above mentioned criteria .", "DATE provides that the private owners of rented flats may , within DATE of the LAW 's enactment , sell their flats to the municipality . The municipality is under an obligation to purchase such a flat if the tenant undertakes to repurchase the flat from the municipality . The price of such a flat will be fixed according to the provisions for determining prices of publicly - owned flats let under specially protected tenancies .", "LAW in general regulates the legal relationship between lessee and lessor in regard to the lease of flats . It recognises a special category of lessees , those who were previously holders of specially protected tenancies on privately - owned flats . Such a category is , according to the LAW , subject to a number of protections , such as an obligation for the owners to contract a lease for an unlimited period of time , the payment of a so called \u201c protected rent \u201d , the amount of which is to be prescribed by the ORG , and strictly limited reasons for termination of the lease . This LAW abolishes the specially protected tenancy as such .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the criteria for establishing the amount of \u201c protected rent \u201d are the condition of the flat in question , expenses for maintenance of the building and the lessee 's financial situation .", "DATE provides that , by enactment of the LAW in question , specially protected tenancies cease to exist and the former holders of specially protected tenancies become lessees .", "DATE provides that the former holder of a specially protected tenancy and the owner of the flat have to take out a lease for an unlimited period of time , and the lessee is entitled to pay the so - called \u201c protected rent \u201d , except where the lessee is using a part of the flat for some business - related activity ; or where the lessee is the owner of an inhabitable house or flat ; or where the flat has not been used by the lessee or any members of his family , during DATE preceding the entry into force of LAW , unless the owner had permitted their absence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
