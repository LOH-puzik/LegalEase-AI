CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , QUANTITY and CARDINAL were full - time employees at ORG ( the MDC ) , a state - owned enterprise ( DATE ) . The applicants in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL are the wife and children of Mr Attard , who also worked at GPE Drydocks during the same period ( having started in DATE ) but left in DATE to take up managerial duties with ORG , where he was no longer exposed to asbestos .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the applicants in applications nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , QUANTITY and CARDINAL and Mr ORG had been constantly and intensively exposed to asbestos during their employment . Asbestos in its various forms was one of the substances kept in stock in GPE Drydocks\u2019 storerooms and ships incorporating asbestos as part of their structure regularly entered the docks ( or ship repair yard ) and were repaired there by workers . Repairs included breaking apart the asbestos casing that was used for insulation purposes , thereby releasing the particles into the surrounding air . Once a machine was repaired , it had to be reinsulated using asbestos retrieved from the store - rooms . Such repairs were carried out both on the ships themselves and in the ORG \u2019s workshops .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contended that asbestos particles would settle on the workers\u2019 clothing and be carried around in this way , with the result that it could also affect the lives of their family members , creating further anguish and affecting their private and family life .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , GPE became a member of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and international standards \u201d below ) and of ORG ( \u201c WHO \u201d ) , both organisations having been raising awareness regarding the dangers of asbestos since DATE . At the time , however , the employees of ORG had been neither informed about nor protected from the dangers of asbestos in any way . The Government disagreed with the ORG assertion that international organisations had raised awareness of the dangers of asbestos in DATE , noting that ORG had been concluded in DATE and that the ORG had issued its guidelines much DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first publicly available \u2013 though not publicly disseminated \u2013 information concerning the fatal consequences of asbestos at ORG appears to be the judicial acts and judgment relating to a lawsuit brought in the names of PERSON proprio et nomine vs PERSON nomine , concerning the deceased PERSON ( erroneously referred to by the parties as PERSON ) who died from asbestosis in DATE . In that case , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the then ORG established ORG \u2019s responsibility for the death of PERSON and awarded ( in a separate decision of DATE ) damages under NORP law consisting of lucrum cessans and damnum emergens ( see also \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . No action was taken following that judgment save that employees were assured that adequate ventilation and the wearing of fabric masks would protect them from asbestos .", "CARDINAL . Mr Attard died in DATE , aged DATE , as a result of a malignant cancer linked to exposure to asbestos ( mesothelioma ) . Following the death of a number of their colleagues , the applicants in applications nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , GPE and CARDINAL underwent medical tests , which were performed again in DATE in the context of proceedings before the ORG . With the exception of the case of PERSON , most of the X - rays revealed bilateral pleural plaques ( extensive in some cases ) compatible with asbestos exposure . PERSON of some of the applicants also revealed pleural thickening , reticulo - nodular interstitial parenchymal texture in the lungs , and in some cases also pulmonary fibrosis , all of which are consistent with asbestosis . The results suggested that there was a strong probability of the presence of asbestos fibres in their stomach lining , as well as in other digestive organs . Moreover , apart from the physical difficulties such as exercise intolerance that were mainly related to respiratory problems , the presence of asbestos in their bodies made them prone to malignant mesothelioma , as was the case with Mr Attard , abovementioned . From the medical data it was also apparent that the applicants had no pleural effusions and that their lungs were clear , with no filtrates or nodules , and their hearts , hila and upper mediastina were also normal . Most of the applicants are nonsmokers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , Mr PERSON has been confined to bed for DATE as a result of his acute respiratory problems and can only breathe via oxygen cylinders that further reduce his mobility . PERSON medical results did not show evidence of asbestos - related disease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE these applicants instituted separate constitutional redress proceedings , complaining of a violation of ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention in that the ORG had failed to protect them from unnecessary risks to their health , which also constituted inhuman treatment and an interference with their private and family life . They asked the court to quantify a fair amount of compensation for the breach of the aforementioned rights , to liquidate that amount , and to order that this pecuniary redress be paid individually to the applicants ( \u201c PERSON xieraq b\u0127ala rimedju g\u0127al ksur tad - drittijiet fuq indikati jew mil - liema minnhom , tillikwida PERSON , u tordna PERSON ir - rimedju pekunjarju jithallas individwalment lir - rikorenti \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the Government \u2019s objection of non - exhaustion of ordinary domestic remedies in the domestic proceedings the applicants in question maintained that under NORP law the ordinary civil remedies available did not apply to non - pecuniary damage ( known in the domestic system as \u201c moral damage \u201d ) , but solely to pecuniary damage ; they claimed that these types of damage were independent of each other .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate but almost identical judgments of CARDINAL DATE the first - instance constitutional jurisdiction DATE namely , ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction \u2013 declined to exercise its powers under LAW and under LAW and discharged the defendants ab observantia iudicii thereby in effect dismissing the applications on the grounds of non - exhaustion of ordinary domestic remedies . That court held that the applicants should have instituted a civil action for damages arising out of tort or contractual liability . It considered that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law , namely GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , there was no general or absolute obligation on ORG to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage in such cases .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL judgments of DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decisions . It considered that the Government , as an employer , could be sued under civil law for their failings . It held in effect that the fact that such failings were also of a constitutional nature did not in itself mean that they could not be pursued through ordinary civil proceedings . It also held that a person could not allow the time within which to bring an ordinary civil action to expire and then resort to constitutional proceedings as a remedy in extremis . The court considered that constitutional redress proceedings could be instituted only after the applicants had instituted civil proceedings and if , after a final judgment , they still felt that the breaches of their rights had not been adequately redressed . It held that given that neither the ORG nor national law provided for compensation for non - pecuniary damage in such cases , the ordinary remedy would have been effective . In any event , according to the court , in their constitutional application , the applicants made no specific mention of non - pecuniary or moral damage , having claimed compensation for pecuniary damage only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE these applicants , who are the heirs of the deceased Mr Attard , also instituted proceedings , complaining of a violation of ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the Government \u2019s objection of non - exhaustion of ordinary domestic remedies in the domestic proceedings , the applicants submitted that under NORP law the ordinary civil remedies available did not provide for non - pecuniary damage but only for pecuniary damage ; they claimed that these types of damage were independent of each other .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction declined to exercise its powers under LAW and under LAW and discharged the defendants ab observantia iudicii , thereby in effect dismissing the claims of the applicants on the grounds of non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies . In its analysis of the principles governing the exercise of the above - mentioned powers under LAW and LAW , the court noted , inter alia , that the failure to pursue ordinary remedies by an applicant was not in itself a sufficient reason for a court of constitutional jurisdiction to decline to exercise its powers if it could be shown that the ordinary means could not provide a complete remedy . It also held that the decision to decline or otherwise to exercise such powers was to be exercised with prudence , so that where it appears that there is a serious violation of fundamental human rights or even where there is likely to be the violation of such rights , then the court should lean towards exercising its powers . Nevertheless , it considered that what the applicants were ultimately requesting was a sum of money by way of damages . Given that ordinary remedies under LAW could have resulted in an award of monetary compensation , the applicants should have pursued those remedies before instituting constitutional redress proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision for substantially the same reason indicated in paragraph CARDINAL above ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
