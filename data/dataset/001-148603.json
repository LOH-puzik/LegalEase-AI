The applications were lodged by CARDINAL individual NORP nationals , whose particulars appear in the LAW ( \u201c the applicants \u201d ) . They were represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applications were also lodged by the civic association Right to Housing ( PERSON na b\u00fdvanie \u2013 \u201c the applicant association \u201d ) , whose registered office is in GPE and of whom the applicants are members . The applicant association was represented by PERSON , its President .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the cases , as submitted by the applicants and the applicant association , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . DATE public authorities allotted flats to the applicants or their predecessors in accordance with the law then in force . Following the developments described below , their rights of use were transformed into tenancies and the houses in which the flats were located were restored to their original owners or denationalised . The applications concern the public authorities\u2019 actions in connection with the denationalisation of the housing fund in GPE , the dismantling of rent control and the impact this has had on the individual applicants . The following facts are relevant .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the fall of the communist regime in DATE , the housing system in GPE was part of a planned State - run economy . ORG in cities and towns lived mostly in flats owned by the ORG or \u201c legal persons \u201d , such as ORG - owned companies . The construction of flats and their use and allocation were managed , financed and controlled by public authorities through a centralised management structure .", "CARDINAL . Others lived in flats which had been built by housing cooperatives of which they were members . Cooperative housing was also funded primarily from public sources . Under the relevant legislation , direct and nonrefundable government grants represented PERCENT of the total costs of construction .", "CARDINAL . NORP Mostly in rural areas , inhabitants built their own family homes which were in their \u201c personal \u201d ownership . Their construction was also subsidised and promoted by the ORG by various means .", "CARDINAL . Persons living in flats owned by the ORG were holders of a right of use ( osobn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edvanie ) under LAW . They were entitled to use their flats for an indefinite period . Members of the same household as a person having a right of use were entitled to continue living in the flat after the latter \u2019s death . Holders of a right of use were allowed to participate in the decision - making processes regarding alterations and reconstruction of the houses in which they lived . Exchanges of flats between holders of a right of use were permissible and frequent . They were subjected to approval by the owner , which was generally only a formality . The amount payable for the use of flats was regulated in accordance with the central wage policy . It did not reflect the costs of construction and maintenance . Users could be evicted only in exceptional circumstances , for example if they had failed to pay the sum due for DATE or had committed a serious breach of the law in their use of a flat .", "CARDINAL . In the former GPE , to which GPE has been one of the successor GPE as of DATE , housing reforms started in DATE in the context of ( i ) measures aimed at redressing certain wrongs that had been committed under the communist regime and ( ii ) the country \u2019s transition towards a market - oriented economy . It involved the restitution of houses to former owners , the denationalisation of ORG - owned housing stock and later the gradual deregulation of rent .", "CARDINAL . New laws allowed for the restitution of property which had been taken away from owners under the communist regime . A number of dwelling houses , especially in towns , were returned to the original owners or their successors . The restitution of dwelling houses as such did not formally affect the legal position of those who had a right of use of individual flats .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the process of \u201c large - scale privatisation \u201d was started . It consisted of the denationalisation of ORG - owned enterprises . In some cases , new owners divided the property of the company of which part , including the company \u2019s housing stock , was transferred to third parties . In such cases , the users\u2019 position was similar to that described in the preceding section . In DATE a law was passed prohibiting the transfer of company - owned flats to persons other than their actual tenants .", "CARDINAL . The main objective of the housing reforms after DATE was the introduction of private ownership of housing stock . The reforms were primarily related to housing in flats .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE LAW was amended so that rights of use in respect of flats were cancelled and replaced by tenancies . Rents remained regulated . In the event of death of a tenant of a flat rented by spouses , the survivor is entitled to become the sole tenant . In other cases , tenancies are transferrable to a deceased tenant \u2019s children , grandchildren , siblings or sons or daughters - in - law , if they can prove they shared the same household at the time of death and do not have their own flat . The same right may be enjoyed by other persons who took care of the deceased tenant \u2019s household or were dependent on him or her for DATE prior to his or her death , and who do not have their own flat .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the Civil Code restrict a landlord \u2019s ability to terminate a tenancy to a limited number of cases , such as where the latter needs the flat for their own or their next of kin \u2019s purposes , or where the tenant did not need the flat or failed to comply with his or her obligations . Termination of a tenancy by a landlord must be approved by a court , and in most cases tenants may only have to vacate the flat once they have been provided with substitute accommodation .", "CARDINAL . Law no . DATE provided for the transformation of cooperatives in the context of the country \u2019s transition towards a market - oriented economy . Members of housing cooperatives were entitled to have ownership of the flats in which they lived transferred to them . They only had to pay the outstanding part of the ORG loan which had been provided in respect of the dwelling . In practice , tenants acquired ownership of cooperative flats either at a nominal price or , where the ORG loan had already been repaid , at no additional cost .", "CARDINAL . The Ownership of Flats and Non - Dwelling Premises Act DATE ( PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was enacted with effect from DATE . It allowed tenants in publicly - owned dwelling houses to buy their flats on favourable terms . The basis for calculating the price was the statistical value of a dwelling as defined in the period of the centrally planned economy . Tenants had a number of further advantages and benefits . As a result , they obtained ownership of flats at a nominal price which was only a fraction of their actual market value . The applicants indicated that CARDINAL of the reasons for the large - scale denationalisation of public housing stock was so that the majority of the population could be compensated in a situation where the denationalisation of a substantial part of ORG property , such as companies , had resulted in it being transferred to a limited number of persons .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent amendments to PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL extended its scope to cover flats the ownership of which had been transferred to a number of legal persons , such as consumption , agricultural and production cooperatives and companies . In its findings in case GPE . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG dismissed a challenge by ORG to some of the amendments . It held , among other things , that the denationalisation of housing stock , in addition to being part of the economic transformation process , aimed at eliminating discrimination against residents of flats as compared to owners of individual houses who had acquired them with the help of public resources .", "CARDINAL . The large - scale denationalisation of housing stock in GPE , especially in big towns , resulted in almost all flats being transferred to private ownership . The rental sector nearly ceased to exist , with rental flats remaining mostly in restored and privatised houses .", "CARDINAL . DATE a number of instruments of subordinate legislation were issued providing for a gradual increase in regulated rent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued Measure no . CARDINAL/R/CARDINAL . It allowed the rent - control scheme to continue to apply after DATE where ( i ) tenants or persons sharing their household did not own or co - own , on DATE , a comparable flat or inhabitable real property in the same municipality or within QUANTITY of its boundaries ; ( ii ) the landlord and the tenant did not reach a different agreement on the rent before DATE ; and ( iii ) the tenants concerned submitted a registration form to ORG before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Documents of that Ministry indicate that , by DATE registration forms had been submitted by tenants in respect of CARDINAL flats where rent control was applied . CARDINAL persons lived in those flats . The documents indicate that it was envisaged that substitute accommodation would be made available to those concerned by the reforms where this was justified by their social situation . PERCENT of the tenants thus registered lived in flats located in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that data , the authorities estimated that the rent - control scheme concerned CARDINAL flats , that is to say PERCENT of rented flats in houses that existed in DATE and PERCENT of the inhabited housing facilities which were available in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Termination and Settlement of Tenancy ( Certain Flats ) Act came into force . It was enacted with a view to eliminating rent restrictions concerning individual owners ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . In application no .
