The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is married with CARDINAL children . She has a medium - level education . Prior to her early retirement she was employed for DATE and had paid her social security contributions to the ORG . Her child , born in DATE , suffers from atopic bronchial asthma ( atopowa astma oskrzelowa ) , various allergies and recurring sino - pulmonary infections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG to be granted the right to an early - retirement pension for persons raising children who , due to the seriousness of their health condition , required constant care , the so - called \u201c EWK \u201d pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP The particular type of pension sought by the applicant was at the relevant time regulated by the ORG \u2019s Ordinance of CARDINAL DATE on the right to early retirement of employees raising children who require permanent care ( ORG PERSON . DATE w sprawie uprawnie\u0144 do wcze\u015bniejszej emerytury pracownik\u00f3w opiekuj\u0105cych si\u0119 dzie\u0107mi wymagaj\u0105cymi sta\u0142ej opieki ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Along with her application for a pension , the applicant submitted , among other documents , a medical certificate issued on DATE by a specialist in allergy and pulmonology from ORG in GPE ( GPE Opieki PERSON ) . The certificate stated that the applicant \u2019s DATE son had suffered from DATE from atopic bronchial asthma , various allergies , as well as frequent sinopulmonary infections often accompanied by fever and bronchial constriction ( spastyczne skurcze oskrzeli ) . Consequently , he was in need of his mother \u2019s constant care . It was further noted that the medical certificate had been issued in connection with the application for an early - retirement pension regulated by the DATE Ordinance in view of the need to provide permanent care to the child from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an early - retirement pension in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) gross ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL net ) , starting from DATE . In the same decision , however , ORG suspended the payment of the pension due to the fact that the applicant was still working on the date of the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant resigned from her full - time job as a clerk at ORG in PERSON , where she had been employed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on an unspecified date , ORG issued a new decision authorising the payment of the previously awarded retirement pension starting from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was issued with a pensioner \u2019s identity card marked \u2018 valid ORG and for the following DATE she continued to receive her pension without interruption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued CARDINAL decisions . By virtue of the first decision , the payment of the applicant \u2019s pension was discontinued starting from DATE . By virtue of the second decision , the ORG revoked the initial decision of CARDINAL DATE and eventually refused to award the applicant the right to an early - retirement pension under the scheme provided for by the DATE Ordinance . The latter decision stated that on DATE the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s right to a pension had been re - opened ex officio and that , as a result , \u201c the medical certificate attached to her application for a pension had been found to raise doubts [ as to its accuracy ] \u201d . Furthermore , the following standard clause appeared in the decision :", "\u201c In the light of the medical documentation obtained concerning the child , it was established that the condition with which the child had been diagnosed was not enumerated in the [ DATE ] Ordinance , and the analysis of the level of severity and the course [ of the disease ] did not indicate an impairment of bodily functions to such a degree as to justify the award of the pension [ on account of ] the necessity of permanent care of the child . It follows that the medical certificate serving as the basis for the award of the benefit is not supported by medical documentation . Consequently the right to a retirement pension is denied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE divesting her of the right to an early - retirement pension . She submitted that she should receive the benefit because her son required her constant care , as confirmed by the medical certificate attached to the original application . Moreover , the applicant alleged that the revocation of her retirement pension was contrary to the principle of vested rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . A medical report by an expert in pulmonology was ordered by ORG . Having examined the medical documentation concerning the applicant \u2019s son , as well as the child in person , the expert found that the applicant \u2019s son suffered from sporadic bronchial asthma and recurring sinopulmonary infections . The expert concluded that the child did not require , as of DATE or at the time of the proceedings , his mother \u2019s permanent care , her nursing or any further aid , since his bronchial asthma did not significantly impair his respiratory functions . He further observed that the applicant \u2019s care was needed only when the child \u2019s condition occasionally became more severe .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the above expert opinion , ORG held that the applicant had been rightfully divested of the right to a pension under the scheme provided by the DATE Ordinance as she did not satisfy the requirement of necessary permanent care . ORG did not examine the case from the standpoint of the doctrine of vested rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the aforementioned judgment . ORG agreed with the findings of fact contained in the expert opinion produced in the course of the first - instance proceedings to the effect that the applicant \u2019s son did not require at the relevant time his mother \u2019s permanent care .", "CARDINAL . On the issue of the re - opening of the proceedings , ORG observed that decisions concerning retirement and disability pensions were only of a declaratory character . Therefore , they could be quashed by a social security authority where new evidence had been submitted or relevant circumstances , which pre - existed the initial pension award but which had not been taken into consideration by the authority beforehand , had come to light .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG observed that pension decisions could be verified even in the light of pre - existing circumstances which had not been taken into consideration as a result of the authority \u2019s own mistake or negligence . On the other hand , ORG agreed with the applicant that the proceedings could not be re - opened as a consequence of a different assessment of the very same evidence which had accompanied the original application for a pension .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal found that , in the instant case , the impugned pension proceedings had been re - opened because relevant circumstances pre - existing the initial pension award had been discovered by the authority in the course of a supplementary examination of the child \u2019s entire medical record by ORG doctor ( lekarz orzecznik ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG stated that the doctrine of vested rights did not apply to rights acquired unjustly , for example when a person had been granted a right to a pension whereas in fact he or she had never met the requirements laid down in the relevant provisions . ORG recalled that the purpose behind the DATE Ordinance was to enable the carers of children with extremely severe disorders to take early retirement . It was aimed at providing a substitute source of income in cases where persons had lost their wages owing to the need to terminate their employment in order to take care of their sick children on a permanent basis . ORG emphasised that , in such circumstances , it was necessary for the social security authorities to make a careful examination of whether or not persons applying for the right in question satisfied all the requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal , fully endorsing the Court of Appeal\u2019authority had lacked evidence as to the severity of the child \u2019s condition , since the medical certificate attached to the application did not specify those activities which the child could not perform due to his alleged impairment . The fact that the aforementioned evidence had been lacking at the date of the decision did not come to light until after the validation of the decision . Therefore , the impugned proceedings had been re - opened due to the discovery of new relevant circumstances and not on the basis of a reexamination of the very same evidence attached to the applicant \u2019s application for a pension .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not ordered to return her early - retirement benefits paid by ORG from DATE until DATE , despite the revocation of her right to the early - retirement pension .", "CARDINAL . In the period from DATE ( the date on which the payment of the applicant \u2019s \u201c EWK \u201d pension was discontinued ) to DATE the applicant was not in receipt of any social benefits . The applicant submitted that in that period she had had no other income .", "As a result of separate social security proceedings , which had been instituted by the applicant , ORG ( ORG ) decided on DATE to grant the applicant a preretirement benefit ( zasi\u0142ek przedemerytalny ) in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) net . Because , under the applicable law , a DATE statute of limitations applies to social security claims the decision to grant the right had a retroactive effect , with a starting date of DATE .", "As a result , on an unspecified date , presumably on DATE , the applicant received a pre - retirement benefit in the form of a lump - sum payment for the period DATE and DATE , without interest .", "The benefit was at first paid by ORG ( Powiatowy Urz\u0105d Pracy ) and since DATE it was paid by ORG . As of DATE the applicant \u2019s preretirement benefit amounts to MONEY ( ORG ) net .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the law as it now applies , it appears that the applicant will qualify for a regular retirement pension in DATE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL applications arising from a similar fact pattern have been brought to the ORG . The applicant in the instant case and most of the other applicants form ORG ( ORG przez ZUS ) ( \u201c the Association \u201d ) , an organisation monitoring the practices of ORG in GPE , in particular in the ORG region .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted , according to the ORG , that PERCENT of the total number of \u201c EWK \u201d pension recipients had been subjected to review and re - opening under LAW of the DATE Law .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that as of DATE approximately CARDINAL individuals had been in receipt of the \u201c EWK \u201d pension . Although there were no statistics as to how many pensions had been revoked either countrywide or in each region , that number was very small .", "CARDINAL . The system of social security in GPE is regulated by LAW DATE on the system of social insurance ( Ustawa o systemie ubezpiecze\u0144 spo\u0142ecznych ) and a number of other acts applying to specific occupational groups and regulating specific types of benefits .", "Proceedings for granting welfare benefits are CARDINAL - tier . First , an application for a benefit is made to the regional ORG . The board makes an assessment of the eligibility criteria for each type of benefit and issues a decision . Then , in the event that an individual concerned appeals , the decision becomes subject to judicial review by a social security court , which is a specialised branch of a regional civil court . ORG is a ORG authority which carries out administrative functions and issues declaratory decisions . In the judicial review phase , the ORG becomes a party to the proceedings before the social security court .", "A judicial decision taken by the regional social security court may then be challenged by either party to the proceedings before a special social security branch of a court of appeal . Ultimately , a decision delivered by an appellate court may be appealed to ORG . This remedy is available irrespective of the amount of the claim .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Ordinance ceased to be in force on DATE . However , its provisions remained in operation with regard to persons who had met the requirements of an early - retirement pension before that date but had failed to apply for the benefit in due time . The conditions to be fulfilled by a person in order to qualify for an early - retirement pension were laid down by paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance .", "Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL contained a reference to LAW paragraph CARDINAL point CARDINAL of the LAW DATE on retirement pensions of employees and their families . In the relevant part it provided that persons entitled to an earlyretirement pension were those persons ( both women and men ) who had been employed for CARDINAL or DATE and who personally took care of a child .", "Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL provided that for children under the age of DATE it was not necessary to submit an official ORG disability certificate . It was sufficient to present a medical certificate issued by a specialist medical clinic stating : \u201c due to the health condition , caused by CARDINAL of the diseases enumerated in paragraph CARDINAL , the child requires permanent care \u201d .", "Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL provided that early retirement was justified by the following physical and/or mental conditions of the child :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Complete dysfunction of upper or lower limbs , pareses and palsies , which prevent the child from independent movement and from controlling his or her physiological functions ;", "CARDINAL .

Mild mental retardation with accompanying significant impairment of movement , sight , hearing or other chronic diseases significantly impairing bodily functions ;", "CARDINAL . Other diseases impairing body effectiveness to a very serious degree . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The re - opening of the proceedings concerning the benefit in question is regulated in CARDINAL of the DATE Law , which at the relevant time read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The right to benefits or the amount of benefits will be re - assessed upon application by the person concerned or , ex officio , if , after the validation of the decision concerning benefits , new evidence is submitted or circumstances which had existed before issuing the decision and which have an impact on the right to benefits or on their amount are discovered . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its resolution of CARDINAL DATE ( no . III UZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , adopted by a bench of CARDINAL judges , ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) dealt with the question submitted by the Ombudsman ( PERSON ) as to whether a different assessment of the evidence attached to the application for a pension , carried out by a social security authority after validation of the decision concerning the pension , might constitute a ground for reopening the proceedings leading to a review of the right to a pension in accordance with CARDINAL of the PERSON of DATE on retirement and disability pensions paid from ORG . The answer was in the negative . ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c A different assessment of the [ same ] evidence as attached to the application for a retirement or disability pension , carried out by a social security authority after validation of the decision awarding the right to a pension , is not one of the circumstances justifying the ex officio re - opening of the proceedings for a review of the right to a pension in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Law of CARDINAL DATE on retirement and disability pensions paid from ORG . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
