NORP The applicant company , ORG , was a NORP legal entity based in ORG , founded in DATE . It was initially represented before the ORG by its administrator , GPE From DATE , after the case was communicated to the Government , submissions in respect of the case were made by PERSON , a legal adviser practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was authorised to operate as a jewellery pawnbrokers .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , on DATE the applicant company had gold stock weighing QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) carried out an inspection of the activities of the applicant company and other companies sharing the same commercial space .", "CARDINAL . On DATE produced an inventory report of the applicant company \u2019s jewellery stock which had been on display for sale . The report was drawn up in the presence of a representative of the applicant company , who had stated that some of the jewellery had been sold at different prices depending on quality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG produced a contravention report fining the applicant company CARDINAL lei ( RON \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) because on DATE it had displayed gold jewellery for sale without a licence to sell precious metals , alloys or stones . In addition , it ordered that the gold jewellery that had been on display for sale , which weighed QUANTITY and was worth RON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . According to the contravention report , the ORG had cooperated with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to produce it .", "CARDINAL . The representative of the applicant company who signed the contravention report objected to it on the grounds that the measure taken had been unjust .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company challenged the report of DATE in the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant company \u2019s action , set aside the report of DATE and ordered the return of the confiscated jewellery . It held that according to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) case - law , proceedings seeking to challenge contravention reports fall under the criminal head of LAW ( \u201c the Convention \u201d ) and therefore the domestic authorities had to comply with the procedural guarantees set out in that Article with regard to criminal proceedings , including the right to be presumed innocent . The court further held that the fine had been imposed on the applicant company under general legal provisions and had been intended as a punishment to deter it from reoffending . Consequently , the burden of proof with regard to the applicant company \u2019s guilt was on the ORG . However , the agency had not submitted any evidence which proved the applicant company \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG allowed that appeal , quashed the judgment of the lower court and upheld the report of DATE . It held that according to the documents available , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant company had only been authorised to hold precious metals . However , it had only obtained authorisation to sell them on DATE . Moreover , according to the inventory report signed by the applicant company \u2019s representative without any objection , the report had concerned the items which had been on display for sale . Also , according to the ORG \u2019s case - law , the contravention proceedings had to comply with the procedural requirements provided for under the criminal head of LAW , which concerned both the rebuttal of the right to be presumed innocent and a relative presumption of truth in favour of the contravention report drafted by a ORG authority following its own perception of the events . Consequently , the burden of proof would have been on the ORG authority which had drafted the contravention report and the report could have been set aside only if the ORG authority \u2019s representatives had not been present when the contravention had happened and it had failed to prove the statements made in the report . But the representatives of the said authority had been present when the contravention had been committed and the report had reflected their own perceptions . The report therefore had to be presumed to reflect the truth and the burden of proof had been reverted to the applicant company in order to rebut that presumption .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that in the inventory report the applicant company \u2019s representative had stated that some of the jewellery had been sold at different prices depending on quality . Furthermore , the contravention report had been signed by the applicant company \u2019s administrator , who had objected to it on the grounds that the measure taken had been unjust , but had not contested the fact that he had been selling jewellery . The contravention report had been lawful and had contained all the lawfully required information . Moreover , the contravention and inventory reports contained similar information about the quantity and value of the items mentioned in them and had been signed by both parties without any objection in this respect . Furthermore , these inconsistencies would not have rendered the contravention report null and void and the applicant company had not proven that it had incurred damage that could have been remedied solely by setting aside the report . Furthermore , absence from the contravention report of information that the fine could have been paid immediately or within TIME had not rendered the report unlawful .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court held that all of the reasons outlined above rendered the applicant company \u2019s argument that the contravention had not existed inadmissible , because it had never intended to sell the jewellery that it had been holding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company signed a merger by acquisition ( fuziune prin absorb\u021bie ) with another company , namely ORG ORG Master Credit SRL . They agreed , inter alia , that the latter company would acquire the applicant company DATE and take over the applicant company \u2019s assets and liabilities . ORG was an associate of ORG ORG Master Credit SRL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company was struck off ( radiat\u0103 ) ORG following the merger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON submitted to the ORG a power of attorney signed by the former administrator of the applicant company authorising her to represent it .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE SC IFN Master Credit SRL changed its name to GPE Master Credit Stand - By ORG and then to ORG Stand - By ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , part of the observations on the admissibility and merits of the case were submitted by PERSON in a document headed \u201c SC Master Credit Stand - By NORP v. GPE \u201d . She did not submit within any of the time - limits allotted by ORG a power of attorney or any other document authorising her to represent ORG ORG Master Credit SRL , ORG - By ORG or PERSON Master C.
