On DATE the first applicant was committed for trial on charges of fraud and fraudulent conversion of property under attachment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was issued with a summons to appear in court .", "CARDINAL . Since the shortened form of procedure ( procedura sommaria ) was applicable , the trial was held before the same Commissario della PERSON , PERSON ORG , who had already dealt with the case as the investigating judge . Evidence was heard from the parties and from various defence witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered by the PERSON della PERSON , PERSON , on DATE and deposited at the registry on DATE the first applicant was found guilty on both charges ( fraud and fraudulent conversion of property under attachment ) , and was given a DATE suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay a fine .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first applicant appealed against that judgment . He argued , firstly , that he could not be held criminally liable and that the only issue that could be raised was that of his civil liability , basing his submission , in particular , on the content of agreements he had concluded with PERSON He also complained that he had not been given permission to consult certain accounting documents which could have established that his actions had at the very most amounted to misappropriation ( appropriazione indebita ) rather than to fraud .

As regards misappropriation , that offence DATE which had , moreover , become subject to limitation \u2013 did not preclude fraud , but should rather be added to it as a preliminary step towards it . The judge accordingly upheld the first applicant 's conviction .", "As regards the offence of fraudulent conversion of property under attachment , the judge considered that the first applicant 's explanation was legally irrelevant , since it referred to a decision delivered after the perpetration of the offences for which he had been tried . The judge also dismissed the objection that the charge of fraud was time - barred , pointing out that time had ceased to run while the expert report was being drawn up and that the limitation period had consequently not expired until DATE .", "The appellate judge also upheld the order for the attachment of the first applicant 's property and referred the case to the civil courts for quantification of the damages to be paid to the complainant .", "Lastly , the judge forwarded the procedural documents to the Commissario della PERSON , instructing him to ascertain whether the first applicant could be held liable for the fraudulent conversion on DATE of a further car under attachment .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE State Counsel appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , seeking the conviction of the second applicant DATE for possession of drugs with intent to supply , rather than merely for possession of drugs DATE and the third applicant .

The judge further held that the second and third applicants ' requests for rulings as to constitutionality were manifestly ill - founded . As regards , in particular , the absence of a public hearing on appeal , the judge concurred with the applicants ' arguments , which were based on the principles of international law , but held that the objection had been raised with a view to revising LAW , a process that could not be initiated by means of a declaration of unconstitutionality .", "CARDINAL .
