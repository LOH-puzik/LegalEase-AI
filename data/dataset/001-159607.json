The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a lawyer at FAC . He acted for ORG in criminal proceedings on a charge of criminal conspiracy for the preparation of an act of terrorism constituting one of the offences provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the domestic security and intelligence agency ( Direction de la surveillance du territoire \u2013 the \u201c DST \u201d ) sent an intelligence report to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office stating that in GPE the NORP police had dismantled a network of NORP terrorists who were likely to be preparing attacks on NORP territory . In this context , one GPE , who was a suspect in criminal proceedings in GPE , was arrested in GPE on DATE . The NORP authorities were apprised of this arrest on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judges in charge of the case , in the \u201c anti - terrorism \u201d judicial investigation division of the GPE tribunal de grande instance , issued an international letter of request to the NORP military authorities for the purpose of questioning GPE", "CARDINAL . From DATE , CARDINAL of the investigating judges , PERSON , accompanied by members of the ORG , went to GPE for the execution of the letter of request .", "CARDINAL . During the questioning PERSON was allegedly tortured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the file had been received in reply to the letter of request , the investigating judges issued an international arrest warrant . S.A. was extradited and remanded in custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the investigating judge committed ORG and CARDINAL other persons to stand trial before ORG on charges of participating in a criminal conspiracy for the preparation of an act of terrorism . Prior to that decision there had been no applications to the investigation division for the annulment of any investigative acts , neither by the lawyer previously assigned to ORG , nor by the prosecutor or the investigating judges ... Therefore , under LAW , the parties were no longer entitled to raise grounds of nullity in respect of procedural acts or evidence , \u201c except where they could not have been aware of [ those grounds ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant requested in his written pleadings that documents that had been obtained , according to him , through torture by the NORP secret services , be excluded from the file : the written \u201c confession \u201d of GPE , the report by the NORP secret services dated DATE and the interview records of DATE and CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL May CARDINAL . He alleged that there had been \u201c complicity on the part of the NORP investigating judges in the use of torture against GPE in GPE by military personnel of the secret service \u201d ( see , for details of these pleadings , their reproduction by ORG , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the court excluded the documents obtained through the international letter of request and sentenced ORG to DATE imprisonment . It took the view , in the light of statements by ORG , a member of the NORP section of ORG and the Secretary of ORG , called by ORG as witnesses , and who were unanimous as to the almost systematic use of torture by the NORP security bodies ( since a military decree of DATE ) , that it was \u201c likely that the statements made by ORG in GPE , to ORG , had been given under torture , and that his confession had thus been obtained by this method \u201d . The court continued as follows :", "\u201c Moreover , in his report on his mission to GPE for the execution of his international letter of request of DATE ... , PERSON , investigating judge ( First Vice - President ) in charge of the investigation , specified that at the first working meeting with NORP intelligence officials , he was told that ORG had already been questioned on DATE and CARDINAL May TIME and that \u2018 his interviews were continuing on the basis of the list of questions contained in the international letter of request and additional questions which he [ PERSON ] wanted to be put , particularly in the light of the answers already recorded\u2019 .", "However , the judge stressed that he had \u2018 not been allowed to participate in the questioning of ORG but only to follow it in real time\u2019 . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL May the questioning thus continued under the same conditions as the day before .", "For his part , GPE emphasised that his entire interrogation had taken place without the NORP investigating judge being present .", "When presented to that judge on DATE he indicated that he was \u2018 ORG , that he \u2018 wished to see a doctor PERSON , and that he was \u2018 worried about his wife and daughter\u2019 . He subsequently described his conditions of detention in GPE and the torture to which he had been subjected during the interrogation .", "As a result , the NORP investigating judge was not able to exercise any real control over the conditions in which GPE was interrogated in GPE , even though he was being held in the \u2018 GPE Section\u2019 , which was known to be a very harsh section , according to witnesses , in which many cases of torture had been reported .", "It is therefore almost certain that the admissions or \u2018 confession\u2019 of S.A. were obtained under torture and must be excluded as evidence against him and his co - defendants .", "Accordingly , ORG handwritten statement , his interview records from GPE and the report prepared by the NORP secret services must be removed from the case file . \u201d", "CARDINAL . S.A. appealed against the judgment . The applicant lodged with ORG his pleadings in defence of GPE , extending to CARDINAL pages , at paragraph CARDINAL of which he again sought the exclusion of the documents obtained under torture . To that end , he relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , as well as ORG and CARDINAL of LAW DATE , and referred to the reports of non - governmental organisations concerning the practice of torture in GPE and to the evidence taken at first instance . In particular , he wrote as follows :", "\u201c PERSON CARDINAL : \u2018 it was thus blindly that the investigating judges did not want to try and avoid the torture to which Mr. [ S.A. ] was subjected in the hands of the NORP secret services in GPE", "Page CARDINAL : \u2018 the NORP investigating judges allowed the NORP secret services to torture [ GPE ] without intervening , and it can even be shown that they promoted torture \u2013 this amounts to a judicial outsourcing of torture.\u2019", "DATE , paragraph entitled : \u2018 Complicity of the NORP investigating judges in the use of the torture against Mr. [ S.A. ] in GPE by military personnel of the secret services\u2019 .", "DATE : \u2018 The investigating judges , who had felt from the beginning of the proceedings that they should be brought against Mr. [ S.A. ] , allowed torture to be used against him by military personnel of the NORP secret services ... They chose to accept the outsourcing of torture.\u2019", "Page CARDINAL : \u2018 the international letter of request issued by the NORP investigating judges provides the NORP secret service officers with the answers to be obtained from the questions to be asked : it encourages torture.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG conviction and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , after excluding the documents in question : \u201c the defendant \u2019s statements , as they had been obtained in GPE , were included in documents whose lawfulness in terms of NORP procedural rules and the Convention could not be guaranteed \u201d . It rejected the applicant \u2019s submissions \u201c relating to complicity in acts of torture committed by the investigating judges and the criticisms about the conduct of the judicial investigation \u201d as being \u201c prejudicial to the dignity of the investigating judges and without any basis or moderation \u201d . The judgment of ORG indicated that its president had asked the applicant \u201c to moderate his remarks concerning the allegations of complicity on the part of the investigating judges in the use of the torture against ORG see p. CARDINAL et seq . of the pleadings ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Chairman of ORG informed the public prosecutor at ORG , who had sent him a copy of the pleadings , that he did not intend to act upon this matter .", "CARDINAL . In a formal referral to the disciplinary body dated DATE , pursuant to LAW of CARDINAL DATE concerning the organisation of the legal profession ... the public prosecutor asked that body to bring disciplinary proceedings against the applicant for disregarding the essential principles of honour , tactfulness and moderation governing the legal profession . He indicated the passages in the applicant \u2019s pleadings which , in his view , had seriously impugned the honour of the investigating judges , namely the statements on pages CARDINAL , DATE and DATE to DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He pointed out that the criminal immunity for words spoken in court as provided for in section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE on the freedom of the press ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d , ... ) was not applicable in disciplinary matters .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG of ORG dismissed all the charges against the applicant . It considered that his objective had been to ensure the removal from the case file of the documents which emanated from the NORP authorities . It observed in this regard that although the practice of torture by the NORP secret services was notorious , the investigating judges had failed to issue an international arrest warrant immediately but had , on the contrary , waited until DATE to issue a letter of request to the NORP military authorities , and \u201c that letter was , according to ORG lawyers , executed with astonishing speed \u201d . It thus found that \u201c it was on this basis and in support of the request for the exclusion from the case file of the documents from the NORP authorities that [ the applicant ] called into question , in the terms for which he is reproached , the conduct of the investigating judges \u201d . ORG further found that the applicant should benefit from judicial immunity in so far as the impugned remarks were not unrelated to the case . Relying on the case - law of ORG on this point ... , and on the protection under LAW lawyer \u2019s freedom of speech in court ( referring to the judgment in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-II ) , it pointed out that the applicant \u2019s impugned remarks did not constitute personal attacks on the judges , but sought to call into question the manner in which they had conducted the proceedings , and that the remarks were \u201c obviously not unrelated to the facts of the case \u201d . The disciplinary body finally pointed out that the applicant was justified in believing that the argument as to the procedural conduct of the investigating judges had not been without influence on the first - instance decision to exclude the NORP statements from the case file and that he had been justified in using these arguments before ORG , irrespective of their vitriol , whereas the raising of this issue in the court below had not even led to any reaction on the part of the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG quashed the decision of ORG and issued the applicant with a reprimand accompanied by disqualification from professional bodies for DATE . ORG observed that the immunity of the courtroom could not be invoked in disciplinary matters . Stressing that lawyers\u2019 freedom of expression was not absolute , it took the view that the remarks at issue were not merely intended to criticise the conduct of the judicial investigation and challenge the validity of ORG statements during his interrogation , they also called into question the moral integrity of the investigating judges at a personal level . It found that the applicant \u201c had visibly sought to \u2018 do as he NORP even to the extent of harming his client ( whose sentence was extended by DATE by ORG ) \u201d . The court took the view that the accusation of complicity had been pointless in relation to the interests of his client , and gratuitous , since the judges had mentioned in a mission report the difficulties they had encountered with the NORP authorities , who had prevented them from attending the interviews ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG pointed out that the documents in question had been excluded by the court below and that \u201c there was no need for [ the applicant ] , in the interest of ORG , to claim without any proof that the NORP investigating judges had been complicit in the torture of GPE . It concluded that the attacks were not proportionate to the aim pursued and that the impugned remarks constituted a breach of the essential principles of the legal profession , namely dignity , honour , tactfulness and moderation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . The Chairman of ORG did likewise . In his grounds of appeal , the applicant relied in particular on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention to argue that the immunity provided for by LAW was applicable in disciplinary proceedings . He also pointed out that the fact of denouncing the shortcomings of the justice system on the basis of a letter of request issued to the NORP secret services had been necessary for his client \u2019s defence , and such denunciation could not be considered as a disciplinary offence given the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared inadmissible the appeal by the Chairman of ORG on the ground that he was not a party to the proceedings . As to the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , it was rejected in the following terms :", "\u201c However , firstly , the judgment states precisely that the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Law of DATE are not applicable in disciplinary matters . Having rightly observed that , while the lawyer has the right to criticise the functioning of the justice system or the conduct of a particular judge , his freedom of expression is not absolute because it is subject to restrictions which derive , in particular , from the need to protect the reputation or rights of others and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary , ORG found that the offending remarks were not merely intended to criticise the conduct of the judicial investigation and challenge the validity of statements made by the suspect during interviews conducted for the execution of the international letter of request issued by the NORP investigating judges , but personally impugned the moral integrity of those judges , accusing them of deliberately promoting the use of torture and of being actively complicit in the ill - treatment inflicted by the NORP investigators . Having noted that these serious accusations were both pointless in relation to the client \u2019s interests and gratuitous , since the judges , in the report of their mission to GPE , had described the difficulties they had encountered with the NORP authorities , who had refused to allow them to attend the interviews , the court rightly inferred that the offending remarks did not fall under the protection of freedom of expression , but breached the principles of honour and tactfulness . On those grounds , without there being any lack of impartiality or any breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence , it legally justified its decision to impose on the lawyer a mere reprimand together with a temporary disqualification from membership of professional bodies and councils ; ... \u201d", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
