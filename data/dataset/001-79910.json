Mr PERSON submitted that he was the only breadwinner in his family and that his detention might cause serious hardship for his family , including his elderly mother who suffered from cardiac disease .

It appears from the photographs and video recording submitted by the Government that in the lawyer - client meeting room of the LOC detention centre , the space for detainees is separated from the rest of the room by a door and a window . The window appears to be made of CARDINAL plates of glass . Both plates have small holes pierced with a drill ; however the holes do not coincide so that nothing can be passed though the window .

The relevant findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) , read as follows ( unofficial translation ) :", "\u201c DATE . Although not a deliberate ill - treatment , the ORG is compelled to point out that at prison No . CARDINAL , the vast majority of prisoners were subjected to a combination of negative factors - overcrowding , appalling material and hygiene conditions , virtually non - existent activity programmes - which could easily be described as inhuman and degrading treatment .", "In contrast , in all the other detention areas , living conditions of the vast majority of the prison population left a considerable amount to be desired . In the most of the cells , the living space per prisoner was well below the minimum standard set and the cramming in of persons had reached an intolerable level . ... In addition , the delegation observed that cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 to CARDINAL m\u00b2 accommodated CARDINAL people .", "Furthermore , in these cells access to natural light was very limited , artificial lighting was mediocre , and the air polluted and rank . For prisoners still under investigation ( i.e. over QUANTITY prisoners ) , the situation was even worse , their cells being virtually totally without access to natural light because of the thick external metal blinds covering the windows . By force of circumstances , the equipment was reduced to the bare minimum , comprising metal or bunk beds which were extremely rudimentary and in a poor state , and a table and CARDINAL or CARDINAL benches . Furthermore , in many cells , there were not enough beds and prisoners had to share them or sleep in turns . In addition , the bedding was in a bad condition ; the very small stocks of mattresses , blankets and sheets was not enough and many prisoners without family or resources had to sleep just on the bed frame and/or the mattress .", "The cells had a sanitary annex , a real source of infection . Above the NORP toilet was a tap which served both as a flush and as a source of water which prisoners could use to freshen up or wash . Moreover , this area was only partially partitioned by a small low wall QUANTITY high , which meant that it was not possible to preserve one 's privacy .", "The state of repair and cleanliness in the cell blocks , overall , was also of considerable concern . In addition , many of the cells were infested with cockroaches and other vermin and some prisoners also complained that there were rodents .", "To sum up , the living and hygiene conditions for the vast majority of the prison population were execrable and , more particularly , constituted a serious health risk . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG recommends that the right of access to a lawyer as from the very outset of custody be rendered fully effective in practice . It also recommends that detainees be able to receive visits from lawyers in conditions fully ensuring the confidentiality of the discussions . ...", "CARDINAL . In certain prisons , particularly those serving as remand establishments , the situation was exacerbated by sometimes severe overcrowding ( as at Prison No . CARDINAL in PERSON , which in DATE held CARDINAL prisoners , compared with an official capacity of CARDINAL . ...", "The DATE visit showed how urgent it is for the authorities to put their plans for legislative reforms into effect ; the extension of the prison estate does not constitute a solution . As already stressed in the previous ORG report , it is far more important to revise the current legislation and practice concerning detention on remand and sentencing and execution of sentences , and the range of available non - custodial sentences . This is a sine qua non if there is to be any hope in the near future of offering decent conditions in prisons . ...", "CARDINAL . ... the follow - up visit to Prison No . CARDINAL in PERSON revealed positive changes which the ORG welcomes . It particularly approves of the removal of the heavy blinds covering the windows of cells looking onto the interior of the establishment .", "That said , the appalling living conditions and state of hygiene in buildings I , II and III , including the transit cells , described in DATE and DATE of the previous report , had not changed ( except as far as access to natural light is concerned ) . Indeed , the acute overcrowding in these buildings exacerbated matters still further . In the few cells viewed that were properly equipped and fitted out , this was due to the prisoners themselves , who had been able to procure what was needed from their families . \u201d", "\u201c b. Remand Centre of ORG", "CARDINAL . The material conditions in this remand centre were in clear contrast to those in the remand centre of ORG . The cells , approximately CARDINALmCARDINAL , could accommodate a maximum of CARDINAL detainees . They had access to daylight , had sufficient artificial lighting and were well ventilated . They had partially separated toilets and lavatories , as well as full bed linen ( mattress , sheets , pillow , blanket ) . ...", "In sum , the material conditions in this remand centre prove that it is clearly possible to ensure in GPE adequate material conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . The situation in the majority of penitentiaries visited , faced with the economic situation in the country , remained difficult and CARDINAL recounted a number of problems already identified during the visits in DATE and DATE in terms of material conditions and detention regimes .", "Added to this is the problem of overcrowding , which remains serious . In fact , even if the penitentiaries visited did not work at their full capacity \u2013 as is the case of prison no . CARDINAL in which the number of detainees was sensibly reduced in comparison with that during the last visit of the Committee \u2013 they continued to be extremely congested . In fact , the accommodation capacity was still based on a very criticisable CARDINAL per detainee ; in practice often even less .", "CARDINAL . The follow - up visit to Prison no . CARDINAL in PERSON does not give rise to satisfaction . The progress found was in fact minimal , limited to some current repair . The repair of the ventilation system could be done due primarily to the financial support of civil society ( especially NGOs ) , and the creation of places for DATE walk was due to support by the detainees and their families .", "The repair , renovation and maintenance of cells is entirely the responsibility of detainees themselves and of their families , who also pay for the necessary materials . They must also obtain their own bed sheets and blankets , the institution being able to give them only used mattresses .", "CARDINAL . ... In sum , the conditions of life in the great majority of cells in FAC and the transit cells continue to be miserable . ...", "Finally , despite the drastic reduction of the overcrowding , one still observes a very high , even intolerable , level of occupancy rate in the cells .", "CARDINAL . ... everywhere the quantity and quality of detainees ' food constitutes a source of high preoccupation . The delegation was flooded with complaints regarding the absence of meat , dairy products . The findings of the delegation , regarding both the food stock and the communicated menus , confirm the credibility of these complaints . Its findings also confirmed that in certain places ( in Prison no.CARDINAL , ... ) , the food served was repulsive and virtually inedible ( for instance , presence of insects and vermin ) . This is not surprising , given the general state of the kitchens and their modest equipment .", "GPE authorities have always emphasized financial difficulties in ensuring the adequate feeding of detainees .
