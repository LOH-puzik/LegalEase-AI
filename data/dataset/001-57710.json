On DATE he was examined by an investigating judge of ORG . He signed the document \" Examination of the accused \" , which indicated that a preliminary investigation ( vorl\u00e4ufige PERSON ) had been opened and that he had been placed in detention on remand because of the risk of his absconding and that of repetition of the offences ( LAW paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG ordered his detention pending trial , for the reasons invoked by the investigating judge . Previously PERSON had tried to evade prosecution by changing his place of residence so that if released he was liable to evade trial or to go into hiding to forestall his future conviction .

The aggravated fraud of which the accused was strongly suspected had resulted in a loss of CARDINAL NORP schillings . The file had become exceptionally voluminous on account of the large number of facts and of the contradictions in PERSON statements and those of his co - accused . The most recent findings of the investigation , and the scope and complexity of the case , made it necessary to leave the prosecuting authorities sufficient time to prepare the indictment and , if necessary , the subsequent proceedings in the assize court .

It feared that the applicant would abscond and cross the frontier clandestinely ; it was immaterial whether it was true , as the applicant claimed , that he did not have identity papers allowing him to go to GPE , that he was banned from entering that country and that he faced prosecution in GPE . There was also a risk of repetition of the offences as the applicant had CARDINAL previous convictions , including a sentence to QUANTITY , imposed by ORG , for fraud and forgery . ORG did not consider that the duration of the detention was excessive at that stage , having regard to the likely sentence in the event of conviction , and deemed the grounds for the detention sufficiently well - founded to rule out other less stringent measures .", "CARDINAL .
