SWEDEN (No. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE , and living in GPE , GPE .", "In DATE he bought a property of CARDINAL sq . m , GPE CARDINAL , in the centre of GPE in the municipality of GPE , a suburb QUANTITY south - west of GPE . On the property there is a CARDINAL - family house .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant bought the property it was covered by a so - called subdivision plan ( avstyckningsplan ) , adopted in DATE . According to this plan no building could be constructed on a plot of CARDINAL sq . m until sufficient water and sewerage facilities had been provided for . Such facilities appear to have been built at DATE . The property was also covered by an area plan ( omr\u00e5desplan ) , adopted in DATE , which described the property mainly as a public area containing open spaces , streets and car parking , and by a building prohibition made pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( byggnadslagen ) DATE and issued on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first building prohibition under LAW was issued by ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen \u2013 \u201c the Board \u201d ) of GPE as far back as DATE and was valid for DATE . This prohibition was subsequently prolonged by ORG for DATE each time . The last decision was taken on CARDINAL DATE and was valid until DATE . On DATE , with the entry into force of LAW DATE ( Plan- och DATE \u201c the DATE LAW ) replacing LAW , the existing system for prohibition on construction was abolished and replaced by a possibility for ORG ( byggnadsn\u00e4mnden ) to defer its decision on an application for a building permit , or a preliminary opinion on an application , for a maximum period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Ever since he bought the property in question the applicant has tried in vain to obtain from the competent authorities a permit to divide his plot and/or to build , in addition to the existing house , more houses on it . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of PERSON stated in a preliminary opinion , requested by the applicant , that it was not prepared to permit the division of his property into smaller plots , referring inter alia to the area plan adopted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kommunfullm\u00e4ktige ) adopted a master plan ( generalplan ) relating to part of the municipality of PERSON , according to which the applicant \u2019s property was earmarked for blocks of flats of CARDINAL storeys . On DATE the ORG stated , in reply to a request from the applicant , that having regard to the master plan it was not prepared to grant him either an exemption from the building prohibition or a permit to build a CARDINAL - family house and a garage on the property . The applicant appealed to the ORG claiming that the building prohibition was invalid . ORG rejected the appeal on DATE , stating inter alia that in its opinion the proposed buildings could be contrary to the aim of the prevailing prohibition and hinder future town planning as indicated in the master plan of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kommunstyrelsen ) adopted an area programme according to which the area in which the applicant \u2019s property is situated should be used for the construction of multi - family housing in DATE . It also stated that the planning procedure should be given priority . On DATE ORG adopted a building programme to the same effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stated in a new preliminary opinion requested by the applicant that it would not be prepared to grant any building permit in view of the existing building prohibition . The applicant \u2019s appeals against this were , as before , unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a new area plan covering inter alia the applicant \u2019s property . This plan mentioned the possibility of using the area for single or multi - family housing development .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings and the interference with the applicant \u2019s enjoyment of his possessions referred to above formed the subject matter of the Allan Jacobsson v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) . In that case the ORG concluded that there had been no violation of LAW CARDINAL . On the other hand , it found that there had been a violation of LAW in that the applicant did not enjoy a right to a court to enable him to challenge the decisions whereby the building prohibitions on his property were maintained in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the above case was pending before the Convention institutions , the applicant requested under LAW ( which had entered into force on DATE ) a preliminary opinion from ORG on whether a permit to build a house on his property could be granted . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided , however , pursuant to the rules laid down in GPE , to defer its decision on the request for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It informed the applicant that a building permit could not be expected for the time being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the expiry of the above DATE period ORG revoked the detailed development plan ( previously called a subdivision plan ) which had been in force since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision ORG confirmed , on DATE , its preliminary opinion of CARDINAL DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s request for a building permit . In its reasons ORG referred to the need for a new detailed development plan and to the GPE \u2019s intention to earmark the land for single or multi - family housing development in accordance with the area plan adopted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , however , the applicant had lodged an appeal with ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) of GPE against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE revoking the DATE plan . On DATE the ORG declined to entertain the appeal on the grounds that , under LAW , ORG was the competent body . Leave to appeal against this decision was refused by ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He observed that under LAW , section DATE , of GPE , a decision ( on building permission ) could be postponed if work had been initiated to amend , revoke or adopt a plan . However , in the present case , such steps had only been taken DATE before the expiration of the DATE period within which the planning measure should be completed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , he maintained that the above - mentioned provision had only authorised alternative measures , not a combination of measures which , as here , consisted of a revocation of a plan in order to amend it or adopt a new plan . By proceeding in this manner , the Municipality had circumvented the legal time - limit for consideration of his request for a building permit . The applicant further pointed out that a revocation should comply with , inter alia , LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE Act which requires the authorities to take into consideration both private and public interests ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant invited the ORG to find that the revocation of the detailed development plan was to be considered as a real revocation , not as a method of prolonging the time - limit for deciding on his application for a building permit . In the alternative , he requested that his application be examined without undue delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the appeal and upheld the revocation by ORG of the detailed development plan of DATE , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The area is covered by a detailed development plan , approved by ORG on DATE . Pursuant to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE LAW for the plan is to be considered as having elapsed .", "In such circumstances the municipality has a strong position in respect of the right to revoke a detailed development plan , something which has been exemplified by the fact that the revocation may be decided without the rights which derived from the plan being taken into consideration ( LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of GPE ) . This presupposes that public interests militate in favour of revocation . The existence of such interests has been expressed by the issuing of an area plan for GPE .", "The review of issues under LAW must take into consideration both public and individual interests , unless otherwise has been specifically provided . The above provision is an example thereof . The meaning of this provision is that the person who has obtained a right according to the plan can not rely on it during the examination of whether the plan should be repealed . However , when it comes to examining the contents of a new plan the main rule in LAW , section CARDINAL , concerning the individual \u2019s interests must obviously be considered , but even in these circumstances it is not required that the rights under the old plan must be respected . As regards the adoption of a new plan , LAW does not constitute an obstacle to the adoption being preceded by a revocation of a detailed development plan . The possible result of an examination of a request for a building permit in respect of a new construction on GPE CARDINAL following revocation of the detailed development plan can not be examined in this case . The applicant \u2019s submissions in support of his appeal do not provide a reason for refusing the implementation of the decision appealed against . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to the ORG , which , on DATE , rejected it on the grounds that they agreed with the assessment made by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the provisions of LAW ( lag QUANTITY om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) the applicant challenged the ORG \u2019s decision in ORG . He also requested the court to examine a request for a building permit and to hold an oral hearing .", "The applicant stressed that , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of GPE , where steps had been taken to draw up , amend or revoke a detailed development plan , ORG could , pending the completion of the planning measure , postpone its decision on a request for a building permit . If the Municipality had not completed the measure within DATE , the request should be decided without delay . It followed from this provision that a prolongation of the said period could not be made by means of revocation of the plan . Moreover , the Municipality had not been free to opt for both revocation and either amendment of the plan or adoption of a new plan . In the applicant \u2019s view , whilst the plan in question had been revoked with a view to adoption of a new plan , the measure fell to be considered as an amendment of the plan . Since the amendment had not been effected within the DATE time - limit , the Municipality had not been permitted both to amend and revoke the plan . Revocation of the plan was meaningless as LAW , section DATE , did not apply to a detailed development plan the completion of which had not been subjected to any time - limit . Contrary to what the Board and the Government had suggested , LAW , should apply in his case . In view of these considerations , the applicant requested that the ORG \u2019s decision be quashed and that his application for a building permit be examined without further delay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints against the ORG \u2019s decision . ORG held :", "\u201c According to section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] ORG must , at the request of a private party in certain administrative matters dealt with by the ORG or an administrative authority , examine whether the decision is contrary to any legal rule .", "In the present case the examination concerns the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . In this decision the ORG rejected an appeal lodged by [ the applicant ] against a decision of ORG of Stockholm to uphold a decision to revoke [ the DATE detailed development plan ] concerning a land area within GPE . This means that ORG can not in the present proceedings examine [ the applicant \u2019s ] request to be granted a building permit . ORG dismisses [ avvisar ] this request and rejects the request for a public oral hearing .", "As regards the question whether the revocation of [ the DATE plan ] is contrary to any legal provision , it can be established that the plan , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of GPE , was to be regarded as a detailed development plan with regard to which the implementation period had elapsed . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE Act such a plan may be amended or annulled without regard to the rights which may have accrued during the plan \u2019s existence . The latter provision constitutes an exception to the main rule in LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE Act that consideration must be given to both public and private interests when examining issues under LAW ( see Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The facts of the case do not indicate that the revocation of the plan is contrary to LAW , section CARDINAL , or LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE Act or to any other provision in the law . The decision is upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Planning and Building Act which entered into force on DATE contains provisions about the planning of land and water areas as well as building . Their purpose is to promote a development of society characterised by equal and good living conditions for people DATE and for future generations , whilst having due regard to the freedom of the individual ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
