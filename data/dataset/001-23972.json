In DATE and DATE , after Mr PERSON had indicated his interest in coming to an arrangement with the public prosecution service , the GPE public prosecutor Mr A. , who was responsible for the supervision of the activities of ORG ( Criminele Inlichtingen DATE \" CID \" ) , explored the possibilities of reaching an arrangement whereby Mr PERSON would give statements about others involved in cocaine trafficking in exchange for a reduced sentence . Although no such arrangement was reached in the end , PERSON did DATE in the course of the negotiations DATE give statements about , among others , the applicant who had not been a suspect in the ORG investigation . These statements were recorded on tape .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) convicted PERSON of involvement in the importation of CARDINAL and QUANTITY of cocaine and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was acquitted in so far as the charges related to a shipment of QUANTITY of cocaine . PERSON , the GPE public prosecutor in charge of the prosecution of PERSON before ORG , filed an appeal .

In these statements , PERSON admitted that he had been involved in the shipment of QUANTITY of cocaine of which he had been acquitted .", "After having obtained the advice of ORG ( ORG \u2013 \u201c ORG ) of the public prosecution service ( openbaar ministerie ) , as required by the Directive on arrangements with criminals ( PERSON afspraken met criminelen ) of DATE , ORG ( College van procureursgeneraal ) approved the arrangement with Mr Z. The arrangement was formally concluded and consigned to writing on DATE .", "This arrangement stipulated inter alia that , in exchange for further truthful statements by PERSON on his own role and that of , among others , the applicant in drug trafficking , the public prosecution service would make a positive recommendation that PERSON request for a partial pardon ( gratie ) be granted . Furthermore , in the context of the proceeds of crime proceedings against PERSON , it would make a proposal for a settlement within the meaning of LAW ) to the effect that Mr Z. would pay LAW Netherlands guilders [ LAW ] ( \u201c NLG \u201d ) for illegally obtained gains .", "On DATE , the applicant was taken into police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of involvement in the importation of hashish via GPE . On the basis of statements given by PERSON in the context of the arrangement of DATE , additional suspicions arose in respect of the applicant concerning his involvement in the importation of large quantities of cocaine . The applicant was eventually summoned to appear before ORG to stand trial on charges of participation in and directing a criminal organisation involved in the importation of cocaine , participation in and directing a criminal organisation involved in the importation of hashish , importation via GPE of CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and/or QUANTITY of cocaine , and ( attempted ) importation via GPE of QUANTITY of hashish .", "In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings in the course of which CARDINAL hearings were held DATE and CARDINAL DATE and in which it had assessed the reliability of the written and oral evidence of PERSON in light of the arrangement of DATE and had accepted the lawfulness of this arrangement , ORG convicted the applicant of participation in a criminal organisation involved in the importation via GPE of cocaine , participation in and directing a criminal organisation involved in the importation of hashish via GPE , importation of very large quantities of cocaine and QUANTITY of hashish , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and payment of a fine of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ PERSON euros ] . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) .", "DATE and DATE , DATE hearings were held before ORG . In the course of the proceedings the following relevant events occurred .", "At the hearing held on DATE , ORG agreed to summon CARDINAL of the CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the applicant , including Mr Z. , various officials of the public prosecution service , cosuspects and other witnesses . It rejected the applicant 's request to add to his case file copies of the ORG investigation documents , including the prosecution 's closing speech and appeal submissions in the criminal proceedings against Mr PERSON as well as all documents relating to the proceeds of crime investigation against PERSON held that the defence could question the GPE public prosecutor PERSON , who had been summoned at the request of the defence to give evidence before ORG , on the criminal investigation and proceedings taken against Mr Z. As to the applicant 's request that all documents on the arrangement concluded with Mr PERSON be included in his case file , the ORG stated that it assumed that all these documents were already so included . ORG requested the advocate - general in charge of the applicant 's prosecution before ORG to verify whether this assumption was correct and whether , for reasons linked to the interests of the investigation and/or the safety of others , there remained objections to rendering legible passages in these documents that had been rendered illegible . It further rejected the applicant 's request that all correspondence between PERSON lawyer and the prosecution authorities be included in his case file as it had not been demonstrated by the applicant that PERSON and his lawyer had no objections to the disclosure of these privileged documents .", "The GPE public prosecutor PERSON gave oral evidence before ORG on DATE and DATE . He denied that the applicant had been a suspect in the ORG investigation , which had concerned another suspect . He further stated that statements given by PERSON in the context of the first attempt to reach an arrangement \u2013 the ORG not having been involved in that attempt \u2013 had been recorded on tape . Although that tape should have been destroyed as no arrangement had been reached , it was still in existence . He further testified that he had not been involved in the further round of negotiations with PERSON on a possible arrangement . As to the reasons for the withdrawal of the prosecution 's appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON Z. , Mr A. testified that this appeal had been filed because the prosecution had considered that there was sufficient evidence to convict PERSON also of the shipment of QUANTITY of cocaine and that the sentence imposed was too low . However , after the GPE advocate - general PERSON who at the material time had been unaware of the further negotiations with PERSON on a possible arrangement \u2013 had concluded that this appeal would stand no chance of success , it had been withdrawn . The withdrawal of the appeal as part of the arrangement with PERSON had never been a topic of discussion . He further denied ever having spoken with PERSON about whether an appeal in the case of PERSON was opportune or feasible .", "The public prosecutor PERSON gave oral evidence before ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , in particular on the arrangement concluded with PERSON and the procedural steps taken in this context . In reply to questions on a possible link between the withdrawal of the prosecution 's appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and this arrangement , PERSON stated that he had told the GPE public prosecutor PERSON that it would be convenient to file an appeal since this might induce PERSON to give a statement . He had never spoken with the advocate - general PERSON about the chances of success of such an appeal , nor with PERSON about the withdrawal of the appeal . He had informed the CTC of PERSON wishes in relation to a possible arrangement and DATE on the basis of information he had subsequently obtained and verified \u2013the GPE public prosecution department was prepared to withdraw the appeal . However , the GPE chief public prosecutor PERSON , apparently having changed his opinion , had subsequently informed the ORG President that he opposed the withdrawal of the appeal . This had given rise to an exchange of correspondence on whether PERSON had misinformed the ORG . As PERSON had not submitted this correspondence , ORG \u2013 acting on a request by the defence \u2013 ordered him to submit the correspondence to the advocategeneral for inclusion in the applicant 's case file . This correspondence was subsequently added to the applicant 's case file . In so far as passages in the ORG documents had been rendered illegible , PERSON pointed out that , according to the covering ORG letter of the acting ORG President of CARDINAL DATE , this had been done for the protection of others and the needs of the investigation interests . Mr B. further stated that he had been involved in the determination of what passages should be rendered illegible and that he subscribed to the reasons given by the acting ORG President for rendering these passages illegible . PERSON refused to answer the question whether these passages concerned investigations DATE whether on - going or not yet opened DATE against other suspects .", "In the course of PERSON hearing before ORG on DATE , ORG examined a request of the defence to order the full disclosure of all passages rendered illegible in the ORG documents submitted to ORG . The defence argued that these passages might contain unknown information intended to convince the ORG of the necessity to conclude an arrangement with PERSON After having deliberated , ORG rejected this request , holding :", "\u201c The request of the defence is rejected and the witness [ Mr B. ] is not obliged to answer questions about the contents of the passages rendered illegible in the ORG documents . The court notes that it does not have the impression that on this point relevant information has been withheld by the witness , and that it must assess the arrangement on the basis of the available material in the case file , irrespective of the contents of the passages rendered illegible in the ORG documents . \u201d", "At the hearing held on DATE , the financial police detective Mr F. was heard before ORG . He testified that he had carried out a proceeds of crime investigation into Mr Z. in the context of the ORG investigation and that the ORG investigation had not been directed against the applicant but against other suspects . He had not completed the proceeds of crime investigation into PERSON , as PERSON of ORG ( Landelijk Rechercheteam ) had informed him in DATE that this investigation could be brought to a halt . He was of the opinion that , on that occasion , Mr J. had told him that the public prosecutor PERSON would conclude an arrangement with Mr Z.", "Mr PERSON gave extensive oral evidence before ORG on CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , and CARDINAL DATE . He confirmed having given CARDINAL statements in DATE in the context of his arrangement with the prosecution authorities . He declared that he maintained these statements . Mr PERSON also confirmed that earlier statements given by him to Mr A. had been recorded on tape .", "At the hearing held on DATE , the defence requested that the tape - recorded conversations between Mr Z. and PERSON be played to ORG . PERSON indicated that he objected to this . Having deliberated , ORG decided :", "\u201c ... that , on the assumption that Mr PERSON will give his permission , the tapes must be submitted on the understanding that the court prefers to play these tapes in private . \u201d", "At the hearing held on DATE , the defence reiterated its request to have the tapes played in public . The President of ORG indicated that the decision previously taken by ORG to play the tapes in private had also been influenced by PERSON view that DATE in conformity with his agreement with Mr DATE the contents of the taperecorded questionings would not be made public if no arrangement was reached as well as by the position adopted by PERSON on the matter . The latter indicated that he would withdraw his permission to allow the tapes to be played if they were to be played in public . The applicant 's lawyer then informed ORG that , in these circumstances and in the interests of the defence , he withdrew the request to have the tapes played in public . ORG then ordered that the tapes be played in private , expressly pointing out that it had decided to listen to these tapes for the purpose of assessing the reliability of Mr Z.", "The tapes containing the statements given by PERSON on DATE and DATE were played to ORG , sitting in private and in the presence of the parties , during its hearings on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In his statements recorded on tape , PERSON mentioned a person he had called \u201c PERSON \u201d ( pastry man ) and , some time later , mentioned the applicant by name . In his oral evidence to ORG , PERSON explained that , at the material time , he had not known that the applicant was the person known as \u201c Taartman \u201d and that the detectives who questioned him had told him that the applicant was \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "The GPE advocate - general PERSON gave oral evidence on DATE , in particular on her involvement in the appeal brought by the prosecution against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON stated that the GPE public prosecutor PERSON had sought her views , in her capacity as the contact advocate - general for the GPE regional public prosecution department , on the chances of the appeal succeeding . She had not known then that the GPE public prosecutor PERSON had been in charge of the prosecution of PERSON before ORG or that PERSON was involved in ORG activities . She recalled that , in her telephone conversation with PERSON , the word \u201c deal \u201d had been mentioned and that no deal had been concluded . She had not pursued this topic and had no knowledge about the contents of any deal with PERSON After having discussed the case with PERSON over the telephone , she had concluded that an appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE would stand no chance of success as there was insufficient evidence to support the facts of which Mr PERSON had been acquitted . She had never seen an appeal memorial of the prosecution in that case and explained that such a memorial only became important once the decision had been taken to pursue an appeal . She did not know that the appeal had in fact been withdrawn and that , in the context of an arrangement , Mr PERSON had made CARDINAL statements . She further had not had any contacts with the ORG about Mr PERSON 's case .", "When heard before ORG on DATE , the GPE public prosecutor PERSON declared that the applicant had never appeared as a suspect in the ORG case . She had dealt with that case until DATE when she had fallen ill for DATE . To her knowledge , the ORG public prosecutor PERSON had not had any involvement in the ORG case . At CARDINAL point she had heard from PERSON that he was having talks with PERSON about a possible arrangement . She and PERSON had then agreed that Mr A. would deal with the arrangement and that she would handle the criminal proceedings against PERSON , and that PERSON dealings as regards an arrangement would in no way influence her handling of the criminal proceedings . However , at the first court hearing in the criminal proceedings against Mr PERSON , his lawyer had made references to an arrangement which had caused some consternation . After this experience , she took the view that an arrangement was not desirable as it could jeopardise the criminal proceedings . She had filed an appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE because she had felt that there was sufficient evidence , albeit difficult to assemble , of PERSON involvement in the shipment of QUANTITY of cocaine of which he had been acquitted and because she had found that the sentence imposed was too low . She had prepared an appeal memorial , which she could submit to ORG . After she had filed the appeal , she had been contacted by PERSON who had told her that negotiations were being held with Mr Z. about a possible arrangement . Until that point , she had been unaware of these further negotiations on an arrangement and , in her opinion , an appeal could only be withdrawn on legal grounds . PERSON had also asked her about the proceeds of crime investigation against Mr PERSON which , at that time , had not yet been completed . She had informed her superior , the GPE chief public prosecutor PERSON , about her conversation with PERSON , indicating to PERSON that she felt that this development was not the proper way to go . PERSON had agreed with her and had taken up the issue with someone else . She did not know the name of that person . She did not remember having been contacted by PERSON before she had filed the appeal and she had only filed the appeal because she disagreed with ORG judgment and definitely not on the basis of a conversation with Mr B. Considering the case to be a rather special one , PERSON had contacted the GPE advocate - general PERSON , who had told her that she considered an appeal pointless . After internal discussions and on the basis of PERSON opinion , the appeal had been withdrawn . PERSON explained that in such a situation , it was common for an appeal to be withdrawn . PERSON found highly surprising PERSON evidence that she had never seen an appeal memorial in the case of PERSON as , following PERSON request , she had sent her this document by fax .", "A report dated DATE prepared by PERSON , accompanied by the formal record of the questioning of PERSON on DATE and DATE , and the appeal memorial prepared by PERSON in the case of PERSON were submitted to ORG and added to the applicant 's case file on DATE .", "At the hearing held on DATE , the defence requested inter alia to have access to the ORG investigation case file in order to verify the documents from that file that might be of relevance for the applicant 's case . The defence stated that it filed this request in order to be able to assess the chances of success of an appeal in the case of PERSON in connection with the withdrawal of that appeal . Having deliberated , ORG rejected this request , holding :", "\u201c the request is rejected as the court fails to see in what way granting it can contribute \u2013 further \u2013 to any decision that must be taken by the court in the present case since DATE whatever may be of the withdrawal of the appeal in the case of Mr Z. \u2013 it has not been established that this has taken place for the purposes of obtaining unreliable or incorrect statements from him . \u201d", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of participation in a criminal organisation having as its aim the importation of cocaine , participation in a criminal organisation having as its aim the importation of hashish and directing that organisation , repeated participation in offences under LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) and participation in an attempted offence under LAW . The court sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment .", "The ORG considered at length the arguments raised by the defence to the effect that the arrangement concluded between the public prosecution service and PERSON was unlawful under domestic law . ORG acknowledged the fact that the applicant 's case file contained no record of the conversations and negotiations between PERSON and the public prosecution service , nor of the correspondence between his lawyer and the public prosecution service on the arrangement made with PERSON However , it found that these conversations and negotiations had been sufficiently clarified in the course of the appeal proceedings . After having examined the circumstances in which the arrangement had been concluded as well as the terms thereof , it concluded that , despite certain shortcomings , the arrangement was in conformity with the DATE Directive on arrangements with criminals and was not contrary either to the principles governing the proper conduct of proceedings or the requirements of LAW .", "ORG observed that there had been shortcomings , including : the failure to carry out any primary criminal investigation against the applicant ; the fact that the public prosecutor PERSON had unjustly given the ORG the impression that the statements of PERSON might shed further light on the \u201c IRT affaire \u201d [ See , for further details , PERSON v. the GPE , no . ORG decision of DATE ] ; the absence of a written record of the conversations and negotiations with PERSON on a possible arrangement ; the \u2013 failing an adequate recording DATE unclear course of events in relation to the filing and the withdrawal of the appeal in the criminal proceedings against Mr Z ; the fact that a passage in the letter of CARDINAL DATE from PERSON to the chief public prosecutor had been rendered illegible whereas , after its disclosure , this passage had appeared to be relevant to the procedure for the establishment of the arrangement and was significant for the contents of that arrangement and had not been rendered illegible for reasons linked to the interests of the investigation ; and the premature termination by the public prosecution service of the proceeds of crime investigation initiated against Mr Z.", "However , ORG held that it could not be said that these shortcomings constituted such serious breaches of the principles governing the proper conduct of proceedings that the applicant 's right to a fair trial had been harmed as a result . It did , however , find that these shortcomings , taken together , constituted a defect which , in accordance with LAW , should be taken into account in the determination of the applicant 's sentence .", "On this basis it decided not to impose a DATE prison sentence , which it considered to be appropriate in the circumstances , but to reduce the applicant 's sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "ORG based the applicant 's conviction on statements given by PERSON , whose evidence was found to be reliable , credible and supported by other evidence , on statements given by co - suspects and other witnesses , on several official ( foreign and domestic ) police reports , on findings of ORG ( ORG ) , and on statements given by the applicant .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , submitting an extensive statement of grounds of appeal in cassation .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE . It rejected the applicant 's grounds of appeal in their entirety . Acting of its own motion , no such complaint having been raised by the applicant , ORG held that \u2013 given the delay DATE , when the applicant had filed his appeal in cassation , and DATE , when it had commenced its examination of the appeal in cassation \u2013 the reasonable time requirement under LAW had not been complied with . On that account , it quashed the sentence imposed on the applicant by ORG and reduced it by DATE .", "As to the applicant 's complaint that ORG had unjustly ordered that the tape - recorded statements given by PERSON be played in private , ORG accepted ORG ruling on this point as legally correct and understandable , having regard also to the stance taken by PERSON on the matter and to the circumstance that , in the interests of the defence , the applicant 's lawyer had withdrawn his request to have the recordings played in public .", "In response to the applicant 's complaints in respect of the arrangement between the public prosecution service and PERSON , ORG rejected the applicant 's argument that the lawfulness of the arrangement should have been examined on the basis of the PERSON on undertakings given to witnesses in criminal proceedings . It held that , as the arrangement at issue had been made prior to the submission of that PERSON to ORG of ORG , ORG had correctly examined the lawfulness of the arrangement under LAW , the principles governing the proper conduct of proceedings and the DATE Directive on arrangements with criminals . ORG further accepted as correct the conclusion of ORG that the arrangement was lawful .", "ORG rejected the remainder of the applicant 's grounds of appeal , including his complaints that he was not granted access to the ORG investigation case file , to the passages rendered illegible in the so - called \u201c CTC \u201d documents and to the correspondence between the public prosecution department and PERSON lawyer . It based itself on the following summary reasoning :", "\u201c The remaining points of appeal do not provide grounds for overturning the judgment of ORG ( kunnen niet tot cassatie leiden ) . Having regard to LAW ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) , no further reasoning is called for , since these points of appeal do not give rise to a need for a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development . \u201d", "The GPE public prosecution service ( openbaar ministerie ) functions under the responsibility of the Minister of ORG , but is not an agency of ORG . It forms a part of the judiciary and its organisation is regulated by ORG .", "Pursuant to LAW , the prosecution service consists of ORG ( Parket - Generaal ) which is composed of ORG ( procureurs - generaal ) and their staff , ORG ( arrondissementsparketten ) , ORG at ORG ( ressortsparketten ) and ORG Landelijk Parket ) .", "The public prosecution service is organised in a hierarchical manner and is headed by ORG ( College van procureursgeneraal ) which is composed of CARDINAL and CARDINAL Procurators - General .

Special agreements with criminals were only allowed in exceptional cases , in which the investigative interest or the ending or prevention of crimes outweighed the disadvantages of these kinds of agreements ( cases of life and death or cases of similar seriousness ) . Furthermore , these agreements should be a last resort and only to be used if it were likely that the aim pursued could not be reached by other means . The information to be obtained had to be essential to the realisation of the aim .
