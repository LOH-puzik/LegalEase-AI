The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was employed in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested and detained on suspicion of organising a criminal group and corruption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) reviewed and extended the applicant \u2019s detention and that of CARDINAL other co - accused . The reasons given for detention were as follows :", "\u201c After having examined the prosecutor \u2019s request [ for the extension of detention ] , the investigating judge finds the request well - founded and orders the extension of the accused PERSON detention ... in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . The accused PERSON ... [ is ] employed by ORG [ and ] has through his work undoubtedly made contact with other customs officers and has also made numerous international contacts which could enable [ the group ] to cross the State border without the necessary documents . That and the fact that they have gained significant profit through illegal activities which they could use in order to avoid criminal prosecution , justifies the fear that if released they would abscond .", "...", "As regards the accused PERSON ... his detention is also ordered in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . Given that the accused PERSON ... is a team leader in ORG , he is the superior of other customs officers who are to be heard as witnesses ... [ this ] indicates that , if released , he would obstruct the course of justice by influencing the witnesses ...", "Taking into account that the accused PERSON ... committed several criminal acts within a short period of time ... the investigating judge considers that these facts represent special circumstances which justify the fear that , if released , he would reoffend , so his detention is also ordered under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "Taking into account that the accused PERSON ... has been charged with serious criminal offences which are punishable by imprisonment for DATE , and in view of the manner in which the offences were committed , in particular , that he is employed in ORG , which was established precisely with a view to preventing the very same offences which he enabled [ others ] to commit ... his detention is also ordered under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW [ on the basis of the nature of the offences alleged and the severity of the penalty that could be imposed ] .", "... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was suspended from work with effect from DATE , the date on which he was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was further extended on the same grounds as given in the above order by a chamber of CARDINAL judges of ORG and by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor issued an indictment \u2013 which was CARDINAL pages long \u2013 against the applicant and CARDINAL other individuals and delivered it to ORG on DATE . The applicant was charged with organising a criminal group and CARDINAL counts of large - scale corruption . ORG extended his detention on DATE for the same reasons as before . In particular , as regards influencing the witnesses , the court concluded that it was still justified to extend the applicant \u2019s detention on that ground because , in view of the complexity of the case and the number of the accused , there were CARDINAL witnesses to be examined . The applicant was served with a copy of that order on CARDINAL DATE and subsequently appealed against it .", "CARDINAL . In parallel to the appeal , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s representative submitted an application for his release to ORG , on the grounds that he had not been served with the indictment within DATE time - limit prescribed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that therefore the DATE time - limit set by LAW had not been respected ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE ORG rejected the application . That decision was not subject to an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with a copy of the indictment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the order extending the applicant \u2019s detention of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that , pursuant to LAW , the date on which an indictment is delivered to the court DATE and not the date on which it is served on the accused \u2013 is the date to be taken in determining whether an indictment has been issued within the DATE maximum pre - trial detention period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of ORG informed the applicant \u2019s representative that the indictment had not been served on the applicant in time due to the complexity of the case and the heavy workload of the judge sitting in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor decided not to lodge an application for judicial review on behalf of the applicant in connection with the orders of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was regularly examined and extended DATE by ORG and ORG , and , following a reform of the domestic judicial system , by ORG ( \u201c the High Court \u201d ) and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeatedly challenged his detention . He argued , in particular , that there was no reason to extend his detention on the basis of a risk of him influencing the witnesses , because the court had failed to specify the witnesses who remained to be examined and in which circumstances , and that , therefore , it was not possible to establish which witnesses he could potentially influence . ORG , as regards the risk of him absconding , he claimed that he had not been working as the team leader in ORG at the time of the alleged criminal activity , but rather that he had been occupying a different post in ORG . The applicant also argued that there was no risk of him reoffending , because he had been suspended from his position at ORG . Finally , he argued that there was no legal basis for the extension of his detention based on the severity of the sentence that could be imposed and the special aggravating circumstances of the criminal offences imputed to him .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE his detention was based on the same grounds as before . In particular , as regards the risk of him influencing the witnesses , the courts reiterated their previous argument that CARDINAL witnesses were yet to be examined at trial , because it had not been possible to examine them during the investigation due to the complexity of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , although it rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG accepted the argument concerning the fourth ground for detention ( severity of the sentence that could be imposed , the manner in which the criminal offence had been committed or other aggravating circumstances ) and decided that it did not exist . The court held in particular :", "\u201c ... for this legal ground [ for detention to be satisfied ] the cumulative existence of CARDINAL conditions is necessary : that the criminal offence in question is punishable by a sentence of DATE imprisonment and [ that there are ] particularly aggravating circumstances . In the present case , CARDINAL condition has been fulfilled , because there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused committed criminal offences for which a sentence of PERCENT imprisonment can be imposed , but the reasons given in the contested order do not justify the existence of the second condition ... [ Neither ] the fact that the accused were employed at ORG , [ nor ] the specific characteristics of their positions , nor the fact that they gained a large illegal profit could be considered as particularly aggravating circumstances , because these facts are contained in the factual description of the criminal acts in question and represent the [ constituent ] elements of those criminal acts .", "Therefore , ORG holds that the reasons given in the contested order do not justify the extension of detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ... \u201d", "Further reasoning for the applicant \u2019s detention based on the risk of him reoffending was also provided :", "\u201c ... there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused , PERSON ... as [ a member of ] an organised criminal group committed a series of criminal offences over a long period of time ... [ the group \u2019s ] criminal activity had been planned for an indefinite period of time and with a view to gaining a vast illegal profit ... [ T]hese circumstances justify the fear that , if released , he would reoffend ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In issuing subsequent orders extending the applicant \u2019s detention , the courts held , in particular , as regards the risk of the applicant influencing the witnesses , that he could influence CARDINAL other accused , ORG and FAC , who were at large ; and that there was a risk that he would influence witness GPE , who was expected to testify about the customs clearance of a motor vehicle which the applicant had received as a gift from ORG", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended only on the grounds that he might abscond and reoffend . The courts held that the third ground , the risk of him influencing the witnesses , had ceased to exist , as there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that at that stage of the proceedings the applicant could contact or influence FAC , who had been at large for DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was based only on the risk of him absconding . The court held that the risk of him reoffending had ceased to exist in view of : the time that had passed since the alleged criminal activity ; the fact that the applicant had been suspended from his post ; the fact that he had no previous criminal record ; the time he had spent in detention ; and the fact that the criminal group had been disbanded . The court further held that the reasons which had previously justified his detention on this ground could not exist throughout the proceedings , and therefore their existence automatically had to be assessed by the court upon each review .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout his detention , the applicant made applications for release on bail . Until DATE they were rejected as inadmissible ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . From DATE , when the applicant \u2019s detention was based solely on the risk of him absconding , CARDINAL applications for bail were rejected because the value of the proposed bail ( a mortgage over the applicant \u2019s family \u2019s immovable property ) was considered insufficient to guarantee his appearance at trial . The courts also noted that no evidence concerning the financial situation of the applicant and his family had been submitted in support of the application , and that an exact value of the immovable property had not been obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court accepted bail in the value of CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and ordered that the application for bail be reconsidered . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s assets had been the subject of a financial investigation and that it was necessary to establish whether those assets were included in the bail that had been offered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again accepted bail in the value of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure DATE , in so far as relevant , provides that a defendant should be released from detention if an indictment has not been issued within DATE of his or her arrest .

U\u017e-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE confirming the long - standing jurisprudence ) .", "CARDINAL .

Reasons for detention are outlined in LAW Detention will be ordered if there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused has committed the criminal offence in question and if , inter alia , there is a possibility that the accused would abscond ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , obstruct the course of justice ( destroy the evidence or influence the witnesses or obstruct the course of justice in some other way ) ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , reoffend ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , or if the criminal offence in question is punishable by a sentence of PERCENT imprisonment and the manner in which the offence was committed , or other special aggravating circumstances , justify the accused \u2019s detention ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
