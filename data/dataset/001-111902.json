In fact , violent incidents among prisoners are a regular occurrence in all prison systems ; they involve a wide range of phenomena , from subtle forms of harassment to unconcealed intimidation and serious physical attacks .", "Tackling the phenomenon of inter - prisoner violence requires that prison staff be placed in a position , including in terms of staffing levels , to exercise their authority and their supervisory tasks in an appropriate manner . Prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary . The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners , based on the notions of secure custody and care , is a decisive factor in this context ; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills . Further , management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority . Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered ( including effective search procedures ) may well be required ; however , such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above - mentioned basic imperatives . In addition , the prison system needs to address the issue of the appropriate classification and distribution of prisoners . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
