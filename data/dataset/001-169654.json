SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for correspondence;Respect for home);Violation of Article 13+8 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 8-1 - Respect for correspondence;Respect for home;Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life)", "JUDGES": "Alena Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1;Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Johan Hirschfeldt;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . From DATE ORG ( Skatteverket ) conducted audits of value - added tax , ORG social security contributions ( arbetsgivaravgifter ) and income tax at the CARDINAL NORP companies ORG , ORG ( \u201c SNS \u201d ) and ORG . The audit covered DATE . On DATE ORG applied to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE for permission to take coercive measures in respect of SNS under section CARDINAL of GPE ( NORP om s\u00e4rskilda tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder i beskattningsf\u00f6rfarandet , DATE hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) , in particular the search and seizure of certain documents and other material .", "CARDINAL . ORG application contained detailed information on what it had been able to establish in regard to the above - mentioned companies during the audits . The ORG stated that it suspected that significant amounts of money had been withheld from NORP taxation through irregular transactions between ORG and a NORP company . According to the ORG , the latter company had been established solely in order to evade taxes on some of the business profits in the above - mentioned NORP companies . While it was considered highly likely that the persons owning or having a decisive influence in the NORP companies , including a Mr Toivo Jurik , were also running the NORP company , it had proved impossible to obtain information on ownership and control of the latter company from the persons involved , who claimed that they had no knowledge of these matters . After Mr Jurik had been shown an extract of the NORP company register , where he was listed as an executive , he had admitted that he and another person involved in the NORP companies had been present at the establishment of the NORP company but that he was listed as an executive only for formal reasons . The other person mentioned had since stated that he would not assist ORG any further in the audit . The Agency therefore considered that it could not continue to investigate the ownership issue and the accuracy of certain business costs unless it obtained access to documents that showed the NORP company \u2019s relationship to the NORP companies and their owners and leaders as well as the NORP company \u2019s role in the business activities . In the ORG \u2019s view , there were no alternative means of review .", "CARDINAL . Not considering it appropriate to order SNS to provide the required documents , ORG further requested that the application for coercive measures should not be communicated to the company and that it should not be notified of the court \u2019s decision before the measures had been undertaken , as there was a risk that the documents to be searched and seized could be withheld or destroyed .", "CARDINAL . As SNS had recently been liquidated and had not had its own business LOC , the requested search should be made at CARDINAL addresses connected to Mr Jurik , who had been responsible for the bookkeeping in all CARDINAL audited companies and was also representing ORG in its contacts with ORG , and therefore could be expected to be in possession of the required documentation . Thus , the search should start at the registered premises of the parent company , ORG ( \u201c Draupner \u201d ) , at the address ORG gata CARDINAL , GPE . This was a flat which , in addition to being owned by PERSON and serving as its registered address , was rented by Mr PERSON and used as a pied - \u00e0 - terre . PERSON was owned by Mr Jurik \u2019s children but was represented and run by Mr Jurik himself . If the necessary documents were not found at the first address , the search should continue at the office of Mr Jurik at the applicant law firm ( whose name at the time was PERSON ) , at the address GPE CARDINAL , GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG granted ORG application and ordered that the judgment was immediately enforceable . Agreeing with ORG , the court considered that there was a substantial risk that documents could be withheld , corrupted or destroyed and that , having regard to Mr Jurik \u2019s connection with ORG and the CARDINAL addresses in question , there was good reason to assume that the documents relevant to the audit of ORG were to be found at those addresses . While a search and seizure undertaken at a location different from the audited party \u2019s business LOC involved a particular encroachment on rights of integrity , the court found that , in the case at hand , the importance of the measures outweighed the intrusion caused .", "CARDINAL . The search of the CARDINAL designated LOC took place on DATE and was conducted by officials of ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) in GPE and several auditors of ORG . The flat was searched first . Present were Mr PERSON , a lawyer of the applicant law firm , representing Mr Jurik ( who was at the time in GPE ) , and DATE towards the end of the search \u2013 Mr PERSON , who , as an associate of the law firm , had been the liquidator of ORG and who was also the designated person to be served writs on behalf of PERSON in GPE . According to TIME of the proceedings , drawn up by CARDINAL of the officers of ORG , the persons present were reminded of the possibility to request exemption of documents .", "CARDINAL . During the search of the flat , material of interest that belonged to PERSON was found . Since PERSON had been involved in transactions connected with the activities of ORG , a decision to audit the company was taken on site by the audit manager of ORG . She also took an interim decision to use coercive measures against PERSON , in accordance with LAW . It was decided to search for and seize material relating to the audit of PERSON both at the flat and at the applicant law firm . In the latter respect , the decision referred to the fact that not only Mr Jurik but also Mr PERSON had offices there .", "CARDINAL . The need for an immediate decision and enforcement was explained by the substantial risk of corruption of material . The decision referred to sections CARDINAL of LAW and to ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the flat CARDINAL files with accounting material , an external hard disk drive and a torn document were seized and the hard disk drive of a computer as well as a ORG memory stick were copied ( mirrored ) . This was specified in a report drawn up and submitted to the parties concerned DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The LOC of the applicant law firm \u2013 that is , the offices of Mr Jurik and Mr PERSON DATE were searched thereafter , again in the presence of PERSON and PERSON . Attending was also a legal representative whom the applicant had appointed . The issue of possible exemption of documents was discussed and the representative was given a list of the officers attending . Cupboards , shelves and computers in the CARDINAL offices were searched and a safe was opened by PERSON , all monitored by the applicant \u2019s representative . However , no material of relevance was found on the LOC . At the end of the proceedings , the applicant \u2019s representative requested that the external hard disk drive and the ORG memory stick DATE seized and copied , respectively , at the flat DATE be exempted from the audit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and SNS appealed against ORG judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and struck out the case in so far as it concerned SNS . In regard to the applicant , it stated that , while the appealed judgment did indeed allow the use of coercive measures on the premises of the applicant law firm , the reason for this was not that the law firm was the subject of the measures but that it could be assumed that documents relevant to the audit of SNS would be found there . In these circumstances , the appellate court concluded that the applicant was not affected by the appealed judgment in such a way that it was entitled to appeal against it . With respect to SNS , the court considered that , as the coercive measures had already been enforced , it did not have a justified interest in having them examined by a second judicial instance .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicant and SNS leave to appeal . On DATE the court dismissed an appeal in the same matter lodged by Mr Jurik , noting that he had not previously been a party to the case and could not therefore join the proceedings at the level of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG interim decision of DATE to use coercive measures against PERSON was referred to ORG , which received it on DATE , the following DATE . The ORG stated as reasons for its decision that PERSON had had transactions connected to ORG , its subsidiary company , that there had been special reasons to search for material at the applicant law firm CARDINAL of PERSON \u2019s representatives , PERSON and PERSON , had offices there and that the risk of corruption of material was acute in view of the fact that , during the ongoing enforcement , it had become apparent to persons involved which transactions and connected documents were to be examined . PERSON requested that the decision be quashed , referring , inter alia , to attorney - client privilege pertaining to its representatives . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the interim decision was confirmed by the court , which found that the seizure of the documents at issue had been justified . The court further considered that there was a substantial risk that the documents would be withheld , corrupted or destroyed if they were returned .", "CARDINAL . Draupner and PERSON appealed to ORG . On DATE the court struck out PERSON \u2019s appeal and dismissed that of PERSON . As in the similar case concerning SNS ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court took into account that the coercive measures had already been enforced and considered therefore that PERSON did not have a justified interest in having them examined by a second judicial instance . In regard to Mr Jurik , it was noted that he had not been a party to the case at the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Draupner also appealed against ORG decision of DATE to conduct an audit . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal because , in accordance with LAW , LAW ORG ; CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , no appeal lay against such a decision . This determination was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision to dismiss the appeal and ORG judgment and referred the case back to ORG . The appellate court found that ORG had lacked a legal basis for its decision ; instead of dismissing PERSON \u2019s appeal , it should have submitted it to ORG for determination .", "CARDINAL . After a new examination of the case , ORG dismissed the appeal in a decision of DATE , finding that no appeal lay against a decision to conduct a tax audit and that LAW was not applicable to such a decision . In addition , it noted that , while the audit decision itself did not involve any harm to PERSON , possible detriment caused by the audit procedure could be removed or mitigated through a request for the exemption of documents from the audit . Such a request was at the time already under examination by the court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON \u2019s further appeal , agreeing with the lower court \u2019s assessment .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , DATE of the search of the flat and the law office , and received by ORG on DATE , the applicant requested that those parts of the material seized and copied at the flat that could concern the law firm be exempted from the audit . It mentioned , in particular , the external hard disk drive and the ORG memory stick . Noting that both SNS and PERSON were clients of the law firm , the applicant argued that the material it sought to have exempted was protected by attorney - client privilege .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the request , finding that the applicant lacked legal standing in the matter . It noted that the material had been seized from PERSON and was therefore not under the applicant \u2019s right of disposition .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , demanding that all seized and copied material except for the files with accounting material be exempted . It also requested that an oral hearing be held on the question of its legal standing in the matter . Mr Jurik joined the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request for an oral hearing , finding it unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and agreed with the lower court that the applicant did not have legal standing concerning the requested exemption of documents , as the coercive measures had not been directed against the law firm . Mr Jurik \u2019s appeal was dismissed , as he had not been a party to the case at the lower court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a further appeal , stating , among other things , that ORG original interim decision of DATE concerning PERSON and ORG judgment of DATE confirming that decision had been directed against the law firm because they allowed a search in the firm \u2019s offices . Moreover , the coercive measures employed had led to the seizure of material which allegedly belonged to the applicant and could contain information covered by attorney - client privilege . In the latter respect , the applicant claimed that the external hard disk drive and the ORG memory stick had been used by its associate lawyer PERSON in his work for the firm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of ORG of DATE not to hold an oral hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) CARDINAL judges participated , CARDINAL of whom was a co - opted member ( adjungerad ledamot ) . She was also a civil servant at ORG , albeit formally on leave of absence while temporarily serving with the court . ORG being the opposing party , the applicant challenged her impartiality and called for her disqualification from the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in a different formation , rejected the objection , noting that the co - opted member was on leave from her post at ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , which had regard to GPE case - law , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , declaring that the objection had not been justified . It considered that the issue of objective impartiality had to be examined in light of the individual character of the case at hand . In this respect , it noted that the co - opted member \u2019s tasks at ORG had concerned activities of a different type than those relevant in the case and had been performed in a different part of the country . Furthermore , she was CARDINAL of CARDINAL judges participating in the decision in question , which had concerned a request for an oral hearing . She had not participated in the judgment on the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Draupner , represented by PERSON , requested that all material seized or copied during the audit be exempted , in particular because it contained information protected by attorney - client privilege pertaining to the applicant law firm and its clients .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . It stated that PERSON was the subject of a tax audit and that all electronic or paper documents linked to the company \u2019s business found on its premises should be considered as belonging to it and being eligible for examination in the audit . The court noted that the company register listed Mr Jurik as a board member and signatory of PERSON . Furthermore , the available evidence in the case showed that he was the representative of the company and that the flat where the search and seizure had taken place constituted the company \u2019s business LOC . As the documents at issue had been found at that flat , they should be considered to belong to PERSON , concern its business and , as a rule , be included in the audit . While the coercive measures used could not therefore be considered to have contravened LAW or the LAW , the question remained whether there were reasons to exempt some or all of the material . Noting that the burden of proof rested with the audited party , the court considered that the company had not demonstrated that the documents were covered by any of the exemptions under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Upon PERSON \u2019s appeal , ORG , on CARDINAL DATE , decided to quash ORG judgment and refer the case back to that court . The appellate court found that the lower court had not examined the contents of all the documents , which was a requirement for the assessment of the question of exemption .", "CARDINAL . ORG then directed PERSON to specify its request in greater detail , which the company did . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court rejected the company \u2019s requests for an oral hearing and an inspection of the flat but granted that a few seized documents be exempted from examination by ORG , as they were considered to be Mr Jurik \u2019s private documents . It further considered that deleted files , which were readable only after reconstruction , could not be the object of a seizure under LAW and could therefore neither be exempted nor used by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Draupner and ORG appealed . PERSON agreed that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL files seized on DATE could be handed over to ORG for examination , following which the request for exemption concerned the remaining material seized and copied on DATE . ORG requested that it be allowed to examine deleted and reconstructed data files .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected PERSON \u2019s appeal , but granted that of ORG . PERSON \u2019s procedural requests for an oral hearing and an inspection were rejected , but the court held a preparatory meeting with the parties to determine the continued proceedings in the case , notably the method for examining the disputed material . The court found that , due to the extremely extensive data material CARDINAL files and DATE , it was impossible to examine each and every data file , and ORG was therefore instructed to list the documents and files it considered as part of its examination after which PERSON would have an opportunity to lodge a new request for exemption . The appellate court agreed with ORG assessments that the material , including the hard disk drive and the ORG memory stick , had been seized on ORG \u2019s business premises , that there was , accordingly , a presumption that it was included in the audit and eligible for ORG examination and that the burden of proof for exemptions rested with the company , even though a modest level of evidence was sufficient . With regard to Draupner\u2019", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had listed the documents and files it wished to examine , PERSON made a new application for exemption of documents which was partially approved by ORG on DATE in regard to some documents which were considered to be of a private nature . However , none of the documents for which exemption had been requested were found to have such content that attorney - client privilege applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( now ORG f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) refused PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON made a complaint to ORG ( PERSON ) against the handling of the case by ORG , ORG and ORG and assessments made by these instances . On DATE the ORG found no reason to take action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also petitioned for a re - opening of ORG decision of DATE not to grant leave to appeal in the case concerning the applicant \u2019s request for exemption of documents . This petition was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The audits concerning ORG and PERSON were eventually discontinued and no taxation decisions were taken on the basis of the audits . All documents were returned to PERSON . Like ORG , PERSON has since been liquidated ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
