On DATE the applicant was admitted to temporary detention facility no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL in GPE . According to the Government , who relied on a medical record drawn up by the head of the facility on DATE , together with the applicant \u2019s medical history , the applicant was examined by the prison doctor on DATE . In addition , the necessary medical tests were performed , in particular blood tests for HIV and syphilis , which showed no presence of infection .

It follows from the medical record that it was not until DATE that the applicant was admitted to the tuberculosis ward of the Sakha ( GPE ) Republic prison hospital in correctional colony no . CARDINAL ( hereinafter \u201c the colony hospital \u201d ) , the reason being that his transfer to the hospital could only be effected after his conviction became final . The applicant was diagnosed with focal tuberculosis of the right lung in the infiltration stage and post - traumatic encephalopathy . He was released from the hospital on DATE after an intensive course of anti - tuberculosis treatment with the recommendation that he continue with the drug therapy . It appears from the documents submitted to the ORG that the recommendation was fully complied with .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was re - admitted to the colony hospital on CARDINAL occasions DATE from DATE , from CARDINAL May to DATE , from DATE to DATE , from DATE to DATE , from DATE to DATE , and from DATE to CARDINAL DATE \u2013 where he was placed on an antibacterial chemotherapy regimen . Relying on the applicant \u2019s medical record , the Government stressed that after continuous tuberculosis treatment and clinical testing , on DATE the applicant was diagnosed with infiltrative tuberculosis of the upper lobe of the right lung in the resolution stage and assessed as requiring regular medical check - ups . The results of microbiological tests on bodily fluids performed in DATE and DATE identified no presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis . A chest X - ray examination carried out on DATE revealed isolated small dense nidi on the upper lobe of the applicant \u2019s right lung , accompanied by restricted pneumosclerosis .

NORP The applicant \u2019s medical record contained a number of entries made by tuberculosis specialists recording his negative , and occasionally aggressive , attitude towards the treatment and the medical personnel . The attending doctors spoke with the applicant , explaining the necessity for and content of the treatment and persuading him to continue with it . The medical records provided by the Government further show that he received regular medical attention in respect of his tuberculosis , as well as medical examinations by prison doctors . The tuberculosis specialists consistently found his state of health to be satisfactory following successful courses of anti - relapse therapy . The applicant seemed to agree with the evaluation of his health , and made no complaints to the tuberculosis specialists . His complaints to the prison medical personnel were mostly of a psychological character , including sleep disorder , extreme nervousness , and fears of an unspecified nature . Those grievances were promptly addressed by the prison psychologist or neuropathologist , as well as by the prescription of medicines . The Government also provided the Court with extracts from hospital logs recording the intake of medicines by the applicant , their dosage and frequency .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant sued ORG and the detention facility , seeking compensation for damage sustained as a result of his being infected with tuberculosis . He claimed that he had contracted tuberculosis in detention , having been placed in a cell with a person infected with the active form of that illness , and that the administration of the detention facility had remained deaf to his complaints about the risk of infection .", "CARDINAL . The defendants submitted observations in reply . They insisted that there was no evidence that the applicant had contracted tuberculosis in detention because he was a long - term offender and had been in and out of prison since DATE . The applicant \u2019s \u201c way of life \u201d was at the root of his contraction of the illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , holding as follows :", "\u201c ... the GPE fault for the damage to the plaintiff \u2019s health was not proved . Under LAW of the GPE compensation for nonpecuniary damage , as a general rule , is awarded in cases when the fault of the defendant is established . The fact of [ the applicant ] contracting tuberculosis in the detention facility was not proved in open court : the mere fact that he had been detained in the cell with PERSON , who was suffering [ from tuberculosis ] , can not serve as a ground for finding the defendants responsible for the damage caused and does not prove their fault because this is only the plaintiff \u2019s conjecture . Having regard to the character of the illness , the court considers it possible that the applicant contracted tuberculosis prior to his detention in DATE because he had , in fact , been detained before and had only been at liberty for DATE after his release . As was established in open court , during the plaintiff \u2019s first medical examination on DATE no evidence of [ tuberculosis ] was found , but on DATE the results of an X - ray examination were positive : the plaintiff was diagnosed with focal tuberculosis of the right lung and treatment was prescribed , [ the treatment ] was a success , the plaintiff clinically recovered ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The Government stressed that the records of the colony hospital personnel showed that medical assistant P. had been on sick leave from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a blood sample was taken from the applicant to be tested for HIV . The results were unclear . CARDINAL further blood tests were carried out in DATE . Medical experts also interpreted the results of those CARDINAL tests as contradictory .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following another blood test , the applicant was diagnosed with HIV . When informing the applicant that he had contracted HIV , the prison doctor explained the results of the test and described various aspects of the infection , its assessment and treatment . It appears from the medical record that the prison psychologist had a number of meetings with the applicant to provide psychological support . The record also reveals that the applicant was subjected to regular clinical assessment to determine whether there was a need to start antiretroviral drug treatment for HIV . Moreover , the doctors constantly reminded the applicant , a heavy smoker and alcohol abuser , of the necessity to adhere to a healthy life style . Following the detection of the virus , the applicant was assigned an enriched food regimen and was prescribed courses of multivitamins and hepatoprotective medicine .

On DATE an investigator of the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office refused to open a criminal case , finding that the applicant \u2019s blood sample had not been taken by PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered an additional inquiry into the applicant \u2019s complaints . ORG reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c Having studied the case - file materials , [ the applicant \u2019s ] personal file and his medical record , the court considers that the decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings is manifestly ill - founded ; [ the applicant \u2019s ] statements about the date when his blood sample was taken and the recording of the date of the test in his medical record are contradictory ...", "It is also necessary to take into account the medical history of inmate G ... It is impossible to give a definite answer to the question whether [ the applicant \u2019s ] blood was taken immediately after the blood had been taken from inmate PERSON without an examination of [ the applicant \u2019s ] and inmate PERSON \u2019s medical records drawn up during their stay in [ the colony ] hospital ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings , finding that the applicant had not been subjected to the blood test together with any HIV - positive detainee and that PERSON had not taken the applicant \u2019s blood sample .

On the second occasion , at some point after DATE , assistant PERSON had taken his blood sample with the same syringe he had used to take a blood sample from inmate PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered that criminal proceedings should be opened , giving the following reasoning :", "\u201c On CARDINAL occasions the investigators refused to institute criminal proceedings because there was no indication of a criminal offence , although [ they ] did not establish the circumstances and the source of the HIV - infection even though the crime had taken place \u2013 [ the applicant ] had been infected with HIV \u2013 in the detention facility \u201d .", "ORG drew up a list of actions to be taken during the investigation , including a medical expert examination , confrontation interviews between the applicant and staff members of the colony hospital , including PERSON , and inmate PERSON , and verification of PERSON whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Sakha ( GPE ) Republic quashed the decision of DATE , acting on appeal by prosecution authorities , and remitted the case for fresh examination , finding that it was necessary for ORG to hear inmate PERSON as a witness in order to arrive at the correct decision .", "CARDINAL . The ORG summoned witness PERSON to a hearing on DATE . He refused to testify , invoking his constitutional right to remain silent . Holding that the applicant \u2019s and inmate PERSON \u2019s blood samples had been taken by the CARDINAL colony nurses on CARDINAL separate occasions and that there was no evidence that PERSON had performed blood tests , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Sakha ( GPE Republic upheld the decision of DATE , endorsing ORG reasoning .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the administration of the correctional colony had delayed the dispatch of his correspondence to ORG or had not sent his letters at all . He initially cited a delay in dispatching his letter of CARDINAL DATE as an example of the authorities\u2019 failure to duly comply with their obligation not to interfere with his communication with the ORG . However , following the notification of the case to the ORG , he no longer relied on the incident involving the letter of CARDINAL DATE but offered CARDINAL other examples . In particular , he insisted that on DATE he had handed a sealed envelope to the head of the special unit of the correctional colony to be sent to ORG . The envelope contained a letter and a number of documents in support of his complaints . However , the letter was mistakenly sent to the Sakha ( Yakutiya ) Republic Service for the Execution of Sentences ( hereinafter \u201c the Service \u201d ) . The colony administration notified the applicant of the mistake and assured him that the ORG would redirect the letter to the ORG . Nevertheless , another mistake occurred and the applicant \u2019s letter was sent to ORG . The applicant insisted that before dispatching his letter an employee of the ORG had seized the attachments to it . The letter was finally sent to ORG on DATE . The applicant stressed that he had learned that the documents had been seized when by a letter of DATE the ORG had asked him to submit copies of the CARDINAL domestic court decisions which he had already enclosed with his letter of DATE . In addition , the applicant submitted that the prison authorities had delayed the dispatch of his letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed the applicant \u2019s submissions , arguing that according to correspondence logs drawn up in the facilities where the applicant was detained since DATE and until DATE , he had sent CARDINAL letters to the ORG and CARDINAL letters to various NORP officials . Every letter had been successfully dispatched in a sealed envelope , save for the one sent by the applicant to ORG on DATE . That letter , by mistake , had been sent to ORG of GPE as the applicant had indicated that it was to be sent to the \u201c last judicial instance \u201d . On DATE the head of the detention facility had asked the President of ORG to return the applicant \u2019s letter immediately . On DATE the letter had been sent to ORG . The applicant , against his signature , had been informed about the delay in its dispatch . The Government provided the ORG with extracts from the correspondence logs of the detention facilities , the letter of the head of the detention facility to ORG , and the letter to ORG , showing that the applicant \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE had been dispatched on DATE and that the applicant had been duly informed about the delay .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained to the ORG about the seizure of the attachments to his letter of DATE . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed him that it was no longer possible to establish the fact of the loss of the attachments , let alone which officials could have been responsible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a similar complaint with the Sakha ( GPE ) ORG , seeking institution of criminal proceedings against the employees of the Service . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the request was dismissed , as the prosecutor found that there was no evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . Between the date of the applicant \u2019s first letter to ORG in DATE and the communication of the case to the Government , the ORG received CARDINAL letters from the applicant , including the CARDINAL letters mentioned by the Government .
