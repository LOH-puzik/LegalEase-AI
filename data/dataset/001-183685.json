This passage resides within a section of the report which describes difficult and sometimes acrimonious relations between the ORG and its NORP counterparts , and it is evident that , in fact , the date , redacted in this passage , is DATE , which is precisely the time at which our flight information demonstrates an aircraft arriving in GPE and transporting detainees onwards to LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to Mr GPE , the plane NCARDINALP took the applicant , together with another ORG detainee , PERSON , from GPE , GPE to GPE , GPE , to a facility lent to the ORG by their NORP counterparts .

Based upon , now , the confirmations in ORG , we can see this outward flight from GPE as the starting point of Mr GPE \u2019s next chronology of detention . It is stated explicitly DATE , from that point DATE , Mr GPE was detained in CARDINAL further sites before ultimately being transferred to ORG in DATE . The flight on DATE took Mr GPE , together with another ORG detainee , PERSON , to GPE , GPE . GPE , GPE , at that time was a facility lent to the ORG , to ORG , by their NORP counterparts . It was a facility which resided within the NORP system , and it is described in explicit detail in ORG . That facility was the same place to which some persons from ORG would be later taken back , but I will explain why Mr PERSON was not one of those , with reference to the same material . In DATE , according to the report , it was allowed to operate until DATE , at which point relations became acrimonious and certain conditions were placed upon it . The ORG collected its detainees who were housed there , which included Mr PERSON , on DATE in the rendition circuit I demonstrated .

On this occasion , the ORG executed a rendition circuit which entailed visiting CARDINAL secret detention sites at which ORG detainees were held . These included , in sequence , PERSON in GPE , GPE in GPE , GPE in GPE and LOC , a secret ORG compartment of LOC , having initially commenced in GPE , GPE . On this particular flight route , it has been found that all of the detainees who remained in GPE at that date were transferred out of GPE and deposited into the successive detention facilities at the onward destinations : GPE , Rabat and ORG . Among those persons was one of the applicants DATE , PERSON , who was taken on that date from GPE to LOC . This particular flight circuit was again disguised by dummy flight planning although significantly not in respect of GPE . It was the sole official declaration of PERSON as a destination in the course of all the ORG \u2019s flights into GPE . The reason therefor being that no detainee was being dropped off in GPE on the night of CARDINAL DATE and the methodology of disguising flight planning pertained primarily to those renditions which dropped a detainee off at the destination . Since this visit to PERSON was comprised solely of a pick - up of the remaining detainees , the ORG declared PERSON as a destination openly and instead disguised its onward destinations of GPE and PERSON , hence demonstrating that the methodology of disguised flight planning continued for the second NORP site in GPE , GPE and indeed for other detention sites situated elsewhere in the world . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the course of the ORG presentation Mr GPE testified as follows :", "\u201c ... [ T]he transfer date of GPE to GPE was DATE . Our investigations have provided evidence that this transfer took place directly from LOC to the \u2018 black ORG in GPE , GPE . Again , the [ GPE ] ORG , albeit using code names , coloured code names for the sites in question , describes explicitly where particular detainees were at particular times , and in this passage highlighted , in describing the closure of the LOC facility in the face of probable exposure due to a ORG assessment of the legality of their detention , it states that \u2018 by DATE in DATE , all CARDINAL ORG detainees were transferred from LOC to other ORG detention GPE . The use of \u2018 FAC here in the plural is very important , because the principal destination for those held by the ORG at ORG was in fact back to the facility in GPE from whence they had come . However , as the ORG inquiry made clear , not all of those held at ORG went back to GPE , and indeed the date cited here , DATE , coincides with the flight of NCARDINALVM aircraft from FAC to ORG , GPE , in GPE . This is the flight circuit , again it is backed up by a tranche of documentary evidence which I am prepared to provide to the ORG , and in particular this graphic demonstrates that there were CARDINAL distinct transfers out of FAC . The first on DATE carried detainees from ORG back to GPE , GPE . The second of these , which is of our principal interest , transported CARDINAL or more detainees , among them LOC , via a stopover in GPE onto GPE .", "I have put together a graphic to illustrate that , once again , the ORG had recourse to its systematic practice of disguised flight planning in respect of this flight . We reached a point in our investigations , Madam President , where evidence of dummy flight planning in fact became a tell - tale sign of rendition or detainee transfer activity on such flights . So it is significant , as I will demonstrate , that this was not a simple circuit . The aircraft embarked from GPE and flew to LOC , whereupon the blue line demonstrates the first part of the detainee transfer from ORG to GPE , a flight planned and executed . From GPE , however , the aviation services provider , in this case ORG from GPE , GPE , filed a dummy flight plan to the alternative NORP destination of GPE , on LOC . The aircraft , however , flew and landed at FAC , as documentation from the NORP authorities demonstrates . It is this flight , depicted here with the blue line , that carried LOC to detention in GPE . From GPE , the aircraft flew back to GPE , GPE , and it is apparent premise that CARDINAL or more detainees from the NORP site , detained prior to DATE , was at that point taken from GPE back to detention in GPE , after which the aircraft returned to its base at GPE", "We have been able to uncover this and other flights planned through the network of private contractors , thanks to a large amount of documentation filed in court proceedings in civil courts in GPE , whereupon several GPE aviation service providers , contracted to the ORG , ended up in a financial dispute . The case in question , ORG against [ sic ] ORG , in fact concerns the ORG \u2019s chief aviation contractor , ORG , formerly ORG , its use of a prime aviation contractor known as ORG , previously ORG , which in turn subcontracted its government mandates to a private company called ORG , who were the owners and operators of the aircraft NCARDINALVM .", "I appreciate that this web of corporate relations is quite difficult to understand on its face , but over DATE , myself and other investigators have carefully unpicked these relationships to provide the direct link between the tasking of ORG on government contracts through the ORG \u2019s rendition group air branch , all the way down to the pilots , crew members and operators of the aircraft in question . It is unambiguously and categorically the case that these are rendition aircraft , operated for the sole purpose of transferring detainees between \u2018 black sites\u2019 in the ORG \u2019s ORG programme . The flight of NCARDINALVM , on the dates in question , belongs in that category . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the circumstances surrounding the applicant \u2019s transfer from ORG to GPE , Mr GPE testified at the fact - finding hearing as follows :", "\u201c The ORG site operated only for a finite period . As I mentioned , it was due to the judicial scrutiny of ORG with a case pending in PERSON v. PERSON , which was likely to expose ORG detainees to the same reporting obligations , but also the same rights , that detainees in other forms of federal custody would enjoy , and so the ORG deliberately took action to remove its detainees from such scrutiny in advance of the ORG ruling . ORG describes this process , based upon cables and other classified material , and states that by DATE , the date I assert , DATE , all of those detainees who were held in ORG were moved out .", "There were CARDINAL flights , as I demonstrated , which formed part of this removal process , the first on DATE , the second on DATE . But the first of those only went to GPE , GPE , and if you recall , the ORG described , based upon its assessment of interrogation schedules , that Mr Nashiri had been to CARDINAL different sites in that CARDINAL timeframe , and in order for him to be in CARDINAL different sites , he , at that moment , could not have gone back to GPE , because there are not sufficient documented instances of rendition which link the territories in question , ORG , GPE and GPE , in the timeframe in which the report confirms PERSON GPE \u2019s tour of the sites .", "The DATE site was the sole outward flight linking ORG to GPE . From the report , from the cables regarding Mr GPE treatment and physical and psychological state , we know that he found himself in GPE in DATE , and in DATE , there were specific notes made upon his state and status in those date frames . In order for him to have been in GPE at ORG or \u2018 Britelite\u2019 by that time , he had to be brought to GPE on flight NCARDINALVM on DATE .", "It is a process of elimination , but it is also a process of correlation , which very clearly links to documents filed by contractors , corresponds with the international aviation data that we have analysed , corresponds with the tactics of dummy flight planning and disguise , and ultimately is validated in the public record by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Black , referring to the applicant \u2019s alleged rendition to GPE testified as follows :", "\u201c I am aware of CARDINAL possible flights that could have taken the applicant LOC into GPE , that [ a flight with the tail number NCARDINALVM ] , is CARDINAL of them .

There are indications that he was held in GPE before that , in DATE , which leads me , of the CARDINAL possibilities , that leads me to prefer the DATE flight as being the more likely of the CARDINAL . In terms of my own research , I would say that there is a small ambiguity on that point , I am not prepared to say that the data I have at my fingertips conclusively demonstrates that he was taken on the DATE flight in DATE rather than the February one in DATE . I think the balance of probability does lie in favour of that . However , whichever of the CARDINAL it is , there is no doubt that he was in GPE by DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted that throughout his detention by the ORG he had been subjected to torture and other forms of ill - treatment prohibited by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE authorities disclosed to the public a second , less redacted version of the transcript of the hearing held by ORG in ORG on DATE ( for the first , more extensively redacted version see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; see also paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . During that hearing the applicant described the treatment to which he had been subjected in ORG custody from his capture in DATE to his transfer to ORG in DATE . The relevant part of that transcript read , as follows :", "\u201c From the time I was arrested DATE , they have been torturing me . It happened during interviews . CARDINAL time they tortured me CARDINAL way and another time they tortured me in a different way .", "By hanging , head was up and legs were pointing downwards . I was hung for DATE .

If I shave my hair the scars will become obvious .", "What else do I want to say ? I was without clothes . I was sleeping on the floor for DATE . Many things happened . There were doing so many things . What else did they did ?", "There a box QUANTITY . It was QUANTITY in height They used to put me inside the box . I was standing in that box for DATE and I could n\u2019t do anything . My feet were swollen . My nails were about fall off because , I was standing on my feet for long time . They do so many things . So so many things . What else did they did ?", "That thing lasted for QUANTITY ] . After that another method of torture began . They use to put something in the food that use to make the body tired . Before I was arrested I used to be able to run QUANTITY . Now , I can not walk for TIME . My nerves are swollen in my body . Swollen too . They used to ask me questions and the investigator after that used to laugh . And , I used to answer the answer that I knew . And , if I did n\u2019t reply what I heard , he used to put something in my food . And , after I ate it my body felt like , um , strange . After that he used to come back and talk to me . He told you he put anything in the food . He used to deny that but the camera was behind him . And ; I would stand in front of the camera and he used to tell you that because camera was on . He could not deny anything . You have to acknowledge to what we are saying . And , I used to say acknowledge what ? They used to ask even political questions . CARDINAL is the solution to the NORP problem in GPE . I \u2019m not the NORP Foreign Minister to answer these questions . So they used to go and put some stuff in my food . These things happen for DATE . That thing did not stop until here . So many things happened . I do n\u2019t in summary , that \u2019s basically what happened .", "Then , the President of ORG says :", "Alright . Let me ask . So then since the time of capture DATE until you came to ORG you experienced these types of events ?", "The applicant responds :", "Yes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the fact - finding hearing PERSON made the following statements concerning the treatment to which the applicant could be subjected during his alleged detention in GPE :", "\u201c I find myself somewhat more limited in my ability to describe specific forms of treatment or interrogation techniques to which Mr PERSON was subjected in GPE than was the case in respect of GPE . And that is because of the natural evolution of the detention cycles to which ORG detainees were subjected . In pursuit of what was described as \u2018 live actionable intelligence\u2019 , the ORG developed its most stringent , harsh interrogation plans for DATE and DATE of a detainee \u2019s period in its detention system . Usually , within DATE of being apprehended , the chief of base at the \u2018 black ORG in question would appeal to ORG headquarters for authorisation to practise EITs , so called \u2018 enhanced interrogation GPE . This was the case in respect of PERSON , this was the case in respect of PERSON , this was the case in respect of PERSON , this we know because of ORG reports . As soon as a detainee was in custody , in PERSON case , was fit enough to undergo interrogation , that plan would commence . We know that PERSON underwent DATE of harsh interrogation in GPE including the waterboard , and we know that upon transfer to GPE , because he was assessed as having withheld information or not been compliant , he was then subjected to an intensive period of harsh interrogation during with multiple , unauthorised techniques were used . Those were documented in the earlier proceedings [ GPE v. GPE ] . But there arrives a juncture in a ORG detainee \u2019s detention at which his intelligence value is assessed as lower , at which no further approval or authorisation is sought or granted to practise these enhanced interrogation techniques , and in GPE case we can only say that that point arrived sometime in DATE . Thereafter , it is , in my assessment and according to the documentary record , unlikely that the ORG practised further unauthorised techniques or indeed concerted programmes of enhanced interrogation on PERSON .", "However , that is not to say that he was not subjected to abuse or indeed that the conditions of his confinement did not amount to violations of LAW . In respect of those CARDINAL latter points , I would aver quite clearly that the treatment did amount to violations of the LAW , purely by virtue of the conditions in which he was held and because of the regular interventions made by persons at the \u2018 black ORG to gratuitously abuse , punitively or otherwise , certain detainees in their custody . I can give you analogous examples of how detainees were treated in GPE . PERSON , for example : there is a lengthy description of his having endured TIME of sleep deprivation , having been shaved and barbered , stripped naked , placed in standing positions with his hands above his head . There are descriptions of how , notwithstanding medical and psychological problems diagnosed by professionals at the scene , he was subjected to further interrogation to the point of enduring hallucinations . I could also cite the example of PERSON , a detainee for whom the ORG sought authorisation to use the waterboard in GPE , an unprecedented move , and who was subsequently subjected to an intensive period of enhanced interrogation in the same site at which LOC was held . I could also cite the case of PERSON who was captured in DATE and even at that point , DATE and more into the programme , was subjected to the same litany of abusive techniques in interrogating him as LOC and others had been subjected to in DATE and DATE . And I could also cite , too , some memoranda produced by the ORG General Counsel \u2019s office in the material period in which PERSON was held in GPE , which described conditions of confinement , sensory deprivation as a matter of routine , denial of religious rights , physical and psychological oppression , sleep deprivation as a matter of course , notwithstanding whether a detainee is subject at that time , or not , to EITs .", "So whilst I can not give the same level of specificity as I was able to present in respect of GPE , I can aver with a high level of certainty that he endured ill - treatment whilst held in GPE because , in my view , every one of those detainees brought to GPE , held incommunicado , indefinitely , with no idea of their whereabouts or their fate , subjected to frequent renditions , shackled , drugged , often beaten in the process , every one of those persons would have a legitimate claim under our NORP Convention on Human Rights for violation of their personal integrity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Black testified as follows :", "\u201c The question of precise types of treatment is , I would not say it is my specific expertise . It is clear from ORG and other sources that treatment in GPE included very extreme sleep deprivation , which apparently led some of those who suffered it to have very severe mental and physical problems , and it is clear also that the applicant , Mr GPE , in particular when he was in GPE , was experiencing serious , let \u2019s say , psychological problems as a result of the treatment that he had received . But my , and I should say also it is clear that around that time , DATE , it is firmly on the record that there were a range of treatments being applied to these people , that the enhanced interrogation techniques were being applied , I think this has all been quite well documented , but it is not really my topic of expertise , I would not say . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Citing as a source CARDINAL ORG cables of CARDINAL May CARDINAL , the DATE ORG states that \u201c at CARDINAL point PERSON launched a short - lived hunger strike that resulted in the ORG feeding him rectally \u201d ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Referring to an email to ORG dated DATE on the subject \u201c ORG for Endgame Views \u201d , the report states that \u201c an DATE psychological assessment of PERSON was used by the ORG to advance its discussions with ORG officials on establishing an \u201c endgame \u201d for the [ ORG ] program \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG further refers to the applicant \u2019s detention at ORG in DATE and DATE as follows :", "\u201c In DATE of LOC detention , most of the intelligence requirements for PERSON involved showing PERSON photographs . In DATE , the DETENTION SITE BLACK chief of Base suspended even these debriefings because it was \u2018 the very , very rare ORG that LOC would recognize a photograph , and because the debriefings often were the \u2018 ORG for his outbursts . \u201d", "It also states , with reference to a cable of DATE , that in DATE ORG expressed concern regarding PERSON \u201c continued state of depression and uncooperative attitude \u201d . DATE a ORG psychologist assessed that the applicant was on the \u201c verge of a breakdown \u201d ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his initial submissions the applicant submitted that no later than CARDINAL September CARDINAL the NORP authorities had assisted the ORG in secretly transferring him from GPE to another ORG \u201c black site \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The experts gave CARDINAL possible dates for the applicant \u2019s rendition from GPE : DATE and DATE . According to them , the latter date was the final closure of the ORG \u201c black site \u201d on GPE \u2019s territory , prompted by the publication of PERSON article \u201c ORG Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons \u201d suggesting that such prisons operated in LOC countries on DATE ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the ORG presentation Mr GPE testified as follows :", "\u201c In terms of [ FAC in GPE \u2019s ] closure , it is stated in the [ DATE ORG ] that after the publication of ORG article , that is the piece of reporting , the Pulitzer Prize - winning article by PERSON , ... dated DATE , the authorities of this country demanded the closure of ORG within TIME CARDINAL . We can see that from the redaction , it does not state exactly how many hours , but it is DATE . And in fact , as I described , CARDINAL DATE , using its practices of dummy flight planning and a further disguise which I will demonstrate shortly , the ORG transferred all of its remaining ORG detainees out of the facility within this time period . Again , as stated , flights into and out of GPE correspond exactly with the narrative described in the report .", "It might be pointed out , in relation to this specific package , that in order for the authorities of the host country to demand the closure of a detention facility , they must have known of its existence . Furthermore , in light of the report in ORG , which went into intimate detail of the ORG \u2019s operations including the forms of ill - treatment and interrogation to which detainees therein were subjected , it follows that the authorities of the host country of ORG and let me be clear \u2013 that is the authorities of GPE , must have known of the nature of operations occurring on their territory .", "The question has often been posed to us , Honourable Judges , if there were detainees in GPE , how did they leave ? There appeared to be no obvious direct flights out of GPE in the critical period , DATE , to any other detention site we were aware of , and this was often put forward by representatives of the NORP authorities as a reason for decrying , for rejecting , for refuting the content of our reporting [ i.e. at the time of the publication of the DATE and the DATE ORG ] .", "We have , however , now ascertained how detainees were removed from GPE , and this occurred in CARDINAL tranches in DATE and , as stated , DATE . I have chosen to illustrate the first of these transfers , which occurred CARDINAL of DATE , because it provides a further segue into detention operations on the territory of ORG , in this case GPE .", "The ORG used CARDINAL tactics of deceit in order to provide these flights with the maximum degree of cover , in order that they could not and would not be tracked , traced or held to account . The first of those was its conventional dummy flight planning , but the second of those was a novel tactic involving switching of aircraft . This graphic will demonstrate how this was deployed on CARDINAL and DATE , involving CARDINAL aircraft , namely PERSON and PERSON . The first of those aircraft is depicted by red lines , the second by blue , on the graphic , the other symbols follow the earlier pattern of drop - off , transfer and stopover points . The CARDINAL planes arrived in LOC , the first [ NCARDINALAB ] from provenance of ORG , GPE , the second [ NCARDINALWH ] from provenance of ORG in GPE on DATE . While the first flew to GPE , in GPE , the second flew directly to GPE , GPE , which would become the staging point for these operations . The first dummy flight plan , filed by the ORG \u2019s aviation services provider , stated a path for PERSON from GPE to GPE airport , a route which it did not , nor did it intend , to fly . The aircraft instead flew directly to GPE airport , the servicing airport for the \u2018 black ORG in GPE , whereupon it would collect detainees . Those detainees referred to in ORG who were cleared from GPE in these critical DATE were then taken from GPE to GPE , to the staging point where the other ORG aircraft had been waiting for DATE in advance . In this staging point , in an unprecedented manoeuvre , according to our investigations , detainees were transferred from the first aircraft onto the second , together with members of the ORG rendition crew . The second aircraft , PERSON , which is also a ORG CARDINAL business jet , used conventionally for wholesale transfers filed its own dummy flight plan , citing a destination of GPE , GPE , a route which it did not , nor did it intend , to fly . Instead , this aircraft NCARDINALWH flew on DATE carrying detainees from GPE to GPE , GPE , thereby providing a link CARDINAL detention sites on NORP territory . The aircraft then departed in their own respective directions , the rendition aircraft NCARDINALWH via GPE , towards the north , and the first aircraft , PERSON from GPE , via FAC , back towards GPE . Therein the ORG had innovated yet another means , another layer of cover to obstruct proper accounting for the illegal transfer of its detainees , but due to a process which Senator PERSON referred to as \u2018 la dynamique de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u2019 , we have been able , methodically and carefully , to unpick these layers of secrecy and present to this ORG what we believe is a truthful and accurate accounting of operations in respect of these \u2018 black sites\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his further testimony , in response to questions from the ORG , Mr GPE added :", "\u201c There are CARDINAL known and documented junctures at which ORG detainees at the \u2018 black ORG in GPE were removed from GPE . The first of those , I illustrated with my last set of graphics , on CARDINAL and DATE , which took detainees from GPE , GPE via switching of aircraft in GPE , to GPE , GPE . The second took place on DATE , within DATE of ORG report , and at the insistence of the NORP authorities , which took detainees via GPE , GPE to GPE , GPE . We know that at DATE there were CARDINAL ORG detention sites in active operation , that much is stated in ORG . Those were the sites known as \u2018 PERSON and \u2018 PERSON : the former , \u2018 Violet\u2019 , in GPE , the latter , \u2018 PERSON , in GPE . And so PERSON , in all likelihood and without any other information to refer to , was taken to one of those QUANTITY destinations on CARDINAL of those CARDINAL flights . Based upon my earlier rationale about the CARDINAL different facilities in which he was held , I would aver that it is more likely than not that he was taken from GPE to GPE on CARDINAL and DATE and was held there until DATE transfer in DATE to GPE and subsequently on to LOC . That would , logically , complete the number and nature of detention experiences chronicled in ORG and other documents released by GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Black testified as follows :", "\u201c ... [ T]here are CARDINAL possibilities , and I believe CARDINAL possibilities : CARDINAL is that [ the applicant ] left [ GPE ] in DATE , on DATE , and the other is that he left on DATE . If the flight on DATE was a dual flight , it was a kind of a CARDINAL - plane switch that took prisoners from GPE into GPE , and the flight DATE in DATE was again a CARDINAL - plane switch that took prisoners from GPE into GPE . I think there is an indication in the data that we have , based on ORG , that Mr PERSON was taken to GPE , which should mean he was taken in DATE rather than DATE , but it is , I would not say it is MONEY clear , unambiguous . I would say it is an indication that seems probable . There is no doubt that the flight in DATE signalled the end of the NORP site , I mean it came , I do not know , TIME after the existence of the site had been revealed in ORG , the government had demanded the site shut down , ORG is very clear that at that point everyone who was remaining in GPE was shipped out to GPE , so at that point , after DATE , the ORG \u2018 black ORG programme was operating only in GPE and in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant section in the DATE ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c After publication of ORG article , [ REDACTED ] Country [ REDACTED ] demanded closure of DETENTION SITE BLACK within [ CARDINAL - digit number REDACTED ] TIME .

Nor had the experts heard at the fact - finding hearing been able to give a precise date for his transfer out of GPE .", "CARDINAL . It was therefore clear that there was no conclusive evidence in support of any of the above versions of the possible dates , circumstances or period of the applicant \u2019s alleged detention in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , there was a particular circuit of information concerning the alleged existence on NORP territory of \u201c secret \u201d detention facilities . To begin with , mass media had launched accusations against certain GPE . Later on , this information had been reiterated as genuine by non - governmental organisations protecting human rights . These organisations had presented as evidence data extracted from records , invoices , and flight plans of planes allegedly used for transferring detainees . At the same time , these organisations had deliberately ignored the verifications performed by some NORP countries regarding the flights allegedly connected to the rendition programme . As a consequence , the information contained in official documents was not based on strong evidence , but on the sum of the data given by the mass media based on nonverifiable sources .", "CARDINAL . The Government contested the credibility of sources relied on by Senator PERSON in his reports of DATE and DATE . They said that the Marty Reports included many inconsistencies and contradictions . For instance , even though the reports had stated that the materials analysed , i.e. satellite photographs , aircraft movements and witness accounts , had not constituted evidence in the formal sense of the term , the authors had nevertheless found that these elements had been sufficiently serious to assume that a ORG secret detention facility existed in GPE . In the Government \u2019s opinion , Senator PERSON had displayed reluctance to reveal his alleged sources of evidence and protected them under the plea of a strict policy of confidentiality . Statements given by anonymous witnesses were not challengeable and this impeded the Government in properly contesting their reliability and defending themselves against the accusations made in the Marty Reports .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the DATE PERSON , the Government saw inconsistencies in many respects . For instance , it was mentioned that the evidence had been obtained through alleged discussions with \u201c well - placed persons from the ORG and the intelligence services \u201d . It was also stated that information had been classified by the NORP into \u201c tiny pieces of information \u201d in order to prevent any single foreign official from seeing a \u201c big picture \u201d . But it was further said that only the highly placed officials had been aware of the HVD Programme . In these circumstances , those \u201c well - placed persons \u201d had been in no position to offer any information .", "The DATE ORG spoke of the alleged \u201c operating agreements \u201d between the ORG and GPE to hold detainees . However , in the next paragraph Senator PERSON had admitted that he had not seen the text of any such agreement .", "Furthermore , statements of NORP politicians had been taken out of context to support the report \u2019s erroneous conclusions . Even a declaration of the NORP President had been distorted into a \u201c formal approval \u201d of the agreement for the cooperation in the ORG .", "In sum , the DATE ORG categorical conclusion that it \u201c [ had been ] finally established that secret detention centres [ had ] existed for DATE in GPE \u201d seemed to have gone beyond the scant indications on which it had been based .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON findings of DATE , in particular those referred to in his affidavit and included in the dossier prepared for ORG , the Government pointed out that they were \u2013 like Senator PERSON \u2019s conclusions \u2013 based on newspaper articles and sources that could not be verified . They were accordingly no more than unsubstantiated allegations . Also , in the same fashion as other experts before the ORG , PERSON had based his theories on selective materials , without analysing the existing contradictions . For instance , he had found support for his assertions as to the alleged use of the ORG building by the ORG in the fact that in GPE a State facility had hosted a secret detention site . This was concluded without having regard to obvious differences between a remote location and a building used on a DATE basis by Government officials in a NORP capital .", "CARDINAL . Referring to Reprieve \u2019s research and findings , the ORG said that this non - governmental organisation represented the interests of some of the detainees held in ORG and carried out a humanitarian project concerning persons who had been subjected to extraordinary rendition in the ORG . Reprieve \u2019s current case work involved representing CARDINAL prisoners from ORG , assisting over CARDINAL prisoners facing the death penalty around the world and conducting ongoing investigations into the rendition and the secret detention of \u201c ghost prisoners \u201d in the so - called \u201c war on terror \u201d . In these circumstances , Reprieve could not objectively state the facts in their documents and respective articles .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the Government pointed out that the reliability of the ORG sources cited by the experts and various inquiries or media reports was open to doubt because even the DATE ORG concluded that the ORG had leaked inaccurate information regarding the operation of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not deny that DATE allegedly \u201c suspicious \u201d \u2013 planes had landed at and taken off from NORP airports ; these flights had at least partly been documented by the DATE ORG . Also , publicly available evidence confirmed their stopovers on NORP soil . However , the impugned flights had been of a private and non - commercial nature and had been treated accordingly . In all cases invoices , air navigation service sheets or ground handling charge notes had been issued for all the services provided . The flights had been included in the control lists of the navigation records . The declassified annexes to the DATE ORG supported the conclusion that the purpose of the \u201c N \u201d flights\u2019 stops at FAC had been mainly technical in nature .", "For instance , as regards the alleged \u201c rendition flight \u201d NCARDINALVM of CARDINAL DATE , the available documents attested that the flight had been recorded in the table containing handling fees and in the control list of navigation records , that an invoice had been issued and that the payment had been made by card ; a copy of the air routing card having been attached to the relevant documents .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , several witnesses who had worked in FAC at the material time and who had made statements in the investigation had identified these flights as having had a technical stop for refuelling at the airport . The vast majority of the witnesses had stated that the \u201c N \u201d flights had been serviced by a civil handling agent as any normal flight . Even the witnesses who had noted aspects that would suggest that the GPE flights had gone through a different procedure had completed their declarations by stating that they had not seen any persons disembarking from these aircraft . It should be stressed that not all the witnesses had serviced the same flights and that , therefore , their declarations should not be seen as contradictory .", "CARDINAL . In contrast to the circumstances surrounding the ORG planes\u2019 landings as established by ORG in GPE v. GPE , in GPE there had been no special procedure for receiving the impugned flights . As the documents in the investigation file showed , all the \u201c N \u201d flights had gone through the standard procedure . The procedure , as described in the ORG statements , had been entirely different from what had happened in GPE in GPE . No foreign vehicles had been seen entering the premises of FAC , there had been no military intervention in order to secure the airport perimeter and , most certainly , GPE officials had not assumed control of the airport on the dates in question . Nor had any HVDs been seen entering the country , as witnesses quoted in the DATE ORG had stated with regard to the aircraft landings in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . As regards the importance attached by the international inquiries , media and experts heard by the ORG to changes of flight plans , in the ORG \u2019s view this by itself could not suggest any involvement of the ORG in the applicant \u2019s detention and ill - treatment .", "The Government did not deny that the initial flight plans for the NCARDINALP flight on DATE and the NCARDINALVM flight on DATE indicating PERSON as their destination had been changed and the planes had eventually landed at FAC in GPE . Yet this could not be a proof of any consistent practice of the so - called \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning referred to in DATE Reports and the findings of ORG Commissioner for Human Rights .", "In accordance with the relevant domestic and international regulations , every flight must have a flight plan , except for emergency issues . Each flight plan must indicate , in addition to the plane \u2019s destination , an alternative destination . The flight plans had been established by the aircraft \u2019s operators . The only potential involvement of the authorities had been limited to their assistance in transmitting the flight plan to the entity managing the integrated initial flight plan processing system . The decision to use the alternative destination or a change in flight plan had been a unilateral action by the flight operator . The acceptance of these changes in the flight plans was not indicative of any complicity of the NORP authorities since such acceptance had in fact been automatic .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , the alleged STS / STATE indicators for the impugned flights could not be considered meaningful , even though various reports had emphasised their exceptional relevance . According to the applicable rules , that indicator should not automatically qualify for an exemption from any relevant flow regulations . Even Mr GPE they added , although repeatedly asked , could not indicate any special privileges that the STS / STATE designation would entail .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s submission , the allegations regarding NORP \u2019s complicity in the ORG , in particular by means of \u201c secret cooperation agreements \u201d were completely baseless . No such agreements existed .", "In that context , the Government referred to the NORP high - office ORG statements , in particular those made by former President of GPE , PERSON and his former security adviser , PERSON in ORG in DATE . Both of them had said that specific agreements had been concluded with the NORP authorities after DATE , including the NORP support at the level of intelligence services \u2013 which had actually been very fruitful . This did not mean cooperation in running a secret prison . Furthermore , in the course of the criminal investigation their initially ambiguous statements had later been clarified to the effect that there had been no cooperation and no complicity in the ORG rendition and secret detention operations on the part of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Nor could it be said that the NORP authorities had otherwise agreed \u2013 explicitly or implicitly \u2013 to the running of a secret detention facility by the ORG in GPE and that they had made available to them LOC for that purpose . These were simply groundless assumptions unsupported by any evidence .", "Referring again to the statements of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON statements in PERSON , the Government stressed that they had both clearly confirmed that they had had no knowledge of any ORG - run detention facility on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . No evidence had been produced to show the slightest degree of knowledge on the part of the NORP authorities as to the alleged hidden purpose of the flights landing at and taking off from NORP airports .", "As attested by Mr GPE at the fact - finding hearing , only at DATE had there emerged the first information about the alleged existence in some \u201c NORP countries \u201d of secret detention facilities designated for suspected terrorists and run by the ORG . Before that time the only information available had concerned the detention facilities in LOC , GPE , GPE or GPE and a specific case concerning the surrender of CARDINAL NORP men by ORG into GPE custody . While information on the setting - up of military commissions for trying persons accused of terrorist acts had been in the public domain , the identities of those persons had been unknown . Nor had it been known what the GPE authorities\u2019 decision would be as to which of them would actually be tried before military commissions rather than before federal courts .", "In sum , at the relevant time , from DATE , there had been no information that would have allowed GPE to suspect that some of the GPE flights that had landed in LOC had been used for the transfer of prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the international inquiries , the ORG declassified documents , the DATE ORG , other abundant materials compiling most recent research on the operation of the ORG and expert testimony obtained by the ORG provided a wealth of compelling evidence supporting his allegations and rejecting the Government \u2019s arguments as utterly untenable .", "In his view , it was established beyond reasonable doubt that GPE had hosted a secret ORG prison in DATE and that he had been detained in that prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE ORG and other documentary exhibits before the ORG , as well as cogent and credible expert testimony confirmed that the ORG detention site code - named \u201c FAC \u201d or \u201c FAC \u201d had been located in GPE . The fact that a ORG secret prison had been located in GPE had already been confirmed in the DATE ORG . In the GPE v. GPE judgment the ORG had quoted verbatim from the expert testimony of Senator PERSON and PERSON GPE stating that there had been a secret ORG detention site in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards evidence that had emerged after the above judgment , the applicant attached particular importance to the DATE ORG , adding that it fully confirmed the ORG \u2019s factual findings in LOC GPE , including those based on expert testimony and documentary evidence .", "Although the report did not refer to GPE by name , it was established that publicly available information , when cross - referenced with references to ORG confirmed that this site was \u201c FAC \u201d , a secret ORG prison that had operated in GPE in DATE . For example , the DATE ORG stated that detainees had begun arriving at ORG \u201c in DATE \u201d . It also stated that after publication on DATE of ORG article by ORG disclosing that NORP countries had hosted ORG \u201c black sites \u201d , the country concerned had demanded the closure of ORG within hours and that the ORG had transferred the remaining ORG detainees out of the facility shortly thereafter .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the DATE PERSON stated that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that the ORG had used a facility in GPE to hold prisoners , that the first of them had been transferred to this facility on DATE and that the last ones had been transferred out of the facility in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant relied on expert testimony at the fact - finding hearing . Senator PERSON had stated that there had been no shadow of doubt that GPE had participated in the ORG programme . Mr GPE had testified that with the exception of the \u201c black site \u201d in GPE , the NORP \u201c black site \u201d had operated for the longest period and held more detainees than any other ORG \u201c black site \u201d . Mr GPE and PERSON had confirmed that the applicant had been secretly detained in GPE . They had also confirmed that the wealth of details about \u201c FAC \u201d in the DATE ORG all corresponded to details about the GPE prison that the ORG code - named \u201c Bright Light \u201d , where the applicant had been detained . As such , the report by itself , offered by no less than the United States\u2019 own ORG , based on exhaustive review of ORG documents , rendered untenable ORG claim that there was no evidence of a ORG prison on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the Government \u2019s arguments ( see paragraphs DATE above ) , the applicant said that contrary to their assertions the application had not stated that he had been detained in GPE for the entire period DATE and DATE . Rather , it stated that he had been detained in GPE for some time during that period . Moreover , after the subsequent disclosure of the dossier submitted by PERSON , the precise date on which the applicant was transferred to a ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE had become clear \u2013 it had been DATE , on flight NCARDINALVM from LOC to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further emphasised that , as regards the location of the secret prison , it had become known only on DATE when a news report had identified for the first time the precise location of the ORG prison in GPE , while at the same time confirming the applicant \u2019s detention there , and providing details of the ill - treatment of detainees . The report had cited GPE intelligence officials familiar with the location and inner working of the prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that planes associated with the ORG rendition operations had landed and taken off from GPE at the material time . The annex to the DATE ORG listed CARDINAL flights that had been considered suspicious by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The Fava Report had \u201c [ e]xpresse[d ] serious concern about the CARDINAL stopovers made by ORG - operated aircraft at NORP airports \u201d which on many occasions had come from or had been bound for countries linked with extraordinary rendition circuits and the transfer of detainees . The list of rendition planes included flight NCARDINALVM of CARDINAL DATE on which the applicant had been transferred to and from GPE .", "The Fava Report further noted that a flight with registration number ORG had suffered an accident on DATE when landing in GPE . The aircraft had reportedly taken off from FAC in GPE , and its CARDINAL passengers had disappeared following the accident . The report expressed deep concern \u201c that NORP authorities [ had ] not initiate[d ] an official investigation process ... into the case of a passenger on the aircraft Gulfstream NCARDINALGCARDINAL , who [ had been ] found carrying a Beretta CARDINAL PERSON pistol with ammunition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant pointed out that the international inquiries and the experts heard by ORG had identified the rendition flights on which he had been transferred to and from GPE .", "The finding in Mr PERSON \u2019s dossier for ORG that the applicant had been transferred to GPE on DATE on board NCARDINALVM , a flight clearly and consistently associated with the rendition operations , had been confirmed by multiple reliable sources , including the DATE ORG and the reconstruction by those experts of the applicant \u2019s transfers in ORG custody .", "CARDINAL . As regards his possible transfer from GPE , the experts had given CARDINAL dates , agreeing on the most probable date , which constituted sufficient evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the ORG \u2019s arguments contesting the evidential value of the material before the ORG should be rejected in their entirety .", "In his view , the Government \u2019s submissions simply constituted an attempt to discredit the findings of reputable officials like ORG Commissioner for Human Rights and Senator PERSON , by arguing that these findings were based solely on newspaper articles . In doing so , they failed to take into account the fact that Mr PERSON and Senator PERSON had engaged in independent investigations and analysis of their own .", "Indeed , Commissioner PERSON \u2019s dossier for ORG had expressly drawn on the \u201c original investigation and the analysis undertaken by [ his ] Office during DATE of [ his ] mandate as Commissioner , among other sources of information \u201d . Similarly , the DATE ORG had engaged in \u201c analysis of CARDINAL of international flight records \u2013 and a network of sources established in numerous countries \u201d .", "Further , as regards the statement in the DATE ORG that GPE had entered into a bilateral agreement with the GPE authorities , the applicant pointed out that , contrary to the Government \u2019s assertion , the fact that Senator PERSON had not seen the actual document did not undermine the credibility of his claim that such an agreement had in fact existed , because its existence had been verified by credible sources , some of whom had been directly involved in negotiations that had led to this agreement . The fact that such an agreement had been brokered had recently been corroborated by the DATE ORG .", "CARDINAL . For the applicant , there was no doubt that the NORP authorities had cooperated with the ORG in the ORG . They had granted licences and overflight permissions to facilitate the ORG rendition flights . The ORG \u2019s officials had collaborated with ORG ( and , by extension , with ORG \u2019s client , the ORG ) by accepting the task of navigating disguised flights into NORP airports .", "CARDINAL . As set forth in the DATE ORG , GPE had entered into a bilateral agreement with GPE . The report had named individual office - holders who had known about , authorised and stood accountable for GPE \u2019s role in the ORG \u2019s operation of secret detention facilities on NORP territory from DATE as follows : the former President of GPE ( up to DATE ) , PERSON ; the then President of GPE ( DATE ) , PERSON ; ORG on ORG ( until DATE ) . PERSON ; the Minister of ORG ( ministerial oversight up to DATE ) , PERSON ; and the Head of ORG , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . GPE had therefore participated in the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment and incommunicado detention by entering into that agreement and giving the GPE the \u201c full extent of permissions and protections it sought \u201d for conducting secret detention and rendition operations on NORP territory ; issuing an order to NORP military intelligence services on behalf of the President to provide the ORG with all the facilities they had required and to protect their operations in whichever way they had requested ; providing the use of a NORP Government building for hosting the secret prison where LOC had been detained ; actively assisting the landing , departures and stopovers of secret ORG rendition flights including flights which had transported LOC in and out of GPE ; and failing to disclose the truth and effectively investigate the existence of a secret ORG prison and rendition flights in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s torture and secret detention , as well as his transfer from GPE in the face of real risks of further torture , secret detention and the death penalty could be attributed to ORG because these acts had occurred on NORP territory with the acquiescence and connivance of the NORP authorities and because GPE had failed to fulfil its positive obligations to prevent these acts , despite being on notice that they would occur .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , citing PERSON v. GPE the applicant emphasised that in that case the ORG had found that ORG rendition operations had \u201c largely depended on cooperation , assistance and active involvement of the countries which put at the GPE \u2019s disposal their airspace , airports for the landing of aircraft transporting ORG prisoners and , last but not least , LOC on which the prisoners could be securely detained and interrogated \u201d and that \u201c the cooperation and various forms of assistance of those authorities , such as for instance customising the LOC for the ORG \u2019s needs , ensuring security and providing the logistics [ had been ] the necessary condition for the effective operation of the ORG secret detention facilities \u201d . This was true with respect to GPE . Just as the ORG had found it inconceivable that GPE had not known about the secret detention of prisoners on its territory , it was simply inconceivable that GPE had not known that it had been hosting a secret prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that GPE had knowingly , intentionally , and actively collaborated and colluded with the ORG \u2019s extraordinary rendition programme , thereby enabling the ORG to subject him to secret detention and ill - treatment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities should have known that high - value detainees would be tortured and ill - treated . Their close degree of cooperation with the ORG \u2019s secret detention operations in GPE must have put NORP authorities on notice of the prisoners being at risk of secret detention and ill - treatment .", "In addition , GPE had had notice of the secret detention , torture and mistreatment of prisoners because of international and NORP news reports , reports of the ORG and human rights organisations and NORP legal cases that had documented GPE mistreatment of detainees suspected of terrorism at the material time . ORG were also presumed to have known of the ORG \u2019s secret detention , torture , and ill - treatment of terrorism suspects through its diplomatic missions .", "CARDINAL . As the DATE ORG had concluded , GPE had been \u201c knowingly complicit in the ORG \u2019s secret detention programme \u201d and senior NORP officials had \u201c [ known ] about , authorised , and [ stood ] accountable for GPE \u2019s role \u201d in the ORG \u2019s secret detention and rendition operations on NORP territory \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the DATE ORG had confirmed that the NORP authorities had known that they had been hosting a secret prison and had attempted to cover up this fact . Indeed , the report observed that the NORP authorities had \u201c entered into an agreement \u201d in DATE with the GPE to host the prison , and that the GPE had paid the NORP authorities \u201c MONEY to host the prison \u201d . It also confirmed that within TIME of ORG reporting in DATE that NORP countries had hosted secret ORG prisons , the NORP authorities had insisted on closing the ORG prison on their territory .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the evidence before the ORG demonstrated that it was the NORP authorities which had given the ORG permission to run a secret prison in GPE , it was the NORP authorities who had given the ORG permission to use dummy flight plans to secretly land rendition planes carrying prisoners in and out of the country , and it was NORP authorities who had given the ORG extraordinary security cover for their operations in GPE .", "As expert ORG had said at the fact - finding hearing : \u201c it [ was ] quite clear that the NORP authorities not only should have known but did know of the nature and purpose of the ORG \u2019s secret operations on their territory \u201d . He had also testified that this level of cooperation had depended on authorisation by the highest levels in ORG . The DATE ORG had confirmed this . Mr PERSON and PERSON had testified that the NORP authorities had known the nature and purpose of the ORG activities on NORP territory because the ORG had paid MONEY as a subsidy to host the prisoners . Moreover , the DATE ORG had also established that it had been at the insistence of ORG that ORG had been ultimately closed . ORG had demanded closure of the ORG prison within TIME from the publication of the DATE ORG article disclosing that ORG \u201c black sites \u201d had existed in LOC . This clearly confirmed that for as long as the ORG prison had existed on NORP territory , it had been there with ORG consent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant referred to the ORG \u2019s finding in LOC v. GPE ( cited above ) that by DATE it was widely known that the GPE rendition programme had involved secret detention in overseas locations . It stood to reason that GPE , which had hosted a secret ORG prison after GPE and had enabled the applicant \u2019s transfers from its territory well after DATE , indeed in DATE , had known by then that there had been substantial grounds for believing that the applicant had faced all of these risks .", "CARDINAL . As regards the statements of Mr PERSON \u2019s and PERSON , the applicant maintained that the ORG \u2019s submission was yet another example of their consistent refusal to acknowledge the truth about their hosting of a secret ORG prison on NORP territory . In particular , the Government had quoted selectively from the statement of witness Z , denying that GPE had hosted a secret ORG prison . But a closer look at that statement revealed that Z had actually admitted that the NORP authorities had supplied a \u201c location \u201d to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the applicant further referred to testimony given by witnesses X , Y and Z , saying that their statements expressly conceded that ORG flights had landed in GPE . In particular , X had said that GPE had partnership relations with similar institutions from other GPE , including equivalent structures in GPE . He also stated that in the framework of these bilateral relations , civil aircraft hired by the partner services on which their representatives travelled had landed at FAC . Witness Z had confirmed that GPE government officials had asked the NORP authorities to provide some locations on GPE \u2019s territory for the deployment of actions meant to fight the dangers of international terrorism and which were to be used by the ORG and that the authorities had \u201c offer[ed ] a location for ORG activities \u201d \u2018 . In his DATE statement Z had acknowledged that there had been \u201c concrete agreements \u201d that had made possible the operation of the special GPE flights in GPE and that those flights had not been \u201c under any obligation to obey usual rules imposed on civil flights \u201d .", "Moreover , Y testified that , in the context of GPE \u2019s strategic objective of \u201c ORG and ORG integration \u201d , it had been possible that ORG offices had been run on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant reiterated that all the experts heard by ORG at the fact - finding hearing had stated , in unambiguous terms , that GPE not only ought to have known but must have known and had known of the nature and the purpose of the ORG \u2019s secret operations occurring on its territory .", "CARDINAL . Referring to any knowledge of the GPE authorities\u2019 practices in respect of suspected terrorist attributable to any ORG to the Convention at the relevant time , AI / ICJ pointed to , among other things , to the following facts that had been a matter of public knowledge .", "CARDINAL . NORP The interveners first emphasised that they had shown in their submissions in GPE and GPE v. GPE ( both cited above ) that , at least by DATE , there had been substantial credible evidence in the public domain that in the context of what the GPE called the global \u201c war on terror \u201d , GPE forces had been engaging in enforced disappearances , secret detentions , arbitrary detentions , secret detainee transfers , and torture or other ill - treatment . Further , the submissions showed that , by presidential military order , the GPE had established military commissions \u2013 executive tribunals with the power to hand down death sentences \u2013 for the prosecution of selected non - GPE nationals accused of involvement in terrorism in proceedings that would not comply with international fair trial standards .", "CARDINAL . A DATE confidential report of the ICRC on Coalition abuses in GPE , leaked in DATE and published in the media at that time , found that detainees labelled by the GPE as \u201c high - value \u201d were at particular risk of torture and other ill - treatment and \u201c high value detainees \u201d had been held for DATE in a facility at FAC in conditions that violated international law .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE reports covering DATE and DATE , distributed widely to governments and the media , AI had reported on the growing body of evidence of human rights violations committed by GPE forces in the counter- terrorism context and stated that these violations , including secret detention and rendition , were continuing . In addition to individual country entries , the global overview pages of both reports addressed GPE abuses in the \u201c war on terror \u201d . For example , in the report covering DATE this overview showed how during DATE , it had become \u201c increasingly clear how many countries had colluded or participated in supporting GPE abusive policies and practices in the \u2018 war on GPE , including torture , ill - treatment secret and unlimited detentions , and unlawful cross - border transfers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG published a leaked CARDINAL DATE memorandum written in ORG at the request of the ORG . The memo advised , inter alia , that \u201c under the circumstances of the current war against ORG and its allies \u201d , presidential authority could override the GPE anti - torture law , that even if an interrogation method did violate that law \u201c necessity or self - defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability \u201d , and that there was a \u201c significant range of acts \u201d that , while constituting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , \u201c fail to rise to the level of torture \u201d and need not be criminalised .", "CARDINAL . In DATE AI published a CARDINAL-page long analysis of GPE violations in the \u201c war on terror \u201d and of ORG documents that had come into the public domain , and including case details of secret transfers of detainees , the alleged existence of secret detention facilities and torture and other ill treatment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , AI published a CARDINAL long report on GPE abuses in the \u201c war on terror \u201d , which included cases of alleged torture or other illtreatment , deaths in custody , military commission proceedings , rendition flights , and the cases of \u201c high - value detainees \u201d allegedly held in ORG custody in secret locations in GPE and elsewhere and being subjected to enforced disappearance . The cases described included those of NORP national PERSON and NORP national PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In sum , as the ORG held in GPE v. GPE ( cited above ) , already by DATE it had been clear that GPE had known or should have known about the GPE \u2019s rendition and secret detention programme and about the grave human rights violations it entailed as well as allegations of torture and other ill - treatment by GPE personnel , the indefinite detention regime at ORG and the prospect of unfair trials by the military commission . As detailed above , the body of evidence regarding the GPE \u2019s rendition and secret detention programme had only grown DATE . The GPE \u2019s use of the death penalty remained well - known during this period and the GPE administration pursued the death penalty from DATE to DATE in the high - profile federal prosecution of PERSON for terrorism offences , as well as moving ahead with a military commission system with the power to hand down death sentences .", "CARDINAL . The parties expressed opposing views on the issues concerning the standard and burden of proof to be applied in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The Government once again reiterated that there was no conclusive evidence that the NORP authorities had in any way participated in the ORG rendition programme by hosting a secret prison for high - value detainees or by any other means .", "They agreed with the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the ORG had accepted that in its establishment of facts and assessment of evidence the co - existence of sufficiently strong , clear and coherent inferences might be considered a proof . Yet in the applicant \u2019s case no such inferences existed .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the applicant had adopted a strategy of persuading ORG that the NORP authorities , including the intelligence services and army , had shared the responsibility for gross violations of human rights during the so - called \u201c rendition programme \u201d based on the idea of , in his view , striking similarities between the present case and ORG ( cited above ) .", "However , in order for the ORG to shift the burden of proof , the applicant was required to establish a prima facie case in favour of his version of events . In the GPE case , that applicant \u2019s presence on NORP territory at the material time had not been disputed . His detention and interrogation in \u201c the former GPE \u201d , together with his surrender to the GPE authorities , had not been refuted either . In contrast , in the instant case no detention facility had been established with certainty , there was no certainty as to the flights on which the applicant had allegedly been transferred to and from GPE , and the exact period of the applicant \u2019s alleged detention in GPE had remained unclear .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , Mr ORG description of the circumstances of his detention and torture had been , as the ORG held , \u201c very detailed , specific and consistent \u201d . Conversely , in the present case the ORG was confronted with the applicant \u2019s incoherent allegations .", "As opposed to ORG , where a significant amount of evidence had corroborated the applicant \u2019s allegations and had given rise to concordant inferences , in the present case no evidence had been put forward , save for the reports which relied on one another . It was true that the ORG had held in the ORG judgment that it might examine a case by \u201c drawing inferences from the available material and the authorities\u2019 conduct \u201d and had concluded that the applicant had prevailed in his claims . Yet in the instant case there was no such material and the authorities\u2019 conduct had been , if not beyond any criticism , proactive and had demonstrated good faith . Without any intention to attack and discredit the reports of reputable officials or non - governmental organisations , the ORG insisted that the truth emerged at the end of a process of gathering evidence , failing which all the allegations remained simple claims .", "CARDINAL . The Government further said that they were fully aware of the ORG \u2019s standards of proof in cases involving injuries , death or disappearances that occurred in detention in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the respondent ORG , if there was prima facie evidence that the ORG might be involved . Nevertheless , they contended that a serious explanation , even if not a final one , had already been provided by the NORP authorities since a serious and independent investigation was still pending before the national authorities .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , the Government invited the ORG to hold that there was no prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant \u2019s version of events and that , therefore , the burden of proof could not be shifted .", "They added , however , that they could not give a final version of the facts since the domestic investigation had not yet been completed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that he had adduced strong , clear and concordant facts in support of his claims . In contrast , ORG had continued to cover up the truth . The Government had an unprecedented advantage over the applicant . They had all the relevant facts in their possession because they had entered into an agreement to host the secret ORG prison , because they had operationalised that agreement , and because they had covered it all up . In contrast , the applicant , still detained at the remote location of LOC , was gagged from speaking of his treatment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant reiterated that he had established more than a prima facie case that he had been detained and tortured in GPE under the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law , the burden of proof now shifted to GPE , particularly because GPE had \u201c exclusive access to information \u201d and witnesses who could corroborate or refute the applicant \u2019s case . However , the Government had failed to provide any such explanation ; instead , they engaged in a pattern and practice of obfuscation and denial with respect to the events complained of . They had done so in the context of unprecedented secrecy maintained by GPE and its partner governments with respect to secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations .", "CARDINAL . Where , as in the present case , the events at issue lay wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , the burden of proof could be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation . Where , as in this case , the authorities had failed to provide a convincing explanation and failed to conduct an effective investigation , despite being on notice , at least since DATE , of the fact that GPE had hosted a secret ORG prison , the ORG was entitled to draw inferences adverse to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant emphasised that the Court had consistently applied these principles in cases involving injuries , death or disappearances that occurred in detention , including cases where , as here , the Government denied that the individual had been in Government custody at the time of the events at issue . It had also applied these principles where persons had been found dead or injured , or had disappeared , in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there had been prima facie evidence that the State might be involved . As the Grand Chamber reiterated in GPE , prima facie evidence could itself be provided by proof in the form of concordant inferences , based on which the burden of proof was shifted to the respondent Government .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in GPE v. GPE ( cited above ) the ORG had established that it was appropriate to adopt a flexible approach towards the evaluation of evidence . ORG had observed that although it had adopted the \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d standard of proof , it also \u201c adopt[ed ] the conclusions that [ were ] , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as [ might ] flow from the facts and the parties submissions \u201d . Proof could thus \u201c follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact \u201d . In addition , in assessing the evidence , the ORG had also taken note of the unique set of constraints on the applicant which had precluded him from testifying about his detention before the ORG and of \u201c the very nature and extreme secrecy of the ORG operations in the course of the \u2018 war on GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that the same constraints applied in his case against GPE . Indeed , he had been virtually isolated in ORG and unable to talk publicly about his torture and ill - treatment or even submit a statement to ORG because the GPE authorities had taken the position that his thoughts and memories about his experiences under torture were classified information . Accordingly , they had prohibited him from sharing these experiences with anyone other than his GPE lawyers , who were prevented from revealing what they had been told by their client on pain of criminal sanction .", "Despite the extreme secrecy associated with ORG operations and his inability to address the ORG directly , the applicant considered that he had submitted ample evidence in support of his factual claims . Indeed , the documentary and expert evidence offered by him and heard by ORG in the present case was , in his view , akin to the evidence that had been given credence by ORG in GPE v. GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and has consistently recognised that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXIII ( extracts ) ; GPE and Others v. GPE , nos .

GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Nonetheless , in cases where there are conflicting accounts of events , the ORG \u2019s examination necessarily involves the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree . In such situations the ORG is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first - instance court ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In assessing evidence , the ORG has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard . Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the LAW . The specificity of its task under LAW to ensure the observance by GPE of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof . In the proceedings before the ORG , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre - determined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions .", "According to the ORG \u2019s established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof , are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see , among other examples , GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no .

While it is for the applicant to make a prima facie case and adduce appropriate evidence , if the respondent Government in their response to his allegations fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the ORG to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred , strong inferences can be drawn ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG .

Furthermore , the Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , where the events in issue lie wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , for instance as in the case of persons under their control in custody , strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention . The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no .

The ORG has already noted that it is not in a position to receive a direct account of the events complained of from the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; also , compare and contrast with other previous cases involving complaints about torture , ill - treatment in custody or unlawful detention , for example , ORG , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; ORG v.

NORP The regime applied to high - value detainees such as the applicant is described in detail in the ORG declassified documents , the DATE ORG and also , on the basis , inter alia , of the applicant \u2019s own account , in the DATE ORG . That regime included transfers of detainees to multiple locations and involved holding them incommunicado in continuous solitary confinement throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention . The transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention were specifically designed to deepen their sense of disorientation and isolation . The detainees were usually unaware of their exact location ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; PERSON ( PERSON ) v.

The above difficulties involved in gathering and producing evidence in the present case caused by the restrictions on the applicant \u2019s contact with the outside world and the extreme secrecy surrounding the GPE rendition operations have inevitably had an impact on his ability to plead his case before this ORG . Indeed , in his application and further written pleadings the events complained of were to a considerable extent reconstructed from threads of information gleaned from numerous public sources .", "Consequently , the ORG \u2019s establishment of the facts of the case is to a great extent based on circumstantial evidence , including a large amount of evidence obtained through the international inquiries , considerably redacted documents released by the ORG , the declassified DATE ORG , other public sources and the testimony of the experts heard by ORG ( see also PERSON v.

As a result , the ORG \u2019s establishment of the facts and assessment of evidence can not be limited to the events that according to the applicant allegedly took place in GPE but must , in so far as it is necessary and relevant for the findings in the present case , take into account the circumstances occurring before and after his alleged detention in GPE ( see GPE v.

According to PERSON findings , the opening of the ORG prison , codenamed \u201c Bright Light \u201d and the start of the ORG detention operations in GPE was marked by the plane NCARDINALP landing in GPE on TIME DATE . The physical location was identified as the ORG building in GPE . The dossier included , in chronological order , a list of CARDINAL disguised rendition flights into GPE in respect of which \u201c dummy \u201d flight plans featuring ORG had been filed , starting from the NCARDINALP flight on DATE and ending with the NCARDINALJB flight on CARDINAL DATE . No specific date of closure of the detention site was given ; paragraph CARDINAL of the dossier indicated that it had operated for \u201c a period of DATE \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . In response to the ORG \u2019s question regarding this point , PERSON explained that at that time their research had not managed to establish the precise dates for the closure of the NORP \u201c black site \u201d nor for the applicant \u2019s transfer from GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON , in his written response to the ORG \u2019s questions , gave an account of the sources and methodology on which he relied in his findings . The conclusions as to the operation of a secret ORG \u201d black site \u201d in GPE were based on \u201c a number of different sources which were crossreferenced and not on CARDINAL piece of evidence in isolation \u201d . This included among other things , official GPE documents , flight records and aeronautical data amassed from diverse entities across the global aviation sector ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "( b ) The DATE PERSON , which in addition to extensive flight data had been based on an analysis of a large amount of new material disclosed in the DATE ORG , stated that it had been established beyond reasonable doubt that a facility in GPE had been used by the ORG to hold prisoners , that the first prisoners had been transferred to this facility in DATE and that the last prisoners had been transferred out of this facility in DATE . The dossier included a list of QUANTITY rendition circuits through GPE , the first of which was executed by NCARDINALP on DATE , the last of which was executed on DATE and involved CARDINAL planes NCARDINALHC ( from GPE to GPE ) and LAW ( from GPE to GPE ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE Senator PERSON and Mr GPE , referring in their ORG presentation to the \u201c final rendition circuit \u201d through GPE executed by NCARDINALP , testified that this particular circuit had marked the closure of the ORG \u201d black site \u201d in GPE and the opening of the ORG \u2019s second secret detention site in LOC \u2013 located in GPE ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the fact - finding hearing held in the present case the experts heard by the ORG confirmed in clear and categorical terms that a secret detention facility had operated in GPE in the period indicated by the applicant . They stated that the NCARDINALP flight on DATE had marked the opening of the site and that a \u201c double - plane switch \u201d circuit involving CARDINAL planes , identified as NCARDINALHC and ORG had indicated its closure , prompted by the publication of ORG article referred to above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the same categorical terms they identified the ORG detention facility located in GPE as the one referred to in the DATE ORG as \u201c ORG \u201d ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "( a ) Senator PERSON and Mr PERSON in their ORG presentation , in support of the above conclusions , referred to the extensive flight data and their correlation , as well as to the DATE ORG . In particular , Mr GPE in connection with several specific references in that report stated that the code name \u201c FAC \u201d in the report corresponded in such \u201c precise and extensive detail \u201d to other multiple data concerning GPE that \u201c GPE , its territory , its airspace , its detention facility , [ was ] inseparable from ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL above )", "( b ) Mr Black stated that it was \u201c clear , beyond reasonable doubt that there was a ORG detention facility in GPE \u201d and that he was convinced on \u201c a wide array of different types of evidence \u201d that it operated from DATE until DATE . He testified that there was no doubt that the flight in DATE which had been a CARDINAL - plane switch taking prisoners to GPE \u2013 had signalled the end of the NORP site and that that flight had come within TIME after the existence of the site had been revealed in ORG article . He added that the DATE ORG was very clear that at that point everyone who had been remaining in GPE had been \u201c shipped out to GPE \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "In his testimony , he also mentioned specific HVDs , including the applicant , who had been detained in GPE DATE , saying that \u201c the fact that those individuals [ had been ] held in GPE at various points DATE [ was ] absolutely beyond reasonable doubt , there [ could not ] be any alternative narrative to that that [ made ] any sense \u201d . He further stated that \u201c ORG [ was ] the site that fulfil[ed ] , in terms of its operating times , the flight paths that we [ knew ] to have been connected to prisoner movements and to the ORG rendition programme . ORG [ was ] the one which correlate[d ] precisely with those flight paths that our research [ had ] discovered , [ had ] reconstructed \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE ORG includes several references to ORG . To begin with , the report confirms that ORG detainees were transferred to ORG in a country whose name was redacted \u201c in DATE \u201d . It further confirms that the site still operated in \u201c DATE \u201d , as well as in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) and that Mr PERSON was held there in DATE and DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "Finally , it indicates that ORG was closed \u201c after publication of the ORG article \u201d , following the pressure from the country concerned , which demanded the closure within TIME which , although redacted in the text , clearly comprised DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that this indication in theory could mean any time DATE . However , in reality , given that the ORG had to secure a safe , secret transfer of possibly several detainees by air to another consenting country , such demand could not be dealt with abruptly and immediately and , by the nature of things , inevitably required some preparation and handling of logistical problems . According to the DATE ORG , the \u201c ORG transferred ... the remaining ORG detainees out of the facility shortly thereafter \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having regard to the fact that ORG article was published on DATE , the dates on which the transfer could realistically have been carried out DATE that is to say , within the range of TIME \u2013 had to be situated in the short period from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . This coincides exactly with the flight identified by the experts as the CARDINAL marking the closure of \u201c FAC \u201d in GPE , namely NCARDINALHC from GPE to GPE , executed on CARDINAL DATE ( see also paragraph LAW above ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , all the materials in the ORG \u2019s possession , including the list of CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d produced by the Government unambiguously demonstrate that a series of ORG - associated aircraft landings at FAC started on DATE with NCARDINALP and ended on CARDINAL DATE with NCARDINALHC . Markedly , these QUANTITY particular flight circuits were disguised by the so - called \u201c dummy flight ORG a practice that , as described by the experts and analysed by ORG in its previous judgments concerning the ORG rendition operations in GPE , consisted in filling false flight plans that indicated a route which the planes did not , or even intend to , fly . Both aircraft \u2019s flight plans indicated GPE as their destination but in fact they landed at and took off from FAC ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , with references to GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , and CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ; see also PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that on DATE the flight plan for NCARDINALP , initially indicating GPE as its destination , had been changed to FAC when the plane had been en route ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , they did not see how the change of flight plans executed by the flight operator \u2013 a change on which the NORP authorities had no influence \u2013 could be indicative of their complicity in the ORG rendition operations or , still less , of the existence of a ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Addressing the Government \u2019s arguments , the ORG finds it appropriate to reiterate certain findings concerning the operation of the ORG - associated flights in GPE emerging from the material in the case file .", "( a ) As already noted above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG referred to CARDINAL stopovers made by the ORG - operated aircraft at NORP airports during the relevant period . Significantly , most stopovers ( CARDINAL ) and take - offs ( CARDINAL ) found suspicious took place at GPE airports . Several of those flights are included in the ORG \u2019s list of CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . ORG also identified CARDINAL different ORG aircraft that landed in GPE at the material time and referred to CARDINAL inconsistent flight plans , concerning , among others , the NCARDINALHC flight on DATE . All these plans indicated destinations filed for GPE or GPE ; however , the aircraft real destination was FAC , at which those flights in fact landed and from which they took off subsequently ( see paragraphs QUANTITY and CARDINAL above ) .", "( b ) PERSON dossier for ORG contained a \u2013 non - exhaustive \u2013 list of the most significant CARDINAL flights into GPE , starting from NCARDINALP on DATE . Destinations for all of them were disguised by the \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning . All bore the characteristics of \u201c detainee drop - offs \u201d , i.e. transportation of ORG prisoners into the country . All those planes are on the list of CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d furnished by the Government ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "( c ) The DATE PERSON identified CARDINAL rendition missions linking GPE to other ORG prison host countries or to known or suspected prisoner transfers . According to that report , the first such mission was executed by NCARDINALP on DATE , the last by NCARDINALHC on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "The list of CARDINAL rendition missions in the DATE PERSON overlaps with the ORG \u2019s list of CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "( d ) In all the inquiries conducted by the international governmental and non - governmental organisations , which were extensively referred to above , most planes included in the ORG \u2019s list have been conclusively and definitely identified as carrying out the ORG rendition missions ( see CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; CARDINAL ; CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "( e ) It emerges from the comparison of the list of CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d with the above reports identifying the aircraft associated with the ORG \u2019s transportation of prisoners that DATE and DATE there was a continued , steady and concentrated flow of those planes through FAC . According to the material produced by the ORG themselves , during that period CARDINAL ORG flights arrived at FAC and CARDINAL were recorded by the NORP authorities as landing at FAC . The ORG flights into GPE arrived at fairly regular intervals of CARDINAL see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Considering the material referred to above as a whole , the ORG is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant \u2019s allegation that the ORG secret detention site operated in GPE DATE and DATE . Accordingly , the burden of proof should shift to the respondent Government ( see ORG , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the Government have failed to demonstrate why the evidence referred to above can not serve to corroborate the applicant \u2019s allegations . Apart from their firm , albeit general , denial that the facts as presented by the applicant and disclosed in the international inquiries \u2013 to begin with ORG and PERSON investigative work DATE never took place or were grossly distorted to GPE \u2019s disadvantage , they have not offered any cogent reasons for the series of landings of ORG - associated aircraft at GPE DATE and DATE ( see also GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Likewise , the Government have not produced any evidence capable of contradicting the findings of the international inquiries and the experts heard by the ORG , categorically stating that the aircraft in question were used by the ORG for transportation of prisoners into GPE . Nor have they refuted expert evidence to the effect that the ORG prison referred to in the DATE ORG as \u201c ORG \u201d was located in GPE ( see also and compare with GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In that context , the ORG can not but note that all the international inquiries and other reports challenged by the Government were based on extensive , meticulous work which was done by the experts and politicians of the highest integrity and competence and whose only aim and mission was to reveal the facts and establish the truth about what had occurred in LOC during the ORG rendition operations . Their work was often impeded by the extreme secrecy surrounding the ORG operations , the uncooperative attitude of the national authorities and the lack of access to the necessary information \u2013 information which was revealed only gradually , over DATE and which still remains incomplete due to the classification of essential documents , in particular the full version of the DATE ORG . It is worth noting that the inquiries conducted in DATE did not have the benefit of access to the ORG declassified documents , which were released in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and which provided an important insight into the fate of specific HVDs , including Mr PERSON , with such details as dates of detainees\u2019 transfers between the ORG \u201c black sites \u201d and interrogation schedules .", "As regards the Government \u2019s challenge to the impartiality and credibility of Reprieve , based on its involvement in ongoing investigations into ORG rendition and secret detention and case work regarding ORG prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG finds no ground whatsoever to consider that Reprieve and its experts , who have DATE as for instance Mr Black \u2013 also been involved in ORG inquiry , lack objectivity in representing the facts concerning the operation of the ORG in LOC and the plight of detainees , including the applicant .", "In so far as the Government can be seen as impliedly contesting the credibility of evidence from other experts heard at the fact - finding hearing ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , the ORG would wish to underline that PERSON , Senator PERSON and Mr GPE already gave evidence in LOC GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE . ORG , in its examination of those cases , relied heavily on their testimonies considering them to be one of the most important parts of the evidence and finding them fully reliable and credible ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL- CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , in ORG considered the expert report from Mr GPE to be \u201c compelling evidence \u201d which was duly taken into account in its establishment of the facts in the case ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "Consequently , in the ORG \u2019s eyes , there is nothing in the ORG \u2019s submission that would be capable of shedding the doubt on the integrity and dependability of the experts whose testimony was taken in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also argued that the fact that the sources relied on by the applicant , including the DATE ORG and PERSON dossier , had given different indications as to the exact location of the alleged \u201c black site \u201d in GPE deprived his allegations of credibility . Referring in particular to the ORG building , they relied on witness R \u2019s statements obtained in the investigation denying that this location had , or could ever have been , used for the ORG prison ( see CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "The ORG does not find these arguments convincing .", "It is true that the applicant , relying on the press disclosures , indicated the ORG building as a probable ORG prison . However , considering the secrecy of the ORG operations it can not be realistically expected that this kind of indication will be absolutely certain , unless the governments concerned decide to disclose such locations and formally \u201c officialise \u201d the information circulating in the public domain . In that regard , the ORG would note in passing that the likelihood of the ORG building having hosted the ORG facility has also been considered in the inquiry conducted by ORG ; however , the NORP authorities did not enable the ORG delegation to visit the site during their fact - finding mission in DATE ( see paragraphs FAC - CARDINAL above ) .", "The ORG will not speculate on that likelihood . Nor is it necessary for the purposes of its ruling to establish where the ORG facility was exactly located . Given the coherent and unrefuted evidence corroborating the applicant \u2019s allegations as to the existence of the ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE , the fact that he did not state its precise location does not undermine the credibility of his allegations .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , the ORG \u2019s objection to the credibility of the evidence and sources relied on by the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) can not be upheld .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG considers the applicant \u2019s allegations sufficiently convincing and , having regard to the above evidence from numerous sources corroborating his version , finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that :", "( a ) a ORG detention facility , codenamed ORG in the DATE ORG , was located in GPE ;", "( b ) the facility operated from DATE and its opening was marked by flight NCARDINALP which took off from GPE , GPE on DATE and , having disguised its destination by indicating FAC in GPE , landed at FAC on DATE ; and", "( c ) the facility was closed on the NORP authorities\u2019 demand and its closure was marked by flight NCARDINALHC which took off from GPE , GPE on DATE and , having disguised its destination by indicating FAC in GPE , landed at FAC and on DATE took off for GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . It is alleged that the applicant was transferred to GPE from ORG on board NCARDINALVM on DATE and that he was detained at ORG in GPE , also codenamed \u201c Bright Light \u201d or \u201c FAC until DATE or , at the latest , until DATE ( see paragraphs QUANTITY and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The ORG firmly contested this ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG is mindful that , as regards the applicant \u2019s actual presence in GPE , there is no direct evidence that it was the applicant who was transported on board the NCARDINALVM flight from ORG to GPE or that he was subsequently transferred from GPE to another ORG secret detention facility on DATE or DATE , the CARDINAL possible dates indicated by the experts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "The applicant , who for DATE on end was held in detention conditions specifically designed to isolate and disorientate a person by transfers to unknown locations , even if he had been allowed to testify before the ORG , would not be able to say where he was detained . Nor can it be reasonably expected that he will ever , on his own , be able to identify the places in which he was held .", "No trace of the applicant can , or will , be found in any official flight or border police records in GPE or in other countries because his presence on the planes and on their territories was , by the very nature of the rendition operations , purposefully not to be recorded . As confirmed by expert GPE in GPE v. GPE , in the countries concerned the official records showing numbers of passengers and crew arriving and departing on the rendition planes neither included , nor purported to include detainees who were brought into or out of the territory involuntarily , by means of clandestine HVD renditions . Those detainees were never appeared in a record of persons on board filed with any official institution ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , in order to ascertain whether or not it can be concluded that the applicant was detained at ORG in GPE at the relevant time , the ORG will take into account all the facts that have already been found established beyond reasonable doubt ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and analyse all other material in its possession , including , in particular , the DATE ORG and expert evidence reconstructing the chronology of the applicant \u2019s rendition and detention in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the following facts either are not disputed or have also been confirmed by flight data from numerous sources , including the documents produced by the respondent Government :", "( a ) On DATE plane NCARDINALVM , having indicated in its flight plans FAC in GPE as its destination , in fact landed in FAC in GPE and took off from there on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "( b ) that on DATE plane PERSON , having indicated in its flight plans FAC in GPE as its destination , in fact landed at FAC in GPE and took off from GPE for GPE on DATE ;", "( c ) that on DATE plane PERSON landed in GPE at CARDINAL:CARDINAL and stayed there until TIME , at which time it departed for FAC ;", "( d ) that on DATE both PERSON and PERSON were in the same airport in GPE between PERSON ( PERSON \u2019s landing ) and CARDINAL ( NCARDINALWH \u2019s departure ) ;", "( e ) that on DATE PERSON , having indicated in its flight plans GPE , GPE as its destination , in fact landed at FAC in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the rendition circuit of CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE , ORG would reiterate that it has already been established that :", "- on DATE NCARDINALHC , having disguised its destination as GPE , in fact landed at FAC and took off from there for GPE , arriving there in TIME on DATE ;", "- NCARDINALAB arrived in GPE DATE , and on TIME , left for GPE ; and", "- on TIME both NCARDINALHC and FAC were in the same airport in GPE between CARDINAL:CARDINAL and CARDINAL:CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has also established that after his transfers from GPE to GPE and from GPE to ORG the applicant was detained in ORG until an unspecified CARDINAL - digit date in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As noted above , the DATE ORG states that by that date , \u201c all CARDINAL ORG detainees were transferred from ORG to other ORG detention facilities \u201d ( see CARDINAL and QUANTITY above , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , in his testimony , explained that the use of the word \u201c facilities \u201d in the plural in the DATE ORG was significant in the context of the applicant \u2019s detention given that , as the very same report established , following his transfer from GPE , he had been held at CARDINAL different ORG \u201c black sites \u201d ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Mr PERSON could not , therefore , have been transferred from ORG back to GPE . Mr GPE further explained that at the relevant time there had been CARDINAL distinct detainee transfers from ORG ; the first which had taken some detainees to Rabat on CARDINAL March CARDINAL and the second which had taken the remaining ones on plane NCARDINALVM to GPE , via a stopover in GPE , on DATE . This , he said , was the sole outward flight linking ORG with GPE . Also , it emerged from the DATE ORG and cables regarding the applicant \u2019s treatment that he found himself at ORG in DATE and in DATE . Mr ORG concluded that , in order for the applicant to be at ORG or \u201c GPE \u201d by that time , he had to have been brought to GPE on flight NCARDINALVM on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Moreover , in respect of that flight the ORG had recourse to its systematic practice of disguised flight planning which , as the expert stated , \u201c in fact became a tell - tale sign of rendition or detainee transfer activity on such flights \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Black stated that he was aware of CARDINAL possible flights that could have taken the applicant into GPE and NCARDINALVM was CARDINAL of them . He indicated that there had been a potential other flight that had occurred in DATE . While it was known for a fact that the applicant had been in GPE after DATE and in DATE , there were also indications that he had been held in GPE before , in DATE . That led Mr Black to prefer , of these CARDINAL possibilities , the DATE flight as being the more likely of the CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that the flight plan for NCARDINALVM , initially indicating ORG as its destination , had been changed to GPE , FAC when the plane had been en route but did not consider that this element could confirm the applicant \u2019s secret detention in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They produced documents issued by the RAS at FAC in connection with the NCARDINALVM landing on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As in respect of other allegedly \u201c suspicious \u201d flights , the Government asserted that the flight had been of a \u201c private and non - commercial nature \u201d and had not been executed in connection with the HVD Programme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . However , this assertion does not seem to be supported by the materials gathered in the present case . To the contrary , the ORG finds that in addition to the expert evidence referred to above , there is other abundant evidence to the effect that on DATE plane NCARDINALVM executed a rendition mission to GPE with the purpose of \u201c dropping off \u201d detainees from ORG .", "In that regard , the ORG observes that since DATE the findings of the international inquiries have clearly associated NCARDINALVM with the ORG rendition operations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL- CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . As already noted above , NCARDINALVM was conclusively identified as the plane used earlier for the rendition of PERSON otherwise known as PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The former ORG Commissioner for Human Rights dossier for ORG included that flight among disguised rendition flights into GPE , bearing the character of detainee \u201c drop - off \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The same dossier listed the applicant among HVDs who had been brought to a ORG \u201c black site \u201d in GPE and indicated DATE as the date of his transfer to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The DATE PERSON indicated flight NCARDINALVM on DATE among the missions carried out under rendition contracts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "That flight is also listed among CARDINAL \u201c suspicious flights \u201d in the document produced by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s rendition by the ORG from GPE , the experts gave DATE and CARDINAL DATE as CARDINAL possible dates of the applicant \u2019s transfer ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Mr PERSON described in detail the ORG \u201c plane - switch \u201d operation that , according to him , had taken place in the course of the flight circuit on CARDINAL DATE and involved CARDINAL aircraft : PERSON and PERSON . On this premise , on DATE the applicant was taken on board PERSON from ORG to GPE and , subsequently , on board PERSON to GPE to a ORG \u201d black site \u201d in GPE , referred to as \u201c Detention Site Violet \u201d in the DATE ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "PERSON considered both dates as probable , with the DATE transfer of the applicant being more likely ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to all the various documentary and oral evidence referred to above , the ORG is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant \u2019s version of the events and that the burden of proof should shift to the Government .", "CARDINAL . Yet again in the ORG \u2019s view the Government have failed to give any convincing grounds to explain why the evidence considered above can not support the applicant \u2019s allegations . They asserted that the applicant \u2019s version of events should be rejected as it was incoherent and that in his account of the facts there had been inconsistencies regarding the dates , circumstances and the exact period of his alleged detention in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "The ORG does not share the ORG \u2019s assessment .", "While it is true that , with the passage of time , the applicant adduced newly disclosed facts relevant for his complaints or corrected the dates initially given for his detention ( see paragraphs QUANTITY above ) , this does not by itself render his version of events inconsistent or incredible . In that context the ORG would again refer to the fact that since his capture in DATE the applicant has been continually prevented from giving any direct account of his fate even to the counsel representing him before the Court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , having regard to the above evidence demonstrating clearly , consistently and conclusively the chronology of the events preceding the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE , his transfer to GPE on DATE and his presence at FAC located in GPE in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) , as well as expert evidence confirming that there were DATE and only CARDINAL \u2013 possible dates on which he could be taken by the ORG out of GPE , the ORG does not find it indispensable to determine on which specific date the transfer occurred . It is certain and beyond any reasonable doubt that the applicant , once detained at ORG and , as confirmed by the DATE ORG and the experts , still present there DATE , must have been transferred out of it at some later point before or when the site was definitely closed on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The experts\u2019 conclusions are founded on in - depth analysis of extensive international aviation data , contractual documents pertaining to rendition missions executed by the air companies used by the ORG and large amount of data released by the GPE authorities , including the ORG . On this basis , they gave a time - frame which is sufficiently accurate for the ORG to conclude that the applicant must have been taken out of GPE either on DATE or on DATE to CARDINAL of the \u2013 at the time DATE remaining ORG detention facilities , referred to in the DATE ORG as ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that :", "( a ) On DATE the applicant was transferred by the ORG from ORG to GPE on board NCARDINALVM .", "( b ) From DATE to DATE or , at the latest , CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was detained in the ORG detention facility in GPE code - named \u201c ORG \u201d according to the DATE ORG .", "( c ) On DATE on board PERSON or , at the latest , on DATE , on board NCARDINALHC via a double - plane switch the applicant was transferred by the ORG out of GPE to one of the CARDINAL remaining ORG detention facilities , code - named ORG and ORG according to the DATE ORG .", "CARDINAL . It is alleged that during his secret detention in GPE the applicant was subjected to torture and other forms of treatment prohibited by LAW . The Government have not addressed this issue .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that , in contrast to PERSON v. GPE where the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by the ORG during his detention in GPE could be established with certainty owing to the ORG \u2019s declassified materials depicting in graphic detail the torture inflicted on him in the course of the interrogations ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , in the present case there is no evidence demonstrating that at ORG in GPE he was subjected to EITs in connection with interrogations ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards recourse to harsh interrogation techniques at the relevant time , the DATE ORG mentions in general terms that in DATE the ORG temporarily suspended the use of the EITs . While their use was at some point resumed and they were apparently applied throughout the most part of DATE , such techniques were again temporarily suspended in DATE and in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In respect of the applicant , the report states that in the \u201c final years \u201d of his detention \u201c most of the intelligence requirements for LOC involved showing [ him ] photographs \u201d . Those \u201c debriefings \u201d were suspended in DATE apparently because of the low value of intelligence obtained from him and \u201c because debriefings often were the \u2018 ORG for his outbursts \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Other heavily redacted passages in the report speak of \u201c feeding him rectally \u201d , which resulted from his \u201c short - lived hunger strike \u201d at some unspecified time in DATE . It is also mentioned that in DATE he underwent a psychological assessment in the context of \u201c management challenges \u201d posed to the ORG by psychological problems experienced by the detainees \u201c who had been held in austere conditions and in solitary confinement \u201d . The applicant \u2019s assessment was used by the ORG in discussions on \u201c establishing an endgame \u201d for the HVD Programme ( see CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In DATE the ORG expressed concern regarding the applicant \u2019s \u201c continued state of depression and uncooperative attitude \u201d . DATE a psychologist established that the applicant was \u201c on the verge of a breakdown \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the experts , even though the applicant was in all likelihood no longer interrogated with the use of the EITs , he did , as Mr GPE stated \u201c purely by virtue of the conditions in which he [ had been ] held \u201d suffer ill - treatment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON added that it was clear that the applicant , in particular when he had been in GPE , was experiencing serious psychological problems as a result of the treatment he had received ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the ORG \u2019s establishment of the facts of the case , the detailed rules governing the conditions in which the ORG kept its prisoners leave no room for speculation as to the basic aspects of the situation in which the applicant found himself from DATE to DATE or CARDINAL DATE . ORG therefore finds it established beyond any reasonable doubt that the applicant was kept \u2013 as any other high - value detainee \u2013 in conditions described in ORG , which applied from DATE to all ORG detainees ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ; see also GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "While at this stage it is premature to characterise the treatment to which the applicant was subjected during his detention at ORG for the purposes of his complaint under the substantive limb of LAW , the ORG observes that the regime included at least \u201c CARDINAL standard conditions of confinement \u201d . That meant blindfolding or hooding the detainees , designed to disorient them and keep from learning their location or the layout of the detention facility ; removal of hair upon arrival at the site ; incommunicado , solitary confinement ; continuous noise of high and varying intensity played at all times ; continuous light such that each cell was illuminated to about the same brightness as an office ; and use of leg shackles in all aspects of detainee management and movement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG , in the chapter giving details as to the establishment of ORG , states that in DATE ( redacted the text ) in DATE the ORG \u201c entered into an agreement \u201d with the country concerned \u201c to host a ORG detention facility \u201d .", "While the terms of that agreement have not been disclosed , it appears from subsequent passages that , in order to demonstrate to the country \u2019s authority ( or person ) whose name was redacted and to \u201c the highest levels of the Country ... government \u201d that the GPE authorities \u201c deeply appreciate[d ] their cooperation and support for the detention program \u201d , the ORG station in the country was invited by their ORG \u201c to identify ways to support the \u201d \u2013 again redacted DATE country \u2019s bodies ( presumably , or activities ) by financial means , defined as a \u201c subsidy \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The requested subsidy which was received in appreciation of \u201c cooperation and support \u201d amounted to a sum ( redacted in the text ) that was a multiple of CARDINAL ; in fact , the amount which was initially put on DATE in the report \u2019s words \u2013 \u201c wish list \u201d presented on behalf of the country by the ORG station was later increased by a further ( redacted ) multiple of CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The fact that such financial rewards were , as a matter of the general policy and practice , offered to the authorities of countries hosting ORG \u201c black sites \u201d is also confirmed in LAW DATE ORG . The conclusion states that \u201c to encourage governments to clandestinely host ORG detention sites , or to increase support for existing sites , the ORG provided MONEY in cash payments to foreign government officials \u201d and that \u201c the ORG encouraged ORG to construct \u201c wish lists \u201d of proposed financial assistance \u201d and \u201c to \u2018 think big\u2019 in terms of that assistance \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In that context , the ORG would also wish to refer to its findings regarding the national authorities\u2019 knowledge of the ORG HVD Programme in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE and the issue of the alleged existence of a bilateral agreement between GPE and the GPE on the setting up and running of a secret ORG prison . In that case , the ORG did not find it necessary for its examination of the case to establish whether such agreement or agreements existed and if so , in what format or what was specifically provided therein . It did , however , consider it inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed NORP airspace , landed at and departed from a NORP airport and that the ORG could have occupied the LOC in GPE without some kind of pre - existing arrangement enabling the ORG operation in GPE to be first prepared and then executed ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The same conclusion is valid in respect of GPE ; moreover , in the present case it has been reinforced by evidence from the DATE ORG , unambiguously demonstrating the existence of a bilateral agreement between GPE and the GPE on hosting ORG on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would also add that the above - cited sections of the DATE ORG further support the conclusions of the DATE ORG , stating that \u201c the key arrangements for ORG clandestine operations in LOC were secured on a bilateral level \u201d , that \u201c the ORG brokered \u2018 operating ORG with ORG and GPE to hold its high - value detainees ... in secret detention facilities on their respective territories \u201d and that \u201c GPE and GPE agreed to provide the LOC in which these facilities were established , the highest degrees of physical security and secrecy , and steadfast guarantees of non - interference \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; see also GPE v.

In that regard , the ORG notes that the DATE ORG listed by name several individual high - office holders who \u201c knew about , authorised and stand accountable for GPE \u2019s role in the ORG \u2019s operation of \u2018 outoftheatre\u2019 secret detention facilities on NORP territory , from DATE to DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL of those identified in the report , namely former President of GPE , PERSON and his former ORG , PERSON Talpe\u015f DATE made public statements relating to the ORG rendition operation in their interviews given to ORG in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in the first ORG publication , Mr PERSON was reported as saying that \u201c there were CARDINAL or CARDINAL locations in GPE at which the ORG probably held persons who were subjected to inhuman treatment \u201d .

He had arranged for a building in GPE to be given to the ORG . The building was used by the ORG from DATE and no longer existed ; PERSON would not reveal its location ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In that context , it is also to be noted that the DATE EP Resolution states that PERSON admitted on record to the ORG delegation that he had been fully aware of the ORG \u2019s presence on NORP territory , acknowledging that he had given permission to \u2018 ORG a government building to the ORG \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Referring to Mr PERSON \u2019s and Mr Talpe\u015f\u2019 interviews in ORG , the Government argued that subsequently their initially ambiguous statements had been clarified to the effect that there had been no cooperation and no complicity in the ORG rendition and secret detention operations on the part of GPE . In that regard , the ORG also relied on evidence from witnesses obtained in the criminal investigation conducted in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not share this assessment .", "It is true that certain NORP officials , for instance Y and Z , who testified in the investigation in DATE , denied receiving any such request or having any knowledge of the existence of the ORG prisons in the country ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "Yet in that regard the ORG can not but note that witness Z in his testimony given on DATE nevertheless confirmed that \u201c ORG officials [ had ] asked the NORP authorities to offer some locations on NORP territory to be used for actions of combating the international terrorist threats by the representatives of the ORG , on the same pattern as that used in the other ORG Member GPE \u201d and that \u201c finally CARDINAL single location [ had been ] offered \u201d .

The accounts given by PERSON and Mr ORG in their interviews and Mr Talpe\u015f\u2019 admission to ORG delegation match the disclosures in the DATE ORG , in particular regarding the date of the agreement to host a ORG secret detention site ( DATE ) , the fact that the NORP authorities were asked for LOC for the ORG , the time at which the LOC were provided ( DATE ) and the fact that they were informed of the purpose for which the LOC that GPE offered were to be used ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . They also correspond to ORG above findings as to the dates marking the opening of ORG in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The statements obtained in the investigation relied on by the Government are in a marked contrast to the disclosures made by the GPE authorities , GPE \u2019s partner under the agreement . ORG does not see how the findings of ORG , based on a DATE investigation and in - depth analysis of first - hand evidence , which in most part came from classified \u201c top secret \u201d sources , including CARDINAL pages of ORG documents ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) could be undermined by the material referred to by the Government .", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG , in the chapter concerning the establishment of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) also refers to several interventions vis - \u00e0 - vis the ORG made by the GPE ambassador in the country in the context of the operation of the ORG in that country and public disclosures of ill - treatment of detainees in GPE custody . First , in DATE , he expressed concern as to whether ORG was aware of the ORG detention facility in the country and its \u201c potential impact \u201d on GPE policy in respect of the ORG concerned . The second and third interventions , prompted by \u201c revelations about GPE detainee abuses \u201d were made in DATE and in the \u201c fall of DATE \u201d .", "The report further states that \u201c while it is unclear how the ambassador \u2019s concerns were resolved , he later joined the chief of Station in making a presentation \u201d to the country \u2019s authorities ( or representatives ) whose names were redacted in the text . The presentation did not describe the EITs but \u201c represented that without the full range of these interrogation measures \u201d the GPE \u201c would not have succeeded in overcoming [ the ] resistance \u201c of PERSON and \u201c other equally resistant HVDs \u201d . The presentation also included representations \u201c attributing to ORG detainees critical information \u201d on several terror plots , including the \u201c GPE Plot \u201d , the \u201c FAC Plot \u201d and the \u201c Second Wave Plot \u201d . Also , in the context of intelligence obtained , several well - known HVDs in GPE custody were mentioned by name ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The above information originated in an evidential source to which the ORG attributes utmost credibility ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It gives a description of a concrete event \u2013 an oral presentation \u2013 that occurred at some time following \u201c the fall of DATE \u201d and during which , in the context of the operation of ORG in the country , the NORP authorities were presented with an outline of the ORG by the GPE officials . Even though the format of the meeting and names or functions of participants representing the host country have not been revealed , the disclosure clearly shows that the presentation included a fairly extensive account of the ORG . To begin with , the GPE officials clearly spoke of intelligence that had been obtained from high - value detainees through \u201c overcoming resistance \u201d by means of a \u201c full range of interrogation measures \u201d . They also suggested that specific terrorist suspects in ORG custody had provided \u201c critical intelligence \u201d on prominent terror plots . ORG prisoners whose resistance was \u201c overcome \u201d as a result of interrogations were spoken of , to mention only PERSON , the top HVD in ORG custody , suspected of masterminding DATE terrorist attacks in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE the fact that the national authorities cooperated with the ORG in disguising the rendition aircraft \u2019s actual routes and validated incomplete or false flight plans in order to cover up the ORG activities in the country was considered relevant for the ORG \u2019s assessment of the LOC knowledge of , and complicity in , the HVD Programme ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The ORG will follow that approach in analysing the facts of the present case .", "CARDINAL . It is to be reiterated that the ORG acknowledged that in respect of CARDINAL flights , namely NCARDINALP on DATE and ORG on DATE the flight plans had been changed when the planes had been in the air . They denied that any role in the process had been played by the NORP authorities , except for a passive , \u201c automatic \u201d acceptance of the change for which the plane operator had been solely responsible and assistance in transmitting the flight plans to the entity managing the integrated initial flight plan processing system ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as already noted above , the clear inconsistencies in the flight data pertaining to destinations where the ORG - associated aircraft were supposed to arrive and from where they actually took off presented by the NORP authorities were already identified in the DATE ORG and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Also , PERSON PERSON \u2019s dossier addressed to ORG listed CARDINAL rendition flight circuits occurring DATE and DATE in respect of which false flight plans had been filed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The practice of so - called \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning , i.e. a process of intentional disguise of flight plans for rendition aircraft used by the air companies contracted by the ORG , for instance ORG or ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , was explained by Senator PERSON and Mr GPE in their testimony during the ORG presentation on the basis of CARDINAL examples of the ORG rendition circuits through GPE executed by plane NCARDINALP on DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The experts described the \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning as \u201c a systematic practice deployed by the ORG and its aviation services providers to disguise ORG flights into and out of its most sensitive operational locations \u201d . They added that the ORG could not execute this tactic alone since it \u201c depended upon , however discrete , a role played by the national counterpart authority \u201d . The NORP documentary records demonstrated the landing of NCARDINALP on DATE at FAC despite the absence of a valid flight plan . According to the experts , \u201c this was part of a systematic practice and through our investigations we [ had ] generated numerous , up to CARDINAL instances on which ORG rendition aircraft [ had ] transferred detainees into , and out of , GPE , GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In this connection , the ORG would also reiterate its above findings that the flights NCARDINALP and NCARDINALHC marking the opening and the closure of the ORG detention facility in GPE , flight NCARDINALVM , identified as the CARDINAL that brought the applicant into GPE and flight PERSON , identified as CARDINAL of the CARDINAL possible flights on which the applicant was taken out of GPE were concealed by the \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above )", "CARDINAL . As the ORG found in LOC GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , the \u201c dummy \u201d flight planning , a deliberate effort to cover up the ORG flights , required active cooperation on the part of the host countries through which the planes travelled . In addition to granting the ORG rendition aircraft overflight permissions , the national authorities navigated the planes through the country \u2019s airspace to undeclared destinations in contravention of international aviation regulations and issued false landing permits ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the fact that the NORP aviation authorities navigated the ORG flights into GPE , despite the fact that the relevant flight plans named GPE or PERSON as the airports of destination and accepted flight plans naming those destinations but navigated the planes to GPE demonstrated that they knowingly assisted in the process of disguise of the ORG planes ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government asserted that , in contrast to the circumstances in GPE v. GPE , in GPE there had been no special procedure for receiving the impugned flights ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "In that regard they relied on evidence from witnesses heard in the investigation , who had not related any special treatment of the GPE flights that would deviate from routine procedures for any ordinary flight ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that , indeed , several witnesses said that they had not heard about or seen any \u201c clandestine passengers \u201d , \u201c detainees \u201d or \u201c any passenger especially of NORP origin \u201d ( see paragraphs MONEY and CARDINAL above ) or that they had not noted \u201c anything out of the ordinary when the \u2018 private ORG [ had ] landed \u201d or that there had been \u201c no special services provided \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the statements of several other witnesses who referred to the \u201c special \u201d or \u201c N \u201d status flights with the GPE registrations contradict the ORG \u2019s assertion .", "Witness E knew CARDINAL such flights that landed at TIME time and parked on the airport platform for TIME . He said that that the only person approaching them had been witness X.", "Witness G knew of the \u201c N \u201d flights having been announced as special flights for which the staff had not been requested . Witness O spoke of CARDINAL plane that had been treated differently and the staff had been asked to stay in the office and not go to the plane . Witness P knew that special flights had been \u201c carried out at night \u201d ; also , on TIME he had seen a plane without a call sign and a man in dark overalls and military boots walking a dog near the plane ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Witness X , apparently the only person who had been seen approaching the \u201c special planes \u201d did not explain in concrete terms what had in reality been going on but said that his presence in the airport had been connected with \u201c bilateral relations \u201d with the GPE \u201d equivalent structures \u201d and \u201c aimed at ensuring protocol relations during processing as well as bilateral courtesy - setting according to diplomatic norms and international rules \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Witness Z , in his statement of CARDINAL DATE given to the prosecutor was more explicit . He confirmed that in the context of GPE \u2019s forthcoming accession to ORG \u201c some developments or agreements [ had taken ] place in relation to the NORP flights to be operated by the ORG \u201d and that , \u201c from DATE several contacts had taken place in that direction and they resulted in concrete agreements that made possible the operation of the special NORP flights on NORP territory , in different conditions than those provided for by international customs \u201d . He added that \u201c those flights [ had ] had a special character and they [ had ] not [ been ] under an obligation to obey usual rules imposed on civil flights \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in the ORG \u2019s view , the way in which the NORP authorities dealt with the accident on the landing of the aircraft ORG that occurred on DATE is CARDINAL more element that contradicts the ORG \u2019s above assertion as to the lack of any special treatment of the ORG - associated flights . The incident was described in ORG and the DATE EP Resolution , and was also related by PERSON at the fact - finding hearing ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The presence in GPE of CARDINAL passengers on the plane which came from GPE , GPE , was apparently concealed . Only on the GPE \u2019s considerable insistence did the NORP authorities give them a list of passengers , all of them GPE citizens with service passports . CARDINAL of them was armed with a Beretta gun and had ammunition on him . No questions were asked about the purpose of their trip from GPE , a place reported as hosting a ORG detention site for the purposes of interrogations of captured terrorist - suspects ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As in GPE v. GPE ( cited above \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE ( cited above \u00a7 CARDINAL ) the ORG considers the informal transatlantic meeting of ORG and ORG foreign ministers with the then GPE Secretary of ORG , Ms PERSON , held on DATE , to be one of the elements relevant for its assessment of the respondent ORG \u2019s knowledge of the ORG rendition and secret detention operations in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his testimony in GPE v. GPE , PERSON stated that the meeting had been convened in connection with recent international media reports , including ORG and ORG disclosures of , respectively , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , naming NORP countries that had allegedly hosted ORG \u201c black sites \u201d on their territories ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . He also described the content of the \u201c debriefing \u201d of that meeting , a document that the ORG obtained from a credible confidential source in the offices of ORG . He stated that it had appeared from PERSON statement \u201c we all know about these techniques \u201d made in the context of the ORG operations and interrogations of terrorist suspects which had been recorded in the debriefing that there had been an attempt on the GPE \u2019s part to share the \u201c weight of accusations \u201d ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . In the present case Mr PERSON testified that it had emerged from the debriefing that , at that stage , all the governments had known that this \u201c operational means \u201d had been chosen by the ORG and that the extraordinary renditions were a tool in the war against terrorism .", "Mr PERSON further stated that the TDIP had \u201c never had doubts \u201d given the precision of the debriefing notes and the fact that in the course of their further work they had received confirmation from PERSON , legal advisor to PERSON , that the GPE had \u201c never violated the sovereignty of any ORG Member GPE or indeed any LAW in in the process of accession to the ORG \u201d and that everything what they had done \u201c [ had been ] done by always informing and asking for cooperation and never trying to prevail over the will of the governments of the Member GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the context of GPE \u2019s knowledge of the ORG , PERSON moreover referred to a statement of Mr Pascu , listed in the DATE ORG among the NORP high - office holders \u201c who knew about , authorised and [ stood ] accountable \u201d for GPE \u2019s role in the ORG HVD Programme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to PERSON , Mr Pascu , as Minister of Defence , had been aware that the NORP authorities had not had access to certain sites which had been under the control of the GPE army or intelligence services . In Mr PERSON \u2019s opinion , this statement , although later rectified by PERSON , was truthful ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers , as it did in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE ( both cited above ) , that the circumstances and conditions in which HVDs were routinely transferred by the ORG from rendition planes to the ORG \u201c black sites \u201d in the host countries should be taken into account in the context of the ORG authorities\u2019 alleged knowledge and complicity in the HVD Programme ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "It follows from the ORG \u2019s findings in the above cases and the ORG materials describing the routine procedure for transfers of detainees between the \u201c black sites \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) that for the duration of his transfer a HVD was \u201c securely shackled \u201d by his hands and feet , deprived of sight and sound by the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and hood and that upon arrival at his destination was moved to the \u201c black site \u201d under the same conditions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds it implausible that the transportation of prisoners on land from the planes to the ORG detention site could , for all practical purposes , have been effected without at least the minimum assistance of the host country \u2019s authorities , if only to secure the area near and around the landed planes and provide the conditions for the secret and safe transfer of passengers . Inevitably , the NORP personnel responsible for security arrangements , in particular the reception of the flights and overland transit , must have witnessed at least some elements of the detainees\u2019 transfer to ORG , for instance the unloading of blindfolded and shackled passengers from the planes ( see also GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "Consequently , the ORG concludes that the NORP authorities who received the ORG personnel in the airport could not have been unaware that the persons brought by them to GPE were the ORG prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also attaches importance to various material referring to ill - treatment and abuse of terrorist suspects captured and detained by GPE authorities in the \u201c war on terror \u201d which were available in the public domain at the relevant time ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before analysing that material , the ORG wishes to refer to President \u2019s PERSON memorandum of DATE , stating that neither NORP nor ORG detainees qualified as prisoners of war under LAW and that LAW CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph MONEY above ) , did not apply to them . The ORG Press Secretary announced that decision at the press conference on DATE . It was widely commented in the GPE and international media . That decision , although including a disclaimer that even detainees \u201c not legally entitled \u201d to be treated humanely would be so treated , also spoke of respecting the principles of LAW \u201c to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Consequently , already at this very early stage of the \u201c war on terror \u201d it was well known that \u201c military necessity \u201d was a parameter for determining the treatment to be received by the captured terrorist - suspects .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would further note that from DATE , when the ORG High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement relating to the detention of ORG and ORG prisoners in ORG , strong concerns were expressed publicly as to the treatment of detainees , in particular the use of \u201c stress and duress \u201d methods of interrogation and arbitrary and incommunicado detention . From DATE to the publication of the ORG report on DATE the international governmental and non - governmental organisations regularly published reports and statements disclosing ill - treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in GPE custody in various places , for instance in ORG and the GPE military base in GPE . The material summarised above and cited in the AI / ICJ \u2019s amicus curiae brief include only some sources selected from a large amount of documents available in the public domain throughout the above period ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Also , in the DATE PACE Resolution of DATE of which GPE , CARDINAL of ORG member States must have been aware \u2013 ORG of ORG was \u201c deeply concerned at the conditions of detention \u201d of captured \u201c unlawful combatants \u201d held in the custody of the GPE authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the ill - treatment , use of harsh interrogation measures , and arbitrary detention of ORG and ORG prisoners in GPE custody , as well as the existence of \u201c GPE overseas centres \u201d for interrogations was also often reported in the international and NORP media ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . In particular , DATE and DATE the NORP press published a number of articles concerning illtreatment of prisoners and the use of \u201c violent interrogation techniques \u201d against captured terrorists by the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is mindful of the fact that knowledge of the ORG rendition and secret detention operations and the scale of abuse to which high - value detainees were subjected in ORG custody have evolved over time , from DATE to the present day . A considerable part of evidence before the ORG emerged DATE after the events complained of ( see paragraphs DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ; see also PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and PERSON ( PERSON ) , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "GPE \u2019s alleged knowledge and complicity in the ORG must be assessed with reference to the elements that it knew or ought to have known at or closely around the relevant time , that is to say DATE and DATE . However , the ORG , as it has done in respect of the establishment of the facts relating to the applicant \u2019s secret detention in GPE , will also rely on recent evidence which , as for instance the DATE ORG and expert evidence obtained by the ORG , relate , explain or disclose the facts occurring in the past ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its assessment , the ORG has considered all the evidence in its possession and the various related circumstances referred to above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Having regard to all these elements taken as a whole , the ORG finds that it has been adequately demonstrated to the required standard of proof that the NORP authorities knew that the ORG operated on NORP territory a detention facility for the purposes of secretly detaining and interrogating terrorist suspects captured within the \u201c war on terror \u201d operation by the GPE authorities .", "This finding is primarily based on compelling and crucial evidence deriving from the DATE ORG and , to a considerable extent , evidence from experts .", "The passages of the report about the agreement brokered between the GPE and the country hosting ORG leave no doubt as to the fact as to the NORP high - office ORG prior acceptance of a ORG detention facility on their territory . Nor can there be any doubt that they provided \u201c cooperation and support \u201d for the \u201c detention programme \u201d and that , in appreciation , were offered and accepted a financial reward , referred to as a \u201c subsidy \u201d amounting to a redacted multiple of CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The experts , with reference to the reward received by the NORP authorities , spoke of a \u201c substantial sum , in the region of MONEY \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or \u201c MONEY \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , for the purposes of its ruling , the ORG does not need , nor does it intend , to determine the sum that was at stake .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further attaches importance to the fact that the former Head of ORG Mr Iliescu and his national - security advisor PERSON , admitted publicly in the press interviews that the authorities had made available to the ORG LOC which , as Mr PERSON later explained , were located in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . While it is true that Witness Y and Witness Z in their testimonies before the prosecutor contradicted the statements of Mr Iliescu and PERSON reported in ORG , in the ORG \u2019s view their denial can not be considered credible as being in conflict with all other relevant materials cited above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . In any event , as noted above , Witness Z confirmed that a location \u201c for actions of combating international terrorist threats \u201d was offered to the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and-CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the disclosure in the DATE ORG demonstrates conclusively that in DATE , when ORG had already been operating in GPE for DATE , the national authorities were given a presentation outlining the HVD Programme by the chief of the ORG station and the GPE ambassador . The content of that presentation as related in the report leaves no doubt as to the fact that at the very least the NORP authorities had learnt from the ORG of a \u201c full range of interrogation measures \u201d being used against their detainees in order to \u201c overcome resistance \u201d in the context of obtaining intelligence ( see CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the experts , who in the course of their inquiries also had the benefit of contact with various , including confidential , sources unanimously and categorically stated that GPE not only ought to have known but actually did know of the nature and purposes of the ORG activities in the country .", "Senator PERSON said that the authorities \u201c must have known that the ORG had used their territory for transfers of prisoners in the context of the war on terror \u201d . Mr GPE stated that \u201c quite clearly , categorically the NORP authorities , at the highest level , did know of the existence of secret detention on their territory \u201d and that \u201c they were aware of the precise purpose of the rendition flights entering and exiting the country , and the conditions , or roughly the conditions , under which the detainees were held in between their arrivals and their departures \u201d . Mr PERSON stated that \u201c though the operations were conducted under extreme secrecy , it is obvious that the ORG plane could not land with its cargo and depart without agreement from high - level NORP decision makers \u201d . PERSON said that it was \u201c clear that the authorities were aware of [ the purposes of the ORG aircraft landings in GPE ] because , among other things , they received money for it \u201d and that , based on the DATE ORG , it was \u201c normally common practice ... that the host country \u2019s officials were in the know about these facilities and the purposes of them \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "This did not mean , the experts added , that the NORP authorities had known the details of what exactly went on inside ORG or witnessed treatment to which the ORG prisoners had been subjected in GPE . As in other countries hosting clandestine prisons , the operation of the site was entirely in the hands of the ORG and the interrogations had been exclusively the ORG \u2019s responsibility ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ; see also GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . However , in the ORG \u2019s view , even if the NORP authorities did not , or could not , have complete knowledge of the ORG , the facts available to them , in particular those presented to them directly by their GPE partners , taken together with extensive and widely available information about torture , ill - treatment , abuse and harsh interrogation measures inflicted on terrorist suspects in GPE custody which in DATE circulated in the public domain , including the NORP press ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , enabled them to conjure up a reasonably accurate image of the ORG \u2019s activities and , more particularly , the treatment to which the ORG were likely to have subjected their prisoners in GPE .", "In that regard the ORG would reiterate that in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE it has found that already in DATE the public sources reported practices resorted to , or tolerated by , the GPE authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention . Consequently , the NORP authorities had good reason to believe that a person detained under the ORG rendition and secret detention programme could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles on NORP territory .", "It further observes that it is DATE as previously found in respect of GPE DATE inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed the country \u2019s airspace , landing at and departing from its airports , that the ORG occupied the LOC offered by the national authorities and transported detainees there , without the ORG authorities being informed of or involved in the preparation and execution of the HVD Programme on its territory . Nor can it stand to reason that activities of such a character and scale , possibly vital for the country \u2019s military and political interests , could have been undertaken on NORP territory without GPE \u2019s knowledge and without the necessary authorisation and assistance being given at the appropriate level of the ORG authorities ( see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; and GPE ( PERSON ) v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accordingly finds it established beyond reasonable doubt that :", "( a ) LOC knew of the nature and purposes of the ORG \u2019s activities on its territory at the material time .", "( b ) LOC , by entering into an agreement with the ORG on hosting ORG , enabling the ORG to use its airspace and airports and to disguise the movements of rendition aircraft , providing logistics and services , securing the LOC for the ORG and transportation of the ORG teams with detainees on land , cooperated in the preparation and execution of the ORG rendition , secret detention and interrogation operations on its territory .", "( c ) Given its knowledge of the nature and purposes of the ORG \u2019s activities on its territory and its involvement in the execution of that programme , GPE knew that , by enabling the ORG to detain terrorist suspects on its territory , it was exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5", "6", "8", "P6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1", "6-1", "8-1", "P6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
