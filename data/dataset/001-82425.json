SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1 (length);Remainder inadmissible;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings;Costs and expenses (domestic proceedings) - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The application is brought by the estate of a NORP national , Mr PERSON , who was born in DATE and died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until its bankruptcy in DATE , Mr ORG owned PERCENT of the company ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the company \u201d ) . He was a member of the board of directors and authorised to sign for the company as well as being responsible for the daily functioning of the company . The other shares ( PERCENT ) were owned by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE sent an audit report ( granskningspromemoria ) to Mr Nitschke , informing him that , following a tax audit of the company , it was considering altering the tax returns for the tax assessment DATE for the company , as well as for PERSON , and imposing tax surcharges on them . On the basis of information from the audit , ORG concluded that Mr Nitschke had to be considered the executive of the company , due to his influence therein , and that his taxable income for DATE should be increased because he had omitted to inform ORG about certain income from the company in the form of salary payments and benefits involving free lunches and the free use of a company car . Moreover , ORG had found that Mr Nitschke had let the company pay for a boat mooring at a marina , as well as for a computer and stereo which he had bought for private use and kept in his home .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON replied to ORG , disputing its findings and demanding that he be taxed in accordance with his tax returns and that the tax surcharges be remitted . He stated that he was not the executive of the company , as he was a minority owner , but that it was the executive of ORG who controlled the company and that the book - keeping was carried out by that company 's accountant . He further claimed that he had never eaten lunch at the restaurant since he was too busy serving lunches to the guests . Moreover , he only used the company car for carrying out work - related matters as he owned a car for private use . The mooring had been rented for the company to cater for islands in the archipelago , and he underlined that he did not own a boat himself . Also , as the company did not have proper office space , he kept the computer and stereo in a room of his house which he only used as an office . The stereo was used in the restaurant and when the company organised parties , and the computer was used to produce lunch menus , price lists , etc .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld its findings in the audit report for the tax assessment DATE . It increased Mr ORG 's income assessment to MONEY ( SEK ) and imposed tax surcharges amounting to PERCENT of the tax liability on that sum ( SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Further , on DATE , it increased Mr ORG 's income assessment for DATE to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and imposed tax surcharges on him amounting to SEK MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , again on the basis of the findings in the audit report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG requested ORG to reassess its decision as he maintained that his tax returns were correct and that he should be taxed in accordance with them . He further developed his reasons for disputing ORG findings on each of the points where his income had been altered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG maintained its decision concerning DATE but lowered Mr ORG 's income assessment by SEK CARDINAL for DATE , as it had been confirmed that Mr ORG did not own a boat and that the mooring had been rented for company purposes . As a consequence , the tax surcharges were lowered to SEK CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company was declared bankrupt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Nitschke appealed against the decisions and requested a stay of payment for the additional taxes for both tax years . This request was rejected on DATE by ORG , and Mr ORG immediately appealed against it to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . However , the court rejected the appeal on DATE , as it found that the prerequisites for granting a stay of payment were not fulfilled . Apparently , Mr Nitschke did not appeal against this judgment and , in DATE , he paid the taxes and the tax surcharges to avoid seizure by ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG invited Mr Nitschke to an information meeting with the responsible officials , which took place on DATE . Mr PERSON was given the opportunity to ask questions about the audit report and to discuss the changes to his tax returns .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made the obligatory re - assessment of its decisions of DATE but decided not to change them . Following this , it forwarded the appeals to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Mr Nitschke submitted a very detailed account ( CARDINAL pages ) of the company , its structure , business areas , its plans for the future , etc . , which could be of relevance for the case , and to clarify his views on the contentious issues . He still maintained that he should be taxed in accordance with his tax returns and that the tax surcharges should be remitted , if on no other grounds , then at least because the proceedings before ORG had been of excessive length , which had caused the interest on the added taxes to increase his debt to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its reply , ORG , on DATE , maintained its stance , except as concerned the lunch benefits , which it agreed to remove for both tax assessment years . As a consequence , it also agreed that the tax surcharges should be lowered , but it objected to them being remitted completely as it did not consider that the proceedings had been unreasonably long or that there were any other reasons on which to remit them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant submitted his comments on ORG submission and requested an extension to supplement his claims . ORG granted an extension of the time - limit until DATE . This date was subsequently prolonged upon request by the applicant until DATE . However , no supplementary pleadings were received by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the appeal in so far as it related to the lunch benefits and the tax surcharges based on these costs , but rejected the remainder of the appeal . In its judgment , it examined , CARDINAL by CARDINAL , each point raised by PERSON , stating the grounds for its conclusions . As concerned the remaining part of the tax surcharges , the court found that no reasons for remission had been shown .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr Nitschke appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE and stated that he would submit supplementary information . However , no further material was received by the court , despite reminders . Thus , in DATE , it formally ordered Mr Nitschke to submit all further material which he wanted to invoke before the court , within DATE from the date on which he received the order . Apparently , Mr ORG asked for further extensions of the time - limit but did not submit any more material . Therefore , in DATE , the court renewed its order and warned Mr Nitschke that the case could be decided even if he did not submit any material within DATE time - limit . Due to illness , Mr Nitschke hired a lawyer to represent him , who asked for a respite of DATE to submit the supplementary information and material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Nitschke died . However , his estate , through the same representative , pursued his appeal concerning both tax assessment years and requested another extension of the time - limit to supplement its claims . ORG granted an extension until DATE and informed the applicant 's representative that no more extensions would be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without having received any submissions from the applicant , ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment in full without giving any reasoning of its own . The court simply stated that :", "\u201c What has emerged in the case does not lead ORG to make an evaluation other than that made by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) and at the same time asked for extra time to supplement its appeal , which was granted and subsequently prolonged twice . On DATE the applicant submitted its supplementary pleadings , invoking LAW . It claimed that the proceedings had been of excessive length and that the accumulated respite interest should therefore be remitted . Moreover , it alleged that the proceedings had been flawed in several ways , inter alia , by ignoring the evidence and by ORG failure to give any reasons for its judgment . Moreover , as Mr Nitschke had died before the appellate court 's judgment , the tax surcharges should have been remitted in accordance with LAW , as they were a penalty falling within the criminal sphere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The rules governing the administration of justice before the administrative courts are laid down in the DATE LAW ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , the determination of a case by a court shall be based on that contained in the documents and what has otherwise been established in the case . The decision of the court shall state the reasons that determined the outcome .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , LAW does not contain any particular provisions stipulating how rapidly cases must be examined and determined by the administrative courts . However , it is in the nature of things that the courts shall conclude the examination of a case and issue a decision or a judgment as soon as this can be done , having regard , inter alia , to the character of the case .", "CARDINAL . At the time relevant for the present case , the DATE LAW ( uppb\u00f6rdslagen , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , section CARDINAL , stipulated that a request for reconsideration or an appeal against a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges had no suspensive effect on the taxpayer 's obligation to pay the amounts in question . However , ORG could grant a stay of execution in respect of the taxes and tax surcharges provided that certain conditions were met ( section DATE ) . Its decision in this respect could be appealed against to the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . If a stay of execution was not granted , the taxes and tax surcharges should be paid immediately or they could be enforced by ORG . However , this also meant that if a tax decision was quashed or amended to the taxpayer 's advantage by a court judgment after the relevant amounts had been paid , the amount overpaid was refunded with interest ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , skattebetalningslagen ) . In addition , a taxpayer could claim compensation from the Chancellor of ORG or bring an action for damages against the ORG for the financial loss caused by enforcement measures taken , on the ground that the authorities or courts had acted wrongfully or negligently ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , skadest\u00e5ndslagen ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE LAW ( taxeringslagen ) , no tax surcharges could be imposed if , at that time , the taxpayer had deceased . This was confirmed by a judgment from ORG ( PERSON DATE not CARDINAL ) . In this case , ORG had granted the tax payer 's appeal and remitted the tax surcharges imposed by ORG . ORG had appealed against the judgment to ORG which overturned the lower court 's judgment and upheld ORG original decision , including imposing tax surcharges anew . However , during the proceedings before the appellate court , the taxpayer had died . Thus , the taxpayer 's estate , and ORG ( PERSON ) , appealed to ORG and requested that the tax surcharges be repealed as they could not be imposed on a deceased person . On DATE , ORG granted the appeal , noting that since the tax payer had died before ORG judgment , there had been no legal basis on which to impose the tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , the estate of a deceased person is a separate legal person responsible for settling all matters relating to the deceased person , including his / her debts and liabilities ( see , inter alia , LAW [ GPE ] and LAW , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section CARDINAL ( b ) CARDINAL of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
