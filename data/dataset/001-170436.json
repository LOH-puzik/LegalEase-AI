The first applicant , who was born in GPE , moved to GPE at DATE . On completing a business - studies course in GPE , he returned temporarily to GPE to attend classes in NORP studies ; while there , he met the second applicant , who became his wife . She moved to GPE in DATE under the provisions for family reunion . When the present application was lodged she was on a training course to become a playgroup leader ( Spielgruppenleiterin ) . The first applicant speaks fluent PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Three daughters were born to the applicants , on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The present application concerns only the first CARDINAL daughters . They were initially enrolled in the GPE primary school in GPE . The eldest daughter subsequently attended an \u201c orientation school \u201d ( PERSON , between the primary and secondary levels ) .", "CARDINAL . Swimming lessons are part of the compulsory school curriculum ; under the applicable legislation in the canton of ORG , pupils can not be exempted until they reach puberty ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This fact was brought to the applicants\u2019 attention on CARDINAL DATE through a recommendation entitled \u201c Guidelines on dealing with religious matters in schools \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants , who are devout NORP , refused to send their daughters to the swimming lessons on the grounds that their beliefs prohibited them from allowing their children to take part in mixed swimming lessons . They stated that although the Koran did not instruct women to cover their bodies until puberty , their beliefs required them to prepare their daughters for the precepts that would be applied to them from that point onwards . As the holders of parental responsibility for their daughters , the applicants alleged that there been a violation of their own rights .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of the GPE of ORG ( ORG Basel - Stadt ) advised the applicants that under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of the GPE of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they were liable to a maximum fine of MONEY ( CHF ) ( around QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) each if their daughters did not comply with the obligation to attend school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head teacher of the school held a meeting with the applicants in order to resolve the situation . The applicants continued to refuse to send their daughters to the swimming lessons . By letters of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the applicants were again invited to send their daughters to the swimming lessons . In spite of these attempts by the school , the NORP daughters continued to be absent from the swimming lessons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the school authorities asked the Head of ORG to open fixed - penalty proceedings against the applicants . On DATE the applicants were invited to comment again as part of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the education authorities ordered the applicants to pay a fine of CHF CARDINAL ( about ORG CARDINAL ) per parent and per child ( a total of MONEY \u2013 about LAW ) for acting in breach of their parental duties ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of the GPE of ORG , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicants against that decision was dismissed by ORG of the GPE of ORG ( ORG Basel - Stadt ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Drawing on its leading decision of DATE ( see ORG judgment CARDINAL I CARDINAL ; paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , dismissed an appeal by the applicants , holding that the authorities\u2019 refusal to exempt their daughters from mixed swimming lessons in primary school had not breached the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of conscience and belief .", "CARDINAL . It accepted that this refusal represented a breach of freedom of religion . Nonetheless , it considered that the swimming lessons formed part of the compulsory school curriculum in the GPE of ORG and that this obligation had a sufficiently solid legal basis . It cited , firstly , section CARDINAL of LAW of the GPE of ORG , which stated that gymnastics was CARDINAL of the compulsory lessons in primary school , and CARDINAL of the same LAW , stating that TIME of the ORG DATE timetable was to be spent in physical education . It also held that , under section CARDINAL of the Act , boys and girls at primary - school level were , in principle , to attend classes together . It further stated that , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Act , the precise organisation of this subject , especially the various lessons and the number of hours allocated to them , was set out in the curriculum , point CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of which provided that swimming formed part of compulsory gymnastics and sports lessons .", "CARDINAL . ORG then pointed out that pupils could be exempted from lessons or from certain subjects , and any such decision was to be taken by the school authorities at the request of teachers or of persons responsible for the children \u2019s education ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It noted that detailed information on exemptions was set out in point CARDINAL of ORG Schulordnung ) of the GPE of ORG , and that the arrangements for dealing with religious issues in schools were included in a ORG ) that had been issued by ORG of the GPE of ORG in DATE . It added that , under point CARDINAL of that recommendation , exemption from swimming classes could only be granted to pupils who had reached the age of puberty . It also indicated that from DATE of school ( that is , generally when pupils had reached DATE ) , girls and boys attended physical education and swimming lessons separately ( point CARDINAL of the recommendation ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that the ORG argument that the recommendation had no legal validity was irrelevant in this case , in so far as , in its view , the recommendation was in any event merely a tool to assist in balancing the competing interests involved in reaching a decision on an exemption request . It also considered the fact that swimming was not taught in all the GPE \u2019s schools and that ice - skating , which also appeared as a lesson in the curriculum , was not taught at all in practice , to be irrelevant in assessing the legal basis .", "ORG accordingly concluded that the measure had a valid legal basis .", "CARDINAL . As to the public interest and the proportionality of the interference , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment to the effect that it was of paramount importance to ensure that children were integrated , irrespective of their origin , culture or religion . It further considered that the interference was lessened by the fact that the swimming lessons were mixed only until DATE , and that the impact of the measure was attenuated by the accompanying measures ( separate changing rooms and showers , and the option of wearing a burkini ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found irrelevant the applicants\u2019 argument that their children were receiving private swimming lessons , holding that what was at stake for the children was not simply learning to swim , but also submitting to the conditions surrounding the teaching itself ( \u00e4ussere PERSON des Unterrichts ) . It held that the school \u2019s function of social integration , valid in respect of all pupils , required that exemptions for swimming classes be granted only sparingly . The refusal to grant an exemption in the present case thus corresponded to its new practice , according to which educational obligations were , in principle , to be recognised as prevailing over compliance with the religious precepts ( religi\u00f6se Gebote ) of CARDINAL part of the population . For that reason , the comparison with exemptions granted for medical reasons was also irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the foregoing factors , ORG concluded that the refusal to grant an exemption from the mixed swimming classes had not breached the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of religion ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["9"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["9-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
