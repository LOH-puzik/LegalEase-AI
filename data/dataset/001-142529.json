On DATE the applicant argued before ORG that he had been the victim of entrapment by the investigative authorities . He indicated in that connection that , according to his first statement as recorded in the report on the discovery of the offence , GPE had initially said that the money was intended for her . He took the view that it was only after been subjected for TIME to psychological pressure on the part of the investigators , who had repeatedly stressed that she would benefit from a reduction in sentence and had questioned her about her family , that GPE had stated that the money was intended for him . He added that the report on the discovery of the offence could not constitute valid evidence , on the ground that it contained a statement that he had allegedly made immediately after being caught in the act of committing an offence , without having been informed by the prosecutor of his right to legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by ORG about the substance of the discussion he had had with GPE just before being caught in the act of committing the offence , the applicant indicated that he had heard GPE say something about a candidate but had not understood exactly what she had meant , as she had spoken softly and at a point when his attention had been distracted by a colleague going into the secretary \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court questioned GPE She stated that she had been caught in the act of committing an offence and that when the investigators had asked her whether the money was for her or for someone else , she had mentioned the applicant . She also indicated that she was not supposed to receive any money from the candidate and that all the money was intended for the applicant . She added that the investigators had asked her to follow up the procedure for the discovery of the offence while being committed and to take the money to the person for whom it was intended . The investigators had allegedly asked her to behave as if nothing had happened and to explain to the applicant that she had been delayed by a traffic accident . When she had hesitated , the investigators had allegedly told her that she could benefit from a reduction in sentence if she accepted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE T.G. was questioned by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG listened to and watched the audio and video recordings made by the prosecutor \u2019s office during the commission of the offence , involving first GPE and GPE , and ORG and the applicant , together with the filmed interview of GPE after she was caught in the act of committing an offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hearings were resumed . The applicant repeated that he had been the victim of entrapment and that GPE had made the statements in question , after being caught in the act of committing an offence , without legal assistance and under pressure from the investigators . He indicated that in the transcription of the recording of his discussions with GPE , the phrase \u201c Put them on the table ... \u201d concerning the impugned envelope appeared in writing but was inaudible on the recording .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , by a majority , ORG , sitting in a CARDINAL - judge formation , sentenced the applicant on the charge of soliciting bribes to a suspended term of DATE in prison . It based its decision on the report of the discovery of the offence while being committed by the applicant , on the statement of GPE and on the audio and video recordings made when the applicant was caught in the act of committing the offence .", "...", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s allegations that he should have had legal assistance from the time when he was first questioned by the public prosecutor in the procedure concerning the discovery of an offence while being committed , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , suspects or accused persons have the right to be assisted by a lawyer throughout the criminal proceedings , and the judicial authorities are obliged to inform them of that right . At the time of the drawing - up of the report concerning the discovery of an offence while being committed , the criminal proceedings had not yet been started in respect of PERSON , who did not even have the status of suspect . Accordingly the [ said ] report and the audio and video recordings made during the discovery of the offence will be admitted in evidence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . After noting that the applicant had always denied the charges , ORG found that his allegations were contradicted by the video and audio recordings . Based on that evidence , it noted that GPE had held out the envelope to the applicant telling him loudly and clearly \u201c this is from the candidate \u201d ; it was thus obvious to ORG that the applicant was perfectly aware of what was in the envelope and he had no reason to believe that an envelope from a candidate contained examination papers . It further noted that the applicant had pointed to where GPE should place the envelope and that when she had started to explain that the rest would be remitted afterwards , he had interrupted her saying that it was up to her .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the applicant \u2019s statement that the envelope had then been covered by certain documents on the desk because he had tidied things up was contradicted by the verifications made using an ultraviolet lamp , which had revealed specific fluorescent traces leading to the conclusion that the applicant had not lifted the envelope to tidy the desk but that he had slid it under other documents to hide it . ORG concluded that this evidence , together with the report on the discovery of the offence , proved that there had been a prior agreement between the applicant and GPE", "CARDINAL . NORP The appeal proceedings before the High Court sitting in a CARDINAL - judge formation", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the first - instance judgment , seeking his acquittal and , in the alternative , a retrial before the first - instance court , arguing that there was no evidence that he had been aware of the content of the envelope in question .", "CARDINAL . He further argued that he had been the victim of entrapment on the part of the investigators . He pointed out that the evidence had been obtained illegally as a result of the pressure exerted for TIME on GPE by the investigators after she had been taken into police custody , without being informed of her procedural rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also indicated that the words \u201c Put them there ! \u201d appeared in the transcripts whereas they were not , in his view , audible in the recording and that his discussion with GPE before entering the office had not been transcribed , even though it would have shown that he had received GPE in his office only upon her insistence . He further argued that the authorisations for recording his discussions with GPE were not legal , on the ground that they had been issued before he was formally charged and had not been confirmed within the statutory time - limit by the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . He lastly indicated that he had not been assisted by a lawyer when he gave the first statement recorded in the report of the discovery of the offence . In this connection , he relied on the first paragraph of LAW of LAW governing the discovery of an offence while being committed . He added that , under LAW , the prosecuting authority was required to draw up a report of the discovery of the offence containing the statements of the \u201c suspect and other persons questioned \u201d . He inferred from this that at the time the offence was committed he must have had the status of \u201c suspect \u201d , which meant that he should have been assisted by a lawyer or at least informed of that right .", "CARDINAL . The hearing took place on DATE . In a final judgment delivered on DATE , issued on paper on DATE , ORG , sitting as a CARDINAL - judge formation , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that , while it was clear that LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW was applicable in the present case , that did not , however , entail an obligation to prosecute before or at the same time as the discovery of the offence while being committed . In the court \u2019s view , such an interpretation would render futile the relevant procedure as a whole , whereas the fact of being caught in the act of committing an offence formed the basis on which the criminal proceedings were then initiated . In addition , since the measure in which the above - mentioned legal provision provided for keeping a record of the statements of the suspect and other persons questioned , the person concerned would be questioned as the suspect only if the prosecution had already decided to bring proceedings against that person . If not , his or her statement would be recorded as that of \u201c another person questioned \u201d . ORG concluded on that point that , in view of the fact that at the time he was first questioned the applicant had been neither a suspect nor an accused person , there had been no statutory obligation for him to be assisted by a lawyer . Moreover , it noted that the applicant had been informed subsequently , in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing , that preliminary investigative acts ( acte premerg\u0103toare ) had been carried out against him in his capacity as a person caught in the act of committing an offence .", "CARDINAL . The High Court further found that the charges against the applicant had been fully substantiated by the video and audio recording of his meeting with GPE on DATE . It noted the importance of their conversation on that occasion and the indicative nature of the applicant \u2019s gesture in showing GPE where to place the envelope , thus ruling out the possibility that he could have been the victim of entrapment . ORG held that , even supposing that the sentence \u201c Put them on the table \u201d had not been audible in the recording , the words spoken by the applicant , and not disputed by him , both before and after the envelope was placed on the table , formed a context that left no room for doubt .", "CARDINAL . The court lastly found the recordings to be valid . In this connection it noted that in case of urgency the prosecutor was empowered to authorise recordings and that the court was required to confirm the authorisations within TIME , as it had done in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG rehabilitated the applicant upon his application and cancelled his conviction of DATE .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "34", "6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3", "8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"]}
