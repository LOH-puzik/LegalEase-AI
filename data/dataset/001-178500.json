The writs of execution issued by ORG on DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , respectively , were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges on the debtor \u2019s account . On several occasions thereafter the bank informed ORG that the enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG of the CB Canton ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) informed the bank that no funds for the enforcement of final judgments had been provided in the cantonal budget for DATE and that , accordingly , the final judgments against the canton could not be enforced .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE , upon the applicants\u2019 enquiry , the ORG informed them that in DATE the canton had designated MONEY ( BAM ) for the enforcement of judgments and BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE for the same purpose .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained of the non - enforcement to ORG the LAW \u201d ) . On DATE ( decision no . AP CARDINAL ) and DATE ( decision no . ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW in the applicants\u2019 and CARDINAL other cases , on account of the prolonged non - enforcement of the final judgments in their favour . It ordered the government of the CB GPE to take the necessary steps in order to secure the payment of the cantonal debt arising from the final judgments within a reasonable time . Although some of the applicants submitted a claim for non - pecuniary damages , ORG did not award any compensation .", "The relevant part of the decision of CARDINAL DATE reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The court notes that the judgments [ in favour of the appellants ] have not been enforced due to the lack of funds on the debtor \u2019s bank account .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterates that under LAW and LAW all levels of government must secure respect for individual human rights , including the right to enforcement of final judgments under LAW and the right to property under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ... The scope of that obligation is not reduced in the present case , notwithstanding the large number of judgments ... [ T]he ORG notes that in NORP v. ORG , and again in \u010coli\u0107 and Others v. ORG , ORG reiterated that \u2018 it is not open to a ORG authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt . Admittedly , a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances , but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under LAW ...", "CARDINAL . ORG agrees with the position taken by ORG ... it is nevertheless aware of the effects the global economic crisis had on GPE ... The court notes that the federal and the cantonal governments had taken certain steps with the view to enforcement of final court decisions . LAW DATE provides that the final judgments against the GPE and the cantons shall be enforced within the amount of budgetary funds designated for that purpose ... and that the creditors shall enforce their claims in the order in which they acquired the enforcement titles ...", "...", "CARDINAL . The court finds that the crux of the problem in the present case is that the CB Canton did not identify the exact number of unenforced judgments and the aggregate debt ... without which it is impossible to know when all the creditors will realise their claims against this canton . Furthemore , there should exist a centralised and transparent database of all the claims listed in chronological order according to the time the judgments became final . It should include the enforcement time - frame and a list of partial payments , if any . This will also help to avoid abuses of the enforcement procedure . These measure and adequate funds in the DATE budget would ensure that all the final judgments are enforced within a reasonable time ... and the ORG would ensure the respect of its obligations from LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "...", "CARDINAL . The court considers that the adoption of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE had a legitimate aim , because the enforcement of a large number of judgments at the same time would jeopardise the normal functioning of the cantons . However , the limitation of the enforcement in the present case is contrary to the principle of proportionality enshrined in LAW No . CARDINAL which requires that a fair balance is struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual \u2019s fundamental rights ... Section CARDINAL places a disproportionate burden on the appellants ... they are placed in a situation of absolute uncertainty as regards the enforcement of their claims ...", "...", "CARDINAL . In order to comply with its positive obligation , the government of the CB GPE must , as explained above , calculate the total amount of the aggregate debt arising from the final judgments and prepare a comprehensive and transparent database ... This court will not specify what a reasonable time - limit should be ... but , in any event , it must be in accordance with LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... The current situation does not give any guarantees to the appellants that their claims against the ORG will be enforced within a reasonable time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE follows the same legal reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON concluded out - of - court settlements with the government of the ORG pursuant to which part of their principal claims were to be paid within DATE following the settlement . They renounced the remaining principal claim and default interest . The legal costs were to be settled by a separate agreement .
