The opposition party , ORG , took third place with PERCENT of the vote ( giving them CARDINAL seats in ORG ) , followed by the applicant party with PERCENT of the vote ( CARDINAL seats ) and GPE , a coalition led by the President of the ORG , PERSON , with PERCENT of the vote ( CARDINAL seats ) .", "CARDINAL . On account of numerous instances of ballot fraud reported by election observers , ORG and the NORP refused to accept the election results . With general support from the population , they called for President PERSON \u2019s resignation . When the newly elected parliament convened for its first session on DATE , the opposition forces broke into the parliament building , disrupted the President \u2019s inaugural speech and ousted the members of parliament ( MPs ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL which , under LAW of the ORG , set the date of the repeat parliamentary election ( \u201c the repeat election \u201d ) for DATE . On DATE , however , the ORG Chairman applied to the interim President of GPE ( Decree no . CARDINAL ) , requesting that DATE be set for the election , arguing that it would hardly be possible to ensure its proper administration within such a short time frame . This application was finally granted on DATE and the repeat election was scheduled for DATE by the interim President .", "CARDINAL . The applicant party challenged ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in court , claiming that the ORG had erroneously relied on LAW instead of LAW of the ORG when setting the date for the repeat election . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the claim , reasoning that the applicant party lacked victim status . That judgment was quashed on DATE by ORG which noted that , since the applicant party was running for election , there was a direct and consequential link between its interests and the decisions of the ORG . However , ORG dismissed the claim as manifestly illfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the ORG issued Ordinances by which voters were required to attend electoral precincts and fill out special forms ; this would enable them to cast their ballots during the presidential election of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Along with other opposition parties , the applicant party challenged the lawfulness of those rules in court . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim as unsubstantiated . With regard to the applicant party , the court stated that it lacked victim status as it had failed to show what direct and specific harm the preliminary voter registration procedure for the presidential election could possibly have caused to its interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was declared President of GPE . By an Ordinance of DATE , the new President appointed CARDINAL members of the ORG , CARDINAL of whom was given authority to appoint CARDINAL members in ORG ( \u201c the DECs \u201d ) under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL political parties and blocs were registered by the ORG on DATE as candidates for the repeat parliamentary election , including the applicant party and the ruling coalition of the President \u2019s ORG and PERSON NORP . ORG had previously won the DATE municipal elections in GPE .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of the repeat election , the ORG passed another decree on DATE ( Decree no . ORG ) , pursuant to which ORG ( \u201c the PECs \u201d ) had to post preliminary lists of voters in their bureaux , data which had been gathered in the course of the preliminary registration of voters for the presidential election . Between CARDINAL and DATE , voters were to attend the electoral precincts again to verify that their names were on the lists . If a voter found that he or she was missing from the list , a petition for correction was to be filed with the relevant ORG . On DATE the PECs were to send corrected versions of the preliminary electoral rolls to the relevant ORG , which was required to produce final electoral rolls and remit them to the PECs for a further public examination . DATE , voters were to recheck the final lists and request corrections if necessary . The Decree also envisaged adding the names of voters who had not been included in the preliminary registration to the lists on DATE itself .", "CARDINAL . The rationale behind the introduction of this system of voter registration was explained by the ORG Chairman in a public statement : \u201c If a voter does not want to participate in the election , does not engage in politics , does not want to cooperate with the ORG , then the ORG is also under no obligation to ensure that this voter is on the unified electoral roll . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The repeat election , based on the system of proportional representation , was held as planned on DATE . Numerous complaints about irregularities on DATE were subsequently filed with electoral commissions , including the ORG , and with the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which annulled the election results for all the PECs in the ORG and PERSON electoral districts ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) in GPE ( \u201c the AAR \u201d ) , where CARDINAL and CARDINAL voters were registered respectively . The CEC Ordinance did not explain which legal provision had entitled it to take this annulment decision . It simply noted that complaints had been filed about voting irregularities in these CARDINAL districts . The complaints requested that the investigative measures envisaged by LAW of the ORG be undertaken by the ORG . However , \u201c in view of the nature of the irregularities alleged in the complaints \u201d , there was , according to the ORG , no point in resorting to such measures . Consequently , the challenged election results in the ORG and PERSON districts were to be annulled and , in accordance with LAW of the ORG , the polls were to be repeated there . The new date was set for DATE ( for more details , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued rules of procedure ( Decree no . CARDINAL ) for the posting of electoral rolls in the various precincts of the ORG and PERSON districts . As before the presidential election of DATE and the repeat parliamentary election of CARDINAL March CARDINAL , voters were expected to pay preliminary visits to the precincts in order to ensure that their names were on the lists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the polling stations in the GPE and PERSON districts failed to open ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE , however , the ORG tallied the votes in the repeat election of CARDINAL March CARDINAL . It stated that CARDINAL votes had been cast , while CARDINAL voters had registered . The applicant party received PERCENT of the vote , which was not enough to clear the PERCENT threshold and thus to obtain seats in ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to TIME of the ORG meeting of DATE , the applicant party \u2019s representative , as CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members of the ORG , objected to the finalisation of the election results . The representative argued that the ORG could not lawfully end the countrywide election without first having held an election in the GPE and PERSON districts . The Chairman of the ORG replied that the fact that the polling stations had not opened in those districts was the fault of the PERSON authorities . He also added that , even if the election had been conducted in those districts , this would not have affected the final results . By a majority vote , the Chairman \u2019s proposal to approve the vote tally was accepted and the relevant LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) was adopted on the basis of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newly elected parliament convened for its first session . After DATE of tension , the Head of the ORG , Mr A. ORG , stepped down on DATE , fleeing the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant party appealed to ORG against Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Alongside the main claim for annulment of the GPE in question , the applicant party asked the court to apply an interim measure whereby ORG would be forbidden from convening for its first session until the dispute had been resolved . The applicant party argued that , if ORG convened , it would become impossible to enforce the judgment should the court find in the applicant party \u2019s favour . On DATE ORG declared the claim admissible but refused to apply the requested interim measure . It reasoned that the claim could not have any suspensive effect under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG and noted that , pursuant to LAW , the first sitting of a newly elected parliament was to be held within DATE of the finalisation of the election results .", "CARDINAL . The applicant party submitted CARDINAL major arguments to ORG , which dismissed its claim on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the applicant party challenged the rules on the composition of electoral rolls . It claimed that many eligible voters who had failed to comply with the procedure for preliminary registration had been refused the right to cast their votes on DATE . At the same time , the obligation to register in advance had created a kind of carousel to facilitate ballot fraud in which some voters could register in different electoral precincts and thus cast their vote more than once . As a result of those irregularities , the applicant party claimed that it had lost votes . It also complained that the ORG had not had competence to change the rules on the composition of electoral rolls , this prerogative being reserved solely for ORG , which alone was entitled to make the relevant legislative amendments to the ORG . In the applicant party \u2019s view , the fact that many voters had been refused the right to vote because of the new rules , and that the Government had total control over the electoral administration , had allowed the election results to be rigged . Based on statistical data about high voting activity across the country at particular times , provided by its representatives in the electoral commissions of ORG , ORG and PERSON regions , the applicant party claimed that vote - riggers had fraudulently cast CARDINAL ballots in favour of the presidential and pro - presidential parties at TIME , TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found the latter allegation unsubstantiated , reasoning that the applicant party had submitted no relevant evidence in support of it . As to the voter registration rules , the court noted that the ORG had issued Decree no . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by which it had remedied the deficiency of LAW of the ORG , the effect of which had been suspended by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Since that GPE allowed voter registration on DATE of election , the allegation that the voters who had missed preliminary registration deadlines were subsequently denied the right to vote was held to be ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant party complained that its representatives at various levels in the electoral commissions had been prevented by other members from fulfilling their duties properly . They had been threatened and instructed not to write complaints about violations observed , namely when votes cast in favour of ORG were attributed to the presidential and pro - presidential parties . The applicant party complained that such permissive conduct was due to the composition of the electoral commissions , since , in every commission at all levels , CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL members were representatives of the presidential and propresidential parties .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the applicant party argued that the impugned LAW of DATE was contrary to LAW of the ORG , since it did not specify the total number of voters and the number of votes cast in each district .", "CARDINAL . In reply to these latter arguments , ORG reasoned that the applicant party should first have complained about the threats to its representatives before a district court . However , it gave no response to the complaint about the pro - presidential composition of the electoral commissions . As to the ORG \u2019s failure to include information in the GPE about the total number of voters and the number of votes cast in each district , the court stated that this was not a gross violation of electoral legislation and could not therefore be regarded as grounds for invalidating that administrative act .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant party claimed that the finalisation of the countrywide election results without elections being held in the GPE and PERSON districts had been unlawful . In view of the fact that there were CARDINAL voters in those districts and that the applicant party needed CARDINAL votes in order to clear the PERCENT legal threshold , it complained that it had been unlawfully deprived of a genuine chance to obtain seats in ORG . It noted that ORG was , by and large , supported in the PERSON constituency .", "CARDINAL . ORG replied as follows :", "\u201c It is true that the repeat parliamentary election results were annulled in the ORG and PERSON electoral districts and the ORG called a new repeat election by its Ordinance ... [ of DATE ] . However , due to well - known events [ tensions between the central and local authorities ] , the election was not held ... in those districts on account of factual circumstances , this being a ground for the annulment of an administrative act [ the CEC Ordinance of DATE ] under LAW ( g ) of LAW of GPE . \u201d", "Relying on LAW of the ORG , ORG decided that the repeat election could be considered as having been held , since , according to the vote tally , CARDINAL of the total number of voters had taken part in it .", "CARDINAL . Acting as a private individual , the Chairman of the applicant party challenged CEC Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ( the rules on the composition of electoral rolls ) and Ordinance no . CARDINAL of DATE ( the vote tally ) before ORG . He claimed that the system of preliminary voter registration , the disfranchisement of the GPE and PERSON constituencies and the presidential control of the electoral administration had infringed the constitutional principle of free and fair elections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the claim inadmissible . It reasoned that , since it was not a normative act , the disputed Ordinance could not be challenged before ORG . As to the impugned Decree , it considered that , firstly , the claimant had failed to substantiate how this normative act had infringed any of his constitutional rights . Secondly , it stated that the claimant , as a private person , did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the election , this right being reserved by LAW for the President of GPE and a specific number of MPs .", "\u201c The mandate of the previous ORG shall cease immediately after the first meeting of the newly elected ORG . \u201d", "\u201c The first sitting of the newly elected ORG shall be held DATE of the elections .

This Report was submitted by the respondent Government as part of their observations . Selected passages from its summary provide as follows :", "\u201c Conditions in GPE were once again not conducive to democratic elections . Intimidation and physical abuse of opposition supporters and journalists underlined the democratic deficit in GPE evident during this election process , effectively creating a dual standard for elections in GPE .", "The ORG administered these elections in a credible and professional manner . However , at times the ORG appeared to exceed its authority , for example , by extending legal deadlines or modifying other legal provisions through decrees . Several aspects of the election process were improved over previous elections , although some ORG decisions in the post - election period cast doubts about its impartiality .", "Voter registers were further improved and consolidated in a computerised database ... However , further efforts are needed to complete voter lists , correct remaining errors , and improve their accuracy .", "The lack of political balance on election commissions remained a source of concern . Some DECs and PECs failed to maintain appropriate distance from the ruling parties , and some local authorities interfered in the work of lower - level election commissions . President PERSON offer to reduce the number of his appointees on the DECs and PECs from CARDINAL addressed some of these concerns . However , these changes came late in the electoral process and should have been extended to the ORG . ...", "The tabulation of results at district level was marred by irregularities in a number of DECs . In some cases , election material was delivered unsealed or inadequately secured , protocols were completed or changed at the ORG level , and in CARDINAL case , the ORG members \u2018 negotiated\u2019 the results . The handling of electionrelated complaints at some DECs was also inadequate .", "An analysis of the ORG results made available by the ORG showed a number of anomalous or implausible results in a significant minority of districts .

The ORG gave an account of the tensions between the central and PERSON authorities on the eve of the repeat parliamentary election of DATE :", "\u201c The situation in the [ ORG ] remained tense , especially after a state of emergency was imposed on DATE . The state of emergency decreased civil liberties , and consequently limited even further the campaign opportunities for parties in opposition to PERSON leader PERSON . Relations between the NORP government and the PERSON authorities deteriorated following the DATE events . On DATE , President PERSON was denied entry into PERSON , where he intended to campaign .

The situation seemed to improve after an agreement was reached during a meeting between PERSON and PERSON on DATE . However , the partial implementation of the agreement did not significantly reduce the tension prior to the elections ...", "Opposition gatherings were violently suppressed or attacked by supporters of the PERSON authorities ... Offices of parties in opposition to the PERSON authorities and of non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) were ransacked , opposition activists and journalists were assaulted or abducted , and members of election commissions were intimidated . While incidents of violence and intimidation also marred previous elections in PERSON , the intensity and frequency with which they occurred this time was higher . Overall , the environment in PERSON was once again not conducive to a meaningful democratic contest during this election process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG also commented on the situation surrounding the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE to cancel the election results in the GPE and PERSON districts and call for repeat polls in those districts :", "\u201c On DATE , the ORG decided to annul the district - wide election results in GPE and PERSON and repeat polling in these CARDINAL districts on DATE . In addition , the ORG dismissed the entire membership of the CARDINAL DECs and created CARDINAL temporary groups composed of ORG members and ORG staff members to organise the repeat elections .", "On DATE , the ORG temporary groups were dispatched to PERSON but they rapidly encountered active resistance . On DATE , the temporary groups were forced to leave the PERSON territory by crowds of people . On DATE , the ORG Chairman was prevented from entering PERSON at Choloki checkpoint on the administrative border . On DATE , at a press conference , the ORG Chairman declared that for security reasons elections in GPE and PERSON would not be held on DATE . Nevertheless , the elections were not officially cancelled .", "The ORG based its decision to annul the district - wide election results in GPE and PERSON and repeat polling in these CARDINAL districts , respectively on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG .", "Prior to DATE , the ORG [ the Election Observation Mission ] attempted to clarify with the ORG Chairman whether the ORG had the authority to cancel the ORG results . During these discussions , he [ the ORG Chairman ] indicated that it was certainly a questionable issue . While ORG Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL grants the ORG the right to examine the ORG documentation , recount ballots and sum up results based on PEC protocols , the ORG does not specifically grant the ORG the authority to annul the results in an entire district .", "In fact , the ORG simply cancelled the entire district results without hearing testimony or investigating the circumstances at each ORG or establishing with any certainty if the number of votes at the annulled polling stations was sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in LAW . Furthermore , the ORG did not examine the electoral material . Elsewhere , where results were annulled this was done by DECs or local courts .", "Notwithstanding the fact that violations took place in GPE and PERSON districts , the decision to annul their results and call a repeat polling appeared inconsistent with the fact that major violations in other districts did not result in the annulling of the ORG results there . Moreover , the legal arguments used and legal basis were weak . The ORG believes that LAW relates to majoritarian elections rather than the proportional contest . The citing of this article rather than LAW ( which specifically mentions its applicability to proportional elections ) raises the question as to whether GPE is a single electoral unit for the proportional election or CARDINAL \u2018 fragments\u2019 . This issue is not adequately defined in the ORG . ...", "Should Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL be applied , then elections should also be repeated elsewhere , PERCENT of voters within a district were affected by the annulling of results . Thus , it appeared that the ORG adopted different and legally questionable procedures just for these CARDINAL districts .", "[ Election observers ] appealed the ORG decision to invalidate the election results and to set repeat elections in GPE and PERSON . In the course of the hearing it became apparent that ORG Order CARDINAL/CARDINAL was based on a questionable decision - making procedure . The ORG could not prove that it made the decision to annul the district results on a PEC - by - PEC basis . ORG upheld the ORG decision and challenged the election ORG authority to bring the case . The court decided that their appeals were [ in]admissible because their legitimate rights or interests were not damaged . [ The observers ] appealed this decision at ORG , that ruled against [ them ] in a closed session .", "The decision to dismiss the case , based on the plaintiffs not having the legal right to appeal , was highly questionable . The ORG does not clearly state that observers can appeal a ORG decision to invalidate the ORG results since there is no provision in the ORG that the ORG can overrule a ORG in such cases . Consequently , the decision of the ORG had to be questioned , not the rights of observers . The dismissal of such an important and well - founded case ... contributed to the impression that the [ electoral ] law was applied in a non - transparent and inconsistent manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of its working documents , ORG examined the systems of voter registration in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of GPE and GPE , the initial registration of voters and subsequent amendments to the electoral rolls in these GPE are automatically carried out by the authorities on the basis of mandatory domiciliary declarations by the population .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE , the compilation and modification of electoral rolls depend on the voters\u2019 individual requests to that end . NORP law even envisages individual criminal responsibility for those who fail to take the necessary steps for electoral registration .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the system is mixed . The authorities compile electoral rolls automatically , on the basis of domiciliary declarations and the general census of the population . However , all subsequent modifications to the rolls are contingent upon voters\u2019 individual declarations to that end .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( IDEA ) has identified CARDINAL broad types or models of electoral management \u2013 the independent , governmental and mixed models ( see ORG : ORG ) . The independent model of electoral management exists in those countries where elections are organised and managed by an electoral management body which is institutionally independent and autonomous from the executive branch of government , and which has , and manages , its own budget . It may be accountable to the legislature , the judiciary , or ORG , but not to the government . The governmental model exists in those countries where elections are organised and managed by the executive branch through a ministry ( such as ORG ) and/or through local authorities . In the mixed model of electoral management , there are usually CARDINAL component bodies , and dual structures exist : a policy , monitoring or supervisory body that is independent of the executive branch of government and an implementation body located within a ORG and/or local government .", "CARDINAL . According to the classification system adopted by the IDEA , among the CARDINAL member ORG there are CARDINAL countries , mostly from central and eastern LOC , which follow the independent model . There are sixteen GPE which have adopted the governmental model , and CARDINAL the mixed model . Among the thirteen Contracting States considered in the IDEA handbook , CARDINAL are classified as following the independent model ( GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , CARDINAL the governmental model ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) and CARDINAL the mixed model ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . There are no common standards among Contracting States as regards the composition of electoral commissions and the appointment of their members . As regards the authority which is competent for formally appointing the commission members , there are some countries which provide for a unique institution ( the parliament in GPE , GPE and GPE ; the Head of ORG in GPE and GPE ; and the government in GPE ) . Even in these cases , however , other institutions and actors may intervene in the nomination process . For instance , in GPE the members of the ORG are appointed after consultation with parliamentary parties and coalitions . In GPE , the members of ORG are elected on the basis of a motion submitted by the Minister of the ORG , after taking the parties\u2019 recommendations into account . In GPE , Her Majesty appoints the commission members on an address from ORG , made after consultation with the leaders of registered parties .", "CARDINAL . There are other systems which provide for a mixed appointment by different State organs , including the judiciary . In GPE , CARDINAL member is appointed by the President , CARDINAL by the government and CARDINAL by the ORG . In GPE , ORG is composed of a judge appointed by the judiciary , citizens designated by the ORG and CARDINAL specialists designated by governmental departments . The NORP electoral boards have a quasi - judicial composition , since the majority of their members are directly appointed from among sitting judges by ORG , whereas the rest are selected from among experts proposed by the political parties .", "CARDINAL . In systems which can be regarded as governmental from the standpoint of electoral management , such as GPE or GPE , the majority of the assessors of the electoral boards / committees are appointed by the chairman ( a judge in GPE ; ORG nominated by ORG in GPE ) among electors . In GPE , most of the assessors are proposed by the political parties . In GPE , electoral boards responsible for the lawfulness of the electoral lists and candidates are created within ORG and other tribunals . The difference with the countries mentioned above is that , in such countries , electoral bodies are set up for the exclusive purpose of specific elections .", "CARDINAL . In some GPE , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the electoral commissions may be classified as expertbased . In others , such as GPE , GPE or GPE , the commissions are composed of experts and representatives of political parties ( combined membership ) . The electoral legislation in GPE and GPE provides for the possibility of expanded membership of the commissions to include representatives of political parties which have submitted electoral lists .", "CARDINAL . The general trend is that decisions are taken by a simple majority ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Only in GPE ( a CARDINAL majority , except for municipal commissions ) , GPE ( a CARDINAL majority ) and GPE ( an absolute majority ) , is a qualified majority required . In GPE , if a decision can not be reached at the first meeting , then at the second meeting the decision is taken by a majority vote .", "CARDINAL . In the case of a tie , the chairman has the casting vote in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . This helps to avoid eventual obstructions to the decision - making process . By contrast , in GPE , in the event of a tie , the proposal is deemed to be rejected . The fact that a chairman with the casting vote is directly appointed by the president of the Republic or the executive government , as in GPE , is of course a relevant factor to be borne in mind for the assessment of the independence of an electoral agency . This can only be compared to the position of ORG or ORG in ORG and ORG in GPE , whose appointment depends on ORG or ORG . In both cases , the officer is the chairman of the committee and has a casting vote . By contrast , in the majority of the countries examined , the chairman is elected by the electoral commission itself ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the guarantees of election ORG independence is that persons who could be involved in an inherent conflict of interests should not be allowed to be appointed to electoral commissions , in particular registered candidates . This kind of rule can be found in the majority of GPE considered ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Apart from candidates standing for election , incompatibility requirements may apply to members of political parties or organisations nominating candidates ( GPE and GPE ) , members or employees of registered parties ( GPE ) , members of parliament , judges in ORG , servicemen in the armed forces , officers in ORG ( GPE ) , the president of the Republic , heads of administrative offices , civil servants , and mayors ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to achieve an adequate balance between political representatives in the commission , there are some systems which provide specific rules . For instance , in GPE and GPE , no political party or coalition may have a majority within the commission . In GPE , the chairman and the secretary must belong to different political parties . In GPE , the chairman and the vice - chairman of an electoral board may not be representatives of the same political party or coalition ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
