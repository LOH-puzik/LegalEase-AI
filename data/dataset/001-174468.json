NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is detained in PERSON . Having been granted legal aid , he was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of armed robbery and theft and sentenced him to twentyfive years\u2019 imprisonment . Following an appeal by ORG , the ruling on the sentence was quashed and a new sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by ORG on DATE . On DATE the ruling became final and binding .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of the appellate judgment may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was found guilty of an offence specified in LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) after having already in the past twice been found guilty of offences specified in that provision , with unconditional prison sentences being imposed on him . Thus , pursuant to the \u201c CARDINAL strikes \u201d rule embodied in that provision , he had to be sentenced to imprisonment for life .", "\u2019s situation , and other factors , such as the level of his involvement in the preparation of and attempt to commit the offence in question and his cooperation in uncovering the offence , as well as his reduced sanity and plea bargain .", "In that respect , the court of appeal found that the trial court had erred when it had accepted as fulfilling one of the conditions stipulated by LAW for the imposition of a CARDINAL - year prison sentence the fact that the applicant had used a firearm exclusively as a threat and that neither the offence in issue nor the CARDINAL earlier similar offences had attained a high degree of gravity .", "More specifically , the court of appeal observed that the fact that the applicant had committed the offence while armed constituted an element of the offence in question and held that this excluded the possibility of accepting as a mitigating circumstance the fact that the firearm had only been used as a threat .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the applicant twice availed himself of an extraordinary remedy DATE lodging an appeal on points of law with ORG . His first appeal of DATE was declared inadmissible on CARDINAL DATE . His second appeal was lodged on his behalf by a legal - aid lawyer after being appointed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his second appeal , the applicant relied in particular on PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , amending LAW as of DATE . In its amended form , this provision only allowed for the imposition of a life sentence in a situation such as his if it was necessary to ensure the effective protection of society and there was no hope that a prison sentence of DATE would sufficiently ensure the convict \u2019s rehabilitation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s second appeal , upholding the reasoning of ORG . As amendment no . PERSON . had only entered into force once the applicant \u2019s trial had been completed with final effect , it could not be relied on to improve his situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the judgments of ORG and ORG before ORG by lodging what he considered to constitute a complaint under LAW .", "He invoked mainly his right to a fair trial and the prohibition of torture , arguing that imprisonment for life was clearly a disproportionate sentence , given the circumstances of his case .", "Moreover , he contended that the higher courts\u2019 conclusions regarding the presence of any circumstances justifying the imposition of a CARDINAL - year sentence had been arbitrary , partly because they had assessed some of the relevant facts erroneously and partly because they had failed to assess some of them at all .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE a single ORG judge informed the applicant under LAW of LAW that his submission could not be dealt with as it clearly fell short of the requirements for a constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent request for the re - opening of his proceedings was dismissed by ORG on DATE and , following the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal , by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Release on parole is governed by the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL allows for release on parole where a convicted prisoner \u2019s behaviour and compliance with the obligations imposed demonstrate his or her rehabilitation and where that prisoner can be expected to behave properly .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a whole - life prisoner can be released on parole after having served CARDINAL of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , as in force until DATE , prohibited the conditional release of persons ( i ) repeatedly sentenced to life imprisonment , or ( ii ) who were sentenced to life imprisonment under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , reference to the latter category of convicts was deleted from that provision by virtue of the above - mentioned PERSON no CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In proceedings brought under file no . PL . \u00daS CARDINAL on DATE , ORG asked ORG to examine whether Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW ( as in force at that time ) were in conformity with LAW and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings in respect of the latter provision with reference to amendment no . PERSON .", "A majority of judges then concluded that LAW was not contrary to LAW . It was admitted that in a small number of cases the effects of that provision reached the limits of conformity with LAW from the viewpoint of their proportionality . Emphasis was put on the fact that the amendment which had taken effect on DATE gave judges wide discretion to take into account the particular circumstances of each case .", "In separate opinions CARDINAL judges disagreed with that conclusion . PERSON were expressed that LAW provided for disproportionate penalties . The offence of less serious robbery was referred to by way of example ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
