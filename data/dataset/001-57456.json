Before the Board met , he had been visited by its chairman and warned that it would proceed in his absence ; the records state that he understood this warning and the charges against him . It appears that he did not expressly seek either an adjournment of ORG hearing or a consultation with a solicitor beforehand ; under the then practice , a request of the latter kind would also have been unsuccessful ( ibid . ) .", "Before the ORG and the ORG , Mr. PERSON gave additional reasons for his non - attendance : firstly , having learned of the outcome of the ORG \u2019s hearing on DATE and having previous experience of such proceedings himself , he did not believe that he would receive a fair hearing and considered that his presence would be otiose ; secondly , he was feeling very ill as a result of his injuries and , on DATE , he was \" in the punishment cell ; lying on the floor ; unable to walk ; not being fed and in considerable pain \" . As regards the latter allegations , which were disputed by the ORG , the applicant had been certified by the medical officer , before both hearings , to be fit for punishment .

In a letter of DATE to a Member of ORG , the ORG Secretary maintained this decision , which he explained by reference to the practice concerning the permitted correspondents of \" category A \" prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) below ) : there was no evidence of a friendship as aforesaid between the applicant and PERSON , although he had known her for longer than some of his approved correspondents .", "Father PERSON also alleged that he had not been allowed to correspond with other friends , including another nun , PERSON .

This therefore represents the maximum period that may be forfeited under a disciplinary award .", "Under both LAW and the LAW , remission - which is seen by the authorities as part of the process for encouraging the reform of prisoners - is a discretionary measure . In practice , at the outset of his sentence every prisoner is given an estimated date for release , calculated by reference to the maximum possible remission , and he will be released on that date unless remission has been forfeited in disciplinary proceedings . Forfeiture of remission - which is not awarded solely for the most serious offences - does not have the effect of increasing the original sentence and it is the latter which continues to provide the legal basis for the detention .", "CARDINAL ORG constituting a disciplinary offence under the Rules may also amount to an offence under the criminal law . Thus , doing gross personal violence to an officer corresponds to the crime of assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Mutiny and incitement to mutiny , on the other hand , are not as such offences under the general criminal law , although the underlying facts might found a charge of , for instance , conspiracy .", "According to the Government , where the conduct amounts to both a disciplinary and a criminal offence , ORG of ORG decides on an ad hoc basis whether the matter should be referred to the police with a view to prosecution in the courts . Conduct so referred , they said , generally involved substantial violence ; other relevant factors might be the prevalence of the conduct in question within the prison , the feelings of staff and inmates , the prisoner \u2019s record and behaviour , the amount of any remission he might previously have lost and of his sentence remaining to be served , and the cost , inconvenience and security risks involved in a criminal trial .", "According to the applicants , however , an individual prison officer may himself report the matter to the police , and the Government recognised that , in any case where the police themselves decided not to prosecute , a private prosecution remained a possibility . Moreover , the same facts may , theoretically at least , give rise to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings ( see PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Where a prisoner is to be charged with an offence against discipline , the charge must be laid as soon as possible and must , in the first instance , be inquired into by the prison governor , generally not DATE following the laying of the charge ( Rule CARDINAL ) .

They may be re - appointed .", "There are lCARDINAL Boards in all and each has DATE members , who are unpaid but are reimbursed their expenses . Anyone may seek appointment but in practice most candidates are persons suggested by existing members . The main principles adopted in making appointments are to achieve a roughly equal number of magistrates and non - magistrates ; to provide members having the requisite personal qualities , interest and time ; and to ensure that membership contains a good cross - section of the population . A ORG is normally appointed for a DATE term ; there is no express statutory provision enabling the Home Secretary to dismiss a member and resignation before expiry of a term of office would , according to the Government , be required only in the most exceptional circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG A ORG duties include , in addition to inquiring into charges of disciplinary offences , satisfying itself as to the state of the premises , the administration of the prison and the treatment of inmates , hearing a prisoner \u2019s complaints or requests , directing the governor \u2019s attention to matters calling for his attention and making reports to ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In case of urgent necessity , it has power to suspend any prison officer until the decision of the ORG Secretary is known ( Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . Its members are required to visit the prison frequently , have a right of access to every part of the prison and to prison records and may interview any prisoner out of the sight and hearing of officers ( Rule CARDINAL ) . A ORG \u2019s adjudicatory functions generally account for a small proportion of its overall duties and , of the small percentage of prison disciplinary proceedings which are conducted before ORG , few concern \" especially grave offences \" .", "The various functions of ORG were examined by an independent committee set up by \" ORG \" , ORG and ORG . In its report of DATE ( \" the ORG report \" ) , this committee noted that \" Boards take their duties of adjudication very seriously \" , but that \" in spite of the efforts made to do justice it is doubtful whether it is seen to be done \" . It concluded that to be involved in the adjudication of serious offences was incompatible with the supervisory body \u2019s need to establish conspicuous independence and therefore recommended that \" the body responsible for supervision should not have a disciplinary function \" . Nevertheless , \" after careful consideration \" , the Home Secretary decided in DATE that \" the independence of ORG was compatible with their other functions \" .", "The status of ORG was also considered in the GPE case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In ORG , Lord Justice PERSON stated that \" Boards of visitors hold the balance between the governor and the internal discipline of the prison and the prisoner himself and , when sitting [ in an adjudicatory capacity ] , can be regarded as \u2018 an impartial and independent authority\u2019 \" ; for Lord Justice PERSON , a ORG \u2019s adjudicatory function \" was properly regarded as a separate and independent function , different in character from [ its ] other functions \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG When a charge of an \" especially grave offence \" is referred to a Board , its chairman must summon a special meeting at which not CARDINAL nor CARDINAL members - CARDINAL being justices of the peace - must be present ( Rule CARDINAL ) . If , after inquiring into the charge , the ORG finds the offence proved , it has to make CARDINAL of the awards mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , although the implementation thereof may be suspended .", "CARDINAL . ORG Neither LAW nor the Rules lay down a detailed code of procedure for disciplinary proceedings before ORG . However , Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) - a similar provision appears in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW - reads as follows : \" At any inquiry into a charge against a prisoner he shall be given a full opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case . \"", "The procedure used to be arranged as a matter of practice . Since DATE ORG have been issued by ORG of ORG with a booklet entitled \" Procedure for the Conduct of an Adjudication by a Board of Visitors \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG Proceedings before ORG are initiated by means of a report by a prison officer to the governor containing details of the alleged offence . The prisoner will receive a \" notice of report \" , stating the alleged offence and the time , date and place thereof , and may reply to the charge in writing . He will also be given a form , which has no statutory force , outlining the procedure which will be followed when he appears before ORG : he will be asked to plead to the charge and may question witnesses in support of the charge , request that witnesses on his behalf be heard and himself give evidence or make his defence . The hearing takes place in private within the prison and the ORG \u2019s decision is pronounced under the same conditions .", "The Rules themselves contain no specific provision as regards legal advice about , or legal representation at , an adjudication before a ORG . Under the practice followed prior to DATE , a prisoner would not have been granted leave to seek legal advice before the hearing . Furthermore , ORG held in PERSON v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) that although a ORG had to observe the requirements of natural justice and act fairly in disciplinary proceedings , a prisoner was not entitled to legal representation thereat . However , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG held that although there is no absolute entitlement to such representation , a ORG does have a discretion to allow it . Furthermore , the prisoner has a right to require that that discretion be exercised and that his request for representation be properly considered on its merits ; if the ORG fails to exercise its discretion properly , its decision must be quashed . Mr. Justice PERSON added that in most , if not all , cases involving a charge of mutiny ORG , properly directing itself , could reasonably decide not to allow legal representation .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , in the GPE case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG had to consider , for reasons of jurisdiction , whether disciplinary proceedings before a ORG were a \" criminal cause or matter \" , within the meaning of the relevant legislation . It answered this question in the negative .", "Lord Justice PERSON based his decision on the fact that the charges heard by ORG were not \" criminal \" , that is charges \" of an offence against public law \" , and that ORG was not a court of criminal jurisdiction .", "Lord Justice PERSON considered that the ORG \u2019s proceedings possessed some of the attributes of a criminal cause or matter ( for example , accusation , inquiry , adjudication and possible punitive consequences ) but lacked the essential characteristic , namely a penal proceeding for the infraction of a requirement relating to the enforcement and preservation of public law and order . In determining the nature of proceedings , account also had to be taken of their context and overall objective . Although an offence under the Rules might coincide with a crime under the general law and lead to a measure corresponding to a penalty or punishment , this did not transform the ORG \u2019s adjudication into a criminal cause or matter . It was essentially a domestic disciplinary proceeding , which did not purport to deal with misconduct in its relation to the public law or the public interest and was designed and pursued with the limited objective of maintaining order within the confines of a prison . It would also be illogical and anomalous to regard as a criminal cause or matter proceedings arising from an offence under the Rules which did not amount to a criminal offence under the general law .", "However , in NORP v. ORG , ex parte DATE , Mr. Justice McCullough , in his judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG , DATE ) , referred to the \" close similarity \" between an accusation of breach of the Rules and an accusation of a criminal offence : each was followed by an adjudication and might lead to consequences of a punitive character , for example , in the former case , forfeiture of remission . Although prison disciplinary offences were offences against a private code , they were also \" penal \" ; in principle , the relevant Rules should be construed no more harshly against a prisoner than would be appropriate were the offences criminal . Again , in the GPE case ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) it was conceded on behalf of ORG that the standard of proof to be applied in disciplinary adjudications was a criminal one .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under Rule CARDINAL , disciplinary awards made by ORG may be remitted or mitigated by the Home Secretary or , subject to his directions , by ORG itself . Procedures and criteria for the restoration of forfeited remission of sentence are laid down in Circular Instruction CARDINAL/CARDINAL issued by the Minister : basically , the prisoner must show a significant improvement indicative of a genuine change of attitude , and the power to restore is not to be used merely to modify an award which is subsequently thought excessive or open to doubt .", "Applications for remission or mitigation of awards are normally made in the first instance to ORG itself . Its decision may be the subject of a petition by the prisoner to the ORG Secretary . Under Rule CARDINAL , every prisoner has to be provided on or shortly after his reception into prison with information in writing about , inter alia , the proper method of making petitions .", "In the FAC case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the members of ORG expressed the view that a petition under Rule CARDINAL was not to be regarded as a formal appeal ; it was noted , amongst other things , that the ORG Secretary was not empowered to quash ORG finding of guilt .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( a ) The question whether the LANGUAGE courts have jurisdiction to review disciplinary proceedings before ORG was considered in NORP v. Hull ORG , ex parte PERSON and others . In that case , application was made for orders of certiorari to quash , on the ground of failure to observe the rules of natural justice , certain decisions imposing disciplinary awards , taken by a ORG in DATE .", "( b ) In a judgment of DATE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG held that although a ORG was in the nature of a judicial body under a duty to act judicially , it was not subject to control by way of certiorari , a remedy which did not extend to private disciplinary proceedings in a closed body enjoying its own form of discipline and rules . It was stressed that a ORG had an \" intimate relationship \" with the prison and , when adjudicating , was part of the latter \u2019s disciplinary machinery .", "( c ) Notice of appeal against this decision was served on DATE . ORG allowed the appeal in its judgment of DATE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . It held that there was no rule of law that the courts were to abdicate jurisdiction merely because the proceedings under review were of an internal disciplinary character . There was no binding authority as to whether certiorari would lie against disciplinary decisions of ORG and the question had to be decided in the light of public policy . A ORG \u2019s disciplinary functions were separate and independent from its other functions . When hearing disciplinary charges it was not imposing summary discipline as part of DATE to day administration of the prison but was instead an independent body which could only punish a prisoner after a formalised inquiry and/or hearing . In doing so it was exercising a judicial function and its decisions were therefore subject to control by the courts by certiorari in appropriate cases . However , the remedy was discretionary and relief would be granted only where there had been a failure to act fairly , having regard to all the circumstances and such unfairness had given rise to a substantial , as distinct from a trivial or merely technical , injustice .", "CARDINAL ORG The case was then remitted to ORG which , by judgment of DATE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , quashed certain of the decisions taken by ORG . ORG observed that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and Rule DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were declaratory of the basic rule of natural justice that every party to a controversy had a right to a fair hearing ; although , on the facts , this rule had not been observed as regards the quashed decisions , there was nothing in the ORG \u2019s procedure in general to which any objection could properly be taken .", "ORG pointed out that the right to a fair hearing before a ORG included the right to call evidence ; the chairman \u2019s power to refuse to allow a prisoner to call witnesses had to be exercised reasonably , in good faith and on proper grounds ( which would not include mere administrative convenience ) . Further , the prisoner must also have a sufficient opportunity to deal with the evidence given against him , which might necessitate giving him the opportunity to cross - examine witnesses whose evidence was initially before ORG in hearsay form .", "CARDINAL . ORG Applications for certiorari must in principle be made within a prescribed time - limit running from the date of the decision challenged : in DATE , the time - limit was DATE ; since DATE , it has been DATE . Leave may be granted to apply out of time ; this is a matter for the court \u2019s discretion but experience shows that if a late application is not opposed by ORG , leave will not be refused .", "Where decisions taken by ORG in disciplinary proceedings are quashed by a court , the charges in question may subsequently be the subject of a fresh adjudication by a differently constituted Board .", "CARDINAL . ORG The question of ORG correspondence and visits is dealt with in a number of the Rules .", "With a view to securing uniformity of practice throughout prison establishments , the ORG Secretary also issues to prison governors management guides or directives in the form of ORG ( \" Orders \" ) and ORG ( \" Instructions \" ) . Unless otherwise authorised , governors are required to comply with these directives , but they do not have , or purport to have , the force of law . As far as correspondence and visits are concerned , the directives are intended to serve a dual function : on the one hand , to circumscribe the discretion conferred on governors by the Rules , and , on the other , to state the manner in which the ORG Secretary has decided in certain respects to exercise his own discretionary powers thereunder .", "Prior to DATE , the directives in question were made available to Members of both ORG for reference but not to the public or prisoners , although the latter received , by means of cell cards , information about certain aspects of the control of correspondence and visits .", "CARDINAL . ORG The basic Rules on correspondence and visits , which were in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case , included the following :", "\" CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) The Secretary of ORG may , with a view to securing discipline and good order or the prevention of crime or in the interests of any persons , impose restrictions , either generally or in a particular case , upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons .", "( CARDINAL ) Except as provided by statute or these Rules , a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any outside person , or that person with him , without the leave of the Secretary of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) Except as provided by these Rules , every letter or communication to or from a prisoner may be read or examined by the governor or an officer deputed by him , and the governor may , at his discretion , stop any letter or communication on the ground that its contents are objectionable or that it is of inordinate length .", "( CARDINAL ) Every visit to a prisoner shall take place within the sight of an officer , unless the Secretary of ORG otherwise directs .", "( CARDINAL ) Except as provided by these Rules , every visit to a prisoner shall take place within the hearing of an officer , unless the Secretary of ORG otherwise directs .", "( CARDINAL ) The Secretary of ORG may give directions , generally or in relation to any visit or class of visits , concerning DATE and times when prisoners may be visited . \"", "\" CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) A prisoner shall not be entitled under [ Rule CARDINAL ] \" - which regulates the quantity of correspondence and visits - \" to communicate with any person in connection with any legal or other business , or with any person other than a relative or friend , except with the leave of the Secretary of ORG . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The foregoing Rules were supplemented or modified , either by Orders or Instructions or by further Rules , in a number of respects , including the following .", "( a ) Under Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) , as supplemented by LAW , prisoners had to seek ORG leave to correspond with or be visited by any person other than a close relation ; they were , however , also normally allowed , without the necessity to seek such leave , to correspond with or be visited by other relatives or existing friends , but the governor could forbid such correspondence or visits on grounds of security or good order and discipline or in the interests of the prevention or discouragement of crime . Governors had a discretion to allow communications with certain other persons not personally known to the prisoner before he came into custody . However , it would have been unlikely that such discretion would have been exercised in favour of \" category A \" prisoners , such as Mr. PERSON and Father PERSON ; this is the security category reserved for persons who , if they escaped , would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or to the security of the ORG .", "( b ) With effect from DATE , the extent of the control of correspondence relating to civil or criminal proceedings to which the prisoner is already a party was limited by Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , which reads :", "\" A prisoner who is a party to any legal proceedings may correspond with his legal adviser in connection with the proceedings and unless the Governor has reason to suppose that any such correspondence contains matter not relating to the proceedings it shall not be read or stopped under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of these Rules . \"", "( c ) Until DATE , inmates had to petition the ORG Secretary for permission to seek advice about , or give instructions for , the institution of civil proceedings ( with the exception of certain divorce cases ) . On DATE , Instruction CARDINAL/CARDINAL introduced changes that were subsequently reflected in Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , which came into operation on DATE and reads :", "\" Subject to any directions of the Secretary of ORG , a prisoner may correspond with a solicitor for the purpose of obtaining legal advice concerning any cause of action in relation to which the prisoner may become a party to civil proceedings or for the purpose of instructing the solicitor to issue such proceedings . \"", "Instruction CARDINAL/CARDINAL - and subsequently Order CARDINALA - further provided , inter alia , that :", "( i ) the inmate had to have sought a solicitor \u2019s advice before he would be permitted to institute proceedings ;", "( ii ) at each stage a written application , with reasons , had first to be made to the prison governor for the necessary facilities , which could take the form of a letter or a visit ; they had to be granted immediately , except that , in the case of prospective civil proceedings against ORG ( or any servant thereof ) \" arising out of or in connexion with \" the imprisonment , the \" prior ventilation rule \" generally applied .", "The effect of the last - mentioned rule was that the prisoner would not be granted facilities to obtain legal advice , by correspondence or at a visit , about such proceedings unless and until he had raised his complaint through the normal internal channels ( petition to the ORG Secretary , or application to ORG , a visiting officer of the Home Secretary or the prison governor ) and been given a definitive reply , whether favourable or not .", "( d ) Visits by legal advisers were subject to the following special Rule :", "\" CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) The legal adviser of a prisoner in any legal proceedings , civil or criminal , to which the prisoner is a party shall be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing him in connection with those proceedings , and may do so out of hearing but in the sight of an officer .", "( CARDINAL ) A prisoner \u2019s legal adviser may , with the leave of the Secretary of ORG , interview the prisoner in connection with any other legal business in the sight and hearing of an officer . \"", "Disciplinary proceedings before a ORG were not considered by the authorities to be \" legal proceedings \" for the purposes of the Rules , notably Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and Rule CARDINAL ) CARDINAL .", "( e ) There were special , less strict , provisions concerning applications to the Commission ( Order CARDINALB CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Prior to CARDINAL DATE , both Orders and Instructions contained , in addition to directives on the control of ORG correspondence and visits , internal rules and guidance of a general nature concerning DATE to day administration of the prison . With effect from DATE , the directives on correspondence and visits were substantially revised . In addition , revised Orders on those subjects have been published in their entirety , matters of a management or administrative nature which do not concern a prisoner \u2019s entitlement to correspond or receive visits and were considered inappropriate for publication having been eliminated from the Orders and embodied in Instructions . The Rules themselves have not been amended , although the Government have indicated that as soon as practicable Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) would be repealed in so far as it affected correspondence .", "CARDINAL . ORG So far as is material to the present case , the earlier position is now modified in the following respects .", "( a ) The new Orders ( nos . CARDINALBCARDINAL - CARDINALBCARDINAL ) state that , with certain exceptions , a prisoner may correspond with any person or organisation , provided always that the regulations on the contents of correspondence and the \" simultaneous ventilation rule \" are observed .", "( b ) The \" simultaneous ventilation rule \" , set out in LAW j , has taken the place of the \" prior ventilation rule \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) in fine above ) . Legal advice concerning civil proceedings in respect of prison treatment may now be obtained as soon as the prisoner has raised his complaint through the prescribed procedures ; he no longer has to await the outcome of the internal inquiry .", "( c ) Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) above ) continues to apply to visits by a legal adviser concerning legal proceedings to which the prisoner is already a party . Under new Order CARDINALACARDINAL , other visits by a legal adviser acting in a professional capacity are also now allowed out of the hearing of a prison officer , provided the subject to be discussed is disclosed to the governor in advance and does not offend against the restrictions on correspondence with legal advisers set out in new LAW ( including the \" simultaneous ventilation rule \" ) . If the subject to be discussed is not disclosed , the visit will still be allowed but will be in the hearing of an officer .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW , responsibility for the health of prisoners is placed on the prison medical officer ; he has discretion to call in another medical practitioner .", "The prison authorities will not generally allow a convicted prisoner to be examined by an outside doctor ( other than one called in as aforesaid ) unless the prisoner is a party to legal proceedings , in which event Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) applies . This Rule provides :", "\" Subject to any directions given in the particular case by the Secretary of ORG , a registered medical practitioner selected by or on behalf of [ a prisoner who is party to any legal proceedings ] shall be afforded reasonable facilities for examining him in connection with the proceedings , and may do so out of hearing but in the sight of an officer . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG An inmate who is aggrieved by a decision concerning his correspondence or visits may complain to the prison governor , ORG or a visiting officer of the Home Secretary or he may petition the Home Secretary himself . A prisoner may ventilate his complaint through any or all of these channels and , if CARDINAL is utilised , in such sequence as he wishes .", "CARDINAL . As far as ORG is concerned , it may examine the compatibility of the decision complained of with the Rules and the Home Secretary \u2019s directives . It will draw the governor \u2019s attention to any irregularity , or report to the Home Secretary ; although its powers are advisory in character , its advice will be implemented save in exceptional circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Inmates have the right to submit petitions to the ORG Secretary about any matter , for example to seek a permission which the local prison management is not empowered to grant or has refused , or to complain of prison treatment .", "On a petition being made by a prisoner , complaining of a decision of the prison authorities concerning his correspondence or visits , the ORG Secretary would , if he concluded that the relevant Orders had not been properly interpreted or applied by the prison authorities , issue directions to them to secure compliance . Although it is possible for him to depart from the Orders in particular cases , this is likely to occur only rarely , if at all , since their very purpose is to ensure uniformity of practice .", "Prior to DATE , directives concerning the submission of petitions were contained in Orders CARDINAL l-CARDINAL . It was , in particular , provided that , with certain exceptions , a prisoner could not petition if and so long as he was awaiting a reply to an earlier petition ( Order CARDINALB CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "With effect from DATE , the provisions of LAW ( CARDINAL ) have been relaxed by new Orders CARDINALCCARDINAL and CARDINALClO. A further petition may now be submitted if DATE has elapsed since the submission of the previous petition . Moreover , even though an earlier petition be outstanding , a prisoner may petition forthwith on certain specified matters , including interferences with his correspondence but not restrictions on his visits .", "CARDINAL . Complaints concerning the control of correspondence or visits may also , on certain conditions , be raised with the Parliamentary Commissioner for ORG ( the ORG ) . However , his jurisdiction does not extend to restrictions effected pursuant to a correct exercise of a discretion conferred by the ORG or the Home Secretary \u2019s directives ; moreover , the ORG can not grant direct relief since he is limited to reporting the results of his investigation to a Member of ORG , the authority concerned and , in certain circumstances , each ORG of ORG ( sections CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The exercise by the prison authorities of their powers under the Rules to control correspondence and visits is subject to the supervisory control of the LANGUAGE courts by way of proceedings for judicial review . In the exercise of this jurisdiction the courts will intervene to secure compliance by the prison authorities with the Rules in so far as they confer on prisoners an entitlement to correspond or receive visits ( for example , Rules CARDINAL(A ) CARDINAL and DATE ( CARDINAL ) ; see paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraphs ( b ) and ( d ) , above ) , and to ensure that the discretion conferred on the authorities by the Rules is not exercised arbitrarily or unreasonably , in bad faith , for an improper motive or in an ultra vires manner .", "The ORG notes in this context that in PERSON v.
