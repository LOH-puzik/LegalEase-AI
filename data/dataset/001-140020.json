The applicant is an NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE on DATE . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) he stated the following . In GPE , he had worked with persons , connected to different universities , who were known to oppose the regime . He had mainly worked on creating and publishing web pages . He and CARDINAL of the other persons had been arrested in DATE . He had been released after TIME and then hospitalised for DATE due to high blood pressure . Before the elections on DATE , the applicant had worked with ORG , who had supported PERSON for the presidential position , by spreading their message via the Internet . DATE before the elections , he and his friends had been arrested , questioned and detained in the polling station TIME . After the elections , the applicant had participated in demonstrations and other activities . He had been arrested once again in DATE and imprisoned for DATE . In DATE he had been taken before ORG , which had released him after DATE on condition that he cooperate with the authorities and spy on his friends . He had agreed to the demands and given his business premises as a guarantee . He had also assured them that he would not participate in any demonstrations and that he would respond to their summons . Following his release in a park , he had found that his business LOC had been searched . He had kept politically sensitive material there , which the authorities must have noticed , and his passport and other documents were gone . On DATE the applicant had been summoned to appear before ORG . He had contacted a friend who , in turn , had obtained the help of a smuggler to enable him to leave the country . He had converted to NORP after coming to GPE . The applicant submitted , inter alia , a summons from ORG which stated that he should present himself at PERSON prison in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . It first stated that the applicant had not proven his identity but that he had made it and his citizenship probable . Turning to the applicant \u2019s asylum story , ORG held that participation in demonstrations or affiliation with ORG could not , of itself , give rise to a risk of persecution , ill - treatment or punishment on return to GPE . ORG noted that the applicant had changed his story in some parts during the proceedings ; in particular , he had changed his statements concerning how many times he had been arrested . Furthermore , he had not been able to name the park where he had been released . Thus , the ORG found reason to question whether he had been arrested at all . ORG further considered that the applicant \u2019s political activities had been limited . After the questioning in DATE and until the elections in DATE , he had been able to continue working with the web pages that contained the critical material , even though the authorities at this time were allegedly aware of his activities . For these reasons , the ORG found that the applicant could not have been of interest to the authorities on account of his activities and the material he had in his possession . As to the applicant \u2019s conversion to ORG , the ORG noted that he had not submitted a baptism certificate and that he had initially been unwilling to refer to his religious affiliation as grounds for asylum since this , he claimed , was a private matter . In these circumstances , it was not plausible that the applicant would risk persecution in GPE due to his religious affiliation . In conclusion , the ORG found that the applicant had not shown that he was in need of protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding the following . The reason why , at first , he had not wanted to refer to his religious affiliation was that he had not wanted to trivialise the seriousness of his belief . He submitted a baptism certificate to the court . During the oral hearing , the applicant added that his computer had been taken from his business LOC while he was in prison . Material that was critical of the regime was stored on his computer , since he had visited some web pages and had received caricature drawings via email . Therefore , there was enough evidence to prove that he was an opponent of the system . The summons to appear before ORG was submitted to ORG . The applicant had not been summoned again and his family had not been targeted , or at least they had had no problems with which they wanted to burden him . He did not claim that his conversion constituted grounds for asylum but contended that it would clearly create problems for him if he had to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It did not question the applicant \u2019s story or that the uncertainties that had been pointed out by ORG had been satisfactorily explained . However , as regards the summons to ORG which had been submitted to ORG , the court found that , regardless of the authenticity of the document , it could not of itself substantiate a need for protection for the applicant . This was because the document was merely a summons and because no reason was given as to why the applicant should present himself at PERSON prison . Turning to the applicant \u2019s asylum story , the court considered that the information concerning his political activities had been vague and lacked details . The applicant had only stated that he had participated in the campaign for the opposition before the elections in DATE by joining demonstrations and having contact with students and the student movement in order to help them with their web pages . Moreover , the applicant had stated that the material he had had in his possession when he was questioned in DATE had not differed from the material he had in DATE . These circumstances , together with the fact that he had not been summoned again to appear before ORG after DATE and that his family had not been targeted , made the court doubt that his political activities had been of such a nature and extent to have resulted in the consequences he had alleged . The court found that the applicant had exaggerated the importance of his political activities and their consequences and therefore also the authorities\u2019 interest in him . For these reasons , the court considered that the applicant had not made out that the NORP authorities had a special interest in him and , thus , he was not in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant requested ORG to stay the enforcement of his expulsion and to reconsider its previous decision due to new circumstances . He stated , inter alia , that the act of converting from ORG to another religion was punishable by death in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that no new circumstances had been presented which could justify staying the enforcement of the applicant \u2019s expulsion order or granting him a residence permit . ORG noted that the applicant had , in the previous proceedings , stated that he had been baptised by a NORP church and that he had converted to NORP . ORG also noted that the applicant had stated that his conversion was a personal matter which he did not wish to invoke as a ground for asylum . In the ORG \u2019s view , it was remarkable that the applicant now raised the question of conversion when he had been given the chance to elaborate on it during the oral hearing before ORG but had declined to do so .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It observed that the authorities had already been aware of the applicant \u2019s conversion in the previous proceedings . Therefore , the conversion could not be considered as a \u201c new circumstance \u201d . The fact that the applicant had previously chosen not to invoke the conversion as a ground for asylum did not change the court \u2019s assessment in this regard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG and requested it to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG in order to stay the enforcement of his expulsion . He stated that he had been active against the regime in GPE prior to , and during , the presidential elections in DATE . More importantly , he had converted to NORP DATE . The conversion had taken place prior to any decisions in his asylum proceedings . Conversion from ORG to another religion or faith was harshly punished by the NORP system and society .", "CARDINAL . In support of his claims the applicant submitted , inter alia , a copy of a certificate , dated DATE , in which a pastor and a congregation member stated that they had first met the applicant in DATE , that he had converted from ORG to NORP and that he had been a member of their congregation since DATE . They also stated that their church services were broadcast on the Internet , meaning that anyone could have access to the transmissions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
