On DATE the ORG ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) , on the basis of evidence obtained by ORG ( Komenda PERSON ) from ORG in GPE , opened an investigation against persons unknown into the circumstances of an attempt to obtain a loan of MONEY ( ORG ) by false pretences . On DATE the prosecutor laid charges against CARDINAL persons of having attempted to forge bank guarantees and fraudulently to seize public property .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the ORG charged the applicant with forgery and attempting to obtain a loan of CARDINAL by false pretences , committed together with CARDINAL other persons , and detained him on remand on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG ( Prokurator Wojew\u00f3dzki ) took over the investigation from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE respectively , both the applicant and his defence counsel appealed against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . The other suspects lodged similar appeals at about the same time . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) upheld all the detention orders .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the investigating prosecutor ordered that evidence be obtained from an expert in graphology , an expert in financial and banking matters , as well as from a psychiatrist and a psychologist . On DATE the prosecutor issued a letter of request to the NORP authorities , asking them to hear evidence from certain witnesses residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , ORG presented , in writing , detailed reasons for the charges laid against him . The prosecutor maintained , in particular , that those charges were based on abundant evidence , in particular in the form of bank documents and testimonies of the applicant \u2019s co - suspects . In consequence and in the light of the material collected at this stage , the prosecution considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant and his co - suspects had forged CARDINAL provisional bank guarantees and CARDINAL final bank guarantees in order to obtain a loan of USD MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered that the charges laid against the applicant in other criminal proceedings instituted against him by ORG be joined in the same criminal proceedings and , accordingly , referred the latter case to the investigating prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an application by ORG , the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s and his co - suspects\u2019 detention until DATE . On DATE , ruling on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) upheld the first - instance decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had asked ORG to release him or to vary the measure imposed on him by replacing detention by bail or police supervision . That application was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the ORG to release him on bail . He asserted that his detention was putting a severe strain on his family . In particular , his minor daughter had recently been examined by psychiatrists and it had been found that the separation from her father had seriously affected her mental state . He also submitted that his daughter was suffering from dyslexia and that her mental state had been rapidly worsening during DATE . The relevant facts were confirmed by a report made by a psychologist on DATE . Furthermore , the applicant stressed that there was no risk of his absconding and that the proper conduct of the proceedings could be secured by bail . On CARDINAL DATE the application was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ruling on an application made by ORG , the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The applicant and his defence counsel appealed against this decision on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE respectively . ORG dismissed their appeals on an unknown date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further application for release with the Pozna\u0144 Regional Prosecutor . It was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE . The relevant decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel applied to ORG to have the applicant released in view of the fact that his wife was ill and was to be admitted to hospital . He submitted a medical certificate . On DATE the prosecutor ordered that evidence be obtained from a medical expert in order to define the nature of the wife \u2019s illness and to confirm whether her state of health required treatment in hospital .", "CARDINAL . Later , on DATE and DATE , the applicant again asked the prosecutor to release him on bail . He maintained that on account of his long - lasting separation from his family both his daughter and wife were suffering from serious neurosis and depression .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ruling on an application made by ORG on an unknown date in DATE , ORG had prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . On DATE the ORG , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , upheld that decision in view of the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and of their serious nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG had completed the investigation . On DATE he lodged a bill of indictment with the ORG . The applicant \u2019s applications for release of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE and of DATE were referred to that court together with the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical expert submitted a report stating that the applicant \u2019s wife was suffering from neurasthenia resulting from her family situation . On DATE the ORG , after considering that report , dismissed all the CARDINAL above - mentioned applications , holding that the applicant \u2019s detention should continue . The court based its decision on the fact that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the serious nature of those offences . It also found that the applicant \u2019s family situation did not militate against his continuing detention and that there were no grounds on which to release the applicant , as defined in LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE , submitting , among other things , that the mere suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged could no longer suffice to justify his excessively long detention and that such reasoning showed that the court had breached the principle of the presumption of innocence . He stressed that CARDINAL of his co - defendants had already been released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed his appeal , holding that the lower court \u2019s findings had not concerned the question of the applicant \u2019s guilt but the likelihood that he had committed the offences in question . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the CARDINAL of his co - defendants had been released and stressed that that could not be a factor militating in favour of releasing him . Furthermore , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s detention should continue because of the serious nature of the charges laid against him and the fact that he had acted in an organised group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made yet another application for release on bail , submitting that his family situation was critical , especially as the mental state of his wife and daughter had markedly worsened . On DATE the court dismissed his application , finding that even though the applicant \u2019s detention was indeed putting a severe strain on his family , the serious nature of the charges laid against him justified his detention .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant attempted to commit suicide by swallowing CARDINAL tablets of the sedative \u201c Relanium\u201d[diazepam ] . On DATE a psychiatrist examined him in prison and found that he was suffering from depression that resulted from his being held in detention and from his prolonged separation from his family .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unspecified date , the ORG scheduled the trial for DATE and DATE . However , on CARDINAL DATE both hearings were cancelled because the presiding judge was ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant and his defence counsel lodged further applications for release , still relying on the difficult situation of the applicant \u2019s family and , in particular , on the fact that the applicant \u2019s minor daughter was in need of treatment in hospital . On DATE the ORG ordered that evidence from medical experts from ORG be obtained to determine the child \u2019s condition . The experts submitted their report on DATE . The court dismissed the application on DATE . The applicant appealed . ORG upheld the first - instance decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG held a hearing but decided not to examine the case on the merits and remitted it to ORG . It ordered that a further investigation be carried out . On DATE , on the parties\u2019 appeals , ORG quashed that decision and ordered the lower court to deal with the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the applicant unsuccessfully asked the court to release him on bail . The relevant decision was upheld on appeal on DATE . Subsequently , on CARDINAL and DATE and on a further unknown date , the applicant made similar applications . They all were dismissed on CARDINAL DATE at first instance and , on appeal , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again asked the ORG to release him on bail in view of his family situation . He also submitted that the criminal proceedings against him were not progressing with the requisite expedience . On DATE the court dismissed the application on the ground that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question acting in an organised group . It attached considerable importance to the fact that the applicant had attempted to obtain a very substantial loan by false pretences . The court acknowledged , however , that his detention , which at the material time had exceeded DATE , had lasted for a long time . Yet in the court \u2019s opinion , that fact did not in itself change the reasons given to justify his being held in custody . The applicant appealed against that decision . The appeal was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed another application for release made by the applicant on DATE . That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing . The court did not deal with the merits of the case and adjourned the trial to DATE .", "During that hearing the applicant and one of his co - defendants asked for release . The court released the applicant and his co - defendant with a condition that they submit to police supervision and ordered the applicant to surrender his passport . The court further observed that at the material time the length of their detention was DATE and that it was not desirable to hold them in custody , especially as the proceedings had to be adjourned for DATE . The court found that there was no risk of collusion and that police supervision would be sufficient to secure the proper conduct of the trial . On DATE , on the Pozna\u0144 Regional Prosecutor \u2019s appeal , ORG upheld the first - instance decision and the reasons given for it .", "CARDINAL . Later , the court listed CARDINAL hearings for DATE and DATE . Those hearings were cancelled ; the first as one of the defence lawyers had failed to appear , the second because another defence lawyer asked the court to give him extra time to study documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court held the first hearing on the merits . On CARDINAL and DATE the trial continued . The court heard evidence from several witnesses called by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was listed for DATE but subsequently cancelled since certain lay and expert witnesses had failed to appear . During the hearing of DATE the court heard evidence from CARDINAL witness . On DATE the court heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses called by the defence and adjourned the trial because several other witnesses had failed to appear . The court fined those witnesses , considering that they had not supplied any satisfactory explanation to justify their absence . The next hearing was listed for DATE ; during that hearing the court heard evidence from CARDINAL witness and ordered that evidence from experts be heard at the next hearing , scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court did not hear evidence from experts because CARDINAL of them had in the meantime died . For that reason , the trial was adjourned sine die . At that hearing , the court lifted the order to surrender the applicant \u2019s passport . It considered that it could not be said that in the course of the trial the applicant had obstructed its conduct and held that at the current stage of the proceedings there was no danger of his absconding or attempting to tamper with the process of obtaining evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , maintaining that no hearing on the merits had been held in his case since DATE , complained to the ORG ( PERSON ) about the length of the proceedings and asked him to intervene on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s trial was to restart on DATE but was postponed to DATE because the presiding judge was ill . On the latter date the court adjourned the trial since CARDINAL of the co - defendants had failed to appear . During the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the court heard evidence from an expert and CARDINAL witness but adjourned the trial to DATE . On DATE the court once again adjourned the trial because a witness had been absent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing and heard evidence from CARDINAL witness . It then postponed the trial to DATE . On the latter date it adjourned the trial sine die , considering that evidence from an expert in international banking transactions needed to be obtained . The trial court did , however , encounter certain difficulties in finding a suitable expert . Eventually , in DATE , the presiding judge appointed PERSON , who assured the court that he would prepare the relevant report by DATE . Yet as that report was in effect submitted to the court \u2019s registry on DATE and the expert could not appear before the court at a hearing listed for CARDINAL DATE , the court postponed the trial to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the above - mentioned date the trial was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE because PERSON , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , had not appeared before the court . The police informed the court that PERSON had apparently left GPE together with his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the court to severe the charges against PERSON and to proceed with the trial . The court made an order to that effect and , at the same hearing , heard evidence from an expert .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was listed for DATE . At that hearing , the applicant produced certain documents from DATE and asked the court to obtain evidence from an expert in graphology . The court granted his application and appointed the expert on DATE , instructing him to prepare the report by DATE .", "The report was submitted to the court \u2019s registry on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After obtaining the report and serving its copies on the parties , ORG ( PERSON ) set the date for the parties\u2019 final submissions for DATE . On DATE it gave judgment . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . All parties to the proceedings except for CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants appealed .", "CARDINAL . The Pozna\u0144 Court of Appeal heard appeals on CARDINAL DATE . It quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case .
