As the defendant failed to deposit the amount required , the enforcement proceedings continued with the drawing up an inventory of his belongings . Despite the court \u2019s orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE requesting the defendant to surrender certain movable assets to bailiffs , it appears that no items were seized or sold by the enforcement authorities .

With reference to the DATE judgment , it ordered the applicant to cover PERCENT of the expenses for the improvement works . It established , inter alia , that the applicant had not deposited , as ordered , his part of the expenses with the court , but with the construction company , which had not released him from the obligation established by the DATE judgment . It further stated that the applicant , after having realised that the defendant had constructed part of the wall , should have withdrawn his deposit from the construction company . Finally , it concluded that the applicant should have deposited the money with the court and that he should have required the court to order the construction company to build the wall . The part of expenses to be borne by the defendant was to be secured by an inventory and sale of the latter \u2019s belongings . On DATE the ORG confirmed that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court ordered the applicant to deposit money equivalent to PERCENT of the cost of improving the wall under threat of suspension of the proceedings .
