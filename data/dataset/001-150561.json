NORP The applicant , Ms Wiktoria Strzelecka , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed a lease contract with ORG , \u201c ORG \u201d ( \u201c Towarzystwo Budownictwa Spo\u0142ecznego \u201d ) concerning a CARDINAL - room flat located in GPE . The applicant knew the flat as it had been rented until then by her son - in - law . The flat measured QUANTITY and the applicant was the only tenant . The applicant was to pay rent in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The building in which the applicant \u2019s flat was located was owned by GPE but managed by the ORG , a legal entity designed to provide low - rent housing to households of modest means and financed by the ORG - owned ORG ( PERSON ) . From DATE the applicant \u2019s flat was managed by another company . The Government submitted that it had never been considered as social housing but as low - rent accommodation for the less well - off .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s rent , which included central heating , cold water and other charges , was increased on several occasions , and presently amounts to ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been paying the rent irregularly , apparently contesting the amount due for central heating , as the flat was always cold because of the poor state of the windows . Moreover , her heating costs increased as she had refused to install indicators of actual consumption of heat on her radiators . After DATE she accumulated substantial debt . In DATE the ORG obtained a court judgment against the applicant , and her granddaughter who was living with her , ordering them to pay maintenance charges . It appears that the court bailiff seized part of the applicant \u2019s pension in execution of this order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE agreed to cancel the applicant \u2019s debt in the amount of ORG provided that the applicant continued to pay DATE rent . Afterwards another debt of ORG was not cancelled because the applicant had failed to comply with one of the conditions for cancellation that is to continue paying the maintenance in full . In DATE the municipality again negotiated with the applicant to cancel her debts upon the condition of her payment of the rent in full in DATE . The municipality agreed to cancel PERCENT of overdue interest and PERCENT of the main debt . The remainder of the applicant \u2019s debt of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL was spread into CARDINAL payments of PLN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been receiving a DATE housing benefit in an amount which started at FAC and recently reached ORG CARDINAL . This benefit , designed to help cover heating costs during DATE , was paid directly to the company managing the building . It was paid on the basis of administrative decisions which covered period from DATE to DATE . It appears that since DATE the applicant has been receiving the benefit without interruption .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has repeatedly complained to the ORG , and later to the municipality , that the state of the flat was unsatisfactory . She submitted that the windows were very old and poor fitted , and she could not open or close them .", "CARDINAL . DATE the ORG had acknowledged that the windows needed to be changed . However , it has been postponing the works due to the applicant \u2019s non - payment of her debt .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant lodged a civil action against the ORG in which she sought payment and to be allocated another flat .", "CARDINAL . As part of the proceedings an expert opinion was ordered . The opinion submitted to the court on CARDINAL DATE stated , in so far as relevant :", "... \u201c CARDINAL . The windows are in very poor general condition . The glass is broken in CARDINAL windows and cracked in others . ORG \u2019s frames and glass are covered in dust and were not cleaned in DATE . The wooden frames are dirty and have paint missing , I think they must last have been painted DATE . CARDINAL the putty is missing , and the glass is actually sticking out of the frame , which causes a real danger of the glass falling out on to people on the pavement . No sign of using widely available window seals . I consider that due to dirty windows the amount of light in the flat is reduced by PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . NORP In general all the walls are covered with mould , dirt and residue from the gas cooker . The same applies to the furniture . There is a discernible smell of mustiness in the flat .", "CARDINAL . The air vents ( size QUANTITY ) in the kitchen and bathroom are not working properly , no draught was perceived ; the total surface of the openings was covered with dust and soot , which is probably what blocked them ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his conclusions the expert considered that the damp and mould had been caused by the total lack of ventilation in the applicant \u2019s flat . The current state of the flat was \u201c an insult to basic requirements for inhabited accommodations \u201d . The state of the windows places passers - by at risk , and they need urgent replacement . In general the expert considered that the applicant should be held responsible for the state of the flat due to her total lack of care , cleaning and maintenance . The expert pointed to the fact that in the neighbouring flats the windows were as old as the applicant \u2019s but well maintained and the flats had not problem of mould or ventilation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . The court established that at the time of signing the lease agreement the applicant had acknowledged the good overall state of the flat except for a broken glass in one window . She noticed no mould or problems with closing and opening of the windows .", "The court concluded that the state of the flat had deteriorated due to the applicant \u2019s negligence in ventilating and cleaning it . The court also agreed with the ORG that replacement of the windows may be made conditional upon the applicant paying the debts she owned to the community .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal but on DATE ORG dismissed it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an emergency chimney sweep was organised . At the same time the Mayor confirmed to the applicant that \u201c the GPE \u2019s obligations as regards refurbishment of the flat will be fulfilled after you pay your financial debts for the [ maintenance of the ] flat . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the granddaughter was convicted by ORG of verbal and physical abuse of the applicant . She was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil action with ORG for eviction of her granddaughter and her children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action and ordered the eviction of M. , with her CARDINAL children ( file no . I C CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . At the same time it ordered that the defendants be allocated social housing by the municipality . The execution of the judgment was to be stayed until they had been allocated social housing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment became final and binding .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant asked the municipality on many occasions to enforce the judgment by granting social housing to M and her children .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Mayor replied to the applicant on CARDINAL May and DATE and on DATE that her request would be dealt with speedily .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M rejected the municipality \u2019s offer of a social housing . Afterwards in DATE the municipality proposed her another flat for rent which she accepted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that in DATE her granddaughter had been granted a social housing and had moved out .", "CARDINAL .
