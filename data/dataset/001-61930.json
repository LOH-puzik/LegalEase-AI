The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the applicant was the publisher and editor in chief of the DATE Domino efekt . In DATE the DATE published CARDINAL articles which concerned civil proceedings for defamation pending before the NORP courts . The proceedings were between Mr Slobodn\u00edk , a Minister who became later a Member of ORG , and PERSON , a poet and publicist who had published a statement alleging , inter alia , that ORG had a fascist past . The relevant parts of the articles , which were not written by the applicant , read as follows .", "\u201c Quo vadis , NORP justice ? ( A shameful judgment delivered by ORG )", "When ORG put an end to the first round of the judicial dispute between Mr Slobodn\u00edk and Mr PERSON dismissing the former minister \u2019s action for protection of his personality rights , voices could be heard alleging that the outcome of the appellate proceedings before ORG would be different . They argued that [ ORG ] judges were \u2018 different\u2019 . Those views came true and GPE faces further ridicule at the international level . The ORG chamber presided over by [ judge \u0160. - the article mentioned the full name of the judge ] did not disappoint .", "A tragicomic farce", "The NORP poet and writer PERSON ( who opted for NORP nationality in the meantime ) stated in DATE that Mr PERSON , who had just become the Minister of Culture of GPE , should not exercise the post of a minister in a democratic state as he had a fascist past ... The statement was based on facts which were generally known : during World War II Slobodn\u00edk had been a member of the ORG and he had participated in a terrorist course in Sekule organised under the auspices of that organisation . Several participants in that course ( it should be mentioned that ORG was not among them ) had been later involved in the killing of the inhabitants of [ a ] village ...", "ORG , who never alleged that ORG was a murderer or a criminal ... expressed the view of a citizen of a free society who considered that a person who had belonged to the ORG and who had been close to people who later killed members of the civilian population , should not be a minister of a democratic state . Nothing more and nothing less ...", "[ Instead of retiring from the post ] PERSON filed an action for protection of his personality rights and thus gave rise to a case which , in a certain way , is tragicomic ... [ and in the course of which ORG ] failed to show that he had not been a member of the ORG and that he had not participated in the course in Sekule . [ Mr PERSON ] thus failed to disprove the facts on the basis of which ORG had declared that he had a fascist past . We simply recall that a decree by President PERSON DATE provided that the ORG was to be considered as a fascist organisation .", "Strange reasoning", "ORG took all the above facts into account and ... dismissed the action of ORG . [ ORG judge ] ... thus established the very best case - law for the newly born democracy and warned every politician that his or her past may and even must be the object of an increased interest by the public .", "At the hearing held on DATE [ ORG ] judge PERSON took the opposite approach in that he ordered PERSON to pay CARDINAL NORP korunas [ SKK ] to GPE and to apologise to the latter [ in the press ] ... Thus [ judge PERSON ] warned all citizens of GPE that , should they come to the conclusion that the moral profile of a politician is incompatible with the exercise of the public function entrusted to him or her , they had better keep quiet .", "[ Judge PERSON ] also showed the strength of his spirit when giving reasons for the judgment . CARDINAL . ORG ... was , in principle , a very good organisation which had been abused by politicians , CARDINAL . PERSON not only caused damage to GPE , but also to the whole of GPE , the Prime Minister , the Movement for a NORP GPE , the Government and the ORG , ... CARDINAL . the post - war retribution decrees enacted in GPE were the result of a conspiracy between President PERSON and the communists .", "[ Judge PERSON ] revises history", "...", "[ It should be recalled that ] the NORP legal rules on retribution , of which the decrees by President PERSON form a part , were adopted in accordance with the principles of ORG for ORG established in GPE on DATE . They were further based on the ... agreement on the establishment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and the ORG on ORG held in GPE ... Such retribution rules were adopted by practically all NORP states which had been occupied by NORP GPE during the war and which had to take a position with respect to collaborators and traitors .", "The words which [ judge \u0160. ] used in order to justify his judgment directly call in question the attitude which , after World War II , the democratic states in LOC took towards fascism and those who had served it .", "It should be said , however , that [ judge \u0160. ] had no choice . When he wanted to reach the decision which he reached , no other reasoning was available \u2013 it simply did not exist ... When I wish to say A , that is that the past of a person who was a member of the ORG and who took part in the course in Sekule is not a fascist one , I am obliged to say also B , that is that I do not recognise the law which defines the ORG as a fascist organisation . As the case may be , I will add that the ORG was a good organisation and things are settled .", "Thus , quo vadis , NORP justice ? PERSON is said to look forward to the international court in GPE . However , a NORP citizen , having in mind such \u2018 LOC decisions of the \u2018 ORG and \u2018 impartial\u2019 ORG does not have many reasons for being pleased . Even if he or she is successful at first instance , the chances of obtaining justice after a possible appeal to ORG are slight as has been shown by the case PERSON v. GPE . \u201d", "On DATE the DATE Domino efekt published an interview with the former president of ORG who was the lawyer of PERSON Feldek in the defamation proceedings brought by ORG . It was entitled \u201c GPE is governed by an absolute legal chaos \u201d and the relevant parts read :", "- \u201c The press stated that [ judge \u0160. ] , who decided the case of GPE against ORG in the way he did and in which you were the advocate of the poet , is a candidate of ORG in the [ parliamentary ] election . What do you think about it ?", "- ... It is ... unusual that a judge , whose task it is to guarantee the objectiveness and impartiality in a NORP society , manifests his political views in public . Having one \u2019s name included in the list of candidates of a political party undoubtedly represents such a manifestation of political views .", "- Let \u2019s talk about the particular inscription of [ judge \u0160. ] on the election list of a particular party , namely ORG ...", "- One should see that that party has a clear position as regards DATE . To put it mildly - it does not condemn that period . And this is the core of the problem - [ judge \u0160. ] , who decided the case of GPE against ORG , that is a dispute in which CARDINAL of the main points at issue had been the behaviour of CARDINAL of the participants during the period of GPE , is the candidate of a party which does not condemn GPE or the regime by which it was governed , on the contrary ...", "... Section CARDINAL of the Judiciary and Judges Act clearly provides that one of the principal obligations of judges is that \u2018 a judge shall abstain from any action which could impair the dignity of the judicial function or jeopardise the trust in independent , impartial and just decision - making of the courts\u2019 ...", "- Do you think that [ judge \u0160. ] had internally decided \u2018 the case of LANGUAGE long before the delivery of the judgment and that all the fuss in the court room served nothing ?", "- There is nothing else that I can think . The performance of that judge has no other explanation . In particular , I can say that , after the delivery of the judgment , I learned that ORG judges had expected such a decision to be taken . The views of [ judge PERSON ] as regards the case or as regards the existence of the NORP State during World War II were known ...", "The appeal against ORG judgment , which was in favour of PERSON PERSON , was transmitted to ORG on DATE ... The case was decided upon on DATE ... that is with the rapidity of a missile , and one can hardly find another case examined by ORG which was dealt with the same promptness . \u201d", "\u201c See you soon in GPE ( Not even death will separate the couple GPE \u2013 Feldek )", "The judicial proceedings in the case GPE v.

[ To the extent that the claim by ORG was granted by the cassation chamber of ORG ] , PERSON will bring the case ... before ORG in GPE .", "Thus NORP justice was open to ridicule . To make things clear \u2013 GPE has no chances of success in GPE . The existing case - law of [ ORG ] comprises a sufficient number of examples where that court used a phrase protecting freedom of expression as such , which every politician in a democratic state should be acquainted with : \u2018 The limits of admissible criticism are wider as regards a politician and narrower in the case of a private person\u2019 . It is easy and clear at the same time and the cassation chamber of ORG ( like [ Mr ] PERSON ) has not grasped it ...", "A different fact is relevant : PERSON has to apologise for a civic \u2018 value judgment\u2019 whereas this is not acceptable for the free world . \u2018 ORG expressed publicly are not , in accordance with the established NORP practice and also in accordance with LAW , susceptible of proof ...", "Should we admit ( as we did in fact ) [ that a journalist who publishes his or her value judgments in respect of a public figure be obliged to prove the truth of such statements ] , a situation would arise which has nothing to do with democracy and with the principles of a NORP society . ORG will simply fear making \u2018 value judgments\u2019 because they will be under the threat of a sanction . As a result , the vital sap of democracy will dry out \u2013 namely an open debate on issues of public interest .", "ORG failed to understand these principles which ... are simple and easy to understand and which are respected by the democratic world as something that is \u2018 given\u2019 . Or , as the case might be , it did not want to understand .", "P.S. I will dare make a \u2018 value judgment\u2019 despite the position which \u2018 value judgments\u2019 have in this country thanks to this case law . In my view , ORG of GPE did NOT WANT to respect the NORP principles of the protection of the freedom of expression . It would have sufficed if the judges had read LAW . In particular LAW where it is written in black and white . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge PERSON filed an action under LAW seq . of LAW for protection of his personal rights against the applicant .

In his reply the applicant stated that the author of the above articles had informed the public about the judicial proceedings in a case which attracted public attention .

The applicant was further ordered to pay the plaintiff SKK CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and to pay the court fees and the plaintiff \u2019s costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the limits of objective and acceptable criticism had been exceeded in that the above articles comprised such expressions as \u201c tragicomic farce \u201d , \u201c shameful judgment \u201d , \u201c strange reasoning \u201d and \u201c legal farce \u201d . The first and the third article were capable of giving the readers the impression that the plaintiff had been biased . ORG further recalled that the judgment criticised in the articles was delivered by an appellate chamber of CARDINAL judges . However , the articles referred to the plaintiff as if he were the only author of the judgment . ORG recalled that a chamber of the appellate court always decides after deliberations in the presence of a typist . A majority of votes is required and the presiding judge is the last to vote . ORG also recalled that judges are independent when deciding on matters before them and that the cassation chamber of ORG had not found any procedural shortcomings in the proceedings leading to the judgment criticised in the above articles .", "CARDINAL . When deciding to grant non - pecuniary damages to the plaintiff ORG noted that the above articles criticised , repeatedly and without justification , a judge of ORG whereby his dignity and position in the society had been considerably affected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the plaintiff appealed . The applicant argued that ORG had failed to apply the law correctly and that it had decided arbitrarily . The applicant submitted that the statements in question were value judgments which were based on facts explicitly set out in the articles . He therefore requested that the first instance judgment , to the extent that it granted the action , be overturned . The plaintiff failed to submit any reasons and subsequently he maintained that he had not appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the first instance judgment in that it dismissed the action of judge ORG judgment stated that the applicant had ceased being the editor of NORP efekt in DATE . As he was not the author of the articles in question , he no longer had standing to be a defendant in the case . The new editor could not be sued as he was not a general successor to the rights and obligations relating to the DATE . The plaintiff \u2019s claim that an apology be published in the DATE could not , therefore , be granted .", "CARDINAL . ORG also examined the merits of the case and found that the phrase \u201c Even the latter has not found courage to quash in full the legal farce produced by [ judge PERSON ] on DATE \u201d published on DATE represented an attack against the authority of the courts as such and that it was not proportionate to the aim pursued , namely to criticise the reasons for ORG judgment presented orally by judge PERSON However , no satisfaction could be granted in this respect as the applicant had lost standing in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plaintiff filed an appeal on points of law in which he challenged the conclusions reached by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the cassation chamber of ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE . ORG held that the appellate court had decided erroneously and instructed the latter to take further evidence . As regards the merits of the case in particular , the court of cassation held that because of their expressive character the applicant \u2019s statements were disproportionate to the aim pursued , namely to criticise a judicial decision or the public activities of judge NORP In ORG view , those statements clearly indicated that the applicant had intended to offend judge PERSON , to humiliate and discredit him . Limits of acceptable criticism had been thereby exceeded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the part of the PERSON CARDINAL ORG judgment of DATE by which the applicant had been ordered to pay SKK CARDINAL , together with the statutory default interest , to the defendant in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . ORG further dismissed the remainder of the plaintiff \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . The judgment stated that the plaintiff had failed to submit reasons for his appeal . Accordingly , ORG could review the first instance judgment only to the extent that it had been appealed against by the applicant . ORG dismissed the claim that an apology be published in NORP efekt as ( i ) the editing rights had been transferred to a different person and the name of the DATE had changed and ( ii ) the plaintiff had failed to amend his action so that a judgment in this respect could be enforced . ORG noted that the plaintiff had failed to specify which parts of the article published on DATE interfered with his personal rights . The relevant part of the action was therefore also dismissed .", "CARDINAL . As regards the merits of the remaining part of the case , ORG recalled , with reference to LAW and the relevant provisions of the LAW , that judges enjoyed special protection as regards the criticism of the way in which they exercised their function . This was dictated by the requirement of impartiality of judges . The latter could be jeopardised if the society tolerated unjustified criticism of a judge for a decision delivered by him or her .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further stated that the situation is different in cases where a judge makes public his or her intention to become involved in politics , and where the decision on a case to be subsequently taken by such a judge is linked to the political views presented by him or her . By failing to withdraw from a case in such circumstances the judge concerned deliberately exposes himself or herself to the threat of criticism by the public , notwithstanding that the decision in question was lawful . ORG therefore held that , when a judge decided to become involved in politics , he or she became a person of public interest and , as such , he or she no longer enjoyed special protection as regards the limits of acceptable criticism .", "CARDINAL . ORG recalled that it was bound by the views expressed in the judgment delivered by the cassation chamber of ORG on DATE . It therefore concluded that the contested statements in the articles published on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE interfered with the personal rights of the plaintiff , whereby his dignity and the esteem for his person in society had been considerably diminished . The expressive character of the terms used was disproportionate to the aim pursued , namely the criticism of a judicial decision or the plaintiff \u2019s involvement in public life . Those terms clearly showed that the purpose of the statements was to offend , to humiliate and to discredit the criticised person . Accordingly , the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for non - pecuniary damage which he had thus suffered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge PERSON filed an appeal on points of law .
