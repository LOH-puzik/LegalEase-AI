NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "He was represented before the ORG by Mr T. \u0160af\u00e1rik , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the present case revolve around a piece of real property , situated in a regional capital , which used to form part of the site of a factory belonging to a ( socialist ) ORG - owned enterprise .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an above - ground heat distribution pipeline was built in the area in order to provide it with heating . The pipeline passes through the property in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a self - employed entrepreneur . In that capacity , in DATE and DATE he rented the said property from the private company which had meanwhile become its owner . Subsequently , in DATE , the applicant himself acquired title to the property by way of purchase .", "CARDINAL . The property forms a part of a shop in which the applicant runs a business which is essentially a car scrapyard .", "CARDINAL . The property partly consists of a road . According to the ORG \u2019s submission , which is supported by photographs and which has not been contested by the applicant , the remaining part of the property is used for storing wrecked cars .", "CARDINAL . The pipeline runs alongside the applicant \u2019s LOC QUANTITY above the ground and CARDINAL from the fence , and it rests on pylons anchored in the ground .", "CARDINAL . The pipeline belongs to a commercial joint - stock company producing and distributing heating for the town concerned .", "CARDINAL . The bone of contention in the present case is the lack of compensation for the restrictions on the use of the applicant \u2019s property due to the pipeline . The applicant unsuccessfully applied for such compensation in the proceedings which lie at the heart of the present case . However , prior to those proceedings he had asserted similar claims in another set of proceedings , but also unsuccessfully . Both sets of proceedings are described below , chronologically , with focus on the contested proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(l ) of LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as in force at the relevant time ) , real property encumbered by easements such as the one in the present case were exempt from real - estate tax . According to the Government , whose submission the applicant has not contested , from DATE this exemption continued to apply to the property in question by virtue of a decision of the municipality concerned .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged an action against the above - mentioned heat production and distribution company seeking compensation in respect of unjustified enrichment on account of the easement relating to the pipeline .", "CARDINAL . The action was dismissed by the Ko\u0161ice II District Court ( ORG s\u00fad ) on DATE and , following an appeal by the applicant , by ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new action against the same defendant , arguing that the latter was the owner of the pipeline and that , along with the protective zones around it , the pipeline prevented him from making use of QUANTITY of his property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the average yearly rent for land in the area was equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) per square metre . Accordingly , the applicant requested an order for the payment of the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to cover DATE before the introduction of his action , plus DATE .", "CARDINAL . In support of his claims , the applicant invoked , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) , as well as the relevant provisions of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) and the DATE Thermal Energy Sector Act ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also relied on a judgment ( n\u00e1lez ) of ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00ed soud ) of GPE ( whose legal tradition is similar to that of GPE ) of DATE in case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "That judgment concerned , inter alia , the continued application of the DATE LAW ( Law no . QUANTITY . ) ( see below ) , which had been adopted at the time of GPE . ORG observed an ideological distinction between the \u201c old law \u201d , that is to say , that of the \u201c old ( NORP ) regime \u201d prior to DATE , and the law applicable under the subsequent democratic constitution . This distinction reflected the political and economic changes that had taken place . While there was a general continuity with the old law , there was a discontinuity in respect of the values of the old regime . Thus , the interpretation and application of the old rules had currently to take due account of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the protection of property . The latter consideration was all the more relevant when the beneficiary of an ex lege easement was making use of it in order to obtain economic gain . While the lawfulness of the creation of an ex lege easement as such was undisputed , where the applicable publiclaw legislation contained no provision for compensation in respect of expenses relating to the exercise of the easement , the relevant provisions of private law were to be used as an alternative . Such provisions provided for compensation in respect of running costs , which was to be agreed on by those concerned or to be ordered by a court . A lack of compensation for such expenses would constitute unjust enrichment on the part of the beneficiary of the easement .", "CARDINAL . The action was dismissed by ORG on DATE and , following an appeal by the applicant , by ORG on DATE . The courts\u2019 reasoning can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . To start with , the courts found that , although the action concerned the same parties and the same property and was based on the same line of argument , the matter was not res judicata by reason of the judgments of DATE and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This was so because the claims raised in it concerned a different period of time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and new legislation had been enacted in the meantime ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In this regard , the courts observed that the heat - distribution facility had been built under a construction permit granted in DATE ; that it had begun to operate in DATE ; and that it was located on land which , at that time , had belonged to the ( socialist ) State .", "By operation of section CARDINAL of ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ( applicable at the relevant time ) on the implementation of the DATE LAW , the application of that LAW had been extended to heatdistribution facilities , such as the one in the present case .", "The DATE LAW thus authorised the construction of the facility but , as a matter of principle , it did not provide for compensation . However , if the owners or users of the real property concerned were significantly encumbered in its use , they could claim adequate CARDINAL - off compensation . The claim had to be filed within DATE of the entry of the installation into use or else it would lapse .", "The DATE LAW provided for ex lege easements and the subsequent legislation , in particular section ORG ) of the DATE LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Thermal Energy Sector Act , had left them intact . None of these pieces of legislation envisaged any compensation for the restrictions inherent in the continued existence of the ex lege easements , other than the CARDINAL - off compensation at the time of their creation . Providing for new compensation claims would have the effect of creating new titles to restitution , which the lawmaker was free under LAW not to choose to do .", "The applicant had acquired his plot in DATE by purchasing it from a private seller . It had been his responsibility to examine the condition of the property , including the existence of the impugned ex lege easement , and to ensure that that was reflected in the purchase price . The contested ex lege easement fell outside the scope of the existing unjustified - enrichment rules , which accordingly were not applicable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the judgement of the ordinary courts by way of a complaint before ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) under LAW .", "In substance , he reiterated the above arguments and alleged a violation of his rights under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL .", "In addition , he submitted that the ORG argument concerning how he had acquired the property was of secondary importance and did not deal with the question of principle obtaining in cases such as his .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "ORG reiterated its established case - law to the effect that a general court could not bear \u201c secondary liability \u201d for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a constitutionally relevant violation of the rules of procedure . However , no such procedural issue had been established .", "The essence of the applicant \u2019s complaint was that there was no law enabling him to claim compensation for the ex lege easement over his property . However , in contrast to some other jurisdictions , including GPE , an individual in GPE had no power to challenge the compliance of the legislation , or lack of it , with the LAW . The applicant \u2019s argument made in reliance on the case - law of ORG of GPE was therefore without consequence .", "The ordinary courts had supported their judgments by adequate reasoning and their conclusions as to the facts and law manifested no signs of arbitrariness or lack of justification .", "CARDINAL .
