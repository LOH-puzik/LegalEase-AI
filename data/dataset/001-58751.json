The applicants , PERSON and his mother , PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant is currently held in FAC . His mother lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances in which the first applicant was arrested , taken into police custody and detained pending trial , as set out by him in a letter dated DATE , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE CARDINAL police officers stopped and questioned the first applicant and his female companion NORP in the LOC district of GPE . Both were in possession of false identity papers . They were immediately arrested and , after a wait of TIME at the local police station , were taken to the anti - terrorist branch of the LOC police headquarters in GPE ( \u201c the branch \u201d ) .", "They were taken into custody in separate parts of the building . On arrival , the first applicant was blindfolded and a group of police officers who said they were members of the \u201c anti - Dev - Sol \u201d squad began punching and kicking him , threatening to kill him if he did not reveal his true identity . He was then led to a ground - floor room where he was stripped , had his hands tied together behind his back and was suspended by his arms , a method known as \u201c NORP hanging \u201d . For TIME the police officers beat him repeatedly while he was in this position and administered electric shocks through electrodes attached to his feet and genitals .", "CARDINAL . At TIME carried to another room and made to lie on the floor with his hands still tied behind his back . A man who said he was a member of the secret service told him : \u201c You belong to PERSON , and if you do n't give us the information we need , you 'll be leaving here feet first ! \u201d The police officers then started to beat him , aiming some of their blows at his genitals . That lasted until TIME , at which point he was taken to a CARDINAL-sq . m. cell , where he had to sleep naked on the floor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME he was taken back to the ground floor , tied up and laid on the ground . He suffered a further beating and electric shocks were administered to his feet , the area behind his ears and his tongue . By the time the torturers went to lunch , he had already fainted twice . TIME he was again subjected to \u201c NORP hanging \u201d and given electric shocks while having cold water poured over him . He was then left lying on the concrete , naked and blindfolded .", "That TIME he was taken back upstairs , where the secret - service agent dragged him by the hair and twice banged his head against the wall . He was then dressed and taken to a forest , where somebody pointed a revolver at his head and urged him to say his \u201c last prayer \u201d before firing a blank shot . Immediately after this mock execution , he was escorted back to the branch . There he was again blindfolded and stripped and then placed in a bath of ice - cold water . DATE the police officers continued to ill - treat him .", "CARDINAL . The ill - treatment ended on Mr Dikme 's DATE in custody . However , he continued to be questioned while blindfolded , and was subjected to a barrage of abuse .", "CARDINAL . Mr Dikme had no assistance from a lawyer at any time while he was in police custody ; he spent TIME a day in his cell and was not allowed to have any visitors or to read any books or newspapers . The only person he saw after entering the premises of the branch was his companion NORP , although he was not able to speak to her .", "In that connection , he produced to the ORG a letter from NORP containing the following passages :", "\u201c PERSON and I were arrested on DATE . ... As soon as we arrived at the first branch they blindfolded us and separated us . Before I was taken to a cell , I saw that they had started to beat him . During DATE I spent in the branch , I only saw PERSON when he was on his way to or from interrogation sessions , and sometimes when he was being taken to the toilet . On each occasion he was blindfolded . Just once , I could see bruises on his eyes . However , when they questioned me they were always insulting ORG and telling me how they had tortured him ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the branch requested the public prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c the public prosecutor \u201d , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to refer the first applicant and GPE to the GPE office of ORG . The public prosecutor consented and on DATE of their detention in police custody \u2013 they were examined by a forensic medical expert , who allegedly told the first applicant : \u201c You 're fighting fit ; there 's nothing wrong with you . \u201d", "The medical report , drawn up that DATE , stated that no traces of blows or physical force had been found on GPE 's body ; only \u201c old grazes covered by a scab were observed on [ the first applicant 's ] left elbow \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE the first applicant and Y.O. were interviewed by the public prosecutor and brought before a judge of ORG . They retracted the statements which they had made to the police and said that they had been signed \u201c under torture \u201d ; they denied the accusations against them . Y.O. made the following statement : \u201c I am lodging a complaint against the police officers who tortured me and who ... called themselves ORG . \u201d", "The judge ordered them to be detained pending trial , as he found that there was \u201c substantial evidence \u201d of their membership of PERSON and of their involvement in acts of violence carried out by that organisation .", "The following comment , signed by PERSON , appeared at the bottom of the order : \u201c I do not wish to inform anybody that I am being held in detention . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , the date of the religious festival marking DATE , PERSON sought to visit the first applicant , but was refused permission by the prison managers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant signed an authority for a lawyer to act on his behalf , although he did not see the lawyer in person ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In an indictment issued on DATE the public prosecutor charged the first applicant and Y.O. with carrying out a series of attacks DATE , the victims of which had included a public prosecutor , a retired general and QUANTITY police officers , and with involvement in a number of acts of violence committed on behalf of the illegal armed organisation Dev - Sol . He sought the death penalty for the first applicant and GPE , under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial began at ORG . The first applicant filed pleadings in which he denied the charges against him and categorically repudiated the content of the records of statements taken by the police while he was in custody , alleging that the statements had been obtained by torture . He accordingly made formal complaints against the officers responsible for him during his time in police custody , and relied on the medical report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The first applicant submitted , inter alia , that he and Y.O. had had to use false identity papers for fear of police reprisals on account of the criminal record of his sister , who had been killed during a clash with the police in GPE , and that they had passed themselves off as a married couple simply in order to be able to rent a flat more easily . He consequently pleaded not guilty and applied for release on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the public prosecutor preferred CARDINAL further indictments , charging the first applicant with carrying out other acts of violence , likewise DATE , including murder , armed assaults and robberies , bomb attacks and assault and battery .", "CARDINAL . After holding CARDINAL hearings and hearing evidence from QUANTITY witnesses , ORG delivered its judgment on DATE . It held that \u201c in the light of the evidence , the accused 's guilt [ was ] established \u201d in relation to some of the offences , which he had committed on behalf of PERSON with the aim of undermining the constitutional order , and sentenced him to death , having regard to the intensity , quantity and seriousness of the offences and to his failure to show any remorse during the trial .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's counsel and ORG at ORG appealed on points of law against ORG judgment on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . In his appeal counsel for the first applicant did no more than complain that the sentence was \u201c unjust and severe \u201d , while ORG submitted that the impugned judgment could not be regarded as having been supported by sufficient grounds , since it did not contain details , where they were needed , of the evidence on which the conviction had been based and ORG assessment of that evidence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , delivered on DATE , ORG set aside the judgment of DATE on the ground that it was \u201c contrary to LAW and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure to deliver a judgment without applying the rule that judgments must be reasoned in such a way as to enable ORG to carry out its review , and without referring in the operative provisions to the substantiated evidence in respect of each of the charges and the assessment made of it ... \u201d .", "ORG consequently remitted the case to ORG , where it is still pending .", "CARDINAL . After putting forward their defence at the hearing of DATE in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the first applicant and Y.O. had lodged CARDINAL separate written complaints against their alleged torturers . On DATE , in the light of that and , it would seem , on the instructions of a ministerial authority , the public prosecutor decided to contact the relevant authorities in order to ascertain whether the first applicant had had access to a lawyer while in police custody and/or been subjected to ill - treatment after being taken into custody at FAC .", "In a letter dated DATE the head of the branch replied that \u201c no interview with a lawyer [ had taken ] place , since throughout PERSON time in police custody , no lawyer [ had ] submitted ... a request to that effect \u201d .", "On DATE the governor of ORG stated : \u201c PERSON ... was not subjected to ill - treatment during his detention and has never lodged a complaint to that effect with our management . There is no risk of his being subjected to ill - treatment while he is held in our prison . Our files also indicate that he had never conferred with a lawyer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG forwarded the complaints filed on DATE to the public prosecutor for action .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor ruled that he had no jurisdiction ratione materiae and sent the case to the GPE prefecture , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . ORG \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE decided that there was no case to answer in respect of the criminal complaint lodged by the first applicant and GPE That decision was served on the first applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not have any other information regarding those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the material time section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on procedure in the national security courts provided that any person arrested in connection with an offence within the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts had to be brought before a judge within TIME at the latest or , if the offence was a joint one committed outside the region under emergency rule , within DATE , not including the time needed to convey the detainee to the judge .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before questioning an arrested person , police officers must inform him of the offence of which he is suspected and ask whether he wishes to say anything in reply . With regard to legal assistance , LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) provides , in the version applicable in the instant case , that an accused may confer or correspond with a legal adviser only after being detained pending trial , and the judge may decide that certain items in the file which are considered sensitive will not be disclosed to the accused until criminal proceedings have been instituted . In addition , the accused 's legal adviser may not inspect documents in the file until the public prosecutor 's office has preferred the indictment ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW it is an offence for a government employee to subject a person to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in relation to torture and Article CARDINAL in relation to ill - treatment ) . The authorities ' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation where acts or omissions that may constitute such an offence are brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL CCP . Offences may be reported not only to public prosecutors ' offices or the security forces but also to local administrative authorities . Complaints may be made in writing or orally . If they are made orally , the authority must make a record of them ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "Under Article CARDINAL of LAW , any government employee who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor 's office an offence of which he has become aware in the performance of his duties is liable to imprisonment . A public prosecutor who is informed by whatever means of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is under a duty to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and the offence was committed in the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by ORG , which restricts the public prosecutor 's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or the province , depending on the suspect 's status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against decisions of local administrative councils . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "With regard to accusations against members of the police force and intelligence services engaged in combating terrorism , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG DATE which was in force at the material time DATE was a lex specialis under which preliminary investigations were subject to the same rule on jurisdiction , but only in respect of offences other than homicide . Subsequently , in a judgment of DATE published in ORG on DATE , ORG annulled that provision with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW taken together with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL cited earlier , there is a DATE time - limit for prosecuting offences of ill - treatment and torture committed by civil servants .", "CARDINAL . From the principles established by the NORP courts when applying the criminal law it is clear that the questioning of a suspect is a means of enabling him to defend himself that should work to his advantage and not a measure designed to obtain evidence against him . While statements made during questioning may be taken into consideration by the judge in his assessment of the facts of a case , they must nonetheless be made voluntarily , and statements obtained through the use of pressure or force are not admissible in evidence . By LAW , as interpreted by ORG , any confessions made to the police or the public prosecutor 's office must be repeated before the judge if the record of the questioning containing them is to be admissible as evidence for the prosecution . If the confessions are not repeated , the records in question are not allowed to be read out as evidence in court and consequently can not be relied on to support a conviction . Nevertheless , even a confession repeated in court can not on its own be regarded as a decisive piece of evidence but must be supported by additional evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-2", "6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
