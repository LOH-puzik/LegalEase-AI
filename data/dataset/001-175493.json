The applicant was born in DATE and is detained in Krems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant shot his cousin , PERSON , CARDINAL times in the chest and stomach . His victim died . The applicant then decapitated GPE and disposed of his head .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant shot dead CARDINAL women , namely his former girlfriend , GPE , as well as her mother , PERSON , using the same gun as he had used for the previous murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on CARDINAL DATE and remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Straflandesgericht \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the Criminal Court \u201d ) , sitting as an assize court ( GPE ) , convicted the applicant of triple murder and disturbing the peace of the dead ( St\u00f6rung der Totenruhe ) . He was found to be criminally responsible for his acts and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . In addition to the sentence , ORG ordered his detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders in accordance with LAW of LAW ; see paragraph DATE below ) . A psychiatric expert , PERSON , had found in his expert opinion that the applicant presented a distinctive picture of secondary personality defence mechanisms , in the sense of suppression of fear , emotion and sexuality . His potential for aggression was increased and he was emotionally unstable and could easily become aggressive . Moreover , there were clear signs of an identity disorder .", "CARDINAL . The above judgment was upheld by ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant has been detained in institutions for mentally ill offenders since DATE . He served his prison sentence until CARDINAL DATE ( as the time he had spent in pre - trial detention \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above \u2013 was counted towards his prison sentence ) . Thereafter , he remained in preventive detention , subject to yearly review proceedings in accordance with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was first detained in the units for mentally ill offenders of GPE and FAC ( GPE ) , and since DATE has been detained in the respective unit of FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE , the applicant applied for release from the institution for mentally ill offenders . He argued that he had completed individual therapy with Professor PERSON in the GPE - Mittersteig Prison as well as specialised therapy preparing him for his release with an external therapist . CARDINAL psychiatric experts had attested that the danger emanating from him had abated or was significantly reduced . Even though different entities had suggested that he be granted privileges ( PERSON ) under LAW ( Strafvollzugsgesetz \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he had not yet been granted any . The applicant claimed that his lawyer had offered him a job and a small apartment if he were released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Krems a.d . ORG ( PERSON \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention in the institution for mentally ill offenders . It referred to an expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE by PERSON , who had stated that the applicant \u2019s condition had stabilised and that the danger emanating from him had considerably abated in respect of the closed and protected living environment of the prison . However , the same could not be said with certainty for a life outside prison . The director of the prison did not recommend releasing the applicant either , as the special therapy he needed in order to be prepared for release was only available in LOC . The applicant waived his right to appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied for release , reiterating that PERSON in his expert opinion of DATE had attested that a process of mental stabilisation had taken place and that it was highly likely that the danger emanating from him was significantly reduced . The applicant claimed that he had successfully completed psychotherapy , which he considered as sufficient preparation for life outside of prison . He emphasised that he was willing to be treated , but that currently he was not receiving any therapy . Moreover , he reminded the court that his lawyer would be able to supply a flat and a job for him if he were released . He complained that the prison authorities had refused his requests to be granted privileges , and as a consequence the domestic courts had dismissed his previous applications for release as he had not been prepared for it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held an oral hearing , ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention . It confirmed that Dr L. , in his additional expert opinion of DATE , had referred to the fact that the applicant \u2019s condition had stabilised . Even though the applicant had developed an aversion to psychotherapy , he did not refuse to talk to psychiatrists . He was actively seeking a dialogue with them . However , PERSON also found that no protection and support would be provided for the applicant after his release . Without such support , conditional release would be too risky from a psychiatric point of view . The stress caused by the overwhelming feeling of unpreparedness for release could lead to near - psychotic or micropsychotic disorders , the danger of which was unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . ORG also referred to the expert opinion of PERSON of DATE and the forensic expert opinion by the GPE - Mittersteig Prison of DATE , as well as the most recent expert opinion by Dr B. ( the resident psychologist of FAC , where the applicant was held at that time ) of DATE . The latter had come to the conclusion that the applicant still suffered from a pronounced combined personality disorder with paranoid , schizoid , emotionally unstable and narcissistic elements . PERSON responded to the generally positive tenor of PERSON opinion and found that the stabilisation process was rather a reaction to the \u201c enemy \u201d institution , namely the prison , in which the applicant was being held , and was not to be considered real or rendering the applicant capable of surviving the challenges of DATE life outside prison . Moreover , at that time , PERSON did not recommend further therapy for the applicant , who was not prepared for any self - reflection and was not ready to process the experiences and challenges of normal social interaction , and thus was still likely to present a danger to others . The director of ORG also recommended the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention , adding that his institution was not equipped to deal with the preparation of his release , which it considered to be a complex and risk - prone task . Only the GPE - Mittersteig Prison was capable of preparing the applicant for his release . The applicant in any event refused to undergo any more therapy .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that owing to the applicant \u2019s negative approach to therapy , it was impossible to prepare him for release , even though his counsel had confirmed the offer of a flat and a job , and the applicant appeared to be stable . In line with the argumentation of the expert opinions of PERSON and PERSON , the court held that in the light of the gravity of the underlying criminal offences , there was a danger that an unprepared release would overwhelm the applicant and could have unpredictable consequences . Therefore , the application for conditional release had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the ORG of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant . It referred to the expert opinions obtained in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and confirmed the decision of the first - instance court . It also reiterated that ORG psychology service had recommended a transfer to FAC , where the necessary therapy was available .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an application for release with ORG on DATE and submitted additional observations on DATE and DATE . In essence , he repeated the arguments he had made in the previous review proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . He also requested that a new expert opinion be obtained from Dr L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders , referring to the most recent expert opinion by Dr B. of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It found that there had been no changes in his circumstances and therefore declined the request for a new expert opinion . Recently obtained information from ORG psychology service stated that the applicant still refused to undergo further therapy at their institution and requested preparation for his release . It reiterated that the necessary preparation was not available in FAC , but only in FAC . However , the latter had not yet responded to a request for the applicant \u2019s transfer . ORG further referred to the reasoning in previous review decisions to avoid repetition , in particular the one by ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It stressed that the applicant still refused to deal with his offences in a therapeutic setting , which in turn was a prerequisite for being granted privileges . In the light of the gravity of the underlying offence , the statements obtained from the various prison services as well as the recent expert opinions , ORG concluded that the applicant still presented a danger to society .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant as unfounded , as it was evident that there had not been a change in his negative attitude towards further therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for conditional release from the institution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing and subsequently ordered an expert opinion in the framework of the yearly judicial review proceedings . On DATE the applicant submitted his observations on the review . He stated that the expert opinion of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been wrong and the court should therefore rather rely on PERSON expert opinion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . As the applicant refused to be examined by any expert , the court held another hearing on DATE . On that occasion , the presiding judge reproached the applicant with the fact that he could not expect to be granted privileges if he did not collaborate with the experts and the authorities . The applicant replied that previously one of the experts had found that privileges were a prerequisite for his release , and that another expert had even come to the conclusion that he could already be released . He explained that he had refused to be examined by a psychiatrist because he was not suffering from a mental illness . The applicant repeated that his lawyer had offered him a small apartment and work in his law firm . He was not willing to live in an assisted - living facility or to follow psychotherapy after his eventual release , but would agree to work with a probation officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention . Based on the information on file , the latest expert opinion of PERSON of DATE and the information from the director of the prison , it concluded that the danger emanating from the applicant still persisted and therefore his application for release had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . That decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The court summarised the genesis of the case so far and the applicant \u2019s complaints , and reiterated the lower court \u2019s findings . As to its own conclusion , it almost exclusively referred to its previous decisions in the applicant \u2019s case of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , holding that there had been no significant changes in the applicant \u2019s situation , in particular that he still refused any further therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for release from the institution for mentally ill offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention , essentially reiterating the reasoning it had given in its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It appears that ORG did not hold an oral hearing prior to that decision . It referred to the \u201c current \u201d expert opinion of PERSON of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and statements by the prison administration and the social service of the prison ( Ma\u00dfnahmenteam ) that the applicant should not be released , as he refused to undergo therapy and still posed a threat . ORG reiterated that the applicant could only be prepared for his release at FAC , but found that it would be unreasonable to order his transfer because of his negative attitude towards therapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant as unfounded . It held that ORG had had no choice but to take into consideration the expert opinion of DATE , as in the course of the CARDINAL review proceedings the applicant had refused to be examined by an expert . ORG again referred to the reasoning it had given in its CARDINAL previous decisions relating to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the above decision , the applicant was almost fortynine DATE old and had spent DATE of his life in different institutions for mentally ill offenders ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
