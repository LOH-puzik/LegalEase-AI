By judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Sentence enforcement division of ORG released him on licence from DATE to DATE , ordering to follow a DATE programme of assistance and supervision . The Government pointed out that the applicant was the first person sentenced to life imprisonment for offences linked to terrorism ever to have been released on licence .", "CARDINAL . The Sentence enforcement division reiterated in its judgment that the applicant \u2019s release on licence would be accompanied by the following general obligations ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) : complying with the instructions of the sentence enforcement judge or of the social worker from FAC and probation service ; receiving visits from the latter and providing him or her with information or documents facilitating supervision of his livelihood and compliance with his obligations ; informing the social worker of any job changes and , if such changes are liable to hamper compliance with his obligations , obtaining prior authorisation from the sentence enforcement judge ; informing the social worker of any changes of address and of any travel lasting for DATE , reporting back to the latter on his return ; and obtaining the authorisation of the sentence enforcement judge for any foreign travel and for any change of job or of address liable to impede compliance with his obligations .

On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by ORG with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took part in a peaceful demonstration outside ORG in support of NORP detainees being held there . The media reported on that demonstration .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG delivered a judgment on DATE imposing additional special obligations on the applicant : refraining from attending , in the vicinity of a prison or other detention facility , any demonstration in support of persons detained for terrorist offences or of any association or movement which is committing or has committed terrorist acts ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL [ CARDINAL ] of LAW ) ; refraining from distributing any document or audiovisual material produced or co - produced by himself concerning , in whole or in part , an offence committed by himself , and refraining from discussing that offence in public ( LAW [ CARDINAL ] of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP That judgment was upheld by judgment of ORG on DATE . However , the latter judgment was quashed by judgment of ORG on DATE , on the grounds that the sentence enforcement court did not have jurisdiction to modify the obligations for release on licence , for which matter the sentence enforcement judge held jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested that the sentence enforcement judge of ORG of GPE add both the aforementioned obligations to the applicant \u2019s list of obligations for release on licence , as well as a prohibition on \u201c contacting any person actively engaged in promoting NORP separatism or supporting detainees convicted of or charged with terrorist acts pursuant to ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL to CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , particularly with a view to expressing support for such detainees ( Article CARDINAL [ CARDINAL ] of LAW ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

He noted that in its judgment of DATE ORG had described the applicant \u201c as a calm , respectful person who spent most of his time writing his memoirs \u201d . The judge inferred that \u201c although it is unclear what the word \u2018 memoirs\u2019 entails , it is quite possible that Mr Bidart might be tempted to publish his memoirs and make statements on the offences of which he was convicted \u201d . Nor did the judgment go into further detail on that point . It explained , however , that \u201c during the adversarial proceedings Mr PERSON was reminded that the prosecution had requested the prohibition only of writings or statements connected with the offences of which he had been convicted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was upheld by judgment of ORG on DATE , stating that the obligation in question \u201c merely prohibited commenting on or condoning the offences committed \u201d and \u201c that the obligation was not a disproportionate measure in the light of the need to protect public order , nor does it prevent PERSON from expressing his political convictions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , on the grounds that in its judgment ORG had properly applied Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL [ CARDINAL ] of LAW , in compliance with the legal texts and conventions relevant to the applicant \u2019s appeal ( including LAW ) .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
