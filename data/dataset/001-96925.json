On TIME , the body of PERSON , a taxidriver , was found in a refuse disposal area in GPE . He had been stabbed to death . His van , which he used as a taxi , was found nearby with blood on the interior upholstery . An examination of the van revealed a palm print on the passenger door frame which matched that of Mr PERSON Powell , who at that time was living with the applicant . Mr PERSON \u2019s fingerprint was also found at the gate of the refuse disposal area together with another set of blood - stained fingerprints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was arrested . When interviewed , he denied any personal knowledge of the murder . On DATE , he made a statement under caution . He claimed that the applicant had developed a plan to rob a taxi driver and that PERSON had accompanied him for this purpose . They had travelled in a taxi driven by PERSON . When the taxi stopped , the applicant had held PERSON from behind and demanded money . PERSON had searched for money and the applicant had produced a knife from his back pocket and stabbed Mr PERSON in the chest . The applicant had then dragged the body to the refuse disposal area and PERSON had opened the gate . Having moved the body , the applicant threw the knife into some bushes before driving the taxi to a swamp area where he tried to dispose of the vehicle . The taxi became bogged down . Mr PERSON and the applicant subsequently removed their blood - stained clothing and hid it in some bushes .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was arrested in respect of an unrelated offence of theft . It subsequently became apparent that the applicant was involved in a number of other offences against property and offences of dishonesty . He was held without charge for the purposes of investigation DATE . He was subsequently held in custody without charge between CARDINAL and DATE for investigation for murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was first questioned under caution after being shown a copy of PERSON statement . The applicant denied PERSON version of events and made no further comments to subsequent questions put to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON took the police to the area where he claimed the knife and blood - stained clothes had been hidden . During the search , the police recovered a knife and several items of blood - stained clothing . PERSON DNA was subsequently found on an item of clothing belonging to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was again questioned under caution . He confirmed the accuracy of his statement of DATE and added that the applicant had used his right hand to stab PERSON and that he , PERSON , had touched the deceased while searching for money . He identified the knife recovered by the police as the murder weapon .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Police Constable PERSON and Detective Constable PERSON ( \u201c the police officers \u201d ) interviewed the applicant a second time . He was asked whether he would answer questions , to which he replied that he would not . At that stage , PERSON reminded the applicant that he did not need to say anything . The applicant was given no formal caution . The police officers later testified that the applicant then asked them whether he was being recorded , to which they replied in the negative . They also testified that the applicant asked Police PERSON to open her jacket in order to demonstrate that she was not carrying a recording device , which she did .", "CARDINAL . The police officers alleged that the applicant then began to speak about God and about having had a difficult past . Police Constable PERSON told him that God could help him have a better life . At that point , the applicant allegedly sighed and hung his head . He then said that PERSON PERSON \u2019s statement was DATE lies and proceeded to give his own version of events . He said that if he spoke the truth he would go to jail , but he wanted to leave a free man as he did not kill Mr PERSON . He said that the \u201c mental PERSON patient \u201d ( a reference to PERSON ) had killed PERSON . He claimed that on TIME in question , he had been looking for women but that PERSON had dragged him away with him . They were picked up by PERSON , whom PERSON instructed to drive to an address which caused the applicant surprise . When the taxi stopped , PERSON grabbed PERSON from behind and demanded money . The applicant found MONEY in the ashtray . The applicant was armed with a knife and Mr PERSON asked for the knife because PERSON had seen their faces . The applicant gave PERSON the knife and PERSON stabbed PERSON PERSON , using both hands . PERSON then tried to pull the deceased out of the van but was unable to do so . He told the applicant to get rid of the knife by throwing it in the bushes . The applicant then undid PERSON seatbelt and PERSON pulled the deceased from the van and , after searching the body , dragged it to the dumpster . The applicant described how he had driven the van to the swamp area and tried to dispose of the vehicle by putting a rock on the accelerator , but this was unsuccessful . He threw the car keys into the bushes because he thought his fingerprints would be on them . As the applicant and PERSON left the scene , the applicant saw that PERSON had PERSON mobile telephone . PERSON wanted to use the phone to ask someone to come and collect them , but the applicant told PERSON that he was crazy as the police would be able to trace the call . Mr PERSON threw the mobile telephone away . The applicant removed his shirt and jacket and gave them to PERSON , who threw them away . They were subsequently met by a friend of PERSON , who gave the latter a shirt which he in turn gave to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police officers alleged that the conversation with the applicant lasted TIME . No notes were made during the course of the interview and the applicant asked that what he had said should not be put into writing as he wanted some time to think about it . He wanted to tell the truth but did not want to go to prison for something he did not do . The police officers testified that , immediately afterwards , they made witness statements as to their recollections of the conversation with the applicant . The CARDINAL statements were almost identical . They were never shown to the applicant . The applicant denies having made any statement to the police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a post - mortem examination revealed that Mr PERSON had suffered CARDINAL stab wounds : CARDINAL in the neck area and CARDINAL on the front of the chest . It was suggested that the nature of the injuries and the lack of defence wounds on the arms or hands of the deceased indicated stabbing from behind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON made another statement in which he described the events surrounding the murder in some detail .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his co - accused , PERSON , were tried for murder before the ORG sitting DATE at the GPE request \u2013 without a jury . The applicant was represented by CARDINAL counsel . Leading counsel was an experienced criminal practitioner who had travelled from GPE to GPE for the applicant \u2019s trial .", "CARDINAL . At trial , PERSON amended his version of events . He admitted that he had stabbed Mr PERSON but claimed that it was in self - defence and that he had been alone in the taxi with Mr PERSON at the time . He alleged that his original statement implicating the applicant in the murder had been invented out of revenge following a misunderstanding regarding the theft of drugs which had been in Mr PERSON \u2019s possession . The only evidence against the applicant was therefore the alleged statement to the police officers .", "CARDINAL . At a first voir dire on DATE , the applicant challenged the admissibility of the evidence of the police officers as to his alleged statement . The challenge was made on the grounds that ( i ) no formal caution had been given and ( ii ) the manner in which the statement was taken was unfair . The police officers gave evidence and were cross - examined . The defence called no evidence .", "CARDINAL . A second voir dire was subsequently held on the admissibility of the alleged statement to the police officers . The judge noted that such a course of action was unusual but acceded to the request for a further voir dire in light of the seriousness of the charge . At the hearing , the applicant \u2019s lawyers alleged that the statement had been obtained through oppression . Again , the applicant did not testify .", "CARDINAL . The record of the voir dire hearings showed that the trial judge had positively encouraged the applicant to give evidence , but he did not do so . At no stage in either voir dire did the applicant \u2019s lawyers put to the police officers the fact that the applicant denied having made the statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his ruling on the admissibility of the alleged statement , the judge found that , while it would have been appropriate for a further caution to have been given on DATE , it was not a requirement . He emphasised that at the start of the conversation the officers did not have enough evidence to charge the applicant with murder . He further concluded that there was nothing to suggest that the manner in which the statement was taken was unfair and that there was no evidence that any inducement had been offered to the applicant to encourage him to make the alleged statement . He said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There is no direct evidence here of why PERSON spoke to the officers . I infer that he believed that what he said could not be used as evidence if it was not recorded or written down as he spoke . I also infer , as I have indicated , that he believed that it would be easier to deny it later if no record was made of it . I infer that he spoke partly because of the need to unburden himself , due to remorse and his religious beliefs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the allegations of oppression , the judge found that even assuming , without finding , that the detention without charge was unlawful , that in itself was insufficient to indicate that the applicant had made his statement as a result of oppression . He noted that :", "\u201c DATE . ... [ The applicant ] showed considerable presence of mind on DATE . For example , he insisted that the conversation not be tape - recorded . He asked PERSON . ORG . ORG to open her jacket for the purpose of proving to him that she had no concealed tape recorder on her person . Many of his answers show a considerable mental acuity , which is the opposite of the state we associate with oppressive conduct . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge observed , in the course of submissions , that he had heard nothing to indicate that the applicant \u2019s detention had had any adverse affect on him . He indicated that he would normally expect to see evidence of a psychiatrist or psychologist as to the effect of oppressive conduct and quite likely evidence from the accused himself . Shortly after this observation , counsel for the applicant sought a short break in order to allow him to seek instructions from the applicant . When proceedings resumed , counsel continued his argument , in the course of which he agreed that \u201c there is no positive evidence by the defence as to the effect of the oppression \u201d . Accordingly , the judge found the statement to be admissible as evidence in the main trial , concluding that no oppression had been demonstrated .", "CARDINAL . Following the ruling in the voir dire , the examination in chief and cross - examination of the police officers were adopted for the purposes of the main trial proceedings . At that time , Counsel for the applicant said :", "\u201c My Lord , may I just take a moment ? ... My Lord , I just want to make sure my client understands that we were adopting cross - examination from earlier ... My Lord , in light of that , I have no further questions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant did not give evidence at his trial . His allegation that he did not make the disputed confession was not put before the court . The transcript of the trial shows that on several occasions , his lawyer took time to ensure that the applicant understood and agreed to various steps being taken on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution case included evidence that the deceased had been carried from the vehicle to the location where his body was found by CARDINAL people , and dragged for some distance . It also included a statement from the applicant \u2019s former girlfriend to the effect that in DATE the applicant had said that he knew about a murder and a statement dated DATE from the applicant \u2019s cousin to the effect that the applicant had made incriminating statements and that , following the murder , the applicant and PERSON had planned to leave GPE and go to GPE . At trial , the applicant \u2019s cousin claimed that his statement was untrue and had been made under the influence of alcohol and cocaine .", "CARDINAL . Both defendants were convicted by the judge of murder on DATE and sentenced to life imprisonment . The judge , in a fully reasoned judgment , found that PERSON had administered the knife wounds ; that his evidence that the applicant was not present was untrue ; and that the applicant \u2019s confession was true .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the lawyers who had conducted the trial on behalf of the applicant gave notice of an application for leave to appeal against the conviction on the grounds that it was unsafe and unsatisfactory . They indicated that full written grounds would follow .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , the applicant appointed a new lawyer and , on DATE , he swore an affidavit regarding the conduct of Mr St PERSON and PERSON , his lawyers at trial . In his affidavit , he argued that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When the voir dire started concerning my statement , I was expecting Mr St PERSON to charge right at the QUANTITY police officers who were lying and try to discredit them . But he did n\u2019t and he kept telling me , \u2018 This way is better . They gave you a truncated form of your rights.\u2019 He also kept saying to me , \u2018 You \u2019ve told me that you did not make the statement , but I \u2019m going to attack it this way . They kept you in custody too long without charging you . I \u2019ll get the statement thrown out because of oppressive conduct.\u2019 Never once did he put to the officers the fact that I did n\u2019t make the statement at all . I sat in the court and listened to the CARDINAL ORG lies and kept thinking that I would have my chance to talk later . At all times I wanted to testify and tell the judge under oath what I have stated in this affidavit . Then the time came and I was talked out of it by the CARDINAL lawyers . They made me think that they knew best and so I put all my trust in them .", "CARDINAL . During the testimony of PERSON , when I heard her lying about a number of things , I got upset and I raised my hand and said , \u2018 I want to testify . I want to tell my side of the story.\u2019 Mr PERSON jumped up and rushed back to me and said , \u2018 Be careful what you \u2019re doing , PERSON . They have n\u2019t proven anything against you . They \u2019re not hurting you , they \u2019re not hurting you , so relax and behave and keep quiet . And do n\u2019t put yourself in the stand and give them a chance to cross - examine you.\u2019 I told him , \u2018 I do n\u2019t have any problem going on the stand . I \u2019m not guilty of anything . I do n\u2019t have anything to hide.\u2019 He told me that if I took the stand and rebutted whatever the officers were saying the judge would more than likely believe them over me and in doing so my ground of appeal \u2018 would be thrown out the window\u2019 . If I did n\u2019t testify , they would have a chance for an argument on the appeal . Mr PERSON said that was the best way to approach the case .", "CARDINAL . At lunch time on DATE , PERSON came to see me about taking the stand . PERSON did not actually take much part in my trial . He was not in court DATE and it was Mr PERSON who conducted my defence . On DATE , Mr PERSON gave me the impression that Mr PERSON had sent him to talk to me . He said , \u2018 This is the turning point in your case . We have to make a tactical decision . I know you were adamant from DATE that you gave no statement to the police officers.\u2019 I said , \u2018 Yes , sir.\u2019 Then he said , \u2018 It will be better to approach the case this way since nothing is damaging you.\u2019 He just talked and talked and I got confused and thought , \u2018 Well , he \u2019s the lawyer\u2019 , and he talked me out of testifying . Because of that , the judge never got to hear what was the most important thing and that was that those QUANTITY police officers fabricated a statement that I never made to them . Because of that statement , I have been convicted of a murder I did not commit and had nothing to do with . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer gave notice that the applicant was applying to ORG to have the affidavit received in evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant issued a release of privilege , thereby releasing his trial lawyers from the lawyer / client privilege in relation to their communications in respect of the trial proceedings .

The appellant \u2019s instructions that he would not give evidence in the proceedings remained a central tenet of his position throughout .", "CARDINAL . The consequences of his not giving evidence were discussed in great detail with the appellant , both prior to the arrival of leading counsel and in the presence of leading counsel . The decision not to give evidence in the trial created tactical considerations and decisions for the appellant .", "CARDINAL . I explained to the appellant and advised him how this decision might affect his trial . I was present when leading counsel advised the appellant how this might affect his trial . I am satisfied that the appellant understood the advice and that he understood the implications of his decision not to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . The appellant chose to challenge the alleged confession on the basis of its admissibility . Upon instructions it was argued on the voir dire that the ORG could not satisfy the tribunal to the requisite criminal standard that what the police officers alleged had been said had been said voluntarily . I am satisfied that the appellant understood the advice offered and the instructions he was providing in relation to the conduct of the voir dire .", "CARDINAL . On the voir dire the learned trial judge ruled against the appellant and in favour of the ORG in relation to the submission that the alleged confession should be excluded . The potential consequences of such ruling had been discussed and were discussed with the appellant before and during the trial . Because he would not give evidence the appellant chose not to put his case about not making the confession to the police officers in the course of the trial proper . This was a topic which was discussed with him in some detail . I am satisfied that the appellant was aware that , having provided such instructions , the only triable issue for him would be the admissibility of the alleged confession .", "...", "CARDINAL . LAW of the affidavit is not true . Mr PERSON was instructed to challenge the admissibility of the alleged admission on the voir dire . At no stage did the appellant indicate to me any desire to testify in the proceedings . I did not \u2018 talk him out of it.\u2019 I explained to the appellant on many occasions that the decision whether to give evidence or not was his and his alone . I explained that he could not be compelled to give evidence , neither could anyone stop him from giving evidence . Mr PERSON PERSON did not , as far as I am able to say , put any undue influence or pressure upon the appellant not to give evidence .", "...", "CARDINAL . I did have many conversations with the appellant in the cells during the course of his trial . Mr PERSON did communicate to me that the appellant had become upset in the dock during the proceedings and there had been a short adjournment . The words which the appellant attributes to me in paragraph CARDINAL of his affidavit are inaccurate in detail and in substance . At no stage did I say or would I say \u2018 We have a tactical decision to ORG I made it clear at all stages that the decision about testifying , as well as other substantial decisions were matters for the appellant and not matters for me or for leading counsel . I did not talk the appellant out of testifying . There was never any change of instructions in relation to the appellant \u2019s decision not to give evidence , nor in relation to the way he wished his case to be conducted . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

I am satisfied from all I have seen , heard and read that the appellant \u2019s instructing attorney acted at all times with and upon proper instructions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued before ORG that : ( i ) the sole evidence against him was the alleged statement of CARDINAL DATE ; ( ii ) the alleged statement was not reduced to writing and signed by him ; and ( iii ) he had continually and consistently instructed each of his defending counsel that he had not made the alleged statement and that it was a fabrication by the police officers . Accordingly , he argued , the failure of his trial lawyers properly to put his case to the court had denied him a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court dismissed the appeal . It refused permission for viva voce evidence to be heard from the applicant to supplement his affidavit , noting that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... He had filed no affidavit in response to those from his former attorneys , although there was an opportunity for him to do so had he so wished . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s decision not to give oral evidence at trial , the court considered that as a matter of best practice , lawyers should record in writing their PERSON wish not to testify in the proceedings . However , where no record was available , the court could nonetheless come to a decision as to whether the defendant in question was given advice from counsel and whether , after such advice , he had decided of his own free will not to testify . In the applicant \u2019s case , the court noted that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . PERSON was being represented by experienced attorneys . Mr PERSON has sworn that PERSON gave clear instructions from the inception of the case that he would not give evidence at any stage of the proceedings , and that he conveyed those instructions to Mr PERSON . Both PERSON and Mr PERSON have sworn that they over and over again gave detailed advice to PERSON as to the ramifications of his decision not to give evidence and of the possible consequences and that PERSON understood those instructions . PERSON said that he met with PERSON several times in his cell and Mr PERSON said that his first conference with PERSON was DATE before the trial commenced . This was not a case in which the defendant did not have access to his counsel and only saw them briefly before his trial . On the affidavits before us , we are completely satisfied that PERSON took a deliberate , constant and continuous decision not to give evidence and instructed his counsel accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the failure of the applicant \u2019s lawyers to put forward a positive defence to the effect that the applicant disputed making the alleged confession , it held that :", "\u201c DATE . It would have been most improper for defence counsel to have suggested to [ the police officers ] that they were lying and had fabricated the account that they were giving unless defence counsel were prepared to call PERSON as a witness . This much would have been clear to PERSON and that is why his defence was conducted in a way that no positive case was put forward on his behalf . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently appealed to ORG . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal by a majority of CARDINAL judges to CARDINAL . Delivering the leading judgment for the majority , Lord PERSON of PERSON concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... while PERSON specifically acknowledges that from the outset the appellant \u2019s position was that he disputed making the statement to the police officers , Mr PERSON does not address that issue . To that extent there could be said to be a difference between the CARDINAL principal affidavits for the trial lawyers . The significance of that difference is less than might at first sight be thought , however , since , according to PERSON , even though that was the appellant \u2019s position , he was equally adamant from the outset that at no stage in the proceedings would he give evidence . In that situation , according to PERSON , while it is correct to say that no positive case was ever put in relation to the allegation that he had not made the statement , this was upon the appellant \u2019s instructions . This is consistent with Mr PERSON position that the appellant \u2019s instructions were that no positive case would be put over and above the issue of the voluntariness of the confession . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON emphasised that a decision by an accused not to give evidence at his trial was \u201c of such potential importance \u201d that it should be recorded in writing . However , Lord PERSON declined to find that the failure of the applicant \u2019s solicitors to produce a written record of the applicant \u2019s decision meant that the court should give the applicant the benefit of the doubt and accept his version of events . He considered that in some cases , the appeal court may wish to hear evidence from the parties but that there may be cases where the court felt able to resolve the dispute without hearing evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , he concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . So far as the matter of PERSON not giving evidence is concerned , the only question is whether counsel in effect forced him , against his will , not to go into the witness box . Their Lordships notice that there is nothing to suggest that PERSON made any protest about this during the trial . Nor is there anything to suggest that , even shortly after the trial , he complained to any fellow prisoner , or court official or prison officer . The first time that such a complaint emerges is DATE in his amended grounds of appeal dated DATE and in his affidavit dated DATE . Of course , the delay in making the complaint does not show that it is unsound , but it is a factor to be taken into account . An appeal court must always bear in mind the distinct possibility that such a complaint may be fabricated \u2013 indeed that is precisely why there should be a contemporaneous written record of the decision that the defendant is not to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the record of the trial proceedings , he highlighted the care taken by Mr PERSON throughout the trial to ensure that the applicant understood the proceedings , noting the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . More importantly , however , the appellant \u2019s allegation is really that , on this critical matter , as well as on the matter of cross - examining the police witnesses , counsel overrode his instructions . But that allegation is wholly inconsistent with the picture which emerges from the record of the trial itself where on several occasions Mr PERSON took time to ensure that the appellant understood and agreed to the step which was being taken on his behalf . . In para CARDINAL of this judgment their Lordships have already drawn attention to CARDINAL such occasion when , at the conclusion of the second voir dire , Mr PERSON took time to explain to PERSON that the cross - examination in the voir dire would , in effect , be held repeated in the main trial . Earlier , during the evidence of PERSON , Mr PERSON had asked for a break of TIME to seek clarification of a point \u2013 although this is not said explicitly , it appears likely that the clarification was to come from his client .", "...", "CARDINAL . On another occasion , when prosecuting counsel announced that his next witness was going to be PERSON , Mr PERSON asked whether he might just take instructions from his client \u2013 and was allowed to do so . Later on , after the appellant \u2019s brother , PERSON , had given his evidence in chief and had apparently dealt with certain matters which had not been mentioned in his statement , counsel for PERSON asked for a moment to consult his client and Mr PERSON asked if he could take instructions at the same time .", "CARDINAL . It is also noticeable that when the judge reserved his judgment and proposed to give it at a time after Mr PERSON was due to fly back to GPE , Mr PERSON none the less recognised that he should be present . And , in the event , he was indeed present at the short hearing even though , of course , there was little which he could say on behalf of PERSON when he was convicted of murder .", "CARDINAL . He concluded :", "CARDINAL . These passages in the record suggest that , so far from being uncaring or cavalier about Mr QUANTITY views , instructions and interests , Mr PERSON was careful to consult his client whenever appropriate . It would make absolutely no sense to suppose that when he had taken care in these relatively minor matters , he had simultaneously been riding roughshod over Mr QUANTITY views as to whether he should give evidence . Moreover , it is extremely difficult to see why counsel would have deliberately flouted a desire on Mr GPE part to give evidence when the lack of any evidence from him was likely to cause potential difficulties , especially in the voir dires . In these circumstances , their Lordships are satisfied that , although counsel culpably failed to have the matter recorded at the time , they can accept the evidence of PERSON and Mr PERSON that they were following Mr GPE instructions in not calling him to give evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the second complaint regarding the failure of the applicant \u2019s lawyers to put his denial that he made the statement to the police officers , the ORG disagreed with ORG and the trial court and found that it was counsel \u2019s duty to put the defendant \u2019s case , even where he did not intend to call evidence to support it . Lord PERSON noted that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... If ... the police officers have indeed been lying , there can be no proper objection to cross - examination which successfully exposes those lies , even if the defendant does not subsequently go into the witness box to give positive evidence about those lies . On the other hand , the reality is that , if the police officers robustly reject the imputations against them , such allegations will usually carry little weight with the jury unless the defendant backs them up by giving evidence . And , as Waller LJ pointed out , if the defendant fails to do so , the judge will be fully entitled to make a strong comment on that failure .", "CARDINAL . ... Even if PERSON had all along said that he would not give evidence , that would not , of itself , have been a reason why counsel could not have cross - examined the police officers to the effect that he had not made the statement , if Mr PERSON instructions were that counsel should do so . Indeed , as a matter of proper professional practice , he would still have been bound to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , he concluded that :", "\u201c DATE . The point does not actually arise in this case , however , since there is nothing in the affidavits of counsel to suggest that Mr PERSON proceeded as he did because he thought that it would have been professionally improper to suggest to the police witnesses that PERSON had not made the statement when PERSON was not going to give evidence to back it up . So ORG really proceeded on a basis for which there is no foundation in the attorneys\u2019 affidavits . In fact , the position taken by PERSON and Mr PERSON in their affidavits is simply that the allegation was not advanced because PERSON instructed that it should not be . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Considering the applicant \u2019s allegation that counsel had defied his instructions in not challenging the evidence of the police officers , Lord PERSON preferred the evidence of the trial lawyers :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Again , their Lordships note that this allegation did not surface until DATE after the trial . And , again , ORG notes that the allegation is hard to square with the obvious care taken by Mr PERSON to obtain his client \u2019s instructions at various points throughout the trial . Moreover , PERSON advances no reason why counsel should have chosen to flout his instructions on this matter , which by no means simplified the presentation of the defence case , especially in the voire dires . On the other hand , the line which counsel adopted in the voir dires was consistent with the instructions which they say that he had given them : standing those instructions , the only thing that they could try to do was to have the statement excluded on the grounds which Mr PERSON advanced and argued with great care , as is obvious from the transcript of the submissions made to the judge . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It is necessary to consider the consequence of the hypothesis that the Appellant \u2019s core allegation in his affidavit , viz that he told counsel that he did not make the confession , is or may be correct .

But ORG clearly thought that counsel did not put it to the police that they fabricated their version because he considered that it would have been improper to do so . Indeed that is what PERSON said . ORG would have been in a position to have a local view of counsel \u2019s perceptions of an advocate \u2019s duty ( mistaken as it was ) in the given situation . In any event this explains why counsel did not cross examine the police appropriately . The failure to do so ( when it was required ) amounts in the circumstances to a material irregularity .

It is quite wrong and improper conduct on the part of counsel to make a charge against the police or against any other witness by way of defence \u2013 because , of course , it would have been a defence if the statements which were the principal evidence against the applicants had been extracted from them by improper means \u2013 if he does not intend to call his client to give evidence to support the charge .", "....
