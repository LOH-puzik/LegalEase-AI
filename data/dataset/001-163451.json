The applicants are a married couple , PERSON and Mr GPE , their CARDINAL daughters , X and Y , and their son PERSON The children were born in DATE , respectively . The applicants have been in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants entered the GPE , where the first and second applicants filed separate asylum applications , and PERSON also filed applications on behalf of the other CARDINAL applicants ( the children , who were all minors ) . The immigration authorities conducted interviews with the first and second applicants on DATE ( eerste gehoor ) and CARDINAL DATE ( nader gehoor ) . An additional interview ( aanvullend gehoor ) was conducted with the second applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie , the \u201c Deputy Minister \u201d ) notified the first and second applicants of her intention ( voornemen ) to reject their asylum requests . In the light of various contradictions in the statements given by the first and second applicants , their inability to answer basic questions about the respective tribes they claimed to belong to , and the second applicant \u2019s inability to provide simple topographic details of the city and the surroundings of the place where he claimed he had grown up and/or to provide any details about the PERSON opposition movement ( goal , members , structure , leader ) for which he claimed to have been active , the Deputy Minister concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicants\u2019 asylum statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL separate decisions of DATE , after the ORG lawyer had filed written comments ( zienswijze ) concerning the intended refusals , the Deputy Minister rejected the first and second applicants\u2019 asylum requests , finding that the written comments had not dispelled her doubts concerning the credibility of their asylum statement .", "CARDINAL . The first and second ORG appeal against this decision were declared inadmissible on procedural grounds by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE sitting in GPE in a joint ruling , the first and second applicants having failed to submit the requisite grounds for their appeals , even though they had been given extra time to remedy this shortcoming . The applicants\u2019 objection ( verzet ) was dismissed on DATE by ORG . No further appeal lies against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants DATE and PERSON also on behalf of the other applicants DATE filed a second asylum request , which was based on essentially the same grounds as their initial request . They submitted various documents in support of their declaration . On CARDINAL DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) notified the first and second applicants of her intention to reject their fresh asylum request , holding that their repeat requests were not based on newly emerged facts or altered circumstances as required by section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . The new documents submitted by the first and second applicants only served to increase the already existing doubts as to the credibility of their asylum statement . In CARDINAL separate decisions of DATE , having received the ORG written comments on the intended decision , the Minister rejected the applicants\u2019 second asylum request on the grounds given in his notice of intention . The first and second applicants did not lodge an appeal against this decision before ORG of The Hague even though it would have been possible to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants , and PERSON also on behalf of the other applicants , filed a third asylum request based on the claim that , if they were to be sent back to GPE , their daughters NORP and Y would be subjected to female genital mutilation ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) , contrary to LAW , due to tribal and social pressure . In interviews with the immigration authorities held on DATE , the first and second applicants stated that they opposed ORG but would be unable to protect their daughters against it . They further submitted a document issued by ORG in the GPE on DATE stating that the applicants \u201c are all NORP citizens although they do not possess the requisite documents to enable them to obtain a NORP laissez - passer \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for ORG notified the first and second applicants separately of her intention to reject their third asylum request . The Minister doubted the sincerity of the applicants\u2019 purported fear that their daughter would be subjected to ORG because they had not raised this argument in their previous asylum requests . The Minister also took into consideration the order amending LAW ( Wijzigingsbesluit Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE , \u201c FAC \u201d ) , which was based on an official report on GPE drawn up by ORG ( Ministerie PERSON ) on DATE ( DPV / AMCARDINAL ) , according to which women who had had the benefit of a higher education ( namely a university or higher professional level education ) and who were living in the larger cities in GPE did not experience any social stigma for not subjecting their daughters to PERSON , whereas women in the rural areas who had received little or no schooling had little choice but to subject their daughters to this practice . As the first and second applicants had still not substantiated their personal identities or given a credible statement concerning their place of residence in GPE , the Minister considered that they had not established that they did not belong to the group of more highly educated people able to reject the practice of female circumcision . The Minister also considered that the second applicant constituted a danger to public order , having accepted a negotiated penalty ( transactieaanbod ) in order to settle out of court a criminal charge for shoplifting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed their written comments concerning the intended refusal of their third asylum request . They argued that the Minister had failed to present a proper reasoning for her finding that it had not been demonstrated that the first applicant did not belong to the group of highly educated women who would be able to resist the social pressure to circumcise their daughters , especially as the first applicant had stated in her first request for asylum that she had only had a primary school level education . The first applicant therefore offered to take an IQ test to prove her level of education .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL separate decisions of DATE the Minister rejected the first and second applicants\u2019 asylum request on the grounds detailed in her notice of intention . The Minister added that it was not for her to examine the first applicant \u2019s level of education through an IQ test but rather for the applicants to prove their identities and background in their asylum application .", "CARDINAL . In a joint ruling given on DATE the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE granted the first and second ORG appeals , quashed the impugned decisions and remitted the case to the Minister for a fresh decision . The provisional - measures judge held :", "\u201c The judge notes that it is no longer in dispute that the petitioners are NORP nationals . Nor is it in dispute that both daughters of the petitioners , currently DATE , have not been circumcised .", "According to the policy guidelines set out in CCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL Vc CARDINAL , a girl can DATE if return would entail a real risk of genital mutilation \u2013 qualify for an asylum - based residence permit ... The following conditions apply :", "there exists a risk of genital mutilation ;", "the authorities of the country of origin are unwilling or unable to provide protection to persons exposed to an imminent risk of genital mutilation ; and", "no internal relocation possibility is deemed to exist in the country of origin .", "According to chapter ACARDINAL Vc CARDINAL \u201c Country - specific part , the asylum policy in respect of GPE \u201d under QUANTITY Vc , genital mutilation is widespread in GPE . Although there is a Health Act forbidding genital mutilation , the NORP authorities hardly ensure compliance with that act . The parental freedom of choice ( as the court understands , whether or not to have their daughters circumcised ) is connected to the cultural attitudes of the family and surroundings . Women with a higher education in larger towns will generally not have their daughters circumcised . This will generally not give rise to problems from their social environment . The term \u2018 women with a higher education\u2019 is to be understood to mean women who have had an academic or higher vocational education . According to the official report of DATE , women with a low level of education living in rural areas have little choice . According to the same chapter it can not be deduced from the official report whether it is possible to avoid circumcision by settling elsewhere in GPE , meaning that for the assessment of the question whether there is an internal relocation alternative , each individual \u2019s declaration is of decisive importance .", "The defendant \u2019s refusal to grant the requested residence permit is based to a large extent on the fact that the identity and origin of , in particular , [ the first applicant ] has not been demonstrated , but also because in the proceedings concerning the first asylum request , it was found that statements lacking credence had been given . For that reason , it is not possible to assess whether the conditions set out in the policy guidelines are met .", "The refusal thus reasoned can not be upheld .", "The policy guidelines are aimed at protecting girls and women against circumcision , an act which according to the policy is to be seen as a violation of LAW [ of the Convention ] . ...", "The assertion that [ the first applicant ] based her first asylum request on an asylum statement subsequently found to be implausible is correct . However , it is unclear what the relevance of that conclusion is in the context of the present [ asylum ] application , which is concerned with the protection of the daughters and not of [ the parents ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister filed a further appeal against this judgment with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted the Minister \u2019s further appeal , quashed the judgment of ORG and rejected the first and second ORG appeal against the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE . It considered that , pursuant to section QUANTITY , it was for the applicants to demonstrate as plausible those facts and circumstances which could lead to the conclusion that they were eligible for admission pursuant to the policy in force , and not for the Minister to demonstrate the opposite . As not only the ORG statements about their identity and origin but also their asylum statement had been found to lack credibility in a decision of CARDINAL DATE which had obtained the force of res iudicata , the Minister could reasonably have found that the applicants had not made out a persuasive case to show that they complied with the conditions for admission under the policy concerned , that the authorities could not provide them with protection , and that there was no internal relocation alternative for them . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant , PERSON , gave birth to a daughter on DATE and to a son on DATE . On DATE was granted a GPE residence permit for the purpose of remaining with her partner . On DATE she informed the ORG that she did not wish to maintain the application in so far as it concerned her .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ) rejected a request for a residence permit filed by the fourth applicant , PERSON , who had come of age in the meantime . On the same day PERSON filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this refusal and , on DATE , she attended a hearing on that objection before an official commission during which she stated that in DATE , as a volunteer for CARDINAL non - governmental organisations , she had disseminated information about ORG , for which purpose she had attended a training course .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister rejected the fourth applicant \u2019s objection . In so far as the fourth applicant would allegedly be exposed to the risk of being subjected to circumcision in GPE , the Minister noted that her parents opposed this practice and therefore found it likely that they would not force PERSON to be circumcised . As regards pressure from the social environment , the Minister noted that PERSON had still not submitted any documents substantiating her identity or alleged PERSON origin . In this situation , the Minister found that it was not necessary to address the question of whether internal relocation would be a possibility . No further information about these proceedings has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fifth applicant , Mr PERSON , applied for a residence permit under LAW in the GPE ( overgangsregeling langdurig in GPE verblijvende kinderen ) , which provided that minors without a residence permit who had been residing in the GPE for DATE could obtain a residence permit if they met certain criteria . These criteria included that the minor in question must have applied for asylum DATE before reaching DATE and must not have evaded monitoring by the GPE authorities for DATE . The close family members of such minors could also qualify for accompanying family - member residence permits for close relatives ( that is to say parents and siblings ) . The fifth applicant also sought accompanying family - member residence permits for his parents , his sisters NORP X. , and for the latter \u2019s CARDINAL children , who are minors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this request was rejected by the Deputy Minister of Security and ORG ( Staatssecretaris PERSON ) , who held that the applicants had not been in touch with the designated immigration authorities for DATE . On DATE , after remittal of the case by ORG on DATE , the ORG objection was again rejected by the Deputy Minister . No further information about these proceedings has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE , the Deputy Minister informed the Mayor of GPE that he would not avail himself of his discretionary powers to admit the applicants to the GPE . The applicants\u2019 objection was declared inadmissible by the Deputy Minister , who held that the content of the letter of DATE was not a decision within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW which could be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings . Although the ORG appeal against this decision was granted on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE , it nevertheless held that the legal effects of the impugned decision were to remain intact .
