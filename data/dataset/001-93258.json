The complaint also cited the above medical records stating that the applicant had sustained grievous bodily injuries .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel pointed out that she had lodged a criminal complaint on DATE and asked to be informed of the case - file number .

On DATE the GPE State Attorney \u2019s ORG forwarded the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint to the Velika Gorica State Attorney \u2019s ORG . A medical report was prepared by a court expert in forensic medicine . As regards the injuries sustained by the applicant , the relevant part of the report reads :", "\u201c Examination and treatment of the victim , PERSON , established numerous blows which caused contusions and lacerations to his head and body each of which amounts to a bodily injury ( under the previous classification , a lesser bodily injury ) . The injuries were caused by several blows from one or more hard objects , possibly a fist , a shoe - clad foot or a similar object . If some of the blows were struck by a shoe - clad foot , the victim was most probably bent over or lying on the ground . Since the injuries are not described in detail , it is not possible to establish their number or the number of blows . The blows were of minor to medium intensity .", "The diagnosis of concussion , although mentioned , was not objectively established in the medical documentation enclosed in the file , and could therefore not be forensically accepted .", "Taken together , all of the injuries sustained by the victim PERSON amount to a bodily injury . \u201d", "As regards the injuries sustained by GPE , the relevant part of the report reads :", "\u201c Examination of GPE revealed CARDINAL stab wounds on his back . Since these wounds are not described in detail , only an indirect conclusion can be reached , namely that , given the lack of injuries in deeper structures , the wounds were shallow and each of them , taken separately and together , amounted to bodily injury . The injuries were caused by CARDINAL separate knife stabs or stab blows by a similar object . The stabs were of minor intensity . At the moment of stabbing the victim most probably had his back turned towards the assailant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Velika Gorica ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG decided not to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON on the ground that the medical analysis of the injuries sustained by the applicant indicated that the diagnosis of concussion could not be accepted forensically , given that all the other injuries were of a lesser nature . Under the relevant domestic law a prosecution for such injuries had to be brought privately by the victim , while a prosecution for grievous bodily injuries had to be initiated by the relevant ORG authorities . The applicant was thus instructed to proceed accordingly and to ask , within DATE , that a juvenile panel from a competent county court institute criminal proceedings against GPE", "CARDINAL . In her submissions of DATE to the Velika Gorica ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG , the applicant \u2019s counsel asked for the criminal complaint of DATE against the other suspects to be treated as a private prosecution for the offence under LAW of assault occasioning bodily harm .", "CARDINAL .

In her submissions to the Velika Gorica State Attorney \u2019s ORG of DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel argued that the decision of DATE not to prosecute concerned only the criminal complaint lodged by the police on DATE , but not the criminal complaint lodged by the applicant on DATE , since the latter was broader in scope than the police complaint . She further emphasised that the offence against the applicant was racially motivated and asked the ORG to act with reasonable expedition . She also argued that the failure to act by the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG had infringed the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights to equality and to life , and his rights not to be ill - treated , to have a competent court decide his rights and obligations , to respect for his private and family life and honour , and to protection from violence and hatred based on his nationality , race or religion .

In her submission to ORG of DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel stated that she was not in a position to find out PERSON \u2019s date of birth and that such information had to be requested from ORG . She also submitted that the order to proceed in accordance with sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG had been unclear . She further argued that the applicant had been prevented from prosecuting his assailants and that it was the practice of ORG not to prosecute acts of violence against citizens of GPE origin . She repeated the contentions she had made to the Velika Gorica State Attorney concerning the infringement of the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , ORG invited the applicant \u2019s counsel to explain whether the private prosecution of PERSON was to be considered as an application to the juvenile panel of a competent county court under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In her reply of DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel confirmed that this was the case . She further explained that on DATE the Velika Gorica ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG had given her an erroneous instruction to bring a private prosecution against PERSON since , under LAW , the prosecution of a minor could not be brought privately , but only by a competent ORG . She further pointed out that she had consulted the case file and that no expert assessment had been conducted of the injuries sustained by the applicant , contrary to the statement by the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG in its decision not to prosecute of DATE . She also argued that the offence in question had infringed the applicant \u2019s right to life and personal safety , and the prohibition of torture , inhuman and degrading treatment , and that he had had no effective remedy for the protection of those rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE addressed to the Velika Gorica State Attorney \u2019s ORG , the GPE State Attorney \u2019s Office expressed its view that the former body \u2019s decision not to prosecute PERSON had been erroneous and contrary to LAW , which required the competent ORG to undertake an official prosecution against minors even in respect of criminal offences otherwise subject to private prosecution . The GPE State Attorney \u2019s Office indicated that it was necessary to obtain information about PERSON from a competent ORG and then to declare the criminal complaint against PERSON inadmissible , in accordance with LAW , subject to the condition that PERSON be ordered to undertake CARDINAL of the measures listed in that provision .", "CARDINAL .
