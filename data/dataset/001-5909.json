FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director ORG , and Mr PERSON , Director , both of ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( valtiokonttori , statskontoret ) of ORG awarded the applicant a full state pension based on his public service . The pension amount would be reviewed DATE by ORG with reference to an index based on the national salary and price level . Such index adjustments took place up to and including DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was awarded , as from DATE , a national old - age pension with a supplementary award for his war - time service .", "In DATE and DATE ORG exceptionally amended the legislation on the index - based protection of pension benefits ( Acts nos . DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . With these amendments the index figure to be used for DATE and DATE was DATE , as opposed to the respective figures fixed by ministerial order ( DATE and DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant 's demand that the amount of his state pension be adjusted with reference to the index fixed by ORG . Reference was made to the exceptional legislation enacted in DATE . According to the notice of appeal attached to the decision , it could be challenged before ORG ( valtion el\u00e4kelautakunta , statens pensionsn\u00e4mnd ) . The applicant 's appeal was refused on DATE . ORG considered that the notice of appeal had been incorrect but nonetheless examined the merits of the appeal , finding that ORG had correctly applied the exceptional legislation in force . On the applicant 's further appeal ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , on DATE , quashed and nullified the decision of ORG to which the applicant had incorrectly been advised to appeal . ORG nevertheless found that ORG had had to refuse the applicant 's demand on the grounds stated in its decision and with reference to the legal provisions invoked therein . ORG was furthermore of the view that the decision in question could not be considered to violate provisions of the LAW . The applicant was later informed by the legal secretary on his case that , in DATE , an opinion on his appeal had been obtained from ORG .", "On DATE ORG , relying on the exceptional legislation enacted in DATE , refused the applicant 's demand that the amount of his state pension be based on the index figure fixed by ORG for DATE . On DATE his appeal was refused by ORG essentially for the same reasons as those stated in its decision of the same date with regard to the requested index adjustment for DATE . The applicant was later informed that , in DATE , an opinion on his appeal had been obtained from ORG .", "In DATE the applicant requested ORG ( verotuksen oikaisulautakunta , skatter\u00e4ttelsen\u00e4mnden ) to review the imposition on him of a national social insurance fee for DATE . He argued that no such fee had been provided by the DATE decision to grant him old - age pension . The imposition of the fee was upheld on DATE . The applicant 's appeal was refused by ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON on DATE with reference to Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which had temporarily amended LAW ( kansanel\u00e4kelaki , folkpensionslagen CARDINAL ) by no longer excluding pensioners from the imposition of a national insurance fee . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG , arguing , inter alia , that his DATE fee was higher than his old - age pension . The imposition of the fee , taken together with the exceptional legislation blocking index - based increases in his state pension , was effectively depriving him of yet further property to which he had a legitimate claim . Having granted leave to appeal , ORG , on DATE , refused the appeal , considering that the DATE pension decision had been silent as to the conditions for imposing a national social insurance fee on a pensioner who had reached DATE . Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which provided for such imposition , had been enacted on DATE and had been applied during DATE . Its wording had not been ambiguous and its application could not be affected by the constitutional provisions protecting private property and prohibiting discrimination . Nor did LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention have any impact on the collection of a fee with the character of a tax .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant 's demand that the national social insurance fee imposed on him for DATE be lifted as being unconstitutional . On DATE his appeal was refused by ORG with reference to Act no . DATE , which had prolonged the temporary amendment to LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , and on the grounds of principle relied on by ORG in its decision of DATE concerning the imposition of the insurance fee for DATE . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "In DATE LAW was amended to the effect that , in DATE , the national pension ( e.g. , the old - age pension ) was to be replaced by a pension calculated with reference to new criteria . Those whose total income in the form of other pensions and various compensations exceeded certain ceilings would no longer be entitled to a national pension . In such a case the so - called basic amount ( pohja - osa , basdel ) of their national pension would be reduced by MONEY annually DATE ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG ( kansanel\u00e4kelaitos , folkpensionsanstalten ) refused the applicant 's demand that he should continue receiving the basic amount of his old - age pension as adjusted in accordance with the relevant index figure to be applied according to the provisions in force when the pension was granted . On DATE ORG ( tarkastuslautakunta , pr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden ) dismissed his appeal with reference to LAW . The decision further referred to an opinion obtained from ORG . This opinion was not communicated to the applicant for possible comments . No further appeal lay open ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
