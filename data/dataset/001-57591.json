ORG The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE . He resides in GPE where he exercises the profession of avocat ( lawyer ) . After being enrolled as a pupil avocat on DATE , he at once opened his own chambers without ever working in the chambers of another avocat ; his pupil - master , however , entrusted him with a number of cases and gave him some payment for the work done in regard to them .", "Mr. PERSON terminated his pupillage on DATE and has since then been entered on the register of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG of the Antwerp Bar appointed Mr. PERSON , pursuant to LAW , to defend ORG , a NORP national . The latter , who had been arrested DATE on suspicion of theft and of dealing in , and possession of , narcotics , had applied under LAW for the assistance of an officially appointed avocat .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON appeared before a Chamber ( chambre du conseil ) of ORG ( tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance ) , which was supervising the investigation , for the purpose of a decision as to whether the warrant of arrest issued against him by the investigating judge should remain in force . The ORG confirmed the warrant on both occasions . It also added to the initial charges a further count of publicly using a false name . Mr. PERSON appealed against these CARDINAL orders , but ORG of ORG upheld them on DATE and DATE respectively .", "On DATE , ORG sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for theft , public use of a false name and illegal residence ; he was acquitted on the remaining charges . On his appeal , ORG on DATE reduced the length of the sentence to that of the period he had spent in detention on remand .", "The applicant had acted for Mr. PERSON throughout these proceedings and estimated that he devoted from TIME to the matter . Mr. PERSON was released on DATE following representations made by the applicant to the Minister of ORG ; he had in the meantime been placed at the disposal of the immigration police with a view to deportation .", "CARDINAL . ORG The following day , ORG notified Mr. PERSON - whose pupillage had finished CARDINAL and a DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) - that it was releasing him from the case and that because of Mr. PERSON \u2019s lack of resources no assessment of fees and disbursements could be made against him . The latter amounted on this occasion to CARDINAL ORG , made up of CARDINAL BF for preparation of the case - file , CARDINAL BF for correspondence , CARDINAL BF for travel to and from the prison , ORG and ORG , and CARDINAL BF in respect of court costs for the copy of a document .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant stated that during his pupillage he had dealt with CARDINAL cases , including CARDINAL cases - representing TIME of work - on which he had acted as officially appointed avocat . He also said that his net DATE income before tax was CARDINAL BF in DATE , increasing to CARDINAL BF in the third .", "CARDINAL . ORG Although it is in various respects regulated by legislation , the profession of avocat in GPE is a liberal profession ; under LAW , \" avocats exercise their profession freely in the interests of justice and truth \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG In each of the country \u2019s CARDINAL judicial districts , there is an ORG ; it is independent of the executive and endowed with legal personality in public law and its ORG takes decisions \" without appeal \" with regard to entry on the register of avocats and admission to pupillage ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) .", "A pupillage normally lasting DATE is a pre - requisite to entry on the register of avocats ( LAW and the second paragraph of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Subject to the powers of ORG , ORG determines the obligations of pupils ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In the main these consist of attending at a pupil - master \u2019s chambers , attending hearings , following courses on the rules of professional conduct and the art of advocacy ( Article CARDINAL , third paragraph ) and acting as defence counsel in cases assigned by ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . ORG ensures that these obligations are complied with and may , if need be , prolong the pupillage \" without prejudice to the right to refuse entry on the register \" ; any pupil who is unable , after DATE at the latest , to show that he or she has satisfied the said obligations \" may be omitted from the roll \" of pupils ( Article CARDINAL , second and fourth paragraphs ) .", "Pupils in principle enjoy the same rights as their colleagues who are already entered on the register of avocats . However , they may not plead before ORG or the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat ( LAW ) , vote in elections of the chairman or other members of ORG ) or deputise for judges and members of the public prosecutor \u2019s department .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the oath that he takes at the end of his pupillage , the avocat undertakes , amongst other things , not to advise or appear in any case which he does not consider to the best of his knowledge and belief to be just ( LAW Subject to the exceptions provided for by law , for example in LAW and LAW , avocats - including pupil avocats - enjoy an exclusive right of audience before the courts ( LAW ) . They pay a subscription to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) and social security contributions .", "CARDINAL . The Council of the Ordre sanctions or punishes as a disciplinary matter offences and misconduct , without prejudice , where appropriate , to proceedings before the courts ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph ) . It will hear disciplinary cases on application made by its chairman , either of his own motion or following a complaint or after a written notification from the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ( public prosecutor ) ( Article CARDINAL ) . The ORG may , depending on the circumstances , warn , censure , reprimand , suspend for a maximum of DATE or strike a name off the register of avocats or the roll of pupils ( LAW ) .", "Both the avocat concerned and the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral may challenge such a decision - finding the avocat guilty or not guilty - by applying to the competent disciplinary appeal board ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The disciplinary appeal board is composed of a chairman ( who is the first president of ORG or a president of a chamber delegated by him ) , CARDINAL assessors ( who are avocats ) and a secretary ( who is a member or former member of ORG ) ; the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or a judicial officer from his department delegated by him fulfils the functions of prosecuting authority ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "The avocat concerned or the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral may refer the decision of the disciplinary appeal board to ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In GPE , as in many other GPE , there exists a long tradition that the Bar should provide legal representation , if need be on a free basis , for indigent persons . At the time of the relevant facts , ORG was under a duty to make provision for \" the assistance of persons of insufficient means \" by setting up a \" ORG \" in such manner as it should determine ( Article CARDINAL , first paragraph , of LAW ) . \" Obviously ill - founded cases [ were not to ] be allocated \" ( second paragraph of the same Article ) , but in criminal matters ORG had to make an officially appointed - or \" pro PERSON \" - avocat available to any indigent accused who so requested DATE before the hearing ( LAW ) .", "Officially appointed avocats were thus designated by the ORG by virtue of a statutory competence conferred by the ORG . In GPE and GPE a system of rotation was used whereas in GPE the matter was dealt with on a more flexible basis . The ORG almost always selected pupil avocats who , if need be , had to continue acting in the case even after the end of their pupillage , as occurred in the present circumstances ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It nonetheless happened - in less than one per cent of the cases - that a difficult case was entrusted to a more experienced avocat .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under the third paragraph of LAW , pupil avocats were required to \" report to the [ ORG on the steps they [ had ] taken in the cases entrusted to them \" ; such cases accounted on average for DATE of their working time , especially during DATE . The ORG des avocats would decline to enter a pupil avocat on the register unless he had acted as officially appointed avocat on a sufficient number of occasions ; ORG enjoyed considerable discretion in the matter since no minimum or maximum was laid down in its pupillage regulations .", "Pupil avocats could invoke the so - called \" conscience clause \" laid down in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or objective grounds of incompatibility . In the event of an unjustified refusal to deal with cases that the ORG wished to allocate to him , ORG could extend the pupillage of a pupil avocat to a maximum period of DATE , strike his name off the roll of pupils or refuse his application for entry on the register of avocats for failure to perform fully his obligations ( Article CARDINAL , second and fourth paragraphs ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Officially appointed avocats were entitled neither to remuneration nor to reimbursement of their expenses . Nevertheless , ORG could , \" depending upon the circumstances , .... fix the amount which the [ assisted ] party [ was ] required to pay either by way of advance provision or as fees \" ( LAW , final paragraph , of LAW ) . In practice such awards tended to be somewhat exceptional - in CARDINAL case out of CARDINAL at GPE - and , what is more , pupil avocats only succeeded in actually recovering QUANTITY", "CARDINAL . ORG The position described in the preceding paragraph has changed in CARDINAL respect subsequent to the end of the applicant \u2019s pupillage : an Act of DATE \" intended to furnish a partial solution to the problem of legal aid and regulating the remuneration of pupil avocats appointed to provide legal aid \" has amended LAW by , inter alia , inserting the following provisions :", "\" The ORG shall grant to the pupil avocat appointed by ORG compensation in respect of the services which he was appointed to render .", "After obtaining the opinion of ORG , the King shall prescribe , by Decree laid before ORG , the conditions governing the granting , scale and manner of payment of such compensation . \"", "In certain circumstances , the ORG will be able to take action against the assisted person to recover the compensation awarded .", "The LAW is not retroactive . Furthermore , for the moment it remains inoperative since budgetary reasons have up till now prevented the bringing into force of LAW provided for LAW CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG The official appointment of an avocat should not be confused with CARDINAL other possibilities which are likewise often included in the notion of legal aid , namely", "- \" official assignment \" , which is provided for under the law in various circumstances where the intervention of an avocat is obligatory , independently of the means of the person concerned ( Articles CARDINAL , second paragraph , and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code , LAW , etc . ) ;", "- \" legal aid \" in the narrow sense , which \" consists of exempting , in whole or in part , persons whose income is insufficient to meet the costs of proceedings , including extrajudicial proceedings , from paying stamp duty , registration duty , registry and copying fees and any other expenditure involved \" , and of providing \" the services of public and publicly appointed officers free \" for such persons ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code ) .", "CARDINAL .
