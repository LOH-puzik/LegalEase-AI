While they were conducting a field search in line formation they came under fire somewhere between GPE and GPE . The gunfire was directed at them from a rocky area , a creek and from the hills around . The security forces , numbering DATE , took cover and returned fire using mainly GCARDINAL and ACARDINAL guns with an effective range of CARDINAL as well as longer range MGCARDINAL and ORG machine guns . The firing distance between the security forces and their assailants varied QUANTITY . The terrorists retreated after TIME and in the lull a search of the scene of the attack was carried out during which the security forces recovered a dead body alongside of which lay an automatic assault gun ( later confirmed as NORP - made in the ballistics report \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) bearing the serial number DATE together with ammunition including CARDINAL cartridge clips , CARDINAL rounds of which were spent and CARDINAL unused .

In this statement , the applicant declared that ORG was injured while running away and that the security forces followed him to the bushes and killed him there .", "The applicant stated that the security forces alone took photographs of the body and when the applicant 's family received the body they had to bury it immediately . An autopsy was conducted but the applicant was not given a copy of the autopsy report although he had requested CARDINAL . The applicant also declared in the statement that the witnesses who saw the body of ORG had left the village , being frightened of the security forces and the intimidation to which they would be subjected if they spoke out publicly . He could not remember any of the names of the villagers who witnessed the killing . The applicant concluded his statement by mentioning that FAC had been detained at ORG gendarmerie headquarters for DATE for questioning and then released .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintains that his account of the events is confirmed by statements made by PERSON to the authorities in circumstances which would have made it impossible for the latter to know of the content of his own statements ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP This statement was taken following a letter dated CARDINAL DATE from the public prosecutor at ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . When PERSON made the statement , he was detained in FAC for possession of hashish .", "CARDINAL . Like PERSON , ORG was from the village of FAC . On DATE PERSON left his house to go and tend his beehives which were situated on a piece of land along a road between PERSON and ORG . When he was leaving GPE , he met PERSON who asked if he could accompany him .", "When he reached his beehives , he heard some people running and saw CARDINAL soldiers approaching him . The soldiers tied up his hands and asked who he was and why he was wandering about . TIME the soldiers noticed ORG running away . The soldiers shouted after him to stop , but he either did not hear them or chose to ignore them as he increased his pace . The lieutenant ordered the soldiers to shoot at ORG feet . At that time ORG was CARDINAL away .", "When the soldiers started shooting at his feet , ORG began to run towards ORG . The soldiers chased him , taking LOC along with them . ORG disappeared beyond a slope and when the soldiers reached the slope he was nowhere to be seen . They then came to the QUANTITY or so houses which are situated at a short distance from LOC where they encountered some other soldiers who said that they had seen ORG . PERSON and the soldiers waited in the street for TIME . He then heard shots being fired ; he estimates that CARDINAL cartridges were fired . TIME a helicopter landed but it was too far away from LOC for him to be able to see what was happening . The helicopter left again after TIME . Later a lieutenant approached PERSON and told him \u201c we have killed PERSON \u201d .", "PERSON was taken to ORG and kept in custody for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Aksoy is said to have made this statement whilst in detention following his arrest on DATE . According to the applicant the statement can not be taken to be reliable and must be considered to have been obtained under pressure , as confirmed by PERSON \u2019s subsequent retraction ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Aksoy states how from DATE he provided food to groups of Workers\u2019 Party of GPE ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) members who came to his village of LOC .

After ORG had appeared , he and one of the ORG members talked to each other in a separate place . DATE CARDINAL ORG members arrived with a group of CARDINAL people . ORG was told to organise the attendance of villagers at a funeral . DATE the military staged an operation during which ORG died .

NORP This report was drawn up by Dr Arzu Do\u011fru who had been flown to the scene of the fatal shooting to perform the field autopsy . It was prepared on - the - spot ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report states that following a telephone call from the district gendarmerie headquarters on DATE to the effect that the body of a person belonging to the ORG terrorist organisation had been captured during a clash , the public prosecutor PERSON and the District Government doctor PERSON set out by military helicopter , accompanied by a gendarme staff sergeant who was to act as clerk . On arrival at the scene the body was found to be lying on its back in the bushes on the bank of a creek . It was moved to a flat piece of ground . Beside the body there was a PERSON rifle with serial number CARDINAL and CARDINAL round of ammunition containing CARDINAL full and CARDINAL empty cartridges . The body is described as being that of a CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE man with grey hair and dressed in blue and grey trousers with a cummerbund round the waist , a sleeveless black vest and a striped DATE shirt , wearing rubber shoes but no socks . Since there was no one at the scene of the incident who could identify the body , the security forces took photographs from several angles .", "CARDINAL . A large number of bullet entry and exit holes were found in the neck of the body , in the throat , above the heart , in the upper left area of the abdomen , around the navel and around the groin , in the left hip and in the femur of both legs .

As the result of these findings , the cause of death is clear . There is no need to carry out a classical autopsy . The conditions in the field combined with the fact that we do not have sufficient security or instruments are in any case an impediment to performing a full classical autopsy . From the above findings I have come to the conclusion that the deceased died from cardiovascular insufficiency as a result of the wounds caused by firearms . That is my definite opinion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report further states that the rifle and the ammunition were seized for safekeeping as corpus delicti . It concludes by stating that the forensic examination of the body and the autopsy procedure had been completed . The report is signed by , inter alia , First Lieutenant PERSON as the person receiving the body .", "CARDINAL . Following the events of DATE and the identification of the body as that of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , a decision of non - jurisdiction was issued on DATE by PERSON , public prosecutor at ORG , and the file was transferred to the public prosecutor at ORG .", "In his decision , the public prosecutor stated that \u201c the preliminary documents have been examined \u201d in respect of a crime committed by ORG who , together with other ORG terrorists , took part on DATE in an armed clash with the security forces The decision describes how the body of the deceased was recovered by the security forces after the clash together with an assault rifle and spent ammunition . The decision notes that the ballistics report on the weapon was not yet available . The public prosecutor concluded that , having regard to the aims of the terrorists and to the fact that the attack took place in an area subject to emergency rule , the investigation should be carried out by the prosecuting authorities of ORG on account of the fact that he lacked jurisdiction in the matter .", "ORG in turn transmitted the file to ORG for investigation .", "CARDINAL . An expert report on the weapon and ammunition found beside ORG body was drawn up by the ORG police forensic laboratory on DATE . The report , which was not available at the time the public prosecutor issued his decision of non - jurisdiction ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , stated that the weapon was a NORP - made PERSON automatic rifle serial no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and that the CARDINAL spent bullets examined had been fired from the rifle \u201c which was found with the dead terrorist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor , apparently at the request of ORG at ORG , took a statement in relation to the death of ORG from FAC while the latter was detained at ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before the ORG , the ORG were requested to supply the photographs which were allegedly appended to the autopsy report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The authorities have so far been unable to retrieve the photographs .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held before two Commission delegates in ORG on DATE oral evidence was taken from CARDINAL witnesses : ( i ) Dr Arzu Do\u011fru , who conducted the field autopsy on the deceased ; ( ii ) First Lieutenant PERSON ; ( iii ) Senior PERSON ; ( iv ) Senior PERSON ; and ( v ) PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not attend the hearing . He notified the Commission on DATE that he feared reprisals if he were to give evidence at the hearing . The nature of his fears was not specified . Nor did Mr PERSON appear . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON , through the intermediary of ORG , informed the Commission that he and his family had been subjected to pressure by the police in order to prevent him from giving evidence at the hearing and he would not therefore be attending .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , although summoned to give evidence , neither the ORG public prosecutor , Mr PERSON , nor the public prosecutor attached to ORG attended the hearing . The former was unavailable on account of other commitments and the latter had taken the view that he would be unable to give any relevant information to the delegates on the pursuit of the investigation into ORG death since he had only become involved in the investigation after jurisdiction had been transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission assessed the documentary and oral evidence before it on the basis of the evidentiary standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt , taking into account the fact that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . In this respect it noted that the failure of the applicant and of Mr PERSON as well as of the CARDINAL public prosecutors to give evidence at the hearing in ORG had a considerable impact on the determination of whether the evidentiary standard had been attained . The Commission noted however that the applicant was not a direct witness to the events and his testimony would therefore have been of limited evidentiary value . On the other hand , the presence of FAC would have been valuable since he claimed to be an eyewitness and his failure to attend meant that he could not be cross - examined with a view to assessing his credibility and the probative value of his evidence . Further , the absence of any detailed investigation at the domestic level into the circumstances surrounding the death of the applicant \u2019s brother ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) meant that the Commission had to reach its conclusions on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence which it itself had collected in accordance with its powers under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s assessment of the evidence concerning the death of ORG can be summarised as follows :", "( i ) The only clear and undisputed facts were that on DATE the body of ORG was found lying in the bushes on the bank of a creek near the village of GPE . The body was dressed in blue and grey trousers with a cummerbund round the waist , a sleeveless black vest and a striped DATE shirt , wearing rubber shoes but not socks . A large number of bullet entry and exit holes were found in the neck of the body , in the throat , above the heart , in the upper left area of the abdomen , around the navel and the groin , in the left hip and in the femur of both legs . The bones of the legs were broken as a result of the impact of the bullets . The total number of bullet wounds is not recorded in the autopsy report but was estimated by Dr Arzu Do\u011fru in his oral evidence to the delegates as CARDINAL or eight . It was also not in dispute that an autopsy , consisting only of an external examination , was carried out on the body by Dr Do\u011fru at or near the site of the killing and that subsequently the body was handed over on the instructions of First Lieutenant PERSON to CARDINAL villagers from the nearby GPE .", "( ii ) The accounts of the clash given by the soldiers whose evidence was heard ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , while deficient in detail , were broadly consistent and in line with the Government \u2019s version of the events ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "( iii ) There were however a number of factors which gave reason to doubt the ORG \u2019s account of the events : there was CARDINAL casualty despite the number of soldiers ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) and ORG terrorists ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) engaged in the gun battle which reportedly lasted DATE ; the extent and severity of the bullet wounds to the deceased \u2019s body having regard to the range of the soldiers\u2019 weapons ( QUANTITY ) and the firing distance between the soldiers and their attackers ( QUANTITY ) ; the fact that there were bullet wounds to all parts of the body suggested that the deceased must have been fully exposed to gunfire whereas neither he nor any of the other terrorists had actually been seen during the clash ; the deceased \u2019s clothing was not typical of NORP mountain apparel ; the body was handed CARDINAL unknown villagers even though he was considered to have been an active terrorist ; and the absence of any forensic evidence linking the deceased to the weapon found beside his body .", "CARDINAL . While the Commission took the view that the matters referred to above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( iii ) ) gave rise to concern and were difficult to reconcile with the undisputed facts , it could not be concluded on the basis of a general assessment of the written and oral evidence that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that ORG was deliberately killed by soldiers in the circumstances alleged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s assessment of the inquiries and investigation into the death of ORG was made in the absence of any detailed investigation by the authorities into the events of DATE and without the delegates having had the benefit of the oral evidence of the key public prosecutors responsible at various stages for the investigation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Commission considered the reasons given for their non - attendance at the delegates\u2019 hearing unconvincing .", "The ORG found that the autopsy performed on the body was defective and incomplete . In the first place , no attempt had been made to record the number of bullets which struck the deceased or the distance from which the bullets had been fired and the autopsy report was imprecise as regards the location of the entry and exit wounds . Secondly , no tests for fingerprints or gunpowder traces on the deceased \u2019s clothes or body were made at the scene . While acknowledging that the autopsy and the forensic examination may have been carried out under difficult field conditions in view of the security situation , the ORG found it remarkable that the body was not flown to a place where further analyses could have been made of , for example , the bullets lodged in the body . The handing over of the body to the villagers precluded any further examination . Thirdly , it appeared to the ORG that the authorities took it for granted that the deceased was a ORG terrorist and they did not consider it necessary to examine seriously the possibility that he had been killed in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the security forces . In this respect , the Commission had regard to the mention made in the autopsy report that the deceased was a ORG terrorist , to the wording of the non - jurisdiction decision issued by the public prosecutor , Mr PERSON , ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and to the apparent failure of the public prosecutor attached to ORG to put any questions to PERSON about the deceased \u2019s possible involvement with the ORG ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted before the ORG and the ORG that the following domestic law is relevant to the case .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL ( instituting the state of emergency ) , security forces , special forces on duty and members of the armed forces are , in the circumstances stipulated in the relevant Act , empowered to use their weapons when carrying out their duties . The security forces thus empowered may open fire and shoot at a person if a command to surrender is not accepted , is disobeyed or met with counter - fire or if they have to act in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . The plea of self - defence is enacted in LAW which , in so far as relevant , provides :", "\u201c No punishment shall be imposed if the perpetrator acted ...", "CARDINAL . in immediate necessity to repel an unjust assault against his own or another 's person or chastity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Code contains provisions dealing with unintentional homicide ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , intentional homicide ( Article CARDINAL ) and murder ( Article CARDINAL ) . In respect of these offences , complaints may be lodged , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities . The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them ( LAW ) , the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated , pursuant to LAW . A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has drawn attention to the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL which requires a public prosecutor to transfer authority for the investigation of allegations against the security forces to local administrative boards or councils . According to the applicant this provision is immune from judicial challenge , being contained in a decree having the force of law . An identical provision in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG ( the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE ) was in fact declared unconstitutional by ORG in a decision of DATE . The applicant contends that the administrative boards , which are composed of appointed civil servants with no legal training , lack independence and entrust investigations into alleged wrongdoing by members of the security forces to a senior member of the security forces . The investigator makes a recommendation as to whether or not a prosecution should be initiated and this recommendation is endorsed by the administrative board whose decisions are subject to review by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government have provided the ORG with a description of the relationship between criminal and civil liability under NORP law .", "When a civil court decides on whether a person was at fault in respect of the commission of a particular act it is not bound by criminal - law considerations . The judge in a civil case is not bound by the rules of the criminal law on liability nor by the decision of a criminal court to acquit a person of the wrongdoing which forms the object of civil - law proceedings . It follows from LAW that the judge in civil matters does not need to adopt the findings of a criminal court as regards either the absence of fault or the existence and degree of fault .", "Article CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The court is not bound by the provisions of the penal laws concerning criminal responsibility nor by an acquittal by a criminal court in deciding questions of fault or capacity to act . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , considerations of crime and fault are not the same as in civil law . Criminal liability comprises the imposition of sanctions whereas civil law is only concerned with the payment of compensation to a plaintiff who can establish fault on the part of the defendant . Liabilities in criminal and civil - law proceedings are determined at different levels and in accordance with different criteria . Under the criminal law , intent on the part of the accused has to be established ; in principle it does not consider negligence as a fault in terms of criminal liability . The position is different under civil law .", "CARDINAL . The criminal court may decide the criminal aspects of a case as well as its civil aspects if requested by the aggrieved party under LAW . Thus , the criminal court may make an award of damages . In such a case the criminal court \u2019s decision on the payment of compensation is binding .", "CARDINAL . A civil court dealing with a claim for compensation against a defendant does not need to await a preliminary ruling from a criminal court hearing the criminal - law aspects of the case . It is only where a criminal court has ruled that an accused has committed an act amounting to an offence that a civil court would be bound by that finding . However if the criminal court has acquitted an accused person on the ground that the evidence against him was not sufficient to sustain a conviction , the civil court would not be bound by that decision if the act of which he was accused formed the object of civil litigation . The issue of civil - law liability would be determined in accordance with civil rules and procedures . On this latter point a court of appeal ruled in DATE that :", "\u201c The fact that the criminal proceedings resulted in the acquittal of the suspect or the fact that the wrongful act had been committed by many people [ and ] it is not possible to determine who committed it shall not bind the civil court judge in a compensation case opened afterwards . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
