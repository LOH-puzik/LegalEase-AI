LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "After GPE regained independence in DATE , ORG , concerning the restitution of property rights to property nationalised by the NORP authorities , was enacted . The applicant , an NORP citizen at that time , requested the authorities to restore to him the property rights to a building owned by the applicant \u2019s late relatives prior to nationalisation .", "By letters of DATE and DATE , ORG informed the applicant that his request could not be granted because he did not meet the criteria set out in ORG , namely , he did not have NORP citizenship and did not reside in the country . On DATE the ORG \u2019s office also informed the applicant about the citizenship and residence requirements .", "On DATE the applicant started an exceptional Presidential procedure to obtain NORP citizenship . On DATE the applicant gained NORP citizenship by a decree of the ORG \u2019s President . In DATE the applicant requested the domestic courts to extend the statutory time - limit for his application for restitution , which had lapsed on DATE . The applicant submitted that he could not have applied for the restitution of his claimed property rights within the statutory time - limit because he had not had NORP citizenship earlier . He also noted that he did not know the NORP language and did not reside in GPE , which made it difficult for him to claim his rights within the time - limit . Before the courts the applicant was represented by counsel , who was present at all the hearings .", "On DATE ORG granted the request . The court held that the applicant had actively sought to have his property rights restored and noted that his requests for restitution had been admitted and examined . Furthermore , the applicant had sought NORP citizenship in order to fulfil all the requirements of ORG . The court observed that in DATE the law was amended to include a possibility to extend the time - limit for applications for restitution and found no reason to deprive the applicant of that possibilty .", "On DATE ORG overturned the decision and dismissed the request by the applicant . The court stated that the applicant , not being a NORP citizen before DATE , did not meet the criteria set out in the law and thus could not claim restitution of property rights . The applicant had only become a NORP citizen on DATE , after the time - limit for restitution applications had already expired . The examination of the provisions regulating the matter allowed the conclusion that the time - limit for submitting a restitution request could only be extended in respect of those persons who had acquired the right within the prescribed time - limit , but who had not been able to make use of it properly within the deadline for good reasons . The submission of the request for restitution , its time - limit and the extension of that deadline were interconnected . The applicant did not have the right to the restitution of property within the statutory time - limit until DATE because he had not been a NORP citizen . Thus , the legal provision regarding the extension of the time - limit was not applicable to his situation . Furthermore , the court observed that the applicant had only applied for citizenship under the exceptional Presidential procedure in DATE , whereas there had been nothing to stop him taking action earlier .", "ORG Nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 ... atk\u016brimo \u012fstatymas ) ( amended on numerous occasions ) provides that the right to property nationalised by the NORP authorities can only be restored to persons who are citizens of GPE . Under LAW , applications for the restitution of property rights could be submitted up until DATE . The time - limit of DATE was set for the production of any additional supporting documents which could not have been submitted earlier in respect of applications made before DATE . LAW , as amended on DATE , provides that the time - limit for both an application for the restitution of property rights and the submission of supporting documents could be extended if substantial reasons for missing the deadline existed . Whether those reasons are sufficiently important is to be established by the courts on a case - by - case basis ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
