SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and her twin daughters , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr J. Nystr\u00f6m , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The first applicant arrived in GPE from GPE , GPE on DATE and applied for asylum on DATE . She submitted before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) that she had been subjected to an attempted female genital mutilation ( ORG ) or possibly to an initiation to the Mungiki sect by friends of her former boyfriend .", "In DATE the applicant had allegedly run away from home to marry her boyfriend , with whom she had been in a relationship for DATE . The boyfriend , who belonged to the NORP sect , had taken her to see an old man who had performed some sort of ritual . She did not know if the ritual had been performed in order for them to get married or if it had been an initiation to the Mungiki group . After the ritual her boyfriend had taken her to a friend \u2019s home and subsequently left the house . His friends had told her that they were going to perform ORG on her . When she refused to cooperate , they had beaten and raped her . They had been interrupted by neighbours who had heard her scream , but the perpetrators had told her that she would not get away . After the incident she had returned to her family home and told her mother about the incident . Her mother had urged her to report the perpetrators , but she had been afraid to do so as the boyfriend \u2019s clan had great influence on the police and authorities . Instead she had moved to a friend \u2019s home in PERSON shortly after the incident and had subsequently left the country , due to her fear of being found by her boyfriend . She feared that she would be killed or persecuted by her boyfriend or other members of the PERSON group as she had refused ORG and had run away .", "Shortly after her arrival in GPE , the applicant met a man and became pregnant . The man , who was later deported from GPE , did not want to take any responsibility for the applicant or his children .", "On DATE ORG questioned the applicant \u2019s credibility and rejected the request for asylum . ORG noted that ORG was prohibited by law in GPE , but was still practised , inter alia , by the Mungiki sect . It further noted that women at risk of being subjected to ORG often did not receive sufficient protection . However , the applicant had stated that her mother opposed female genital mutilation , and that she had urged the applicant to report the perpetrators to the police . Furthermore , the applicant had not known the purpose of the ritual to which she had been subjected and it was therefore found unlikely to have been an initiation to the Mungiki sect . It was noted that the applicant \u2019s boyfriend had not searched for her , despite her claim that he knew where she was . ORG found that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the NORP authorities and her own family . According to her own information , ORG was no longer practised by her people , the NORP .", "On DATE the second and third applicants were born .", "The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) and added that she had given birth to CARDINAL children out of wedlock and would be regarded as a prostitute in GPE . She submitted that she was no longer in contact with her mother , and did not know how her mother would react to the applicant having children . She had travelled to GPE by plane via another NORP country , but did not know which . She had not carried a passport .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . The court found reason to question the applicant \u2019s story , in particular with regard to her identity and her travel route to GPE . This affected her overall credibility . Her account of the alleged incident was considered vague . She had not known whether the alleged ritual was an initiation or a wedding ceremony , and her description of the ritual contradicted country information . The court considered that it was not likely that the applicant had been married or initiated through the alleged ritual . She was considered to have been subjected to a criminal offence performed by private actors and such criminal activity was predominantly an issue for the NORP authorities . Referring to relevant country information , the court found that the police were taking measures to control the NORP sect . The applicant had failed to demonstrate that the domestic authorities were not willing or able to protect her . It was furthermore noted that ORG was not performed by her people , and that her family opposed the tradition .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrations - \u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "An application for asylum was also submitted on behalf of the second and third applicants . It referred to their mother \u2019s involvement with the Mungiki sect and stated that they were at risk of ORG if deported to GPE . It was also submitted that they would be at risk of ill - treatment as they had been born out of wedlock .", "On DATE ORG rejected the second and third applicants\u2019 request for asylum . ORG referred to its decision regarding the first applicant and found that it was not plausible that they would be at risk of ORG and ill - treatment on return to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the second and third ORG appeal and upheld the ORG \u2019s decision .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "The provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) .", "LAW , LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , religious or political beliefs , grounds of gender , sexual orientation and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "NORP country information ( NORP Landinfo , Report GPE : Mungiki \u2013 Abusers or abused ? , DATE ) describes the PERSON group as follows .", "\u201c [ T]he Mungiki movement [ is ] the largest and best known of the organised armed criminal , political and religious groups in GPE , with a large following among the PERSON . PERSON operates primarily in the GPE slums , in LOC and in LOC . Although PERSON offers poor residents in slum areas protection and social services , extortion and violence tend to constitute their mode of operation . PERSON human rights violations perpetrated against civilians , adversaries and defecting members are attributed to them . The NORP authorities have not succeeded in their attempts to limit PERSON \u2019s influence or abuses , despite recent crack downs ... \u201d", "The Mungiki movement is also reportedly \u201c encouraging , demanding and enforcing female genital mutilation practices upon girls and women in its communities \u201d , including partners and family members of those who have joined the movement . Members who defect are at serious risk of being killed or harassed .", "In a report on female genital mutilation , ORG states that the prevalence of the practice in GPE has decreased in DATE . Throughout GPE , PERCENT of all women have been mutilated . Among PERSON , PERCENT of all women aged DATE are said to have been mutilated ( ORG , ORG . Towards the Abandonment of Female Genital Mutilation / Cutting in DATE , DATE ) .", "More recently , ORG Note \u2013 GPE , DATE ) stated the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL The Government of GPE has taken a clear position on the abandonment of ORG and other harmful tribal practices . It is illegal to carry out ORG on females aged DATE or younger , although no similar protection currently exists for women over DATE ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL The available evidence suggests that the ability and willingness of the authorities to protect women from the imposition of ORG is slowly increasing . The number of churches , NGOs and other organisations actively working to protect women and girls from ORG and to end the practice is also steadily increasing . However , the accessibility of such protection is variable , geographically and in terms of the circumstances of individual women . It is easier for women to access protection in areas where ORG is less culturally prevalent ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . There are particular concerns for applicants whose ORG claim includes fear of the Mungiki . The PERSON have been criticised for encouraging , demanding and enforcing ORG practices upon girls and women in its communities , on the grounds that it is a traditional NORP practice . The Mungiki are known to force their female family members to undergo ORG . There is no evidence to suggest either that the condition of being married is any protection to women , or that single women are at greater risk . ORG may also be forced upon the wives of Mungiki defectors . Anti - FGM legislation provides protection to children and girls below the age of CARDINAL ; it does not address the protection needs of adult women . However , there are community centres , particularly in the southern areas of LOC , that now provide sanctuary to young women and girls who have escaped forced ORG ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ... The authorities actively take measures to prevent ORG , although there have been relatively few prosecutions . Accordingly , those in fear of being forced to seek ORG for their child should be able to seek the protection of the state . Those in fear of undergoing ORG may , in general , seek the protection of the authorities .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL PERSON should consider cases in which there is no Mungiki element within the context of the ORG guidance on internal relocation ... In general internal relocation is likely to be a viable option in such cases .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL For cases where there is a Mungiki element , caseowners should consider cases on their individual merits ... Given the increasing efforts of the NORP authorities to crack down on suspected NORP members , and also that GPE has an area of QUANTITY , with a population of CARDINAL people , internal relocation may be feasible in individual cases . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
