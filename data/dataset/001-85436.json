The first documentary evidence of a mudslide in LOC dates back to DATE . Subsequently mudslides were registered DATE ; occasionally they hit the town , causing damage . The heaviest mudslides registered prior to DATE occurred on DATE , on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE .

The inhabitants and authorities of NORP are generally aware of the hazard , and are accustomed to the mudslides which usually occur in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first technical research into a scheme to protect NORP from the mudslides was carried out in DATE , and by DATE a number of proposals had been made . The scheme chosen by the authorities following a comparative feasibility study provided for the construction of a feed - through mud retention collector . Construction work began , but in DATE this was disrupted by an exceptionally strong mudslide , and the project had to be corrected and extended accordingly . The construction of the collector was finished in DATE and operated successfully for DATE , apparently providing sufficient defence against the mudslides . In DATE a technical review was carried out following a particularly strong mudslide which seriously damaged some sections of the collector , and it was considered necessary to carry out repair work . The collector was fully repaired by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In addition , in DATE the local authorities put into operation a mud retention dam in the river gorge of GPE , upstream from the mud retention collector . The dam was intended to enhance the protection of NORP from mud and debris flows . It measured QUANTITY and was built with QUANTITY of reinforced concrete and QUANTITY of metal structures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a mud and debris flow hit the dam , seriously damaging it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the director of ORG , a state agency whose mandate included monitoring weather hazards in high - altitude areas , called for an independent survey of the damage caused to the dam by the mudslide .

He stated that the dam was seriously damaged , that its reconstruction appeared unfeasible at that stage and that , consequently , the only way to avoid casualties and mitigate the damage was to establish observation posts to warn civilians in the event of a mudslide , for which he requested a mandate and financial support ( see the full text in Section C below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG sent a letter to the Prime Minister of the ORG in which he referred to the imminent large - scale mudslide and requested financial aid to carry out certain emergency work on the dam .

She also alleged that she had witnessed a GPE vehicle with CARDINAL men in it being carried away by the mudslide .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , following the mudslide of DATE the authorities ordered the emergency evacuation of the residents of NORP . The police and local officials went round people 's homes to notify them of the mudslide and to help evacuate the elderly and disabled . In addition , police vehicles equipped with loudspeakers drove round the town , calling on residents to evacuate because of the mud hazard .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not specify when exactly these measures were taken . The applicants agreed that the alarm was indeed raised through loudspeakers once the mudslide had struck , but no advance warning was given . They claimed that they had been unaware of the order to evacuate and doubted that any had been issued . They also alleged that there had been no rescue forces or other organised on - the - spot assistance at the scene of the disaster , which became a cauldron of chaos and mass panic .", "CARDINAL . In TIME DATE the mud level lowered and the residents returned to their homes .

No copy of this decision was made available to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government of the ORG adopted a directive on the payment of compensation for loss of housing to the victims of the mudslide . It established the general principles for the provision of new accommodation and the guidelines for calculating compensation for those who wished to settle outside GPE . The loss of a CARDINAL flat gave rise to payment of MONEY ( RUB ) , of a CARDINAL flat DATE to up to RUB CARDINAL and of a CARDINAL flat DATE to up to RUB CARDINAL . Alternately , victims could opt for housing vouchers that would entitle families of CARDINAL person to free housing of CARDINAL sq . m per family member , and single - person families \u2013 to QUANTITY m.", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant 's parents were rescued .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's flat and all her possessions were flooded and destroyed by the mudslide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of LOC decided not to launch a criminal investigation into the death of the first applicant 's husband .

She claimed RUB CARDINAL for the loss of movable and immovable property , and RUB CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage on account of the death of her husband and the mental and physical suffering she and her children had been caused by the disaster . She claimed that the authorities had persuaded the local population that there was no risk of a mudslide . She also alleged that the authorities had been negligent as they had failed to take measures to mitigate the damage , in particular by establishing an early warning system and clearing the deposits left in the dam and river channel since the DATE mudslide .

Noting that the retention capacity of the dam was calculated for a flow of QUANTITY , when the actual flow rate was QUANTITY . m per second , it concluded that a mudslide of such exceptional force could be neither predicted nor stopped . The court also found that the media had informed civilians of the risk of possible mudslides and it took into account the fact that , following the mudslide , the authorities had carried out infrastructure work , such as repairs to a water pipeline , and had offered the applicant social aid in the form of accommodation and financial compensation .", "CARDINAL .
