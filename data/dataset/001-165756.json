The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claims to have entered GPE illegally on DATE with her son ( \u201c S \u201d ) , who was born on DATE .

On DATE the applicant claimed asylum on the basis that if returned to GPE she would be killed by the wife of a man who , she alleged , had sexually assaulted her . Her application was rejected by the Secretary of ORG for ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was diagnosed with a psychotic illness and detained in hospital for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal of her asylum claim on asylum and human rights grounds , finding , inter alia , that she was not a credible witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to CARDINAL count of child cruelty . She was granted bail pending a further hearing set for DATE . She then absconded for a period of over DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a residence order was made in favour of LOC \u2019s father and the child was returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to her second child ( \u201c M \u201d ) , who had a different father to S.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with possession of false documentation with intent to commit fraud . She was convicted and on DATE she was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of child cruelty . Before sentencing the applicant for the offence of child cruelty , ORG asked PERSON , a specialist registrar in forensic psychiatry , to produce a report . The report , which was dated DATE , indicated that the applicant suffered from a recurrent depressive disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder . However , at the date of the report her depressive and psychotic symptoms were being managed with medication and therapy , with the result that her mental illness was not considered to be of a nature or degree to warrant treatment either in the prison healthcare wing or in hospital . She did not , therefore , fulfil the criteria for treatment under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for the offence of child cruelty . She also pleaded guilty to the offence of failure to surrender to bail and was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , to be served concurrently . The judge recommended deportation in view of the seriousness of the offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to deport the applicant . She therefore remained in detention under immigration powers when her criminal sentence ended on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision to deport her . In her notice of appeal she reiterated her claim that she was at risk of being killed in GPE and that she had no family connections there . As M had been taken into the care of the local authority and was the subject of care proceedings , she also asserted a right to remain in GPE until those proceedings had concluded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her appeal but found that it would be proportionate to allow her to remain in GPE for the short period that it would take to complete the care proceedings in respect of M.", "CARDINAL . The applicant was refused bail on DATE and again on DATE on the grounds that she could not be relied on to comply with bail conditions , she offered no sureties and she represented a danger to herself and to others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained a report from Professor K , a medical expert , on her mental health . He agreed with the diagnosis of Dr O and concluded that the applicant was not suitable for compulsory treatment under LAW as she was not in need of in - patient psychiatric care and her mental health needs could be met in the community . She was taking medication and if necessary could be admitted to hospital on a voluntary basis . Professor K did , however , note that the applicant \u2019s mental health was likely to deteriorate in response to continued detention , although it should improve in response to release in the community .", "CARDINAL . Bail was again refused by the authorities on DATE in view of the risk of the applicant once again absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made representations requesting that the decision to deport be reversed or , alternatively , that the representations be treated as a fresh asylum claim pursuant to the relevant immigration rules . In these representations the applicant claimed that she faced a real risk of treatment contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention if she were deported to GPE due to her mental health status and the poor standard of treatment facilities in the destination country . Additionally , the applicant claimed that her family life with M would be irrevocably disrupted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge in ORG made a care and placement order in respect of PERSON In concluding that the threshold criteria were met , he stated that :", "\u201c I am satisfied the evidence supports a finding of likelihood , that is to say a real possibility , of harm to [ M ] , founded on [ S \u2019s ] grave injuries ; the previous court \u2019s findings in respect of those ; the mother \u2019s mental history ; her plea to a seriously abusive offence against [ S ] ; her absenting herself from the care and the criminal processes ; the social and practical vulnerability produced by the parties\u2019 lack of immigration status ; and their criminal offending , with its practical consequences for their availability to [ M ] . I am satisfied the matters I have outlined placed [ M ] , at the relevant time , at significant risk of physical and emotional harm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of ORG , on DATE Professor K prepared a further report . He noted that the applicant \u2019s mental state had deteriorated considerably since he last saw her as she was more depressed and more floridly psychotic . She was also experiencing sideeffects from the medication she was taking . DATE and DATE she had fought with another detainee , sustained injuries while being restrained , ingested washing powder , attempted to tie a ligature around her neck , stolen food from other detainees and smashed things in her room . Professor K considered that the deterioration in her mental health was largely due to her continued immigration detention . He expressed the opinion that the applicant would now benefit from hospital assessment and treatment and recommended her transfer under the provisions of section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Professor K gave an opinion that the applicant was not fit to act as a litigant . He reiterated that she should be transferred to hospital under section CARDINAL LAW . However , a transfer to a mental health hospital required the agreement of CARDINAL clinicians responsible for a patient \u2019s care . The applicant was not transferred as there was no agreement about whether she fulfilled the relevant criteria .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE authorities contacted the responsible clinicians to request another mental health assessment of the applicant . However , the clinicians indicated that a further assessment was unnecessary as she had had CARDINAL assessments already . The applicant was seen by the General Practitioner in ORG , who was satisfied that the medication being prescribed was best suited to her mental health situation and confirmed that there was no merit in arranging a further psychiatric assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following what ORG described as a \u201c lengthy delay \u201d the Secretary of ORG refused to treat the applicant \u2019s representations as a fresh claim for asylum . Further similar representations led to a further decision on DATE in which the Secretary of ORG maintained that the conditions for a fresh claim were not met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a judicial review claim challenging the lawfulness of her detention and the failure to transfer her to a mental hospital for compulsory treatment . She then added a further challenge to the refusal to treat her representations as a fresh claim for asylum . She was represented in these proceedings by ORG as she lacked capacity to conduct the litigation on her own behalf .", "CARDINAL . In or around DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG of a hospital after attempting suicide .", "CARDINAL . Around this time Professor K examined the applicant once more and produced a report dated DATE . He noted that her condition had deteriorated due to her continued detention ; she was more depressed , was describing mood - congruent auditory hallucinations , and continued to make multiple attempts to self - harm . He once again expressed the view that she should be transferred to hospital for compulsory treatment under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . While the applicant was in hospital she was examined by a nurse . She assessed the applicant \u2019s risk of harming children as grade CARDINAL on a scale of CARDINAL to CARDINAL . She was also at a risk of suicide , deliberate self - harm and other offending behaviour at grade CARDINAL . This gave the applicant a summary risk to herself of CARDINAL and to others of CARDINAL . Although the nurse noted that the applicant \u2019s mood had improved since DATE , she still considered that she had ongoing and enduring mental health problems and that her needs could not adequately be met in PERSON \u2019s ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was readmitted to ORG on DATE , following a further attempt to self - harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was assessed by Dr R , a consultant psychiatrist , PERSON , Acting Consultant for ORG , and Dr I of General Adult Psychiatry . They noted that she displayed a tendency to act impulsively and without consideration of the consequences . She also had a tendency to self - harm and exhibited behaviour which could be interpreted as suicidal . Furthermore , they considered her to be in an extremely stressful situation , given her detention and the ongoing care proceedings . In view of these considerations , they concluded that the applicant remained at very high risk due to her impulsivity and unpredictability . Although that risk could only be contained by constant supervision , this need could be met at PERSON \u2019s ORG Hospital admission would not provide management different to that .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was accordingly discharged back to PERSON \u2019s PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Professor K considered Dr R \u2019s report along with other materials . He agreed that the applicant was at high risk of suicide , but considered that this required not only constant supervision but also treatment of the underlying problem , which would be more appropriately managed therapeutically in a hospital setting . He further noted that other doctors had recommended psychological intervention in a secure in - patient setting .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the applicant \u2019s detention , DATE detention reviews were carried out . During these reviews any change in circumstances was recorded , the likelihood of removal within a reasonable time was considered , and a proposal was made with regard to whether detention should be maintained .", "CARDINAL . Permission for the applicant \u2019s first judicial review challenge was granted on DATE and the hearing took place on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judicial review application was dismissed by a ORG judge , who found that while the Secretary of ORG had failed to take into account paragraph CARDINAL of her own policy , ORG and Guidance ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , when considering the justification for the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE ( \u201c the first period of detention \u201d ) , that failure had not caused any damage since the decision to detain would have been the same even had the policy been correctly considered and applied . The judge therefore dismissed the claim for false imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The judge found that the policy had been taken into account from CARDINAL DATE up to the date of the hearing on DATE ( \u201c the second period of detention \u201d ) . He therefore found that continuing detention was lawful during this second period . The judge also rejected submissions that the period of detention had become unreasonable and unlawful under the principles set out in R v. Governor of ORG , ex parte ORG PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ( \u201c the ORG PERSON principles \u201d ) ( see paragraph DATE below ) . In this regard , he noted that , taking an analytical approach to each of the periods of detention following DATE , the applicant \u2019s detention was explicable by steps she had taken , or failed to take ( for example , cooperation in relation to emergency travel documents , and the conflicting advice in the hands of the authorities as to the effect of detention on her mental condition and the possibility of treating it while in detention ) . In relation to the applicant \u2019s own conduct , the judge noted that :", "\u201c It is clear from the ORG PERSON principles that obstacles to the Claimant \u2019s removal caused by the Claimant \u2019s conduct do not count in the formula . The initial conduct of the Claimant was her commission of the offence on her son . Relevant to the decision to deport and to detain pending deportation were her conviction for absconding and her conviction for fraud . The Claimant \u2019s utilisation of the rights available under the legislation to challenge the Defendant \u2019s decisions allowed her to remain in the GPE . In a sense she is rightfully in GPE while these processes unwind . On the other hand , they are of her choosing since she could repatriate herself voluntarily to GPE . Put neutrally as the authorities do , without tendentious issues such as fault , it is her conduct which has caused her to be here . She appealed asylum and deportation decisions , engaged at some stages in the family proceedings and issued a purported fresh claim and judicial review . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal to accept the applicant \u2019s representations as a fresh claim , the judge found that the further representations were not \u201c significantly different \u201d from material that had already been considered . Further , and in any event , the judge found that there was no LAW issue within the meaning of ORG v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG DATE and that any interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW was justified under sub - paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against the dismissal of her judicial review claim on CARDINAL DATE . Permission was granted in light of the recent judgment of DATE by ORG in R ( PERSON and PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( \u201c GPE and Mighty \u201d ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , in which the application by the Secretary of ORG of a \u201c secret policy \u201d in respect of immigration detention was held to be unlawful in violation of public law principles .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for assisted return to GPE under LAW ( a scheme under which financial incentives are provided for a voluntary return by an individual to his or her country of nationality ) but the application was refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was served with a deportation order on DATE . Although she submitted further representations for a fresh asylum and human rights claim the immigration authorities refused to revoke the deportation order . The immigration authorities also declined to give her a further statutory appeal right in relation to that decision and removal directions were set for DATE . The applicant challenged this decision by way of judicial review and obtained an injunction preventing removal until this judicial review claim had been determined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , shortly before ORG hearing , the applicant was released on bail by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the court hearing , the Secretary of ORG conceded that following the decision of ORG in GPE and ORG the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE had been unlawful on account of a failure to consider the guidance on detention of mentally ill persons in the published policy on immigration detention ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . As a result , on DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment . However , as the Secretary of ORG had continued to detain the applicant after the relevant policy had been taken into account ( from DATE ) , the court was satisfied that she would have been detained during the earlier period even if the policy had been considered . Moreover , having assessed all the evidence in the case \u2013 in particular , the risk of the applicant reoffending , self - harming , or absconding \u2013Despite the concerns over her mental health , the balance of expert advice was that her needs could be managed appropriately in detention . It therefore concluded that not only would the applicant have been detained during this period , but that she could have been detained lawfully .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the ORG PERSON principles , the court did not consider that the period of detention had become unreasonable by the date of the hearing before the judge , either on account of its length or because it should have been apparent that it would not be possible to effect deportation within a reasonable period . On the contrary , the court considered that deportation within a reasonable period had remained a sufficient prospect at every stage . In this regard , it noted that there was no external barrier to removal and no case - specific problem such as the absence of travel documentation . The only intermittent delaying factor was the applicant \u2019s legal challenges but that did not oblige a finding that the prospects of removal were fanciful . Although it accepted that the Secretary of ORG could have responded sooner to the \u201c fresh claim \u201d representations , the \u201c lengthy delay \u201d only had a minor effect overall and did not constitute a failure to act with due diligence .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in relation to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s refusal to treat the new representations as a fresh claim , the court found that he had been entitled to reach the conclusion he did .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the court awarded the applicant nominal damages of ORG in relation to the period which had been conceded to be unlawful . Permission to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant succeeded in quashing the decision not to give her a further statutory appeal right in relation to the decision to refuse to revoke the deportation order in light of the second set of representations for a further fresh claim ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This case is now being reconsidered by the authorities in light of all the current circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant has brought further judicial review claims ( not related to the present application ) . She has also been litigating in ORG and is bringing a personal injury claim against the immigration authorities .", "CARDINAL . By DATE contact between the applicant and M had been limited to TIME every two months with a view to further reduction and the prospect of a goodbye meeting once the applicant was deported or M adopted . However , the local authority subsequently agreed not to proceed with adoption and instead opted for long - term fostering for PERSON The applicant had her first contact with M in DATE and the local authority have agreed to further contact DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
