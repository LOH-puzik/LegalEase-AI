The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are the legal successors of former owners of land situated in GPE , GPE . In DATE the applicants\u2019 legal predecessors were obliged to transfer their property to ORG without compensation . The transfer was confirmed by a protocol dated DATE issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicants\u2019 request , the Minister of Economy declared the DATE protocol null and void . This decision entitled the applicants to seek compensation on the basis of the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to ORG for compensation for the loss of profit they could have made had they had the property at their disposal . Their request concerned the period DATE ( the date of entry into force of LAW ) and DATE ( the date on which the property in question was returned to the applicants ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicants compensation for lost profit , finding that the rights to the property in question had been restored to the applicants and that they had not proved that they had sustained any further damage . It also found that according to the case - law of ORG , the applicants could not seek compensation for the loss of expected profit which they had allegedly sustained before the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then applied to the civil courts seeking compensation for the loss of expected profit . On DATE they lodged a claim with ORG . Subsequently , they limited their claim to the period from the entry into force of the CARDINAL Constitution until DATE ; they maintained that the conduct of the authorities had prevented them from using their property even after its return . They claimed MONEY ( ORG ) and requested exemption from the court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG request was granted and they were exempted from court fees in excess of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants further limited their claim to compensation for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . The court admitted that ORG case - law had gone in CARDINAL opposite directions ; the first line of case - law accepted that in situations similar to that of the applicants they could seek both actual loss ( damnum emergens ) and loss of expected profit ( lucrum caessans ) , whereas the second line limited the compensation to actual loss only . The court decided to base its judgment on the latter case - law of ORG and held that it could not grant the applicants compensation for loss of expected profit because the right to full compensation had not been inserted in LAW until DATE , when the LAW entered into force , whereas the damage in question had occurred before that date .", "CARDINAL . Taking into consideration the incoherent case - law of ORG , ORG applied LAW and decided not to impose the costs of the proceedings on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested that the court stay the proceedings pending a decision by ORG on the legal issue in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the request and stayed the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a full bench , adopted a resolution ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which it acknowledged that the respective provisions of civil and administrative law had given rise to serious difficulties and to divergent interpretation in judicial practice . It held that in situations similar to that of the applicants , if a final decision had been given in breach of the law before the entry into force of LAW , compensation on the basis of LAW would not include lucrum caessans even if the loss of expected profit had happened after the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings before ORG were resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred to the abovementioned ORG resolution of DATE and held that compensation for loss of expected profit could be granted only if the wrongful decision had been issued after the entry into force of LAW . Finding that the loss in the applicants\u2019 case had occurred before that date , it dismissed the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . The court did not impose the costs of the proceedings on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not lodge a cassation appeal , since it would not have had any prospects of success ; ORG would have had to follow the resolution adopted in DATE by ORG plenary .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , which entered into force on DATE , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by the unlawful acts of a public authority .", "CARDINAL . A statute shall not bar access to court to persons seeking redress for any breach of their freedoms or rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW permits the amendment or revocation of any final administrative decision whenever necessary in the general or individual interest , if this is not prohibited by specific legal provisions . In particular , pursuant to LAW , a final administrative decision is subject to revocation if it has been issued by an authority which had no jurisdiction to do so , or if it has no legal basis or is contrary to the applicable laws .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c A decision shall not be revoked ... if DATE has passed since the date on which it was delivered or if the decision had irreversible legal consequences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c If it is impossible to set aside a decision for reasons referred to in LAW , the administrative authority shall only declare that the challenged decision has been issued in flagrant breach of the law and shall give reasons for refusing to set it aside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of LAW , as applicable to the applicants\u2019 case , reads :", "\u201c Anyone who has suffered loss on account of the issuing of a decision in a manner contrary to LAW or on account of the revocation of such a decision may claim compensation for actual damage , unless he has been responsible for the circumstances mentioned in this provision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG declared LAW unconstitutional in so far as it limited the scope of compensation to actual damage only . ORG held that its judgment applied only to losses which had occurred after the entry into force of LAW , that is , after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Law of DATE on amendments to LAW and other statutes ( LOC o zmianie ustawy \u2013 ORG cywilny oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw ) ( \u201c the DATE Amendment \u201d ) entered into force . The relevant amendments were in essence aimed at enlarging the scope of ORG liability in tort under LAW of LAW , including the addition of a new LAW . New Article CARDINAL CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that compensation can be claimed for damage caused by way of an unlawful and final decision , after the unlawfulness of such a decision has been declared in separate administrative proceedings . LAW abrogated LAW . However , under the transitional provisions of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Amendment , Article CARDINAL of LAW as applicable before DATE and LAW apply to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date .", "CARDINAL . An administrative decision in respect of a compensation claim was amenable to appeal before a civil court .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as applicable after DATE , provides :", "\u201c ORG , or [ as the case may be ] a self - government entity or other legal person responsible for exercising public authority , shall be liable for any damage ( szkoda ) caused by an unlawful act or omission [ committed ] in connection with the exercise of public authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment of ORG , the domestic courts , including ORG , took CARDINAL different approaches in interpreting the term \u201c time in which loss occurred \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the first approach , which could be observed from DATE , the decisive date was that on which the original decision had been issued . This , in turn , meant that if the decision in question had been issued before the entry into force of the LAW , only actual damage could be compensated for . The first approach was adopted by ORG in its judgments of DATE ( I CK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( II CSK CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL DATE ( I CSK CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the second approach adopted for the first time in DATE , loss could occur after the entry into force of the LAW even if the decision constituting the source of the loss had been issued long before that date . In such circumstances , a claimant could effectively seek full compensation for both : actual loss and expected profit . This approach was adopted by ORG in the judgments of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) , DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( I ORG DATE ) , DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , DATE ( I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL DATE ( I ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG requested that a bench of ORG composed of CARDINAL judges convene to clarify a legal question and adopt a resolution . The issue concerned the substantive law governing compensation claims in respect of damage caused by administrative decisions issued before DATE where the unlawfulness of the decisions had been declared by way of an administrative decision given after that date . The President noted , inter alia , that CARDINAL strands had developed in the case - law of ORG and other courts , against a background of serious difficulties concerning the temporal scope and consequences of the PERSON of DATE as to the applicable substantive law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . These divergences decisively affected the compensation rights of individuals in respect of whom unlawful administrative decisions had been made prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , requested the full composition of that ORG to adopt a resolution clarifying the issues raised by the President ( III CZP CARDINAL ) . The ORG noted that the issue had given rise to serious discrepancies in judicial practice , including that of ORG itself . Considering the importance of the issues involved and the fact that previous decisions and resolutions of ORG had failed to bring uniformity to judicial practice , a resolution by ORG of the ORG sitting as a full bench was called for .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , sitting as a full bench , adopted a resolution ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It acknowledged that the applicable provisions had given rise to serious difficulties and to divergent interpretations in judicial practice . ORG held that former LAW was applicable . It further held that :", "\u201c If a final administrative decision which was deficient ( wadliwa ) was issued before the date of entry into force of the LAW , compensation due on the basis of LAW shall not encompass lost profits , even if the damage occurred after the entry into force of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
