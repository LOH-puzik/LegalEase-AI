Details as to their names are indicated in the appended table . All of them are represented before the ORG by the Sed Lex Constan\u0163a Financial Trade Union ( \u201c the Union \u201d ) , which has its headquarters in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Union , on behalf of its members ( the applicants ) , filed a petition against their employer , a ORG agency , namely ORG , asking to have their entitlement to certain wage - related rights acknowledged . More specifically , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , they asked for CARDINAL allowances to be added to their basic salary , namely a grade supplement and a supplement related to their salary step . The applicants quantified each of these supplements at PERCENT of the basic salary .", "The aforesaid allowances were to be paid retroactively , starting from DATE , and correspondingly updated in line with the inflation index . The amounts were to be paid for the whole duration of the employment contract .", "The employer dismissed the petition as ill - founded , in so far as the legislation did not allow the payment of the allowances in question ; moreover , the budget allocated to the payment of salary entitlements did not include the allowances and in any event , a regional department of public finance was not competent to decide on budgetary matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants contested that decision before ORG . They contended that even though , in accordance with Government Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the application of the provisions granting them the rights in question had been suspended until DATE , the suspension did not mean the extinction of the rights , and in any event , the suspension was in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ; therefore , the allowances claimed were to be paid retroactively , from DATE .", "The applicants also invoked LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , alleging that their right to obtain the allowances in issue was a \u201c possession \u201d within the meaning of that Article .", "In support of their claims and referring also to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) , the applicants invoked the case - law of other courts of appeal in GPE , which had granted the requested allowances to their fellow public servants across the country . The applicants made specific reference to judgments given in DATE by ORG , ORG and the Cara\u015f - Severin County Court , which had all become final after being upheld on appeal by the corresponding courts of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . The court acknowledged that the CARDINAL supplements claimed were provided for by law , albeit without any indication of a precise amount . In fact , none of the subsequent legal texts regulating civil servants\u2019 salary entitlements made any reference to a method or criteria for determining the amount of each of the supplements .", "Therefore , even though PERSON no . CARDINAL expressly provided that a civil servant \u2019s salary also included the grade supplement and the salary - step supplement , the determination of the corresponding amounts was not possible . Consequently , the court held :", "\u201c For the calculation of the CARDINAL allowances , as components of public LOC salaries , explicit legal rules for the application of section DATE ) ( c ) and ( d ) are necessary , and this task belongs either to the legislative power , in the event that a law is passed , or to the executive power , in the event that a decision for the application of the law is delivered . \u201d", "The court further considered that to grant the allowances in the absence of precise criteria for their calculation would mean obliging the employer to pay sums that were impossible to calculate , and thus delivering a judgment that was impossible to enforce ; on the other hand , the potential calculation of those allowances by the court would mean encroaching on the powers of the administrative authorities and completely disregarding ORG case - law to the effect that :", "\u201c the courts do not have jurisdiction to repeal or to refuse to apply specific normative acts which they consider to be discriminatory , and thus to replace them with norms created by judicial intervention or with provisions contained in other normative acts . \u201d", "With respect to the allegations raised under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , the court held that the applicants could not claim to have a possession , in so far as their requests had never been allowed or confirmed by the courts in a final judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment before ORG , reiterating their arguments submitted before the first - instance court . They again referred to the fact that several other courts across the country had already granted the allowances in issue to colleagues of theirs , meaning that by denying them the right to also receive the allowances , ORG had discriminated against them in relation to other public servants , in violation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL .", "In addition , they stated that the allowances were provided for by law , and that their right to receive them had been confirmed by the first - instance court , which had nonetheless decided not to grant the allowances in the absence of criteria for their calculation .", "The applicants further mentioned that their lack of financial means and the defendant \u2019s omission to include the related costs in the budget could not be held against them in order to deprive them of the CARDINAL allowances in question , to which they were entitled by law .", "When asked to comment on the judgment given on DATE by ORG and ORG on an appeal in the interests of the law , in which it held that the CARDINAL allowances in question could not be granted by the judiciary , the ORG representative stated that he was not able to give an opinion on the issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "The court noted that according to the above - mentioned judgment given by ORG and ORG , in the absence of a legal determination of their amount , the grade allowance and the allowance relating to the salary step could not be granted by the judiciary .", "In so far as ORG interpretation of the law , as set out in the decision given in the appeal in the interests of the law , was obligatory , the court was bound to follow ORG ruling and thus to dismiss the ORG claims as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . LAW entered into force on DATE , once PERSON no . CARDINAL had been enacted . On DATE section CARDINAL of the Statute was amended to provide that , starting from that date , certain allowances were to be included in the salaries of public servants :", "\u201c CARDINAL . For discharging their activities public servants have the right to a salary composed of the following :", "( a ) basic salary ;", "( b ) seniority allowance ;", "( c ) grade allowance ;", "( d ) step allowance .", "CARDINAL . Public servants shall be granted bonuses and other salary rights , in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The remuneration of public servants shall take place in accordance with [ the criteria ] prescribed in the law on the implementation of a unitary remuneration system concerning public servants . \u201d", "On DATE , point ( d ) was amended to read \u201c allowance corresponding to the salary step \u201d . With effect from DATE , section CARDINAL became section CARDINAL , while no amendments were made to the content .", "The application of these provisions was suspended from DATE until DATE , firstly by PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , then by Government Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , enacted as PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and then by Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , enacted as LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "With effect from DATE , the CARDINAL allowances , namely the grade supplement and the allowance corresponding to the salary step , were abolished by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which itself was repealed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Starting with DATE , a divergent case - law emerged across the country concerning the granting of the grade supplement and of the allowance corresponding to the salary step .", "CARDINAL . It is why on CARDINAL DATE , in order to ensure the uniform interpretation and application of the law , the Prosecutor General applied to ORG and ORG , in accordance with the provisions of LAW .", "In the judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE , ORG confirmed the existence of a divergence in the case - law concerning the interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , on the granting of allowances to public servants . ORG held that the entitlements claimed did not constitute a \u201c possession \u201d within the meaning of LAW , being only \u201c virtual rights \u201d in the absence of criteria for their calculation ; it consequently held that :", "\u201c for the uniform interpretation and application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( c ) and ( d ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG holds that in the absence of a legal determination of their amount , the grade allowance and the allowance relating to the salary step can not be granted by the judiciary . \u201d", "ORG interpretation of the provisions in question is binding on all the domestic courts .
