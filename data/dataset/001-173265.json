He lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suffered for DATE from , inter alia , pain in his back and legs and numbness in his right arm . He alternated between full and part - time sick leave from DATE . In DATE he received a partial early retirement pension and in DATE a full disability pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he applied for life annuity and alleged that his physical problems had been caused by his former employment as a driver ( DATE ) , as a dairy worker ( DATE ) and as a food science technician ( DATE to CARDINAL ) . ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) appointed an in - house specialist in orthopaedic surgery who , in a written statement , concluded that there was not a high degree of probability ( h\u00f6g grad av sannolikhet ) that any harmful element in the applicant \u2019s former employment had caused his problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the application . Referring to , inter alia , the specialist statement by the insurance doctor , it was held that the applicant had not been subject to any harmful influences which , with a high degree of probability , could have caused or aggravated his problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( f\u00f6rvaltningsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . On DATE the court , after having held an oral hearing , upheld ORG decision in full . The court found that , although it was scientifically known that employees in the food industry had a statistically high risk of injury , the circumstances in the applicant \u2019s case had to be taken into account . The applicant \u2019s back problems had appeared after DATE in the industry and he suffered from degenerative changes to his back . Against that background , the medical investigation and other material did not adequately support the conclusion that the applicant , in his work , had been subject to any harmful influences which , with a high degree of probability , could have caused or aggravated his problems .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , the applicant submitted , inter alia , a medical statement ( epikris ) issued in DATE by ORG , ORG ( ORG for folkh\u00e4lsa , arbets och milj\u00f6medicin ) . According to the medical statement , there were reasons to believe that the applicant \u2019s work had caused his problems .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a written statement to the appellate court , ORG questioned the conclusions in the medical statement as they were based on information about exposure which was to a high degree uncertain . Furthermore , there were medical records from DATE in which the applicant was held to be fully able - bodied and in which it was noted that no somatic evidence had been found in support of the applicant \u2019s symptoms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted leave to appeal . The applicant requested an oral hearing in the case but , on DATE , the court rejected the request . It referred to the nature of the case and to the fact that an oral hearing had been held before ORG . The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . It first gave an account of the parties\u2019 submissions and the evidence relied upon , including the medical statement of DATE , and then stated the following reasons :", "\u201c The medical and other evidence in the case does not demonstrate that the applicant has been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which could , with a high degree of probability , have caused his problems . His back - related and other problems can thus \u2013 as has been found also by ORG and ORG \u2013 not be defined as a work - related injury . [ The applicant ] is therefore not entitled to life annuity according to the [ Work LAW ] . The appeal must consequently be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( H\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . He complained of the lack of reasoning in ORG judgment and argued that that court \u2019s refusal to hold an oral hearing had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG , complaining that his right to a fair trial under LAW had been infringed because ORG had refused to hold an oral hearing and its judgment had not been sufficiently reasoned .", "CARDINAL . This application was declared inadmissible by ORG DATE for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies . The ORG found that the applicant had failed to lodge a claim with the Chancellor of ORG ( NORP ) or the ordinary courts to seek compensation for the alleged breaches of LAW v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE , the applicant lodged a claim for compensation for the alleged breaches of the Convention with the Chancellor of ORG . He argued that ORG lack of reasoning , as well as its refusal to hold an oral hearing , had infringed his right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . He requested MONEY ( SEK ) for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The Chancellor of ORG communicated the case to ORG which submitted that its handling of the case had been in accordance with domestic law as well as the LAW . In response , the applicant maintained , and developed the grounds for , his claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chancellor of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . As concerns the lack of an oral hearing , the Chancellor of ORG noted that ORG and ORG had held an oral hearing and consequently , in accordance with the ORG \u2019s case - law , a less strict standard applied to the requirement to hold a hearing before the appellate court . Thus , in view of the character of the case and the fact that the applicant had been given the opportunity to finalise his submissions in writing and the court had had access to substantial written evidence , the Chancellor of ORG concluded that there had been no breach of the LAW in this respect .", "CARDINAL . As concerns ORG alleged lack of reasoning , the Chancellor of ORG referred extensively to the ORG \u2019s case law on this matter and then made the following evaluation . ORG had , in its judgment , accounted for the applicant \u2019s arguments and the new evidence he had submitted before it . It had further accounted for the considerations and conclusions drawn from the evidence submitted by the parties , namely , that the investigation in the case did not demonstrate that the applicant had been exposed to any such harmful influences in his work which , with a high degree of probability , could have caused his problems . Thus , the Chancellor of ORG found that ORG had taken a stance on the central and decisive question in the case , that is , whether the applicant had been exposed to harmful influences in his work . While the Chancellor noted that it would have been preferable , for pedagogical reasons , for the court to have given clearer grounds for why the applicant \u2019s evidence had not been sufficient , she concluded that the reasoning was not so deficient that the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial under LAW had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , provisions on work injuries were set out in the Work Injury Insurance Act ( Lag ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ) , which covered all people working in GPE . A person whose ability to earn an income had been impaired due to a work - related injury was in some specified situations eligible for life annuity ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c work - related injury \u201d referred to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful effects at work . \u201c Other harmful effect \u201d meant the influence of a factor that with a high degree of probability might cause the kind of injury suffered ( LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . If an insured person had suffered an accident or another harmful effect , the injury was to be considered to have been caused by the harmful effect , if that causal link was highly probable ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . The standard of proof was somewhat mitigated on DATE , but that amendment did not apply to the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL .
