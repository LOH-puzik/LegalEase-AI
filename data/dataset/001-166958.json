The applicants , PERSON and his wife PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP secret service ( PERSON ) bought a data carrier from a certain PERSON for a considerable amount of money . The data carrier contained financial data from ORG relating to CARDINAL people . PERSON , who had formerly been an employee of ORG , had illegally copied the data . The data carrier was submitted to the NORP tax investigation authorities , which subsequently instigated proceedings against , inter alia , the applicants , in relation to tax evasion crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , following an application from the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office , issued a search warrant in respect of the home of the applicants , who were suspected of having committed tax evasion DATE . The search warrant allowed the seizure of papers and other documents concerning the applicants\u2019 capital , both inside and outside GPE , especially documents concerning information on foundations and any documents that could help to determine the true tax liability of the applicants DATE .", "CARDINAL . The search warrant indicated that , in the course of investigations against another suspect , the prosecution had obtained information that the applicants had established the \u201c ORG \u201d on DATE and the \u201c ORG \u201d on DATE . The applicants were suspected of having made financial investments via these CARDINAL associations with ORG in GPE , for which they were liable for tax in GPE . According to the search warrant , the applicants had failed to declare MONEY ( ORG ) of the yearly interest accrued from the capital of both ORG and ORG in their tax returns for DATE . It indicated that the applicants had evaded tax payments of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE . The search warrant stated that the house search was urgently needed in order to find further evidence and that , weighing the seriousness of the alleged crimes against the constitutional rights of the applicants , the house search was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 flat was searched and CARDINAL envelope containing ORG documents and CARDINAL computer files were seized .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the search warrant . They argued that the warrant had not been granted in accordance with the law . It had been based on material which had been acquired in breach of international law , especially LAW of DATE and ORG , Search , Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime of CARDINAL DATE , because the data had been stolen from ORG and had been bought by the secret service . The acquisition of the data had also violated domestic law , as the secret service had no authorisation to obtain tax data . In fact , such an act was a criminal offence under NORP law , as it infringed section ORG ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c divulgence of official secrets \u201d ( NORP ) ) . Furthermore , the secret service was not authorised to forward tax data to the financial authorities and the prosecution , as this infringed the NORP legal principle of separation of the secret service and the police / prosecution ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG dismissed the appeal . It was of the view that the house search had been legal as it had been based on a lawful search warrant . The court had no doubt that it had been lawful to base the search warrant on the information contained in the GPE data carrier , as , in its view , the data had neither been seized in direct violation of international law nor by circumventing international treaties .", "CARDINAL . ORG was also of the view that the search warrant in question could be issued on the basis of the information in the data carrier , as the secret service had only played a passive role in acquiring it . According to the court , there was no indication that the secret service had incited a third person to steal the data , and it had merely accepted the data from a third person when this person had offered it . The fact that the secret service might have remunerated the seller did not , in the court \u2019s view , change the fact that the secret service had only played a passive role . In the court \u2019s opinion , it was within the secret service \u2019s remit to acquire the data carrier in the prescribed way and hand the data over to the prosecution , as the data carrier contained CARDINAL sets of data concerning international cash flows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . It held that the search warrant had been lawful , even if it was true that the NORP authorities had infringed domestic criminal law in obtaining the evidence . Even assuming that the NORP authorities might have committed the criminal offences of acting as an \u201c accessory to a criminal offence \u201d ( PERSON , LAW of LAW ) and an \u201c accessory to the divulgence of official secrets \u201d ( Beihilfe zum NORP , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , in conjunction with LAW ) in buying the GPE data from PERSON , and that PERSON might have committed the offence of \u201c industrial espionage \u201d ( ORG , section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , it considered the search warrant to have been lawful . With regard to the ORG allegation that the data had been acquired in breach of international law , ORG doubted any such breach .", "CARDINAL . As regards the question whether illegally obtained evidence could be used in criminal proceedings , ORG referred to a decision of the same court of DATE , where it had held in a similar case and with regard to the same data carrier that the interest in prosecuting the suspects outweighed the possible infringements of criminal law , as the principal criminal act of \u201c data theft \u201d had been committed by a third party and not by the NORP authorities . According to the well - established case - law of ORG , evidence that had been illegally acquired by a third party could generally be used in criminal proceedings , unless it had been acquired through coercion or force . It also had to be considered that the use of the \u201c stolen \u201d data had not infringed the core of the applicants\u2019 private sphere , but their business affairs . Furthermore , the \u201c data theft \u201d had not primarily infringed the rights of the applicants , but the data - protection rights of the bank from which it had been \u201c stolen \u201d . Thus , the GPE data was not excluded as evidence and the search order could be based on it . As to the presumed breach of international law , the court added that such a breach would not lead to the unlawfulness of the search warrant , firstly because international law did not grant the applicants any personal rights and secondly because the use of the evidence did not in itself constitute a breach of international law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . They were of the view that ORG and ORG should have decided that the search warrant had not been in accordance with the law , as the use of the GPE data as a basis for a search warrant had violated international treaties and the sovereignty of GPE , which had protested against the use of the data .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , they argued that their right to respect for their home under LAW had been infringed , as the search warrant had been based on evidence that had been acquired by the secret service and passed on to the prosecution in violation of domestic law . The data purchase from PERSON had constituted a criminal act . Moreover , the secret service had no authority under NORP law to purchase such data . Furthermore , the transfer of the GPE data from the secret service to the financial authorities and the prosecution had violated the principle of the separation of the secret service and the prosecution in GPE . The infringement of domestic law had been so severe that the criminal courts should have come to the conclusion that the GPE data could not have formed the basis of a search warrant . They would thus have been obliged to declare the search warrant illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional complaint as manifestly ill - founded . It found that the fact that the search warrant had been based on the GPE data did not infringe LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court reiterated that there was no absolute rule that evidence which had been acquired in violation of procedural rules could never be used in criminal proceedings ( compare paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court further pointed out that it had to be borne in mind that the case at hand did not concern the question of whether evidence could be admitted in a criminal trial , but only concerned the preliminary question of whether evidence that might have been acquired in breach of procedural rules could form the basis of a search warrant in criminal investigation proceedings . Even if evidence was considered inadmissible in criminal proceedings , this did not automatically mean that the same was true for all stages of criminal investigations .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court reiterated that it was not its role to substitute itself for the authorities in the interpretation and application of domestic law , but to review , in the light of LAW , the decisions taken by the authorities in the exercise of their margin of appreciation .", "CARDINAL . In applying these general principles to the case at hand , ORG ruled , at the outset , that it was not necessary to decide upon the question whether the acquisition of the data had been in breach of national or international law or violated the principle of the separation of the secret service and the prosecution in GPE , as ORG had departed in its decision from the ORG allegation that the evidence might in fact have been acquired in breach of domestic and international law , including criminal law .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found that the fact that ORG based its legal assessment on the assumption that the acquisition of the data had been in breach of domestic and/or international law was not arbitrary and hence could not be found to be in violation of LAW . Its finding that the applicants could not invoke international law in their favour only showed a different legal opinion without disregarding the applicants\u2019 basic rights . Furthermore , ORG considered reasonable LOC legal assessment that the principle of separation of the secret service and the prosecution had not been infringed , as the facts of the case did not show that the secret service had either ordered or coordinated the \u201c data theft \u201d , but had been offered the data on PERSON \u2019s own initiative . Acquiring data in such a way and passing it on to the prosecution could not violate the principle of separation , and hence could not render a search warrant unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . With regard to ORG finding that the search order could be based on the GPE data ORG found that ORG legal assessment sufficiently took into account the applicants\u2019 basic rights as ORG had departed from the ORG allegation that the evidence had been obtained in breach of domestic law and thus based its decision on , what was , for the applicants , the best possible assumption .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further considered that ORG had struck a fair balance between the different interests at stake . The alleged breach of national and/or international law did not entail an imperative prohibition to use the evidence in the proceedings at issue . Furthermore , ORG had rightly pointed out that the data did not relate to the core area of the applicants\u2019 private life , but to their business activities . It had recognized the decisive interest at stake , namely the applicants\u2019 right to inviolability of their home , and took it sufficiently into account , as nothing showed that NORP authorities purposely and systematically breached international or domestic law in obtaining the data carrier .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG acquitted the applicants of the charges of tax evasion , finding that it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the capital of the foundation in question had been invested in an interest - bearing way ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
