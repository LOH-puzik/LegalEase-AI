THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza;Simon Brown", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and is a resident of ORG in GPE . He was represented before ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant is subject to hospital and restriction orders under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) following his conviction for rape of a minor in DATE . He is therefore detained in a psychiatric hospital . In DATE the applicant suffered a mild heart attack ( when he was awaiting surgery for another condition ) and thereafter was diagnosed as suffering from minor coronary disease .", "Throughout his period of confinement , there has been considerable debate as to whether he was mentally ill . There was a consensus that he suffered from a \u201c psychopathic personality disorder \u201d , a condition not classed as a mental illness . However , there was disagreement as to whether he also suffered from a mental illness .", "On DATE , for example , ORG found that he was suffering from a mental illness . Following that decision , Dr O , the applicant \u2019s responsible medical officer at the time , proposed treating the applicant with anti - psychotic medication . She sought a second opinion from PERSON , a second opinion appointed doctor ( \u201c SOAD \u201d ) appointed by ORG . PERSON did not give the necessary authority . He considered that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the applicant might be suffering from a psychosis to justify treatment in the event of his agreeing to it , but not sufficient evidence to justify treatment against his wishes .", "In DATE another responsible medical officer ( \u201c the RMO \u201d ) took over the applicant \u2019s care . The ORG formed the view that the applicant \u2019s pronounced paranoid beliefs and attitudes were due , not only to his personality disorder , but also to an underlying psychotic mental illness . In any event , the ORG considered anti - psychotic medication necessary to relieve the applicant of his \u201c paranoid ideation \u201d . These views were reflected in the ORG \u2019s report of DATE .", "In DATE ( it is not clear precisely when ) , the ORG proposed the new medication to the applicant and the applicant refused it : from the outset , he made it clear that he would physically resist it . Since he was not consenting , the treatment had to be certified by a ORG ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW below ) . On DATE the ORG requested the appointment of a ORG . PERSON ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a highly experienced consultant psychiatrist , was appointed .", "On DATE the ORG examined the applicant ( it was disputed during the domestic proceedings how long this examination took : TIME according to the applicant ; CARDINAL according to the ORG ) . The ORG issued a certificate of second opinion on that date certifying that the applicant was not capable of understanding the nature , purpose and likely effects of the proposed medication , \u201c but that , having regard to the likelihood of the treatment alleviating or preventing a deterioration of the patient \u2019s condition , it should be given \u201d . The certificate authorised a plan of treatment whereby the specific drugs would be administered on a number of occasions . The ORG also signed a Form CARDINAL confirming that the statutory criteria had been fulfilled .", "The ORG was concerned that , when faced with a threatening situation , the applicant was apt to become extremely anxious and agitated and that he had acted violently on many occasions ( for example by starting fires ) . As a result , he and the other members of his clinical team arranged that the applicant would have no notice of the ORG \u2019s arrival to the hospital and that the medication would be administered immediately after the certification had been obtained .", "Accordingly , on DATE that the ORG \u2019s certificate was signed ( DATE ) , the applicant was given anti - psychotic medication by the ORG against his will . On DATE he was again injected with the same medication . On each occasion , the applicant physically resisted and had to be restrained by members of staff . On the first occasion , he suffered an angina attack and had to be taken to a seclusion room . The applicant claimed that he subsequently suffered significant side - effects from the treatment , including low blood pressure and chest pain .", "Since a further injection was due to be administered on DATE , the applicant consulted his solicitors on DATE . The applicant sought judicial review of the decision to administer the treatment . The only relief he sought was a declaration that the proposed future treatment would be unlawful . He did not seek any relief in relation to the past treatment . On DATE the High Court gave him leave to apply for judicial review and granted an injunction preventing further treatment pending the hearing of his substantive challenge .", "His solicitors obtained a report from a consultant psychiatrist ( PERSON ) and the ORG and the ORG ( CARDINAL of the respondents in the applicant \u2019s proceedings ) prepared witness statements .", "In his first witness statement , dated DATE , the ORG said the following :", "\u201c The conclusion of my opinion is that I believe medication holds out a real prospect of giving benefit to the applicant . I wish to emphasise that what I am proposing is a trial of medication only in order to see what benefit the patient derives from it . If there is no benefit then the trial will be stopped . I believe the patient is suffering from mental illness . The essential point in my view is that whether CARDINAL favours a diagnosis of mental illness or CARDINAL of personality disorder a trial mediation [ sic ] can and should be given for the paranoia which all doctors agree is both present and considerable ...", "Although other psychiatrists think otherwise I think it would be unsafe to move [ the applicant ] to conditions of medium security without giving him a trial of medication . [ The applicant ] has been attempting to get ORG to support his moving to conditions of medium security and the ORG adjourned in DATE in order , among other things , for a report to be obtained from Dr [ S ] ... Dr [ S ] reassessed him and in a report dated DATE Dr [ S ] said ... \u201c I do not believe that a treatment with antipsychotic medication at the present time would be indicated \u201d ...", "I wrote a letter to Dr [ S ] dated DATE ... saying that I intended to give [ the applicant ] a trial of medication . Dr [ S ] replied in his letter of CARDINAL DATE saying that he would be very happy to await the outcome . He wrote ... \u201c I am a strong believer in a \u201c trial of mediation\u201d[sic ] in patients such as [ the applicant ] who have spent DATE in hospital and have been unsuccessful moving on . I can think of several patients who have successfully moved from ORG to ORG where previously undiagnosed mental illness was treated with successful results . I would therefore be very interested in the outcome of any trial of antipsychotic medication \u201d ...", "For the reasons above the patient \u2019s best interests are served by trial medication . The potential benefit could be considerable enabling the patient to move on to a less secure and restrictive hospital and possible eventual return to the community . If the trial does not work the patient will be no worse off than he is at present ... \u201d", "As to capacity to consent the ORG said :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] \u2019s paranoid attitudes and beliefs render him incapable upon the subject of treatment with medication ... In my view he lacks capacity because of his mental illness but if we take the view expressed in Dr [ G ] \u2019s report of CARDINAL ... that [ the applicant ] only has a personality disorder and that the paranoia is due to that , then [ the applicant ] still , I would emphasise , does not have capacity . Whichever way we look at it , he does not believe that he shows paranoia and he therefore does not believe that he needs medication to treat it . He further believes that ORG hospital and I and other doctors before me acting as agents , have sought to obstruct his discharge from the hospital . He is not able to see that medication could be of benefit to him . \u201d", "As to the applicant \u2019s heart condition , he said :", "\u201c Many patients suffer [ angina ] attacks from time to time and come to no harm and I have spoken with Dr [ X ] about this . He told me there is always a chance when [ the applicant ] suffers an attack of angina it will develop into a heart attack , but that chance is very small . \u201d", "The ORG , in his first witness statement , described a TIME interview with the applicant . He said that he looked at the applicant \u2019s reports , which substantiated his claim that he suffered from a personality disorder but also raised the question of his paranoid thoughts . There was no clear consensus , in his opinion , as to whether these thoughts were a part of his personality disorder or if they related to an underlying illness .", "As to the treatment plan , he said :", "\u201c I felt that the treatment plan proposed by the ORG was both reasonable and addressed an issue that was preventing the further rehabilitation of the patient . That the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation was apparent both from records made in his clinical notes and from his personal presentation upon examination by myself . Whether such paranoid ideation was associated with his primary diagnosis of personality disorder or was symptomatic of mental illness unconnected with that diagnosis , it was reasonable in my view to attempt to relieve [ the applicant ] of this symptom and would be in [ the applicant ] \u2019s best interests . It is accepted clinical practice to treat persons with paranoid ideation with antipsychotic medication . \u201d", "In his report , dated DATE , PERSON said the following in relation to diagnosis :", "\u201c The prevailing view of psychiatrists who have assessed [ the applicant ] over DATE is that he suffers from a personality disorder , and not from a psychotic mental illness .", "[ The ORG ] \u2019s opinion that [ the applicant ] has a paranoid psychotic illness does not appear to arise from evidence of new symptoms that have recently emerged , but is based on a further careful review of [ the applicant ] \u2019s history and presentation . [ The ORG ] \u2019s conclusion that treatment with antipsychotic medication would help [ the applicant ] progress after DATE in ORG was reached in good faith and with concern for [ the applicant ] \u2019s welfare .", "In my view the basis for arguing that [ the applicant ] suffers from a paranoid psychotic illness , or schizophrenic illness is weak and there is inadequate clinical evidence to justify such a diagnosis . There is not a good history of positive psychotic symptoms such as delusional beliefs , abnormal perceptions ( e.g. hallucinations ) or characteristic abnormalities of thinking and affect . There has not been a gross decline in his level of social functioning indicative of chronic psychosis . The past observations noted by [ the ORG ] in his tribunal report ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of thought disorder and emotional incongruity have not been sustained and are certainly not present in [ the applicant ] \u2019s current presentation . The persistent characteristics of irascibility , explosive anger , poor judgment and suspiciousness are typical of a personality disorder of a paranoid type . There should be particular caution about inferring that [ the applicant ] \u2019s beliefs about ORG amount to delusions . They do not have the fixed , incorrigible form of delusions . The content of some of his ideas , namely about the motivation of hospital staff , is in my view misguided and wrong , but it is psychologically understandable , given his experience , personality and the context of long term detention , and it is not wholly irrational ... \u201d", "As to medication , he said ;", "\u201c In my view it was not appropriate under all the circumstances to administer antipsychotic medication forcibly to [ the applicant ] . In particular , I believe that there were significant medical risks associated with forcible medication under restraint in his case .", "Antipsychotic medication is generally appropriate and beneficial in the treatment of psychotic illness but generally not in the treatment of personality disorder . The likelihood that antipsychotic medication would modify [ the applicant ] \u2019s personality characteristics and help him become more relaxed and amenable was low in my opinion ...", "The risks and adverse effects of antipsychotic medication in [ the applicant ] \u2019s case included his medical history and his psychological reactions to the treatment . He was an elderly man with ischaemic heart disease . He had consistently been opposed to taking anti - psychotic medication ...", "It was foreseen that antipsychotic medication would probably have to be given forcibly under restraint . [ The applicant ] had indicated that he would physically resist . It is known that sudden cardiac death can occasionally occur when patients are given medication under restraint . This is recognised as a special risk associated with restraint that does not apply when antipsychotic mediation is given in a normal way . The position is summarised in a Report for ORG between Antipsychotic Drugs and Sudden Death\u2019 , published in DATE [ \u201c the ORG \u201d ] .", "In weighing up the reasonableness of the decision to forcibly medicate [ the applicant ] under restraint the CARDINAL principal concerns are his adverse medical history and the equivocal evidence of medical illness ... I do not think that forcible administration of antipsychotic medication under restraint was appropriate or justified . \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused an application , by the applicant , for an order that the ORG , the ORG and PERSON attend the substantive judicial review hearing for cross - examination on their witness statements . On DATE , the date of the coming into force of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the applicant was granted permission to appeal this refusal to ORG .", "In the meantime , the ORG withdrew his authorisation for the treatment . However , the ORG remained of the view that the applicant required anti - psychotic medication and intended to seek a further ORG certificate to that end unless precluded from doing so by the courts .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and held that cross - examination would be appropriate in this case .", "Lord Justice PERSON found , referring to paragraphs CARDINAL of the ORG v. GPE judgment ( of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , that a court must inevitably reach its own view both as to whether the applicant was indeed incapable of consenting ( or refusing consent ) to the treatment and , depending upon the conclusion on that issue , as to whether the proposed forcible administration of such treatment would threaten his life and so be impermissible under LAW , would be degrading and so impermissible under LAW and would not be justifiable as both necessary and proportionate under LAW , given the extent to which it would invade the appellant \u2019s right to privacy .", "He noted that the \u201c super - Wednesbury test \u201d which had been applied in judicial review cases involving LAW had been found by ORG to be inadequate ( PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ORG ORG ) and he could see no basis upon which an approach disapproved of in the context of homosexuality in the armed forces could be acceptable in the context of forcibly treating mental patients particularly as the case raised a \u201c real question under LAW \u201d .", "He went on to point out that if the applicant was considered to have the capacity to refuse consent to the treatment , it was difficult to suppose that he should nevertheless be forcibly subjected to it despite the ORG \u2019s views : the impact on the applicant \u2019s rights to autonomy and bodily inviolability was immense and its prospective benefits ( not least given his extreme opposition ) appeared \u201c decidedly speculative \u201d . Moreover , even if he was not capable of consenting , the court would need to be satisfied ( in the language of the ORG judgment ) that the medical necessity had been \u201c convincingly shown to exist ... according to the psychiatric principles generally accepted at the time . \u201d", "Accordingly , Lord Justice PERSON concluded that what would be required on a substantive challenge to future treatment would be a \u201c full merits review of the propriety of the treatment proposed and , for that purpose , cross - examination of the specialists . \u201d", "Finally , he did not think that Article CARDINAL added anything to the debate . As to LAW , he stated :", "\u201c If I am correct in having concluded that the [ applicant ] on this challenge is entitled to have the legality of his future treatment plan determined by the court according to its own assessment of the relevant facts , then plainly the requirements of LAW are satisfied : ORG [ on an application for judicial review ] will conduct a merits review on the evidence . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON and Lady Justice PERSON also allowed the appeal . On the question of the level of review , PERSON Justice PERSON had regard to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and found that :", "\u201c Whatever the position before the [ CARDINAL Act ] , the decision to impose treatment without consent upon a protesting patient is a potential invasion of his rights under LAW . ORG is not enough . The [ applicant ] is entitled to a proper hearing , on the merits , of whether the statutory grounds for imposing this treatment upon him against his will are made out : i.e. whether it is treatment for the mental disorder from which he is suffering and whether it should be given to him without his consent \u2018 having regard to the likelihood of its alleviating or preventing a deterioration of his condition\u2019 . If they are , in other words if [ the ORG ] rather than [ Dr G ] is right , then I would hold that this treatment could be given to him .", "This is not the same as saying that every patient is entitled to such a hearing in advance . Once again the analogy with arrest holds good . The ORG and ORG are not determining his civil rights and liabilities . They are merely deciding to impose or authorise treatment in the belief that the statutory grounds for doing so exist . They do not have to go to court for advance authorisation ( although as in the incapacity cases there is nothing to stop them doing so if the case is a particularly difficult or controversial one ) . But once a situation exists in which the treatment can be scrutinised , whether before or after the event , then that scrutiny should take place . \u201d", "PERSON prepared a supplementary report dated DATE as to the applicant \u2019s capacity to consent . PERSON analysed the applicant \u2019s ability to use information and weigh it in the balance in making his decision . He considered that there were CARDINAL aspects to the applicant \u2019s opposition to the treatment , CARDINAL of which were rational , CARDINAL of which was partially rational and partly based on lack of insight , and the last of which was manifestly wrong and based on paranoid suspicion about the motivation of his ORG . Taking this into account PERSON reached the \u2018 overall judgment\u2019 that the applicant had capacity to consent .", "The ORG prepared a second witness statement , dated DATE in response to PERSON original and supplementary reports . He pointed out that the conclusion of ORG , referred to by PERSON was that :", "\u201c There are insufficient epidemiological data to prove that sudden death is more likely among people being treated with antipsychotic medication than it is among the general population . However , there are no data to prove that there is no causal connection between the use of this group of drugs and sudden death . \u201d", "He also stressed that he had given the applicant depot medication rather than a preparation which would have acted immediately . As a result , during the short period where the applicant was being given the injection and was suffering the angina attack the amount of antipsychotic drugs in his blood stream would have been negligible . There was no question of the drugs causing the angina attack . That was caused by the over - exertion .", "He obtained evidence from Prof B , the convenor of the group which wrote ORG , and from Dr D , who sat on the review panel for the said report , both of whom supported his interpretation of the report . Dr D in his letter of reply apparently stated that the risk of sudden death was very small .", "As to capacity the ORG said :", "\u201c [ It ] is clear that [ the applicant ] is not able to believe treatment information which I give him because he is very suspicious about my motives , he sees me as part of a corrupt system in which individuals , including doctors , have no compunction about telling lies in order to support the system and protect themselves ...", "I believe that this is a considerable impairment of [ the applicant ] \u2019s ability to \u201c weigh \u201d information and balance risks and needs in order to come to a reasonable decision , in addition to his difficulty in believing information about his mental condition and treatment needs . This is caused by his suspiciousness and anxiety which derive directly from his mental condition .", "I am entirely satisfied that [ the applicant ] does not have capacity with respect to decisions about the treatment of his mental condition . \u201d", "The ORG also prepared a second witness statement , dated DATE , in which he said that he had been aware of the applicant \u2019s heart condition from the records but that he had considered that the potential benefits of the treatment outweighed the risks .", "Since ORG hearing there have been no further attempts to impose compulsory treatment and the applicant has not attempted to progress the judicial review proceedings to a substantive hearing .", "Detention in a psychiatric institution pursuant to LAW does not , of itself , authorise treatment . The individual \u2019s consent must be obtained or , if that consent is not forthcoming , Part IV of the DATE Act applies . LAW provides that the treatment shall be given for the mental disorder from which the individual suffers : without compliance with this condition , the treatment is unlawful . Sections CARDINAL of the DATE Act then go on to provide a range of additional safeguards graded to reflect the severity of the various treatments which may be contemplated .", "Section CARDINAL , the relevant section for the present case , applies to CARDINAL different forms of treatment ( electronic convulsive therapy and \u201c long - term medication \u201d ) .

The claimant in that case was also a restricted mental patient detained in hospital , who refused to consent to a treatment plan which included the administration of anti - psychotic medication by injection for her psychotic illness .
