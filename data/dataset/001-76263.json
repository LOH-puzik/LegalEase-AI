It concluded that the ORG regime affected the cognitive functioning of detainees in a negative manner , with particular reference to the speed of processing information and response inhibition . This was probably a result of the lack of stimuli in the detention situation . The report further concluded that the ORG regime caused more depression than a restricted community regime and that strip - searches were perceived as humiliating , constituting an extra burden for persons detained in the ORG . On the other hand , the ORG regime provided a better balance between rest and activity than a restricted community regime , as a result of which ORG detainees maintained a healthier life rhythm . In addition it had not been demonstrated that ORG detainees displayed more physical symptoms of persistent mental stress .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under GPE law , the civil courts have traditionally had jurisdiction to grant relief against the authorities , if and in so far as no other relief is available . Where a person bases a claim against the authorities on an allegation that the latter has committed a tort within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Dutch Civil Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) against him or her , the civil courts have jurisdiction in principle . Where the civil courts have jurisdiction , they can also act in summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) in which a plaintiff can , inter alia , request the civil court to issue an order against the authorities . An act by the authorities is unlawful and constitutes a tort when it violates a right of the plaintiff or is contrary to a rule of international or domestic law which seeks to protect the plaintiff \u2019s interests , or to general principles of proper administration ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) . An action in tort is subject to a limitation period of DATE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as to the jurisdiction of the civil courts in cases where an administrative appeal lies , it is an established principle under GPE law that DATE given the closed system of legal remedies ( gesloten system van rechtsmiddelen ) in the GPE legal system \u2013 the civil court should refrain from examining the lawfulness of an administrative decision , provided that the administrative appeal offers sufficient guarantees as to a fair procedure . On this topic , extensive case - law has been developed by ORG ( PERSON ) over DATE , supported by several authorities , to the effect that where an administrative appeal does not offer sufficient guarantees of a fair procedure , the civil courts have full jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the administrative decision . On the other hand , a civil action should be declared inadmissible when another specific remedy exists which offers sufficient guarantees of fair proceedings ( see ORG , DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no .

In a case in which it gave judgment on DATE , ORG examined the question whether a party which considers that it has been injured by a judicial ruling against it can bring a subsequent civil action in tort against the ORG arguing that the judge failed to act with due care in giving that ruling . ORG found that this was not possible , holding that it was solely for the legislature to decide in what cases a remedy was to be provided . It would be incompatible with this principle if an unsuccessful party were to have the possibility , via a civil action , of making the correctness of a [ final ] judicial ruling the subject matter of new proceedings , and thus to obtain a renewed examination in another manner than that provided for by statute . It added that only if the proceedings leading to a judicial decision had breached such fundamental legal principles ( fundamentele rechtsbeginselen ) that the case could no longer be said to have been determined in a fair and impartial manner , and if there was no possibility of appeal nor had there ever been such a possibility , could the ORG be held liable for the effects of such a ruling in a civil action in tort ( GPE DATE , no .

The parties provide different answers to the question as to whether the measures requested by the plaintiff ... constitute a form of redress compatible with our legal system and , if so , whether those measures are suitable and appropriate in this case .", "CARDINAL . [ The judge responsible for provisional measures rejects ] the argument of the ORG that the closed system of legal remedies in criminal proceedings and the corresponding obligation of the ORG to execute rulings of the criminal courts , militate against this form of redress . In this system , no provision has been made to date for ( a suitable response to ) a violation of the kind at issue in the instant case . There have been no prior similar cases , and the possible occurrence of such cases has apparently not been taken into consideration in legislation or in existing case - law . In principle , early release or non - execution of a fine imposed may constitute a suitable form of redress for a violation of LAW kind in issue . This exception to the closed system of legal remedies in criminal cases is , to that extent , consistent with ORG approach in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has referred to the financial compensation awarded by the [ ORG ] and to the satisfaction which , in the case of the applicant , lies in the fact that his complaint was declared well - founded [ by ORG ] . However , these CARDINAL elements do not form a suitable , and certainly not a sufficient , form of redress for the plaintiff . Consequently , they do not stand in the way of the claims being allowed . The plaintiff can request the domestic judge to order that additional measures be taken .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a question , the ORG stated that it was possible , in this respect , to consider measures such as the plaintiff \u2019s serving the remainder of his prison sentence under a less strict regime or the granting of a pardon in accordance with existing procedure . ... Again , these options do not form an obstacle to allowing the claims . The first option does not constitute sufficient redress in this case , while the option of a pardon corresponds to ( a request for ) a concession rather than the granting of a right , which is what is at issue here .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , the ORG should release the plaintiff DATE [ when the plaintiff becomes eligible for early release ] and waive the execution of the sentence in its entirety . Having regard to the nature of the violation of the ORG which is an established fact , a form of redress ( genoegdoening ) which relates to the applicant \u2019s liberty is more suitable , and in any event warrants greater priority than waiving payment of the part of the fine still outstanding .", "CARDINAL . No fixed standard exists for \u2018 offsetting\u2019 the remaining part of the plaintiff \u2019s prison sentence . There are no pertinent reference points on the subject in the existing legislation . This means that the amount of the compensation must be determined on an equitable basis ( naar billijkheid ) . The seriousness of the violation [ of the ORG ] justifies reduction of the sentence by a period equal to PERCENT of DATE for which the applicant was subjected to the regime in the ORG ... This amounts to a reduction of DATE ( round figure ) ...", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this solution , the plaintiff \u2019s claim should be rejected . Indeed , the plaintiff has no urgent interest in a provisional measure which will only take effect after DATE [ when the applicant has served his mitigated sentence ] ... It is assumed that the ORG ( the Minister of ORG ) will execute this ruling and release the plaintiff at a time that can be determined precisely on the basis of the standard set out here . If need be , the plaintiff can apply again in due course to the judge responsible for provisional measures .", "CARDINAL . Each of the parties can in fact be deemed to have been ruled against . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both parties agreed to lodge a direct \u201c leapfrog \u201d appeal on points of law ( sprongcassatie ) with ORG , which dismissed both appeals on DATE . Although it agreed with ORG that the judge responsible for provisional measures had incorrectly assumed that LAW gave Mr Lors\u00e9 an ( independent ) right to redress which , if need be , could be asserted before the domestic judge , it held that this could not lead to the setting - aside of the judgment as , pursuant to the LAW , the ORG was obliged to provide redress . However , relying on the ORG \u2019s reasoning in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( ( LAW ) , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON and ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVIII ) , ORG considered that , although the ORG was in principle free to determine the manner in which redress was to be provided , that freedom did not mean that the domestic judge was unable to take a decision on that point , but simply that a suitable form of redress was to be sought within the domestic legal order . As ORG had acted unlawfully towards PERSON in so far as his rights under LAW had been violated , as found by the ORG , PERSON was entitled to claim compensation from the ORG , which would be acting unlawfully if it failed to provide a suitable form of redress . ORG accepted that such compensation could be granted in a manner other than the payment of a sum of money . In cases such as the present one , where the violation found concerned the manner of execution of a custodial sentence , it could take the form of cessation of the execution of the sentence . ORG found that the order of the judge responsible for provisional measures to cease execution of the prison sentence should be regarded as a suitable form of compensation in kind in the case of PERSON . As regards the argument raised by the ORG that the closed system of legal remedies and the corresponding obligation for the ORG to execute rulings of the criminal courts precluded the form of redress claimed by PERSON , ORG \u2013 while acknowledging that there was a difference between a situation in which the violation found concerned a domestic criminal conviction itself or the proceedings having led to that conviction [ as in the case of PERSON and Others ] and a situation in which the violation found was unrelated to such a conviction or proceedings [ as in the case of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in which the applicant complained that his telephone conversations with PERSON had been recorded by the latter with equipment provided by the police with a view to their use as prosecution evidence against him , the ORG found a violation of LAW on the ground that the conversations in question had not been recorded \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . As the applicant had declined to submit any claims for compensation in respect of pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage , stating that he intended instead to pursue such claims before the domestic courts , the ORG made no award for just satisfaction under those headings . In so far as the applicant claimed compensation for legal costs and expenses incurred by him in the domestic proceedings , the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the criminal proceedings against him had resulted entirely from the violation it had found in his case , taking the view that those proceedings had in fact been occasioned by a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing on the applicant \u2019s part , and recalling that it had already at the admissibility stage rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints touching on the use made of the evidence obtained as a result of the violation found .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date and on the basis of the ORG \u2019s findings in its judgment of DATE , the applicant PERSON filed a request with ORG for revision of the final domestic judgment of DATE , in which ORG \u2013 without the recorded telephone conversations having been relied on in evidence \u2013 had convicted him of having sexually assaulted PERSON and another woman and had sentenced him to a suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and payment of a fine of NLG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , to be replaced by CARDINAL days\u2019 detention in the event of non - payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request for revision and , in accordance with LAW ORG , determined the matter itself . It held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... the ORG has the obligation to provide redress if ORG has found a violation of a LAW provision . Such redress can be provided entirely or in part within the framework of the revision procedure , amended for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the violation of LAW found by ORG , ORG is of the opinion that revision is necessary for the purposes of redress . To that extent , the request is well - founded . ... The request is aimed primarily at having ORG declare the prosecution inadmissible , while quashing the judgment in respect of which revision is sought .", "CARDINAL . ORG can not accede to this request since it is only in exceptional cases that a prosecution may be declared inadmissible , and the instant case can not be considered as such . In this respect the petitioner relies mistakenly on [ ORG judgment of DATE ; NL DATE , no . CARDINAL ] . In that case ORG held that , in certain circumstances , a serious breach of the principles of proper proceedings may lead to the prosecution being declared inadmissible if , as a result of that breach , deliberately or owing to gross negligence of the defendant \u2019s interests , the defendant \u2019s right to a fair hearing has been violated . As ORG , in its decision on admissibility [ M.M .. v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] of CARDINAL DATE , preceding its judgment of DATE , declared inadmissible the [ applicant \u2019s ] complaint under LAW as being manifestly illfounded , it can not be said that there has been a serious breach of the principles of proper proceedings as a result of which , deliberately or owing to gross negligence of the [ applicant \u2019s ] interests , his right to a fair hearing has been violated .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account that , in the proceedings leading to the judgment of which revision is sought , there was no breach of LAW and that the contents of the recorded telephone conversations were not used in evidence , there is no ground for referring the case to ORG under LAW , as requested by the petitioner in the alternative .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the importance of the provision violation and the nature and seriousness of the irreparable defects in the preliminary criminal investigation , as found by ORG , ORG will , after accepting the [ revision ] request , determine the matter itself , in accordance with LAW ORG , and reduce the fine imposed by ORG in the following manner . \u201d", "ORG quashed the original judgment of ORG in part , that is , in respect only of the amount of the fine imposed and the duration of the alternative detention period , reducing the fine by PERCENT to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the duration of the alternative detention to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) as regards the ORG , as set out in its Report on the visit to the GPE from DATE , together with ORG response to those findings , are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON ( cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited the GPE again from CARDINAL to DATE and , in the course of this visit , carried out a follow - up visit to the ORG .

At the time of the DATE visit , ORG ( ORG ) at the FAC was being renovated , and the inmates allocated to it were being held in FAC ( ( GPE ) building nearby ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "In addition to paying a brief visit to the facilities undergoing renovation , the ORG \u2019s delegation examined the regime currently being applied , and devoted attention to the procedures governing placement and extension of placement in ORG .

Following its first visit to the ORG , the ORG expressed considerable concern about the regime applied within the institution . It recommended that the regime be revised , in particular as regards certain of its features : the group system ( if not discarded , to at least be relaxed and inmates to be allowed more out - of - cell time and a broader range of activities ) ; searching policies ( to be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint ) ; and visiting arrangements ( to be reviewed , the objective being to have visits take place under more open conditions ) ( cf . paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "However , in their response ( dated DATE ) to the ORG \u2019s visit report , the NORP authorities defended point by point the different aspects of the regime being applied in the ORG ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the DATE visit , the Director of the FAC and the Acting Director of the ORG informed the ORG \u2019s delegation that a limited number of modifications to the regime and its implementation had taken place . For instance , steps were being taken to increase staff / inmate communication through a training programme known as \u201c Safety at the door \u201d , as well as by the previously - mentioned adaptations of the exercise yards . Further , a slight expansion of the types of activities offered had made it possible for inmates to practice playing musical instruments in their cells . Another positive development was that the special \u201c handcuffs regime \u201d ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) had not been applied in respect of any inmate since DATE .", "However , despite these welcome developments , the regime in the unit was essentially the same as in DATE , and the prison \u2019s management acknowledged that there had been \u201c no change in most of the rules \u201d . Although the official allowance for activities was generous ( TIME ) , in practice , most inmates\u2019 out - of - cell time did not appear to have increased ( averaging TIME per day ) . The stringing of plastic curtain hooks on short rods , which was performed individually in the cells , continued to be the only work offered . It remained the case that body searches - including anal inspections - were performed on each prisoner at least once DATE , a process which was invariably perceived as humiliating . Conditions under which visits and sessions with non - custodial staff took place also continued to be very restrictive . Inmates\u2019 remarks to the delegation ( e.g. \u201c losing positivity \u201d , lacking \u201c future feelings \u201d , \u201c beginning to hate people from the heart \u201d , and/or having to cope by being \u201c mentally separate \u201d ) frequently echoed those made in DATE .", "To sum up , inmates held in the ORG remained subject to a very impoverished regime .", "CARDINAL . In an environment which is potentially hazardous to the mental health of prisoners , it is of critical importance to provide a varied programme of appropriate stimulating activities ( including education , sport , work of vocational value , etc . ) . The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to make further efforts with a view to increasing out - of - cell time , allowing for more human contact , expanding the range of activities ( work and education ) , and alleviating searching measures for prisoners held in the ORG . Less constrained contact should be encouraged with all staff .", "Following a recommendation made by the ORG in its previous periodic visit report ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , the NORP authorities commissioned ORG to carry out an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the ORG . A preliminary study completed on DATE concluded that \u201c an empirical examination of the possible effects of a maximum security regime on the mental conditions of prisoners is feasible . \u201d The NORP authorities have indicated that such an empirical examination has in fact commenced and would be completed by DATE . The ORG trusts that it will receive the results of the study in due course .", "CARDINAL point raised by the preliminary study may be noted , i.e that the lack of influence of detainees on the severity of the regime being applied to them constitutes a \u201c contradiction in the policy \u201d of the ORG .

Less constrained contact should be encouraged with all staff ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "Response : Prisoners in the ORG spend a total of TIME a week on out - of - cell activities , and these activities are no less varied than in other prisons . They include exercise , visits , sport , work , education and recreation . Not all prisoners take part in all activities . What they do depends partly on interest and ability . The work in the ORG is simple . However , it is difficult to provide work that is more varied and yet meets security requirements . In principle , work in the ORG is done jointly . The Government refutes the claim that , on average , prisoners participate in activities for no more than between TIME a day . In fact they spend an average of TIME a day in out - of - cell activities .", "The Government agrees that prisoners and staff should have more contact . Fenced - off walkways for staff have now been erected in the exercise yards . They provide more opportunities for informal contact and interaction between prisoners and staff .", "The number of searches has been sharply reduced since the opening of the ORG . Besides a DATE search during cell checks , searches are carried out after visits to areas containing potentially dangerous objects , such as the hairdresser \u2019s or the doctor \u2019s or dentist \u2019s surgery , and after contact with the outside world , such as visits . Searches are still necessary from the point of view of security . The Government would point out that searches are also conducted in ordinary prisons .", "On DATE , in CARDINAL separate cases against the GPE , ORG ruled that : \u201c the combination of routine strip - searching with the other stringent security measures in the ORG amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of LAW .
