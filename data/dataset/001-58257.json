He blamed PERSON for all his troubles but would not do a \u201c PERSON \u201d in a school but would see him at his home .

On DATE ORG broke into a car parked near a clay - pigeon shoot near GPE in GPE and stole a shotgun . He sawed off both barrels . While the theft was reported to the local police , because there was nothing to connect the incident to ORG the theft did not come to the attention of the GPE police dealing with the case .", "CARDINAL .

According to the record of the interview , ORG said that he had been planning the attacks ever since he lost his job , and for DATE he had been watching the Osmans\u2019 house . Although he considered Mr Perkins as his main target , he also regarded PERSON and PERSON as being responsible for his losing his position at ORG . ORG stated that he had been hoping in the back of his mind that the police would stop him . He admitted holding the family at gunpoint as they returned to the house , making PERSON and PERSON kneel down in the kitchen , turning out the light and shooting at them . He denied that on earlier occasions he had damaged the windows of the Osmans\u2019 house but admitted that he had let down the tyres of their car as a prank .

On DATE ORG was convicted of CARDINAL charges of manslaughter having pleaded guilty on grounds of diminished responsibility ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was sentenced to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . An inquest was held into the death of PERSON after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings . Since a person had been convicted in connection with the death , the Coroner did not hold a full inquest ( section CARDINAL of the Coroner \u2019s Act DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants commenced proceedings against , inter alios , the Commissioner of Police of the LOC alleging negligence in that although the police were aware of PERSON - Lewis\u2019 activities since DATE they failed to apprehend or interview him , search his home or charge him with an offence before DATE . Orders for discovery of documents were made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Commissioner issued an application to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action . ORG judge dismissed the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appeal by the Commissioner ( PERSON and another v. PERSON and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports at p. CARDINAL ) . In its judgment , the court held that in light of previous authorities no action could lie against the police in negligence in the investigation and suppression of crime on the grounds that public policy required an immunity from suit .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice GPE found , inter alia :", "\u201c In my judgment the plaintiffs [ the applicants ] have therefore an arguable cause that as between [ the second applicant ] and his family , on the one hand and the investigating officers , on the other , there existed a very close degree of proximity amounting to a special relationship . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , having regard to the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) , from which he found no relevant distinction , he considered that the matters in issue were failures in investigation of crime and thus public policy doomed the action to failure . He rejected the argument that where the class of victim was sufficiently proximate and sufficiently small the public policy argument might not apply . He found that Lord PERSON in the LOC case had treated public policy as a separate point that is not reached unless there is a duty of care .", "The second judge in ORG , Lord Justice PERSON , also held that on grounds of public policy the claims were not maintainable but refrained from expressing an opinion as to whether the facts , if proved , were sufficient to establish a relationship sufficiently proximate to found a duty of care . Lord Justice PERSON agreed with the judgment of Lord Justice PERSON . The applicants\u2019 claim was accordingly struck out .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG and the application to ORG for leave to appeal was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The domestic courts had not established the full facts of the case since ORG pleaded guilty to the charges against him and a full inquest was not conducted into the death of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , the applicants\u2019 civil action against the police was struck out as showing no reasonable cause of action ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having examined the submissions and materials of the parties especially as regards the facts in dispute the Commission proceeded to the establishment of the facts of the case . Its findings may be summarised as follows .", "DATE . As to the CARDINAL meetings which took place between the police and the school DATE and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Commission was satisfied that the police were made aware of the substance of the events and of the school \u2019s concerns about the disturbing attachment which ORG was showing towards PERSON as well as PERSON - Lewis\u2019 worrying reaction towards PERSON .", "Furthermore , Mr Prince had in all probability informed ORG PERSON and PERSON on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) about the graffiti incident , the theft of the school files and PERSON - Lewis\u2019 change of name , even if both officers had no recollection of having been told CARDINAL matters . Like the meetings between PC PERSON and PERSON , no police notes appear to have been taken . However , the Commission did not find it established that at this stage the police had made any commitment to searching PERSON - Lewis\u2019 home or were seriously concerned about the possibility of ORG kidnapping PERSON . These hypotheses emerge from the memoranda drawn up by ORG officers around this time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and were probably based on the contacts which the officers had with Mr Prince and not on any direct contact between the officers and the police .", "CARDINAL . While all the vandalism on the Osmans\u2019 home and property DATE had been reported to the police and the family had informed the police of its concern that ORG was behind the attacks , the only step taken during that period was to invite ORG to the police station for an interview ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the Commission \u2019s opinion , little reliance could be placed on PERSON - Lewis\u2019 later assertions that he told PC PERSON during the interview that he was in danger of doing something criminally insane . No police notes or records of this meeting which took place on an unspecified date could be traced .", "CARDINAL . Following the alleged ramming incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the police immediately interviewed the NORP and the NORP and photographed the graffiti at the school ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Although Detective PERSON in his undated report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had stated that there was no evidence that ORG was responsible for the graffiti and the attacks on the Osmans\u2019 home the police had nevertheless taken the view that he was presenting a sufficient threat that formal steps should be taken against him . Thus the decision was taken on CARDINAL DATE to arrest ORG on suspicion of criminal damage .", "The ORG was also satisfied that there was no evidence that ORG had made any direct or indirect threats against the NORP during his meeting with ORG officers on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It placed greater weight on the contemporaneous notes of the meeting rather than on the statement of CARDINAL of the officers taken DATE that ORG threatened at the meeting to commit a \u201c PERSON massacre \u201d . According to the notes of the meeting , ORG is reported as having stated that he would not do a \u201c PERSON \u201d at the school but would see the deputy at home . In the ORG \u2019s view , this would explain why the police requested that a casual watch should be kept on Mr ORG address . Furthermore , despite the wording of the ORG memorandum of CARDINAL DATE and of Mr Prince \u2019s rather cryptic diary entry on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) it seemed unlikely PERSON that the police had referred to or promised police protection to the PERSON family especially since none was in fact envisaged or provided . The school authorities had probably received this impression from the assurances given by the police that the necessary measures were being taken to deal with the situation including the vague threats made against Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Commission did not find it established that the letter sent by the ORG to ORG at the request of the police following the failed arrest attempt on CARDINAL DATE caused ORG to disappear ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It was also satisfied that the police took no further active steps to trace the whereabouts of ORG from DATE apart from placing his name on ORG in DATE . In addition , there were no contemporaneous records to support the assertion that ORG had informed the police about ORG being seen by her son around the PERSON home in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It may have been the case that PERSON Green merely left a message with the police station that ORG should ring her back . In that event , it was not surprising that ORG had not been able to make a connection between a PERSON and the ORG file since the case had been dormant for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Lord PERSON in ORG found :", "CARDINAL . While he considered this sufficient to dispose of the appeal , Lord PERSON went on to set out public - policy objections to the existence of an action in negligence against the police in the performance of their duties in the investigation and suppression of crime .", "\u201c Potential existence of such liability may in many instances be in the general public interest , as tending towards the observance of a higher standard of care in the carrying on of various different types of activity . I do not , however , consider that this can be said of police activities . The general sense of public duty which motivates police forces is unlikely to be appreciably reinforced by the imposition of such liability so far as concerns their function in the investigation and suppression of crime . From time to time they make mistakes in the exercise of that function , but it is not to be doubted that they apply their best endeavours to the performance of it . In some instances the imposition of liability may lead to the exercise of a function being carried on in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind . The possibility of this happening in relation to the investigative operations of the police can not be excluded . Further it would be reasonable to expect that if potential liability were to be imposed it would be not uncommon for actions to be raised against police forces on the ground that they had ORG failed to catch some criminal as soon as they might have done , with the result that he went on to commit further crimes . While some such actions might involve allegations of a simple and straightforward type of failure DATE for example that a police officer negligently tripped and fell while pursuing a burglar \u2013 others would be likely to enter deeply into the general nature of a police investigation , as indeed the present action would seek to do . The manner of conduct of such an investigation must necessarily involve a variety of decisions to be made on matters of policy and discretion , for example as to which particular line of inquiry is most advantageously to be pursued and what is the most advantageous way to deploy the available resources . Many such decisions would not be regarded by the courts as appropriate to be called in question , yet elaborate investigation of the facts might be necessary to ascertain whether or not this was so . A great deal of police time , trouble and expense might be expected to have to be put into the preparation of the defence to the action and the attendance of witnesses at the trial . The result would be significant diversion of police manpower and attention from their most important function , that of the suppression of crime . Closed investigations would require to be reopened and retraversed , not with the object of bringing any criminal to justice but to ascertain whether or not they had been competently conducted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON commented :", "\u201c ... if this action lies , every citizen will be able to require the court to investigate the performance of every policeman . If the policeman concentrates on CARDINAL crime , he may be accused of neglecting others . If the policeman does not arrest on suspicion a suspect with previous convictions , the police force may be held liable for subsequent crimes . The threat of litigation against a police force would not make a policeman more efficient .

In Swinney and another v. the Chief Constable of GPE ( [ DATE ] Queen \u2019s Bench Reports at p.

The information was recorded , naming the plaintiff , in a document which was left in an unattended police vehicle , which was broken into with the result that the document was stolen , came into the possession of the person implicated and the plaintiff was threatened with violence and arson and suffered psychiatric damage . The plaintiff \u2019s claim in negligence against the police was struck out but allowed on appeal by ORG judge . The Chief Constable appealed contending that the police owed no duty of care or alternatively that public policy precluded the prosecution of the claim since the police were immune for claims arising out of their activities in the investigation or suppression of crime . ORG dismissed the appeal .", "In his judgment Lord Justice PERSON referring to the cases of ORG and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) stated that he could not accept a claim of blanket immunity for the police in this case , but that there were other considerations of public policy in this case , namely , the need to protect springs of information , to protect informers and to encourage them to come forward . On the facts of the case , it was arguable that the police had assumed a responsibility of confidentiality towards the plaintiff . The case should therefore proceed to trial .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice Ward held that it was arguable that :", "\u201c There is a special relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant , which is sufficiently proximate . ORG is shown by the police assuming responsibility , and the plaintiffs relying upon that assumption of responsibility , for preserving the confidentiality of the information which , if it fell into the wrong hands , was likely to expose the first plaintiff and members of her family to a special risk of damage from the criminal acts of others , greater than the general risk which ordinary members of the public must endure with phlegmatic fortitude .", "It is fair , just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty , there being no overwhelming dictate of public policy to exclude the prosecution of this claim . On the one hand there is , as more fully set out in GPE v. the Chief Constable ... an important public interest that the police should carry out their difficult duties to the best of their endeavours without being fettered by , or even influenced by , the spectre of litigation looming over every judgment they make , every discretion they exercise , every act they undertake or omit to perform , in their ceaseless battle to investigate and suppress crime . The greater good rightly outweighs any individual hardship . On the other hand it is incontrovertible that the fight against crime is DATE dependent upon information fed to the police by members of the public , often at real risk of villainous retribution from the criminals and their associates . The public interest will not accept that good citizens should be expected to entrust information to the police without also expecting that they are entrusting their safety to the police . The public interest would be affronted were it to be the law that members of the public should be expected , in the execution of public service , to undertake the risk of harm to themselves without the police , in return , being expected to take no more than reasonable care to ensure that the confidential information imparted to them is protected ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
