The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and who lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of an organised criminal gang , tax fraud , perjury and other related offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded him in custody . That decision was justified by the strong evidence against the applicant , the gravity of the offences with which he had been charged and the severity of the penalty which could be imposed if convicted . In addition , the court relied on the risk that the applicant would induce witnesses to give false testimony and also go into hiding if released . The latter ground was justified in the light of the fact that the applicant did not have a fixed residence prior to his arrest .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal against the above detention order was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended by the decisions of ORG issued on DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and by the decisions of ORG ( PERSON ) issued on DATE and DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Likewise , the applicant \u2019s request for release was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG released the applicant from detention , placing him under police supervision ( doz\u00f3r policyjny ) . The court considered that keeping the applicant in detention was no longer necessary since the majority of witnesses had already been examined by the trial court and in the light of the fact that the applicant had been recently registered at a fixed residence address .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the criminal proceedings against him are currently pending .", "CARDINAL . In parallel to his pre - trial detention subject of the instant application , the applicant served CARDINAL separate prison sentences imposed on him by a competent criminal court . The CARDINAL prison terms amounted to DATE , DATE and DATE . And thus from DATE until DATE the applicant was serving a sentence imposed on him by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and from CARDINAL DATE until DATE the applicant was serving a sentence , which was imposed on him by the same court in its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
