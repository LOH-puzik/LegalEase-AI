On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the company for fraud , theft and fraudulent breach of trust and sought leave to join the proceedings as a civil party seeking damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge discontinued the proceedings in an order worded as follows :", "\u201c It appears , in fact , from the evidence given by the civil parties and the head of PERSON and from the documents produced by the parties that the leasing arrangement , the mechanism of which has been described as fraudulent by the civil party , does not fall within the ambit of the criminal law . The disputes between [ the applicant ] and PERSON are clearly matters governed by civil or commercial law and have , moreover , given rise to various proceedings of this type in the civil or commercial courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
