The applicant , who has a severe learning disability , has CARDINAL children . From DATE she was in receipt of CARDINAL non - contributory state benefits administered by the Secretary of ORG : child benefit and means - tested income support . Her income support personal allowance was assessed on the basis that she was a lone parent . She received an additional amount of personal allowance for each child who was a member of her family and a family premium . The benefits were paid by order book .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to regulation CARDINAL ) of the Income Support ( General ) Regulations DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the applicant was under a duty to report any change of circumstance which might affect her entitlement to benefit to ORG ( \u201c DWP \u201d ) . A note on the back of her order book advised her that she might break the law if she did not notify the ORG if a dependent or someone living with her moved to a different address . She had also received a Form INFCARDINAL , which advised her that she should immediately inform the ORG if , inter alia , children that she had claimed for were taken into care .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL children were taken into care . She did not report this fact to the ORG . At the time , however , the applicant did not have the services of a social worker and she did not receive any practical help from the local authority disability team . It was accepted that she did not realise that this was a fact which she was required to report .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant began to receive support from ORG , a charity which provides a range of support services to people with learning difficulties .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Owl Housing notified the ORG that the applicant \u2019s children had been taken into care . There followed CARDINAL separate decisions . First , the Secretary of ORG decided , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , to supersede her award of income support to reflect the fact that she had been receiving benefit to which she was not entitled . Secondly , a decision was made that the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were satisfied so that the Secretary of ORG was entitled to recover the overpayment . Thirdly , the Secretary of ORG decided to exercise his discretion so as to recover the overpayment . Fourthly , the Secretary of ORG decided to recover the overpayment by reducing the applicant \u2019s future payments of income support by the amount permitted by regulation CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The amount of income support that the applicant had received in respect of her children after they had been taken into care was GBP CARDINAL . However , this amount was reduced by PERCENT ORG because during the relevant period the applicant could have claimed , but did not claim , an income support disability premium .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision that she had to repay GBP MONEY . She relied on previous decisions of ORG , in which they held that there would be no failure to disclose unless disclosure was reasonably to be expected . If there was no failure to disclose , the question of recovery of an overpayment would not arise at all . The ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that the relevant test was not what a reasonable man would have thought it appropriate to disclose , but rather what a reasonable man knowing the particular circumstances of the claimant would have expected her to disclose . The ORG accepted that the applicant did not understand that the placing of her children in care was a material fact which she needed to disclose to the ORG , and that it was not reasonable to expect her , in the particular circumstances of her case , to have disclosed that fact .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Commissioners \u201d ) . The Commissioners allowed the appeal , holding that if a claimant was aware of a matter which he or she had been required to disclose , there would be a breach of that duty even if , because of mental incapacity , the claimant was unaware of the materiality or relevance of the matter or did not understand an unambiguous request for information . Notwithstanding the settled case - law of the Commissioners , the \u201c reasonableness test \u201d was not a requirement under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and did not represent a possible construction of section CARDINAL . Capacity was not relevant to the issue of failure to disclose and the applicant was in breach of the obligations imposed on her under the first limb of regulation CARDINAL ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . She submitted that there had been a violation of LAW read in conjunction with LAW No . I in that the ORG \u2019s interference with her possessions discriminated unjustifiably between people who were unable to report facts because they were not aware of them and people who , like the applicant , were unable to report them for some other reason . It was argued in the alternative that the law treated identically people who were capable and people who were incapable of understanding that there was a fact which they were required to report .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the argument fell at the first fence because there were no possessions of the applicant at stake : what the Secretary of ORG was claiming was an entitlement to recover money which should not have been paid to the applicant in the first place . Although the decision of ORG in the case of NORP ( PERSON and PERSON ) v. the Secretary of ORG for Work and Pensions to the effect that a noncontributory benefit such as income support was not a possession within the meaning of Article CARDINAL was taken as correct by ORG , the underlying issue of principle awaited the decision of ORG in the case of NORP . The recovery of overpaid benefits , however , stood outside this question and by parity of reasoning outside LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to reject in any event the applicant \u2019s first alleged ground of discrimination as it did not consider people who were unable to report facts because they were not aware of them to be in an analogous , or relevantly similar , situation to people who were unable to report them for some other reason . The proposition that you could not report something that you did not know was a simple proposition of logic , whereas the proposition that you could not report something you did not appreciate you had to report depended on difficult questions of cognitive capacity and moral sensitivity which varied from person to person .", "CARDINAL . As to the latter ground relied upon by the applicant , namely that the law treated identically people who were capable and people who were incapable of understanding that there was a fact which they were required to report , ORG found it unnecessary to determine what was considered to be a difficult question , since the recovery of overpaid benefits could not in any event amount to a deprivation of possessions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , regulation CARDINAL ) of the DATE Regulations provided that :", "\u201c Except in the case of a jobseeker \u2019s allowance , every beneficiary and every person by whom or on whose behalf sums payable by way of benefit are receivable shall furnish in such a manner and at such times as the Secretary of ORG ... may determine such certificates or other documents and such information and facts affecting the right to benefit or its receipt as the Secretary of ORG ... may require ( either as a condition on which any sum or sums shall be receivable or otherwise ) and in particular shall notify the Secretary of ORG ... of any change of circumstances which he might reasonably be expected to know might affect the right to benefit , or to its receipt , as soon as reasonably practicable after its occurrence , by giving notice in writing ( unless the Secretary of ORG ... determines in any particular case to accept notice otherwise than in writing ) of any such change to the appropriate office . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
