The first article reported on allegations by a NORP civil servant concerning irregularities in the NORP institutions . The second concerned the internal investigations ORG had carried out into those allegations .", "CARDINAL . A rumour began to circulate within ORG that the applicant had paid MONEY ( ORG ) or NORP marks ( ORG ) to a NORP civil servant in exchange for this information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE OLAF , suspecting the applicant of having bribed a civil servant in order to obtain confidential information concerning investigations in progress in the NORP institutions , opened an internal investigation to identify the person who had disclosed the information to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The minutes of an ORG meeting held on CARDINAL and DATE stated in particular :", "\u201c The members of ORG noted that the journalist \u2019s articles were not at all aggressive in tone but hinted at the real situation , as was often the case with individuals . They were surprised that ORG \u2019s press release referred to a payment for such information . Consequently , they wished to be informed whether such a payment had been made and whether any serious evidence existed in this regard . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE written in the course of his inquiry into a complaint ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/GG ) filed by the applicant against ORG , ORG indicated that the suspicions that the applicant had bribed an ORG official had originated from \u201c information from reliable sources , including members of the NORP Parliament \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a press release entitled \u201c OLAF clarification regarding an apparent leak of information \u201d . The press release was worded as follows :", "\u201c On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) issued a press release announcing that it had opened an internal investigation under LAW into an apparent leak of confidential information included in a report prepared within ORG . It stated that according to information received by the ORG , a journalist had received a number of documents relating to the so - called \u2018 ... affair\u2019 , and that it was not excluded that payment might have been made to somebody within ORG ( or possibly another ORG institution ) for these documents . ORG \u2019s enquiries have not yet been completed but to date , ORG has not obtained proof that such a payment was made . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued his decision . He had already submitted a draft recommendation to ORG on DATE . The decision , which essentially reproduced the conclusions set out in the draft , stated in particular :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL ... by publishing this press release , ORG has not adequately implemented the ORG \u2019s draft recommendation . Instead of withdrawing the allegations of bribery , ORG simply states that \u2018 to date\u2019 it has not found sufficient evidence to support these allegations . The wording of this press release thus implies that ORG considers it possible that evidence supporting these allegations could still emerge . In these circumstances , the action taken by ORG is manifestly inadequate to remedy the instance of maladministration that the ORG has identified . A critical remark will therefore be made in this respect .", "...", "CARDINAL . Conclusion", "CARDINAL On the basis of the ORG \u2019s inquiries into this complaint , it is necessary to make the following critical remark :", "By proceeding to make allegations of bribery without a factual basis that is both sufficient and available for public scrutiny , ORG has gone beyond what is proportional to the purpose pursued by its action . This constitutes an instance of maladministration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE OLAF lodged a complaint with the NORP judicial authorities , submitting a report on the internal investigation it had carried out . It also referred the matter to the NORP judicial authorities .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE , an investigation was opened in respect of a person or persons unknown for breach of professional confidence and bribery involving a civil servant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the investigating judge , the applicant \u2019s home and workplace were searched by the NORP judicial authorities . Almost all of the applicant \u2019s working papers and tools were seized and placed under seal ( CARDINAL crates of papers , CARDINAL boxes of files , CARDINAL computers , CARDINAL mobile telephones and a metal cabinet ) . It appears that the search warrant was not handed to the applicant but was read out to him . No inventory of the items seized was drawn up . On that occasion , the criminal investigation department apparently led the applicant to believe that the search was in response to a complaint lodged by ORG , which suspected him of having bribed a NORP civil servant in order to obtain confidential information . According to the applicant , the authorities subsequently lost a whole crate of papers , which was not found until DATE , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant applied to ORG at ORG for leave to consult the investigation file . His application was refused in a letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied again on DATE , to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , he had applied to the investigating judge to have the measures relating to the seizure discontinued .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE the investigating judge rejected his application .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , alleging , inter alia , a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the order on DATE , holding as follows :", "\u201c The question whether or not protection of the confidentiality of sources of information used by journalists constitutes a right inherent in press freedom , and , if so , whether that right has an absolute value or is subject to restrictions , has not yet been established in law .", "The actual wording of LAW does not recognise the protection of journalistic sources , a right which has developed through the case - law of ORG , albeit without having been enshrined as an absolute value according to legal authorities ( see , to this effect , the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , no . CARDINAL , Human Rights Information Bulletin no . CARDINAL , DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "Recent legislative initiatives tend to acknowledge that journalists are entitled to protect their sources of information , although the exercise of this right does not give rise to immunity from prosecution or from civil liability ( see in this connection the PERSON granting journalists the right not to disclose their sources of information , passed by ORG on DATE , and the opinion of ORG on the legislative proposals to grant journalists the right to protect their sources of information , approved by ORG on DATE ) .", "The investigative measure complained of is , admittedly , an interference in the rights guaranteed by LAW ORG . It was , however , lawfully ordered by the competent investigating judge in connection with the matter referred to him .", "It pursues legitimate aims since , in the context of the information in the case file brought to the attention of the court , whereby the applicant is charged as principal or joint principal in a case of bribery intended to secure the disclosure of confidential information , its purpose is to \u2018 verify whether the protection of confidentiality applies to a lawful or unlawful source ; the latter must be overridden by a superior value , namely the prevention of ORG written application by ORG of DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "As is rightly noted by the investigating judge , it is not acceptable that the right to protect sources can be used to cover up offences , since this would deprive that right of its purpose , notably the provision of accurate and reliable information to the public , and would be likely to jeopardise public safety by creating de facto impunity ( see to this effect the judgment of ORG DATE , ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "...", "In the instant case , as the investigating judge noted in the order appealed against , in particular on page CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , the requirements of the investigation still dictate that the orders for items to be seized and placed under seal should be maintained , being justified by the ongoing duty to investigate , the sole manifest aim of which is to verify the good faith of the applicant in seeking to establish the truth in the context of the preventive measures underlying the referral to the investigating judge .", "The arguments advanced by the applicant in his submissions to this court , which can not substitute its own findings for those of the court below , do not give rise to any doubt in this respect .", "It follows that the appeal is unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . Relying in particular on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the Convention , he submitted that freedom of expression included the freedom to seek out and collect information , essential aspects of journalistic activity . According to the applicant , that meant that journalists\u2019 sources were to be protected and kept confidential and that the judicial authorities were prohibited from taking measures or decisions intended to force journalists or organs of the press to reveal their sources . The applicant also complained that since he had not had access to the investigation file , he had been unable to inspect the evidence deemed to be serious and relevant which had been used to justify the search .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that LAW authorised restrictions on freedom of expression , that the search and seizure were provided for by LAW and that ORG had given sufficient and adequate reasons for its decision . ORG further held that the lawfulness of a search was not dependent upon the existence of strong evidence of the guilt of the person at whose home or workplace the search was carried out . It was sufficient for the investigating judge to have evidence suggesting that that these LOC might be harbouring documents or items useful in establishing the truth concerning the offences mentioned in the search warrant . Consequently , the objection raised by the applicant was outside the scope of the review of the lawfulness of the investigation and did not constitute a ground permitted by law to support an appeal on points of law under LAW , and was therefore inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL and DATE , the applicant had lodged CARDINAL applications with ORG of ORG . The first sought the annulment of the complaint filed by ORG and compensation for the harm allegedly caused to the applicant \u2019s career and reputation . The second sought a temporary injunction prohibiting ORG from inspecting any document seized during the searches at issue . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the President of the court dismissed the applications . The President ruled that ORG \u2019s decision to forward the report on the internal investigation had no binding legal effect and could not therefore be the subject of an action for annulment . He stressed in particular that ORG \u2019s conclusions set out in a final report could not automatically give rise to the opening of judicial or disciplinary proceedings , given that the competent authorities remained free to decide on the action to be taken in relation to the report . As regards the applicant \u2019s application for interim measures , he ruled that there was no causal link between the alleged harm and ORG \u2019s action and that it had not been established that ORG had acted in breach of the principles of good administration and proportionality .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . By an order of DATE the President of ORG of ORG upheld the order .", "CARDINAL . In the context of those proceedings , the applicant received a copy of ORG \u2019s complaint but not of the other documents in the criminal file . At that time , he had not been charged in GPE . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor informed the applicant \u2019s counsel that the investigation in GPE had been closed without any charges being brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG drafted a special report for ORG following the draft recommendation he had addressed to ORG in connection with a fresh complaint filed by the applicant ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL/GG ) . In the complaint the applicant alleged that during the inquiry into complaint no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/GG , ORG had provided incorrect information that was prone to mislead the ORG ; he requested the latter to conduct a new inquiry .", "CARDINAL . In his above - mentioned report , the ORG stated that the alleged remarks by the members of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had probably never been made . They were rumours circulated by another journalist , PERSON , which the Director General of ORG had not bothered to check with the members of ORG concerned .", "CARDINAL . In his recommendation , the ORG concluded that ORG should acknowledge that it had made incorrect and misleading statements in its submissions to the ORG in the context of the latter \u2019s inquiry into complaint no .
