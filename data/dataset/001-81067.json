It rejected the applicant association 's cassation appeal because the provisions of the NORP statute contravened the relevant legislation .

The judicial division therefore considers that LAW , CARDINAL of the statute ... do not fully correspond to the legislation .

Most of the organisations , which owned the property that should be restituted , ceased to exist and ORG is represented by several organisations .
