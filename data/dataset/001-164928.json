The applicant was a minority shareholder in and the CEO of a liquefied gas supply company from southern GPE in which the ORG owned PERCENT of the shares . In DATE a criminal investigation was initiated in respect of an alleged unsuccessful attempt by the applicant to commit a fraud in connection with his activity at the company . In particular , he was accused of having , DATE , devised a scheme involving the importation of liquefied gas from GPE and GPE , as a result of which the company had sustained major financial losses . According to the accusation , instead of purchasing gas directly from the producers , he had called on the services of intermediary companies , resulting in a significant increase in the price of the gas . Those intermediary companies also had ties with his sons . Later , when his company was faced with a court claim from the intermediary companies amounting to CARDINAL United States dollars plus penalties , he had acknowledged that debt in court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , in DATE the investigating authorities summoned the applicant to appear before them and to make a statement . In his defence the applicant argued that his company could not purchase gas directly from the producers , because the minimum quantity which the producers agreed to sell exceeded his company \u2019s needs for DATE . Therefore , it was impossible for his company to purchase the amounts of gas needed directly from the producers . Moreover , the producers PERCENT pre - payment and his company did not have the available funds . He submitted that all national gas importers used the same method of importing gas and that the price of the gas purchased by his company was lower than that on the free national market . He further argued that the difference in price between that of the producers and that paid by his company was explained by transportation costs , certification , handling , insurance and other factors . He also denied that his sons were in any way involved in the intermediary companies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned on several occasions and in each case appeared before the investigating authorities and cooperated with them . In DATE the applicant \u2019s house was searched , his personal computer was seized and various documents were extracted from it . It does not transpire from the case file that there were any instances when the applicant did not comply with the instructions of the investigators and/or that he was ever accused of obstructing the investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s sons , who were also suspects in the criminal proceedings and were subsequently charged , were summoned to appear before the investigating authorities without being arrested . Later , CARDINAL different investigations were initiated in respect of the applicant and all of them were joined in a single procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and on CARDINAL DATE he was formally charged with the attempted large - scale misappropriation of goods belonging to the company where he worked , namely with the facts described in paragraph CARDINAL above . On DATE , the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to ORG for a DATE detention warrant on the following grounds : the seriousness of the offence , the risk of influencing witnesses and the risk of reoffending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected and argued that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence . In particular , he submitted that the criminal proceedings against him were nothing but a means of influencing the outcome of pending civil proceedings concerning the debt owned by the ORG - owned company and the intermediary companies . In any event , the grounds relied upon by the prosecutor were stereotyped and the prosecutor had failed to explain the reasons for his belief that the applicant would attempt to influence witnesses and reoffend . He submitted that he was a well - known person in the region and that he had worked at his company for DATE . He had a permanent residence , had been cooperating with the investigation since DATE and had never attempted to abscond or hinder the investigation . Moreover , he relied on his age and on his poor state of health , submitting that he had suffered a heart attack and a stroke .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly upheld the prosecutor \u2019s application and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the deed with which [ the applicant ] is charged is considered to be an exceptionally serious offence , which allows for detention pending trial . [ The court ] takes into account the nature and seriousness of the offence and the complexity of the case , and considers that at this incipient stage of the investigation there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused could collude with others ( his sons , who have not been questioned ) in order to take a common position .", "The other reasons relied upon by the prosecutor , namely the risk of absconding and influencing witnesses or that of destroying evidence , are not substantiated and are not very probable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , contending that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence . He reiterated his previous statement to the effect that the criminal proceedings pursued the ulterior motive of influencing the outcome of pending civil proceedings between the company at which he worked and a third company . He further argued that the ground relied upon by the court to order his detention on remand , namely the risk of his colluding with his sons , had not been invoked by the prosecutor . Moreover , his CARDINAL sons had not been formally charged and , in any case , all of them had had plenty of time to collude DATE , when they first learned of the investigation , and DATE had they been so inclined . The applicant also relied on his serious medical condition and submitted that he was a well - known individual with a family , a residence and a job in GPE , who had appeared before the investigating authorities whenever he had been summoned during the period from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE , essentially repeating the grounds given by the lower court without giving any reasons for dismissing the arguments put forward by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case applied to the court for the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand by DATE . He relied on such reasons as the gravity of the offence , the risk of influencing witnesses , the risk of reoffending and the risk of absconding .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected , submitting that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence and no reason to believe that he would influence witnesses who had already been questioned . He also emphasised that he had cooperated irreproachably with the investigation before his arrest and that he had a permanent residence . He therefore asked the court to order the replacement of the measure of detention with another less severe measure . CARDINAL of his lawyers asked the court to order a less severe measure such as , for instance , house arrest , in place of the detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand by DATE . After recapitulating the parties\u2019 positions and citing the applicable provisions of the law , the court found that :", "\u201c ... the grounds relied on when applying the preventive measure [ of detention ] remain valid , the majority of the investigative actions have been carried out , but a number of additional measures requiring [ the applicant \u2019s ] participation are still necessary in order to send the case to the trial court . The court considers that the application on the part of the defence to replace the preventive measure is premature , taking into account the seriousness and complexity of the case and the need to protect public order and the public interest , as well as to ensure the smooth and objective course of the investigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done previously .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court gave essentially the same reasons as it had done in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , namely the gravity and the complexity of the case , the risk of absconding or influencing witnesses and the risk of destroying documentary evidence which have not yet been collected by the prosecutors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case applied for a further prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand of DATE . He argued that the case was complex and that new charges had been brought against the applicant in the context of the same proceedings : he had now been charged also with abusing his position and overstepping his duties . As on previous occasions , the prosecutor argued that the extension of the detention was necessary in order to avoid the risk of the applicant \u2019s influencing witnesses and reoffending .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant objected and asked the court to replace the measure of detention with another measure . He submitted the same reasons as before and added that his health had considerably deteriorated during detention and that he needed medical care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand by DATE , stating that the reasons for his continued detention remained valid .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , submitting inter alia that the complexity of the case invoked by the prosecutor had been deliberately generated by the latter \u2019s refusal to conduct an audit of the company or to question the witnesses cited by the applicant . He also challenged the allegation concerning the gravity of the offence imputed to him , pointing out that he was only being accused of attempting to commit an offence , not of committing it . He claimed that no actual loss had been caused to the company and that the court had failed to take into consideration the accused \u2019s individual circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , finding that it had been adopted in compliance with the law . The court also noted that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious offence punishable by imprisonment from CARDINAL to twenty - five years and that the investigation was still ongoing . The court held that if released the applicant might be able to abscond or to influence witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case applied again for a further DATE extension of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected on the basis that there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond or influence witnesses . He stressed that the prosecutor had not conducted any investigative measures for a long time and that the investigation was virtually completed . He reiterated that he had a permanent residence and that he had agreed to appear before the investigators whenever necessary . He presented a medical report dated DATE , according to which it was established inter alia that he had arterial hypertension and a slight paralysis of his right leg as a result of a stroke . The doctor recommended treatment in a neurological clinic . The applicant asked the court to dismiss the prosecutor \u2019s application and to apply a less severe measure such as conditional release or house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the prosecutor \u2019s application and accepted the applicant \u2019s request , ordering that he be placed under house arrest for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the applicant has been detained for DATE and has participated in all the necessary investigative actions ; ... LAW imposes a presumption that an accused be freed while he awaits his trial ; ... certain evidence , which may have been sufficient earlier to justify [ detention ] or to render alternative preventive measures inadequate , could become less convincing with the passage of time ; ... it is for the prosecutor to prove the existence of a risk of absconding , and such a risk can not be proved only by reference to the severity of the potential punishment ; [ the court referred to the applicant \u2019s medical problems and his age , the lack of a criminal record , his permanent residence and married status ] ; the [ ORG ] case - law provides that detention pending trial should be exceptional , always objectively reasoned and must correspond to the public interest ; the court finds that it is implausible that [ the applicant ] will abscond , influence witnesses or destroy evidence , and that the normal course of the criminal investigation is possible while the accused is under house arrest . \u201d", "The court set the following conditions for the applicant \u2019s house arrest : prohibition from leaving his house ; prohibition of using the telephone ; prohibition from discussing his case with any other person .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was immediately taken home , where he remained for DATE . However , the prosecutor lodged an appeal against the above - mentioned decision and invoked as one of the reasons for the applicant \u2019s continued detention in custody the fact that the applicant refused to confess to having committed the offence imputed to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and adopted a new one , ordering the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the lower court did not take into account the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the offence with which [ the applicant ] is charged ; the court considers that while under house arrest [ the applicant ] could communicate with the other accomplices , who are not under arrest and who are , moreover , his sons ; he could abscond by fleeing to the [ self - proclaimed and unrecognised \u201c GPE \u201d ] , which is not under the control of the GPE authorities ; he could influence witnesses , in order to make them change their statements ; the applicant has received visits from doctors and can obtain medical assistance in prison . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case applied again to the court for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . He relied on the same reasons as before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial by DATE . It argued again that the applicant was accused of a serious offence and that he could abscond or hinder the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , advancing essentially the same arguments as he had done earlier .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision and adopted a new one , changing the preventive measure to house arrest . The court found that :", "\u201c the prosecutor did not provide any evidence confirming the continued need to detain [ the applicant ] , did not submit additional materials confirming the probability that he could exert influence on witnesses who have already been heard ; [ the applicant ] promises to appear before the investigating authorities whenever summoned ; there is no specific information concerning any risk of absconding \u201d .", "The court also prohibited the applicant from communicating with persons who had any link with the criminal case against him and from leaving his house , and obliged him to phone the prosecutor \u2019s office DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the prosecutor \u2019s application to prolong the applicant \u2019s house arrest by DATE . The applicant did not object to the prolongation of the house arrest provided that the measures concerning the limitation on his communication with relatives were discontinued . The court upheld the prosecutor \u2019s request and ordered the prolongation of the house arrest for DATE . It also upheld the applicant \u2019s request and discontinued the limitation on his communication with his relatives . The only reason invoked by the court was the seriousness of the offence imputed to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again prolonged the applicant \u2019s house arrest for DATE . The only reason given by the court was the seriousness of the offence imputed to the applicant . The applicant did not object provided that he was allowed to visit the hospital and the court in order to study the case file .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request with ORG asking for the measure of house arrest to be changed for that of provisional release or release on bail . He argued that he had never breached the rules of the house arrest and that he undertook to further comply with all the instructions issued by the investigation organs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to release the applicant on bail , observing that he had been detained for DATE and had never breached any of the restrictions imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was acquitted of the charges for which he had been detained between CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The court found that no offence had taken place in regard to the facts imputed to him . At the same time he was acquitted of CARDINAL other charges brought against him and was found guilty on CARDINAL count , namely that of having illegally sold liquefied gas which had been seized by a bailiff , for which he was sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MONEY ) . Neither the applicant nor the prosecutor appealed against that judgment , which became final . The applicant \u2019s sons were acquitted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
