NORP The applicant company is based in GPE . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The applicant company publishes a nationwide newspaper called ORG and the second applicant is the editor - in - chief of that newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the National Conciliator ( valtakunnansovittelija , riksf\u00f6rlikningsmannen ) at the time , and B. , his female friend , entered late at night A. 's home where his wife was present . The situation escalated , the police were called and the incident , which subsequently involved also A. 's grown - up children , led to ORG 's arrest . Following this incident , criminal charges were brought against both PERSON and NORP on DATE . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) sentenced PERSON to a DATE conditional prison sentence for resisting arrest and for criminal damage ( vahingonteko , skadeg\u00f6relse ) , and PERSON to a fine for assault . On DATE ORG ( valtioneuvosto , statsr\u00e5det ) dismissed PERSON from his post as ORG . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the judgment with respect to B. As regards PERSON , the case was discontinued as he had died on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , one day after the ORG judgment , the ORG newspaper published an article about A. and PERSON with a title \u201c A. defends fiercely his post \u201d . The article focused mainly on ORG 's conviction but in the caption to B. 's picture , her name , conviction and the fact that she was A. 's female friend were mentioned . Prior to this article , the identity of PERSON had been revealed at least in a NORP magazine on DATE ( see PERSON and others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and PERSON requested that criminal investigations be conducted against journalists who had written about the incident on DATE and the circumstances surrounding it . On an unspecified date they made such a request with respect to the second applicant , claiming that the article published in ORG had invaded PERSON 's privacy . Investigations started in respect of the second applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges under chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW against the second applicant in ORG . PERSON concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor and pursued a compensation claim against both applicants , which was joined to the criminal charges . The applicant company was summoned on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , after having held an oral hearing on DATE , first decided to declare all parts of the case file secret for DATE except for the applicable legal provisions , the conclusions and the summary of the case . Additionally , the identity of PERSON was not to be revealed in the public parts of the case file . As to the merits of the case , the court sentenced the second applicant to pay DATE - fines , amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) , for invasion of PERSON 's private life . Moreover , the applicants were jointly ordered to pay B. EUR CARDINAL plus interest for non - pecuniary damage as well as her costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied . ORG had already found in DATE that the national television broadcast on DATE , in which ORG 's name had been mentioned twice in the context of an interview with A. , had invaded her private life . PERSON did not hold such a position in society that the exception in LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW was applicable . The fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to A. 's dismissal from his post as ORG did not justify revealing her identity . Nor was PERSON 's conviction of a kind that would have justified revealing her identity . The applicants , therefore , had had no right to reveal PERSON 's name or to publish her picture . As to the intent , ORG found that invasion of private life was punishable only if intent could be shown . As the second applicant had not prevented the invasion of PERSON 's private life , this omission fulfilled the intent criteria .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG , claiming , inter alia , that the provision of LAW in question did not define with sufficient clarity which acts fell within its scope , and that a disclosure of a convicted person 's name could not be considered as falling within the scope of private life . Moreover , the lack of evidence was used to the detriment of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , partly upheld the ORG judgment . The court balanced the right to freedom of expression against the protection of private life in the light of the ORG 's case - law . It found that , according to the preparatory works and the national and the ORG 's case - law , the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied . ORG had already found in DATE that PERSON was not a public figure , and the fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as ORG did not justify revealing her identity . However , since the convictions of A. and B. were closely linked in this case , PERSON 's name and conviction could lawfully have been mentioned . Nevertheless , the publishing of a big picture of PERSON was not necessary and therefore invaded her privacy . As to the intent , the omissions of the second applicant could not be regarded as proving his intent to invade PERSON 's privacy and , consequently , the charges against him were dismissed . He was also exonerated from paying B. non - pecuniary damages as well as her costs and expenses . The non - pecuniary damages payable by the applicant company were lowered to LAW . In total the applicant company paid ORG ORG as compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant company applied for leave to appeal to ORG , reiterating the grounds already presented before ORG . Moreover , it claimed that , in declaring that the case file was to remain secret , ORG had not given any reasons which would constitute sufficient grounds for the measure , that the length of the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time , and that the restrictions on freedom of expression were neither necessary nor justified in this case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant company leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic legislation and practice are outlined in the ORG 's judgment in PERSON and others v. GPE ( no .
