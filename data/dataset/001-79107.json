ORG found that , having regard to the fact that PERSON was staying since DATE , namely DATE , with his grandparents in GPE , had signed off residence and school in GPE and was attending school in GPE , this country had to be regarded as his habitual residence . Therefore , the case had ceased to be within the scope of NORP jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL .

It noted with reference to GPE 's reservation to LAW that custody proceedings would not necessarily require a public hearing , and that the parties ' right to present their case was duly complied with by submitting written statements , which the applicant had been able to do . The decision of ORG to annul the proceedings , resulting in a shift of jurisdiction from GPE to GPE , was lawful . LAW expressly referred to the actual exercise of custody as a condition for its application . The applicant 's submissions that she had been hindered in the actual exercise of her custody were not relevant as the DATE Hague Convention served the child 's and not the parents ' interest and the same applied as regards the DATE LAW . Under this aspect , an interference with the applicant 's rights under LAW was justified .
