De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment in divorce proceedings . It held that both parents of twins PERSON , born in DATE , were to retain parental rights over them , with their place of permanent residence being with their mother , the applicant . Having regard to the lack of cooperation between the parents , it restricted both of them in the exercise of their parental rights and decided that they should be supervised by a court - appointed guardian . The guardian was to report to the court once DATE on the exercise of the parties\u2019 parental rights and on the situation of the family . This judgment was later upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon a petition submitted by the children \u2019s father , changed the manner in which the parties\u2019 parental rights should be exercised .", "CARDINAL . The court established that DATE the children , who before had had a harmonious and spontaneous relationship with their father , had started to react negatively and even hysterically to his presence .", "CARDINAL . The court had regard to CARDINAL expert opinions . They had stated that the children and their mother as a family had been affected by PERSON syndrome ( Parental Alienation Syndrome ) , consisting in a strong emotional link with CARDINAL of the parents , in this case \u2013 the mother . This entailed the children \u2019s complete submission to her , and in their perceiving the father , as a result of the mother \u2019s hammering this into her daughters , as an enemy . This resulted in a total severance of all emotional links with him .", "CARDINAL . The court heard as witnesses a number of experts , CARDINAL of the children \u2019s teachers , a psychologist who had talked with the mother for the purposes of making a diagnosis of the situation and a number of other persons .", "CARDINAL . It refused to admit evidence from psychologist PERSON , proposed by the applicant , and refused also her request for additional expert opinions of another psychologist , paediatrician and psychiatrist . The court found that ample expert evidence was already available in the case file .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted the conclusion that the family was affected by PERSON ( ORG ) syndrome , caused mostly by the applicant \u2019s emotional pressure on the children in order to make them perceive their father in a negative light . There was no evidence to indicate that the children \u2019s father had committed any reprehensible acts and the children had not accused him of any . In particular , no incidents of domestic violence had been established . He was interested in the children \u2019s development , cooperated with the authorities and had been complying with the court \u2019s decisions on contact with the children and the court guardian \u2019s suggestions . The children were deeply disturbed . They were overly excitable and often aggressive , verbally denigrated their father and their paternal grandparents , referred to alleged episodes of illtreatment which had never been confirmed and of which they had received information from their mother , showed undue fear and reacted hysterically when spoken to about their father and when seeing him .", "CARDINAL . The court was of the view that the children \u2019s best interest dictated that they should be given appropriate treatment . The applicant was unable to draw a line between her own negative view of her former husband and the conduct which she should have adopted in the children \u2019s best interests . Her behaviour was dictated entirely by her own emotional relationship to her former husband , with no due regard to the need to show restraint for the sake of the children \u2019s development , wellbeing and psychological balance . The court noted that it was well aware of the necessity of keeping the measures to be applied within limits , having regard to the proportionality principle . It was of the view that the children should be placed in a children \u2019s home and temporarily change their environment . The applicant should be allowed to see her children in the home , supervised by psychologists , and ordered to undergo therapy suitable for persons affected by ORG . The same obligation had to be imposed on the children \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She requested that the decision be quashed in its part concerning the placement of her children in the institution . She submitted that the measures were not in the children \u2019s best interests . The court had failed to examine whether less invasive measures would also have achieved the aim sought .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG amended the contested decision . It deleted the description of an alleged disorder affecting the applicant and her daughters from the description of the facts of the case . It observed that the opinions of specialists had not given rise to any doubt that the children were indeed deeply disturbed and that their separation from the mother , together with therapy , would help them . It maintained the order to place the children in a children \u2019s home with a view to therapy and maintained the obligation for the parents to undergo therapy aimed at ameliorating their contacts , due regard being had to the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that already in the divorce judgment the court , having regard to the conflict between the former spouses , had imposed on the latter supervision measures intended to facilitate their contacts and to ensure respect for the children \u2019s best interests . As the parties had subsequently failed to co - operate and their relationship had steadily deteriorated to the point where they were unable to ensure compliance with the custody and access arrangements without acrimony , the decision of the lower court was justified and should be upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting ex officio , set aside the placement order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant and the children \u2019s father had a number of conversations with the assistance of specialists of ORG to the Family . The court was informed of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court decided again to place the children in a children \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted the applicant \u2019s request to stay the execution of that order . It appointed another expert with a view to determining the best possible therapy for the children . The court fixed CARDINAL dates for the applicant and the children for therapy sessions . The applicant failed to attend these sessions without providing any justification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant contested the appointment of the expert . The court dismissed her motion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court set the placement order aside and appointed a court guardian for the family . The court had regard to the children \u2019s health and found that the placement could have a negative effect on their health ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
