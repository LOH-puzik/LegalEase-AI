DATE and DATE B. was referred to his general practitioner for some CARDINAL complaints .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE B. was taken for examination to hospital on numerous occasions for complaints of diarrhoea and fever , and on each occasion he was found to be in a normal condition . When on DATE B. was admitted to hospital , a laboratory stools test indicated the presence of phenolphthalein ( a laxative ) . The doctor was satisfied that P. had been responsible for laxative poisoning and reported the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities took B. into protective custody , alleging that PERSON was harming her son , then aged CARDINAL , by administering laxatives to him inappropriately . He was suspected of being a victim of induced - illness abuse , the syndrome known variously as PERSON syndrome by proxy ( \u201c MSBP \u201d ) , fabricated or induced illness , illness - induction syndrome or paediatric falsified condition .

Rochdale ORG ( \u201c the local authority \u201d ) became aware of the pregnancy after P. had taken steps with a view to obtaining an annulment of her previous marriage and her ex - husband had informed the district attorney in GPE who in turn made contact with the authorities in GPE , giving information about P. 's conviction for harming her son PERSON The local authority was informed of the pregnancy by PERSON 's doctor and commenced an investigation .", "CARDINAL . Social workers were in contact with P. and C. from DATE . A letter was sent to arrange a meeting . Prior to the proposed meeting , there were several exchanges on the telephone . C. considered that the social services should provide more detailed information before a meeting took place and made a list of requirements regarding access to files and copies of documents . Tension arose when the social worker requested that PERSON give her date of birth in order to confirm that she was the person concerned in the information from GPE . P. initially refused to give this information . The proposed meeting was cancelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' solicitors wrote to the social services requesting that they provide information to both themselves and P. directly , concerning , inter alia , the reason for the proposed meeting , details of any information in their possession , forms for applying for access to social - work files , specific details of child protection concerns in the case and a list of every person with whom PERSON had been discussed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a meeting took place attended by P. and C. , social workers and the police .", "CARDINAL . There was further correspondence between the local authority and the applicants ' solicitors concerning the appointment of an expert to assess the risk to the unborn child , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the section CARDINAL assessment \u201d ) .

They pointed out that the person suggested by the applicants was not an expert in PERSON and requested details of the other proposed experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority made contact with Dr Eminson , a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who had been proposed by the applicants , with a view to her undertaking an assessment .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the local authority 's solicitor referred to a letter of CARDINAL DATE by the applicants ' solicitors . It was pointed out that , as there were no care proceedings in train , there was no obligation on the local authority to agree a letter of instruction for the expert with the applicants . At that stage , all that was required was P. 's agreement to see the expert . The view was expressed that it was for the local authority to decide what documents to submit to the expert , although they would have no objection to the applicants ' providing extra documentation . Although they wished to work in cooperation with P. , they could not allow her to dictate the course and conduct of the section CARDINAL assessment .", "CARDINAL .

's solicitor and the paternal grandmother of the unborn child . TIME of the meeting state that the reason for the conference was that P. had a conviction which led to concern that her child might be at risk of induced illness / injury after it was born . It was noted that P. disputed details of the background to her conviction , claiming , inter alia , that there was evidence of her son PERSON having had diarrhoea as she alleged . C. was noted as accepting that the existence of a conviction could give rise for concern but not that it automatically meant his wife suffered from PERSON , alleging that there was no direct evidence of any harm having been inflicted by her . Due to the concern that P. suffered from PERSON , it was decided to place the child on ORG at birth and to undertake a full risk assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr Eminson agreed to act as expert in the assessment to take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' solicitors wrote to the local authority , pointing out that their request for an agreed letter of instruction and the list of documents given to the expert was based on good practice and procedure and that , although there were no care proceedings , they had assumed the same principles would be applied . They stated that P. could not be expected to go into a meeting blind to the specific points the doctor had been asked to address and that they needed a list of documents in order to assess whether they wished to provide the expert with anything further .", "CARDINAL . By reply of the same date , the local authority 's solicitor stated that a section CARDINAL assessment procedure was at the entire discretion of the local authority and that different principles applied than in care proceedings . However , they were prepared to disclose the list of documents sent to Dr Eminson and set out the questions which they would ask her to address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in discussions between the applicants ' solicitors and the local authority , it was indicated that the applicants were no longer happy with PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority held a case conference to review the situation . It was found that the parents had not cooperated with the local authority assessment , or that their cooperation was superficial . A combination of excuses and evasiveness had made it impossible to hold CARDINAL meeting . There still appeared to be a complete denial about events in GPE . The local authority 's solicitor had spoken with the district attorney involved in the case in GPE and reported a number of allegations , including the concern that P. suffered from PERSON as shown by her own medical history , that C. had impersonated a therapist in trying to convince P. 's probation officer that she was complying with an order and that PERSON had harassed PERSON and the district attorney by telephone calls . It was noted that PERSON and C. were unwilling to see the expert proposed by the local authority . It was decided to take out an emergency protection order at the child 's birth as there was", "\u201c reason to believe that the baby would be at risk of significant harm if left in the care of his / her parents ; there has been no genuine cooperation from the parents and it would be impossible for ORG ... to manage the risk without legal jurisdiction which includes removal in the first instance . An application for interim care proceedings would require notice and [ there were ] reasons to believe that the parents would evade the authorities \u201d .", "The address of the foster placement was to be kept secret to avoid harassment or an attempt to remove the child . The parents were to be told about the intention to take legal action in general terms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' solicitors confirmed that P. and C. would see PERSON . They attended an appointment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote to the local authority , expressing grave concern and recommending the removal of the baby at birth and strict supervision of contact as there was a high level of risk of harm from P.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority was approached by C. 's mother , asking whether the child could be placed with her . The local authority decided to raise the matter with PERSON as part of her assessment .", "CARDINAL . Notes dated DATE of a discussion between the assistant director ( social services ) and PERSON included the doctor 's view that the basis upon which to work with the parents was extremely limited given the absence of acceptance / agreement about concerns over the unborn baby or the past history in GPE . She had found that the parents were not prepared to discuss the real issues with her , that C. was mainly interested in the battle with the authorities and that the couple showed little concern for or awareness of the key issue , that of the safety of the unborn baby . Although a definitive conclusion was difficult , the risk factors were not in her view sufficiently worrying to justify not telling the parents about the proposed application for an emergency protection order at birth . While the possibility of further assessment with the couple and newborn baby at a residential facility was not ruled out , this was not possible at that time due to the limited degree of cooperation and commitment of the parents .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it was becoming likely that , due to the lie of the baby , P. would have to have a Caesarean section instead of the planned delivery at home . The midwife reported that the consultant PERSON wanted PERSON to be admitted on DATE for an elective Caesarean , but that P. had refused and gone home . The midwife was noted in the social - work records as having become very angry with P. and C. for resisting medical advice and , later , for having claimed that they had been lucky to get a live baby .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , PERSON was born by Caesarean surgery . C. had brought PERSON to the hospital when her waters broke at home .", "CARDINAL . The local authority applied for an emergency protection order at TIME They contacted the hospital concerning the possibility of staff supervising the baby at the hospital . After discussions , it was confirmed to the local authority by the hospital management that , even with security measures , they could not guarantee the baby 's safety . The ORG stated that the hospital was concerned by the difficult behaviour of a friend of PERSON 's who demanded to be present during the operation and had to be threatened with removal by security guards , and the aggressive attitude of P. 's friends and family towards staff after the birth . The applicants have stated that there is no evidence for these allegations in the records . Notes in the hospital records indicated that at TIME Dr Maresh had stated that he would prefer the visit of the social workers to be deferred , as the news might upset PERSON and cause a rise in blood pressure .", "CARDINAL . At TIME it was decided to serve the emergency protection order on the applicants with a view to removing S. to foster care . According to the Government , C. 's mother refused to allow S. to be removed and C. 's father threatened to follow the social workers and the baby . Safe departure from the hospital was only achieved with the assistance of the hospital staff . The applicants stated that there was no evidence for this in the records , although they accepted that the family were very upset when PERSON was removed , and C. 's mother pleaded with the social workers not to let PERSON go to strangers .", "CARDINAL . A contact visit was arranged on CARDINAL DATE , attended by C. and his parents . While social services had considered taking S. back to the hospital for visits while PERSON was an inpatient , it was felt that it was not in the interests of S. as a newborn baby to be transported on a trip of CARDINAL to QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . P. remained in the delivery unit due to concerns about her blood pressure . It was noted by her consultant that she was very clearly distraught about events . She was prescribed drugs to suppress lactation and anti - hypertensive medication . She was discharged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The local authority meanwhile applied to the court for a care order under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . P. and C. were allowed supervised contact with PERSON , initially CARDINAL times a week . The first visit occurred on DATE . P. and C. applied for more access and were supported by the guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent S. Contact increased to CARDINAL times a week from DATE . S. also had contact with her maternal and paternal grandparents .", "CARDINAL . P. and C. developed an excellent relationship with their baby daughter PERSON The notes made by the supervising officials were positive and complimentary . The paternal grandparents were also observed to have a caring and attentive relationship with her .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the local authority suspended the assessment of the paternal grandparents which had commenced after their approach to the local authority on DATE . This was to await the directions of the court , as advised by their counsel . The grandparents were advised of this on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was transferred from the county court to ORG on grounds of complexity .", "CARDINAL . Dr Eminson issued her report on DATE , stating that in order to assess the risk to S. it would be necessary to obtain , inter alia , a psychiatric assessment of P. and her capacity to change and a comprehensive social work assessment of each family member , including the grandparents , as regards their capacity to care for and protect S.", "DATE . On DATE the timetable for the proceedings was set by a circuit judge and the hearing date fixed for DATE . It was directed that the assessment of the grandparents should be undertaken by an expert but that the local authority should provide the factual background .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated CARDINAL September CARDINAL , a social worker recorded the factual investigation into the paternal grandparents .", "CARDINAL . In his report dated DATE for the guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent S. , PERSON , a consultant paediatrician , found , inter alia , a clear and chronic pattern including unexplained symptoms suggesting that PERSON suffered from a severe illness ; a definitive episode of poisoning ; non - appearance of symptoms when the child was supervised by others and resolution of the health problems in the child after separation from the mother ; extensive inaccuracies and inconsistencies by PERSON when repeating her history to different doctors ; and exceptionally frequent medical attendance by mother and children . His opinion was that PERSON , and to lesser extent GPE , had been victims of child abuse on the fabricated illness spectrum . The tendency to fabricate appeared to be ongoing ( references were made to P. 's conduct during her pregnancy with S. : she had , for example , complained of ulcer symptoms but no ulcer was found , and she had referred to a stomach tumour which was presumably a besore [ A condition caused by the swallowing of hair and the biting of hair and nails ] removed in DATE ) . His view , strongly expressed , was that the risks to S. of rehabilitation with P. outweighed the advantages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the local authority informed P. and C. of their intention to apply for a freeing for adoption order under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr Maresh , ORG 's obstetrics consultant , gave a statement indicating that it was clear to him that PERSON was aware that there was a strong possibility that her baby would be taken away from her at birth and that this made it difficult for her to stay at the hospital . He noted that during her pregnancy the number of assessments that PERSON was undergoing had sometimes interfered with the making of ante - natal appointments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON issued his psychiatric report .", "( i ) It was noted that , during his meetings with P. , she had been superficially cooperative . She had considered that the test which found a laxative in PERSON 's stools could have been a false positive . She accepted that PERSON had been hospitalised too often and that she had allowed emotional harm to come to him . Her explanation was that she had been a victim of the divorce process and suffered considerable financial stress . The only statement by P. in which she appeared to take responsibility for exaggerating PERSON 's illness was when she said that she had exaggerated the number of loose stools that he had had . There was a sense of evasiveness and minimisation , even a degree of trivialisation of what was discussed . It was difficult to tell whether some events referred to by P. were a constructed reality or had really happened .", "( ii ) As regards C. , his research attempted to show that health practitioners sometimes developed a perspective where they created the notion that the parent was inducing illness in a child , thus demonstrating the misuse and fallibility of medical authority . C. had stated that there was nothing to suggest that P. would harm S. He was prepared to look after S. alone if necessary . Together , P. and C. had stated that they would undertake any therapeutic work with a view to obtaining care of S. without , however , acknowledging that there was a problem as far as P. was concerned .", "( iii ) As regards the paternal grandparents , they tended to agree with the parents ' analysis of the situation and found it hard to face up to the fact that P. 's actions had given rise to major concerns about her potential to harm . There were positive factors in their favour ( such as their commitment and desire to protect S. ) . However , the main problem if S. were placed with them would be their age when PERSON reached her adolescent phase of development .", "( iv ) The report found that P. had a personality disorder , including a factitious disorder , as disclosed by her gross exaggeration of having had ovarian cancer and statements about miscarriages as well as the fabrication and exaggeration of B. 's symptoms . While P. had indicated a willingness to accept therapeutic work , which would have to be prolonged and required considerable motivation to change , she had not accepted how extensive such change needed to be . As regarded a possible referral to ORG , it was noted that this would require considerable commitment on the part of both parents . Although the couple had indicated a willingness to enter such a therapeutic setting , PERSON 's level of motivation was limited . It might , however , be advantageous for P. to be admitted to a special clinic for a further detailed assessment of whether a referral to ORG would be appropriate .", "( v ) The report concluded that C. was not himself a direct risk to S. but was so indirectly . He embraced his wife 's views and had a limited understanding of the local authority 's concerns . Similarly , the grandparents would be protective of S. if she were placed in their care but , as they would be in DATE when PERSON was DATE , they would have increasing difficulties in meeting her growing emotional needs . It was therefore difficult to consider them as possible long- or short - term carers because PERSON needed to be in a secure long - term placement by her first birthday . As regards contact , the fact that the fabrication of symptoms was not life - threatening meant that contact would need less rigorous supervision than in the case of more life - threatening abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority made an application to free S. for adoption .", "CARDINAL . NORP The local authority care plan dated DATE stated that placement of S. with both parents would pose a serious risk to her . As the circumstances in which C. intended to offer to care for S. on his own were unclear , the concerns about her protection remained . Regarding the paternal grandparents , it was noted that they had not shared the concerns in respect of the risk to S. if she were placed with her parents , and that PERSON did not support placement with them , particularly because of their age . The local authority 's view was that the care plan for PERSON should be permanent , secured by adoption , and that she needed to be placed with an adoptive family as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing , which began on DATE and ended on DATE , the High Court heard the local authority 's application for a care order in respect of S. The local authority informed the judge that there were CARDINAL families available and wanting to adopt PERSON and C. were parties , as were PERSON paternal grandparents , while PERSON was represented by a professional guardian ad litem , solicitors and both senior and junior counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE C. applied for leave to withdraw from the proceedings , on the ground that he saw no prospect of success in obtaining custody of S. and that the stress of the proceedings was likely to lead to a breakdown in his health . On DATE the judge granted him leave to withdraw . C. 's parents also withdrew from the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE legal representatives ( leading counsel and solicitors ) withdrew from the case , informing the judge that her legal aid had been withdrawn . It was later stated by the judge that they had withdrawn because PERSON was asking them to conduct the case unreasonably . In fact , her legal aid had not withdrawn , as the judge made clear in his judgment . The legal - aid certificate could not be formally discharged until PERSON had been given the opportunity to show why that should not happen .", "CARDINAL . P. asked for an adjournment until DATE , which was granted . On that date PERSON asked for a further adjournment in order to apply for the reinstatement of her legal - aid certificate .", "CARDINAL . The judge refused the adjournment . As a result of this decision , PERSON conducted her own case , assisted by a \u201c PERSON friend \u201d , PERSON The applicant stated that she found conducting her own case immensely difficult . At CARDINAL stage , she told the judge that she simply could not continue because she was so distressed . That was after cross - examining her own husband PERSON , which she found very painful . However , the judge said that she should carry on . The solicitor for the guardian ad litem and a social worker visited P. that evening to persuade her to carry on .", "CARDINAL . In his judgment , the judge explained his refusal of an adjournment :", "\u201c In the first place I was satisfied that the mother had a very clear grasp of the voluminous documentation , at least as good and if not better a grasp than the lawyers in the case . Secondly , it was clear to me from the documents that the mother , who is an intelligent woman , was fully able to put her case in a clear and coherent way , an assessment that has been amply borne out by the hearing itself .", "Thirdly , I was confident that the Bar , in the form of leading and junior counsel for the local authority and the guardian ad litem , would not only treat the mother fairly but in the tradition of the Bar would assist her in the presentation of any points she wished to advance , in so far as it would be professionally proper for them to do so . Once again that assessment has been fully justified by the conduct of counsel during the hearing . As examples , the local authority both facilitated and paid for the attendance of Dr PERSON , consultant toxicologist , to attend as part of the mother 's case . Junior counsel for the local authority ... struggled manfully to ensure that the mother had a complete set of the ever growing documentation . There were other examples .", "Fourthly , the outcome of the case seemed to me to hinge or be likely to hinge substantially on the mother 's cross - examination , an area of the case in which the ability of lawyers to protect her was limited .", "Finally , and most importantly , I was concerned about the prejudice to [ S. ] of what would have had to have been a very lengthy adjournment . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW expresses the general principle that delay in resolving a child 's future is prejudicial to that child 's welfare . In this particular case intensive preparation for the hearing had been going on effectively since [ S. 's ] birth in DATE and up until the outset of the hearing before me the mother had had the benefit of advice from her lawyers , latterly of course from leading counsel . An adjournment would have involved a very substantial delay in resolving [ S. 's ] future .", "The hearing was estimated to last , and did indeed , last something in the order of DATE . A fresh legal team , assuming legal aid was restored , would have needed a substantial amount of time to master the voluminous documentation and to take instructions . DATE of court time simply can not be conjured out of thin air .", "Furthermore the evidence of Dr ... Bentovim , the consultant child psychiatrist jointly instructed to advise me , amongst other things , on [ S. 's ] placement , was that a decision on her long - term future needed to be both made and if possible implemented before her first birthday .", "The consequence of the events I have described was that the mother has been obliged to conduct her case in person with the assistance of a PERSON friend , PERSON . In their closing submissions Mr PERSON and Miss PERSON for the guardian ad litem paid tribute to the manner in which the mother had conducted her case . They described her as fighting bravely , resourcefully and skilfully for the return of her daughter . I would like to echo that tribute . I would also like to express my gratitude to the mother 's PERSON friend ... who was clearly a considerable support to the mother throughout the case .", "If the mother had been represented by counsel her case would , I think , have been conducted differently , but I am entirely satisfied that the result would have been the same . As so often happens the mother was given a latitude which would not be given to a litigant who was legally represented . For example , I allowed her to call a witness , Professor PERSON , who had not provided a statement prior to the hearing . I was also prepared for her to call a consultant psychologist who had given evidence in the NORP proceedings , Dr [ P. ] , who in the event was unable to attend . I also allowed the mother to cross - examine witnesses twice ... I have throughout the hearing endeavoured to ensure that the mother was treated fairly . ....", "I am the first to acknowledge that the courtroom is not a friendly environment and ... that those who are not used to it find it difficult . However much experience the mother may have had of the legal system in GPE , I accept ... that she is not a lawyer . Further , the hearing has had in [ S. 's ] interests to delve into matters which were highly distressing to the parents and which are normally intensely private and would have remained private .", "It is my judgment that the mother 's case has been fully heard and that the hearing has been fair ... I reject any suggestion that had the mother been legally represented the result would have been different . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge made a care order . In reaching his decision , he did not consider himself bound by the NORP conviction and reached his own findings of fact on the available material , which included a substantial volume of documents from GPE and expert reports . He concluded beyond reasonable doubt that PERSON 's diarrhoea had been caused by laxative abuse on the part of P. on CARDINAL occasion and , on a balance of probabilities , that abuse was the most likely cause of PERSON 's diarrhoea on CARDINAL further occasions . He went on :", "\u201c I am therefore in no doubt and so find that [ B. ] did suffer harm in the care of his mother . In my judgment that harm was not limited to his physical health . I accept the argument of the local authority that he also suffered serious psychological harm . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . While the judge accepted that P. had not put S. at risk during her pregnancy and that the parents ' treatment of S. during contact sessions had been exemplary , he found that P. suffered from a personality disorder , and that such people were very difficult to treat and did not change easily . He considered that PERSON was in a state of deep denial about what had happened to her son PERSON and the potential risk that she posed to her daughter PERSON He referred to the expert evidence \u201c that to receive help P. would need to accept that she remains a potentially dangerous person to PERSON and \u201c that is impossible even to start where the mother is in denial to the extent that this mother plainly is \u201d . He noted that PERSON had found a small acknowledgment about her role in PERSON 's illness , but that PERSON had challenged the accuracy of his report on this point and embarked on a high - risk strategy of launching an outright attack on the NORP evidence .", "\u201c At the end of a very careful and thorough cross - examination by the guardian ad litem , PERSON agreed ... that given the depth and longevity of the mother 's state of denial , and given that the father had embraced it fully , the time scale for any therapeutic work with the mother designed to bring her to a state of understanding of and ability to address the risk posed to PERSON was way outside the time scale during which PERSON could be kept waiting for a permanent placement . PERSON conclusion , reached I think with some regret , was that in the circumstances there could be no question of reunification of S. with her mother . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge found that C. was incapable of altering his emotional perception of P. or of accepting that she was responsible for harming her son PERSON , although with a different woman as a partner he would have been able to bring up and care for a child . The direction of the case could have been altered if PERSON had acknowledged that there was a serious risk to be guarded against . C. was dominated by the mother and unable to put PERSON 's interests and the need to protect her first . The judge concluded that PERSON 's moral or physical health would be endangered by leaving her with her parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same ORG judge heard the application to free LOC for adoption . The transcript of his previous judgment was not yet available . The final order of CARDINAL DATE listed PERSON C. and S. as respondents . According to the applicants , PERSON was present throughout and was specifically asked in court if he consented to a freeing for adoption order being made , and C. indicated that he was not .", "CARDINAL . At the commencement of the hearing , P. informed the court that without legal representation she was significantly disadvantaged and was being deprived of a proper opportunity to advance her case . Both P. and C. had valid legal - aid certificates . The judge declined to defer the proceedings , finding that PERSON was capable of representing her interests and that she would have been put on notice by her lawyers at an earlier stage that the freeing for adoption application would follow the care order . Although he noted that there might appear to be \u201c an element of railroading \u201d , on balancing the parents ' interests against the need for PERSON to have her future decided at the earliest possible opportunity , he considered that PERSON 's interests prevailed . On the issue of the freeing for adoption application , the judge concluded that the parents were withholding their consent to adoption unreasonably as they should have accepted , in the light of the previous proceedings , that there was no realistic prospect of the rehabilitation of S. to their care . He therefore issued an order freeing PERSON for adoption . That permanently severed legal ties between PERSON and her parents . As regards contact , he stated :", "\u201c I 'm assured by [ the local authority ] that there will be conventional letter - box contact . But it will in due course ( if an adoption order is made ) be essentially a matter for the adoptive parents as to precisely what contact [ S. ] has with her natural family . \u201d", "DATE . The judge refused PERSON leave to appeal against the order . Her renewed application before ORG was refused after a hearing on DATE , where she and C. appeared in person . Although ORG noted that C. was not a party to the appeal , it referred to the fact that C. had addressed the court at some length on the issues . It noted that that the trial was of exceptional complexity , with enormous documentation , much expert evidence and lasting DATE . It found , however , that the judge had carefully and thoroughly weighed all the issues of fact and that he had been meticulous throughout in ensuring fairness . No error of law or any failure of procedural fairness had been demonstrated .", "CARDINAL . The last contact visit by P. and C. with PERSON was on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. was placed for adoption with a family . On DATE the local authority informed P. and C. that S. had been placed with adopters .", "CARDINAL . S. was adopted by an order made on DATE . P. and C. were informed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The adoption order made no provision for future direct contact between PERSON and her parents . Any such contact was now at the discretion of the adoptive parents .
