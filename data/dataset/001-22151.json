SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national . She was born in DATE and lives in GPE , PERSON ( GPE ) . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON , of the GPE and ORG respectively .", "On DATE Mr PERSON ( \u201c Mr NORP \u201d ) , who had been tetraplegic since DATE following an accident on DATE , died a voluntary and painless death after having sought recognition from the NORP courts since DATE of his right not to have the ORG interfere with his decision to end his life in that way .", "Those proceedings , which he had instituted in the GPE civil courts , ended with a decision of ORG of DATE dismissing his amparo appeal on the ground that the remedies in the ordinary courts had not been properly used because the applicant had failed to bring his case in the courts with territorial jurisdiction . That decision was examined by the ORG , which declared the application ( no . CARDINAL ) inadmissible on CARDINAL DATE for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies .", "The applicant , PERSON sister - in - law , is the heir legally appointed by him to continue the proceedings which he had instituted while he was alive .", "On DATE Mr PERSON brought an action ( jurisdicci\u00f3n voluntaria ) in ORG ) requesting :", "\u201c ... that my general practitioner be authorised to prescribe me the medication necessary to relieve me of the pain , anxiety and distress caused by my condition without that act being considered under the criminal law to be assisting suicide or to be an offence of any kind ; I fully accept the risk that such medication might entail and hope thus to be able , at the appropriate time , to die in dignity . \u201d", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG Instance refused PERSON request , holding that LAW did not allow a court to authorise a third party to help a person to die or to bring about that person \u2019s death .", "Mr PERSON appealed . In a decision ( auto ) of DATE , the Corunna Audiencia provincial upheld the judgment on the basis of LAW and ORG interpretation of that LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice , below ) , LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , LAW , and LAW .", "Mr PERSON then lodged an amparo appeal with ORG on the basis of the rights to human dignity and the free development of the personality , to life and to physical and psychological integrity , and to a fair trial ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW ) . The appeal was registered on DATE . On DATE Mr Sampedro was given DATE in which to submit his final observations .", "In TIME of CARDINAL DATE Mr GPE died , assisted by CARDINAL or more anonymous persons . Criminal proceedings were instituted against a person or persons unknown for aiding and abetting suicide .", "After Mr Sampedro \u2019s death , the applicant informed ORG on DATE that she intended to continue the proceedings instituted by PERSON in her capacity as his heir .", "On DATE the applicant reworded as follows the grounds of appeal submitted by PERSON in support of his amparo appeal in order to adapt them to the new situation arising as a result of his death : \u201c [ that ] the Audiencia [ provincial ] should have acknowledged [ Mr Sampedro \u2019s ] right for his general practitioner to be authorised to administer him the medication necessary ... \u201d .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings and refused the applicant the right , in her capacity as Mr ORG heir , to continue the proceedings brought by him . It did not rule , however , on the applicant \u2019s allegation regarding the excessive length of the proceedings in ORG , which had still been pending at the time of Mr PERSON \u2019s death . The following is an extract from the court \u2019s judgment :", "\u201c It must be acknowledged that our legal system allows continuity in the exercise of actions for the recognition and protection of certain personal rights by heirs and other persons after the death of the person bringing the action . Such is the case for actions concerning civil status , such as establishing descent ... and those concerning civil protection of the right to honour , personal and family privacy and personal image ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Institutional Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) . Those substantive legal conditions do not suffice , however , to justify PERSON request to continue the proceedings merely on the basis of the declaration contained in LAW of LAW ... .", "There are CARDINAL aspects to the right granted under that provision to continue legal proceedings : ( a ) it concerns legal rights and relations that are not exhausted in themselves but are projected onto the family group , extending beyond the holder of the right to other persons affected by the court decision recognising or remedying the right infringed , and , essentially , ( b ) ... not successors to legal proceedings under succession law , but successors ope legis , in so far as expressly provided for by law .", "That said , in the case of the right to die in dignity by euthanasia without the intervention by a third party constituting a criminal offence , which was the right in respect of which Mr ORG lodged his amparo appeal , the above conditions are not met . There is no explicit legal provision to that effect ( LAW being limited to indicating the time at which succession takes effect ) and the case does not concern rights such as a personal honour , reputation , image or privacy , the effects of which are not confined to the holder of the right but extend to his family circle or relatives . On the contrary , it is here a request of a \u201c strictly personal \u201d nature and inextricably linked to the person exercising it as \u201c an act of will concerning that person alone \u201d ( Constitutional Court Judgment ( \u201c CCJ \u201d ) DATE seventh ground , and CCJ CARDINAL/CARDINAL , fifth ground ) .", "...", "In the light of the foregoing , the request to continue the proceedings must be rejected . The applicant \u2019s claim lapsed from the moment at which Mr PERSON , the appellant , died and his heir , PERSON , can not continue to rely on it in the constitutional proceedings . Our conclusion is further supported by the nature of an amparo appeal in constitutional proceedings , which has been established for the purpose of challenging actual and effective breaches of fundamental rights . As stated in the ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , an amparo appeal \u201c is not a proper remedy for requesting and obtaining an abstract and generic decision determining declarative claims which concern allegedly erroneous interpretations or incorrect applications of constitutional provisions , but only and exclusively those claims which are intended to re - establish or protect fundamental rights in the event of an actual and effective breach \u201d ( second ground ) . \u201d", "\u201c Heirs shall inherit all the rights and obligations of the deceased by the fact of his death alone . \u201d", "\u201c Anyone who helps or encourages another to commit suicide shall be liable to a prison sentence [ of DATE ] ; if he assists to such an extent that he causes the death , he shall be liable to a prison sentence of DATE . \u201d", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . Anyone who performs an act necessary to assist another to commit suicide shall be liable to a prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL . If that assistance causes the death , the person providing it shall be liable to a prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who , at the express , genuine and unequivocal request of a person suffering from a serious terminal illness or CARDINAL causing him serious permanent and intolerable suffering , causes that person \u2019s death or actively performs an act necessary to assist him to die shall be liable to a sentence in the first or second category below the one provided for in DATE and QUANTITY of this Article \u201d .", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where the holder of the infringed right dies without having been able to bring , either himself or through his legal representative , an action under this LAW , on account of the circumstances in which the infringement occurred , the action may be brought by the persons referred to in section CARDINAL [ the person designated in the will or , failing that , the spouse , descendants , ascendants and brothers ... ]", "CARDINAL . Those persons may continue an action previously instituted by the holder of the infringed right when he dies . \u201d", "\u201c ... The right to life is , accordingly , an inherently positive and protective one which can not therefore be considered as a right of freedom encompassing the right to die . It is not , however , inconsistent with that principle to acknowledge that , in so far as life is a personal asset forming an integral part of a person \u2019s freedom , an individual can dispose of his own life . However , such an example of \u201c licence to act \u201d ( agere licere ) , in the sense of taking one \u2019s own life or accepting one \u2019s own death , is an act permissible by law but not in any way a subjective right allowing an individual to solicit support from the public authorities to overcome resistance to his desire to die ; still less is it a fundamental subjective right in respect of which that possibility would extend over and above even legislative resistance , which can not reduce the essential content of a fundamental subjective right .", "Accordingly , LAW , as in force , can not be construed to guarantee the individual a right to his own death ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
