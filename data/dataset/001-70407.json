The marriage was celebrated and registered at ORG ( Standesamt Bonn II ) in GPE , which delivered a marriage certificate ( PERSON ) to the couple the same day .

She made an express request for her new surname to be retranscribed correctly , without any amendment .", "On DATE the Nationality and Migration Service issued the applicant with a new NORP passport . However , on page CARDINAL , the main page containing all the passport holder \u2019s basic details , her surname appeared as \u201c Mencena \u201d , not \u201c GPE . Officials at ORG explained to the applicant that the changes in the written form of her surname had been made on the basis of Regulation no . CARDINAL on the transcription and identification of forenames and surnames in documents , which required all surnames and forenames to be reproduced \u201c in accordance with the spelling rules of the NORP literary language \u201d and \u201c as near as possible to their pronunciation in their original language \u201d . Consequently , the affricative consonant \u201c tz \u201d was replaced by the letter \u201c c \u201d , which is pronounced [ ts ] in NORP and therefore has the same phonetic value . Likewise , the inflectional ending \u201c -a \u201d was added to the applicant \u2019s surname , denoting the feminine nominative singular . However , in the section entitled \u201c Special remarks \u201d ( \u201c PERSON atz\u012bmes \u201d ) on page CARDINAL of the passport , ORG affixed a special stamp certifying that the original form ( ori\u0123in\u0101lforma ) of the surname was \u201c GPE \u201d .", "After trying in vain to persuade the officials at ORG who had issued her with the passport to rectify the written form of her surname , the applicant lodged an internal appeal with the departmental head . She argued among other things that the phonetic transcription and grammatical adaptation of her surname had violated her right to respect for her family life , as guaranteed by LAW . On an unspecified date , the departmental head dismissed her appeal on the grounds that page CARDINAL of the passport provided the original version of the surname \u201c GPE in any event and that there had therefore been no alteration to the surname .", "The applicant issued proceedings against ORG in ORG of GPE , which dismissed her claim in a judgment of DATE .

It also pointed out that persons finding themselves in that situation could always have the original form of their surname entered in the section of the passport entitled \u201c Special remarks \u201d if they so wished .", "The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG , arguing , inter alia , that ORG had misconstrued the domestic legislation . In her appeal , the applicant criticised the very principle of \u201c LOC \u201d of the written form of foreign surnames and forenames . In her submission , the CARDINAL sets of regulations cited in the impugned judgment violated the right to respect for private life guaranteed by LAW . The applicant also pointed out that neither LAW nor the relevant regulations required any grammatical or spelling changes to foreign trademarks or commercial undertakings . That being so , it was questionable whether such a practice with regard to names was either necessary or proportionate . Lastly , the applicant said that , owing to the change in the written form of her surname , she and her husband now had CARDINAL different surnames in their identity papers , which made their identification as members of the same family more difficult .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . After noting that ORG had fully complied with the applicable law and regulations , it accepted that the situation complained of could be regarded as interference with the right guaranteed by LAW . However , it considered that the interference , which was intended to protect the NORP language , was consistent with the second paragraph of that provision . With regard to the applicant \u2019s submission that different rules applied to trademarks and company names , ORG considered that it had no bearing on the case before it , since people \u2019s names fell into a completely different category and were governed by special rules .", "The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG of ORG , arguing , inter alia , that the protection of the NORP language could not be a legitimate aim for which restrictions were permitted by LAW . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed her appeal , holding that , since the original form of the surname \u201c PERSON \u201d appeared on page CARDINAL of her passport , there had been no violation of her right to respect for her private life .", "After amendments to LAW ( PERSON tiesa ) had come into force , the applicant lodged an appeal ( konstitucion\u0101l\u0101 s\u016bdz\u012bba ) with that court seeking a declaration that section CARDINAL of LAW no . CARDINAL on the transcription and identification of forenames and surnames were unconstitutional .

ORG accepts the applicant \u2019s argument that the \u2018 Latvianisation\u2019 [ latvisko\u0161ana ] of her surname affected her emotionally . The fact that her surname is not spelt in the same way as her husband \u2019s is a source of unpleasantness and social inconvenience . It makes DATE life more complicated , as she has to give additional explanations on her relationship with her partner . While the misunderstandings are eventually cleared up , it all takes time .", "... CARDINAL of the main functions ... of the forename and surname is to make it possible to identify people and to determine the relationship of the person concerned with his or her family .", "In view of the applicant \u2019s psychological attitude to the transcribed surname and the complications it entails in DATE life which , especially abroad , can be seen in the difficulty which others have in determining her relationship with her family , and since the stability of the surname affects not only the individual \u2019s private life but also the interests of society , the provision requiring foreign surnames in passports issued in GPE to be transcribed in accordance with the traditions of the NORP language and its linguistic rules must be considered to constitute interference in private life .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) ... [ The ] interference in the applicant \u2019s private life is in accordance with the law , as it has been provided for by regulations issued by the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The applicant \u2019s argument that the NORP transcription of her surname does not pursue any of the aforementioned legitimate aims is without basis . Names are one of the features of language and the issue of the rules applicable thereto affects the entire system of language . It can be seen from the case file that the applicant in fact criticises the very principle of transcribing foreign surnames , which is a characteristic of the NORP language . Consequently , in order to determine whether the interference ... pursues a legitimate aim , it is necessary to examine the role of the NORP language in GPE .", "By declaring that the official language of GPE is NORP , LAW it constitutional status . The constitutional status of the official language reinforces the legal basis for the use of NORP in documents issued by GPE . Regard being had to the fact that a NORP citizen \u2019s passport is an official document that not only identifies the person concerned , but also attests to a permanent legal link between the individual and the ORG , that person \u2019s surname and forename must be written in the official language .", "... ORG agrees with the opinion of the expert ... that the surname is used not just by the person so named , but also by society . Consequently , surnames must be regulated ... for the convenience of members of society .", "Owing to historical factors , in particular the fact that the proportion of NORP [ of origin ] on the national territory has diminished during the course of DATE , the NORP nation represents only a minority in some large towns , including GPE ... , and the NORP language has only recently recovered its status as the official language . The need to protect the official language and to consolidate its use is , therefore , closely linked to the democratic regime of ORG .", "Regard being had to the fact that , ... in the context of globalisation , GPE is the only place in the world where the existence and development of the NORP language and , by the same token , the NORP nation , can be guaranteed , a restriction or limitation on the use of [ this ] language ... on the national territory constitutes a threat to the democratic regime of the ORG .", "[ In a recent judgment , ] ORG also came to the conclusion that the official language helps to preserve national identity , unites the nation , and serves to express national sovereignty and the indivisibility of the ORG ...", "That being so , the purpose of the interference in the applicant \u2019s private life was to protect the right of other residents of GPE to use the NORP language freely throughout the national territory and to protect the democratic regime of the ORG . Accordingly , the interference ... pursued legitimate aims .", "( CARDINAL ) ... [ It ] is necessary to examine whether the interference [ in issue ] was proportionate to the legitimate aims [ it pursued ] .", "( CARDINAL ) ... ORG has no doubt that the written form of names in documents has a direct bearing on the other spheres in which the language is used , as they are closely connected . If the written form of foreign names in documents were only permitted in their original form , it would be coherent and logical for their use [ in this form ] to spread progressively , because names are used in different texts . It is impossible to isolate the written form of foreign names in identity papers from [ their written form in other types of document ] . That would seriously threaten the quality of the NORP language and , therefore , the function of [ this ] language in society ...", "The evidence in the case file shows that the [ impugned ] interference has not prevented the applicant ... from exercising other rights she possesses , such as to cross her and other States\u2019 borders , to vote in elections and to receive mail . The inconvenience an individual might suffer in his or her DATE life does not constitute a sufficient ground for not applying rules that are the consequence of the language \u2019s official status .", "ORG considers that the damage to the functioning of the NORP language as a single system that would result from writing foreign names in their original form only would outweigh the inconvenience individuals might suffer as a result of using a passport issued in a surname transcribed in accordance with the traditions of the NORP language .", "In these circumstances , the functioning of the NORP language as a single system ... constitutes a social necessity , not a whim of the ORG authorities .", "In some cases , transcription of the surname may make it more difficult to identify a person or to determine his or her relationship with his or her family ( partner ) . However , the interests in protecting NORP as the official language and , therefore , in protecting the democratic ORG system , justify [ this interference ] .", "( CARDINAL ) The applicant \u2019s allegation that the surname that she acquired by marriage has been transformed is unfounded . The transcription [ atveide ] of a name does not constitute its translation into NORP ( it is not the ORG of the noun [ as such ] ) , but its adaptation to the grammatical particularities of the NORP language .", "There are a large number of systems of writing in the world , which are widely used , and the differences between them make it objectively impossible when passing from CARDINAL system to another to preserve the original form . Due to the difference between alphabets , absolute conformity to the original is impossible even between languages using NORP characters . In NORP , since the beginnings of written language , the settled practice has been to transcribe foreign names according to their pronunciation in the original language , not their written form . Regulation no . CARDINAL translates this principle governing the written form of foreign names , which is a characteristic of the NORP language , into a legal rule ...", "Both the [ Official ] LAW no . CARDINAL refer to rules of literary language . ... [ At ] the base of NORP grammar are declensions . The word endings indicate the gender and number of ordinary and proper nouns and the function of the word in the sentence . The declinable word - ending of a name indicates the gender of the bearer of the name . In many NORP languages ( such as LANGUAGE , NORP and NORP ) , either names have no grammatical gender or no distinction is made in the form of male and female surnames . Consequently , in these languages , foreign names can be incorporated into a sentence in their original form without destroying the grammatical system of the language . However , in NORP , a foreign surname can not be included in a sentence ... unless it is written in the way it is pronounced and has an ending . Consequently , the traditions governing the written form of foreign names are based on the grammatical particularities of the NORP language .", "ORG can not therefore accept the applicant \u2019s submission that the damage to her rights is greater than the benefit to the ORG . With a limitation of this sort on the private life of the individual , the ORG enhances the stability of the NORP language system . Compliance with the codified traditional rules ... in all spheres of use and writing of names , including documents , plays an integral role in the concrete historical circumstances of the ORG in establishing the status of the official language . ...", "( CARDINAL ) In order to reduce the inconvenience caused by the transcription of a person \u2019s name as far as possible , the [ Official ] LAW provides : \u2018 [ When ] the person concerned ... so wishes and is able to produce documentary evidence [ of it ] , the original form of the foreign surname shall be indicated in the passport , in addition to his or her forename and surname as transcribed ... \u2019", "The meaning of the expression \u2018 in addition to\u2019 [ papildus ] has been defined by the ORG in its Regulation no .

However , it declared the regulation requiring the original form of the surname to be indicated on page CARDINAL of the passport and not in a more visible location nearer the front to be unconstitutional , having regard to the fact that the main page of the passport was page CARDINAL .

However , it should be remembered that the strictness of this rule , which is especially important where particles , declined names and forenames are concerned , is tempered , in appropriate cases , by the provisions of the second , third and fourth paragraphs of LAW .", "...", "Article CARDINAL", "...", "Of the various systems of transposition , the LAW chooses transliteration : each letter , with any diacritic marks , is reproduced by its equivalent in the other language .", "...", "Where there are no standards recommended by ORG , the transposition must , as far as possible , still be achieved by transliteration .", "Thus , there are at present no standards for the transliteration of NORP characters into NORP characters . Transliteration does however seem possible in many cases , especially with the help of the transliteration rules contained in ORG RCARDINAL ( international system for the transliteration of NORP characters into NORP characters ) .", "On the other hand , it seems clear that in the total absence of standards it is not possible to transliterate LANGUAGE , LANGUAGE or LANGUAGE characters into NORP characters , or NORP characters into NORP or LANGUAGE characters . In these circumstances reproduction can be achieved , in the cases envisaged , by another process such as phonetic transposition . However , even in that event , translation is still forbidden . The surname and forenames must be reproduced by transliteration from the records and documents produced with a view to the making of the further record . \u201d", "At its meeting in GPE on DATE , ORG adopted the following resolution :", "\u201c ORG ... is of the opinion that the phrase \u2018 or some other document that shows the surnames and PERSON , contained in the first paragraph of LAW , covers any public document even if it does not emanate from a civil registrar , such as a passport of the person concerned . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( ECJ ) delivered a judgment in PERSON v. PERSON , GPE , and PERSON , PERSON ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG Reports DATE , p. I-CARDINAL ) . In this case , which concerned a referral by ORG ( ORG ) for a preliminary ruling , the ECJ had to consider the question of the compatibility of the transliteration of a NORP name with freedom of establishment , as guaranteed by former Article CARDINAL of the LAW establishing ORG ( which became LAW when LAW came into force ) . In that case , the name of the applicant in the main proceedings , Mr PERSON ( ORG ) , a NORP national who worked as a masseur in GPE , was transcribed in a translation of his birth certificate and in the register of marriages as \u201c PERSON \u201d . This was the written form that resulted from the application of ORG CARDINAL , as prescribed by LAW no . CARDINAL ( see above ) . The ECJ ruled as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he national court \u2019s CARDINAL questions are to be regarded as seeking to ascertain , in substance , whether LAW is to be interpreted as meaning that it is contrary to that provision for the name of a NORP national who has settled in another Member ORG in order to pursue an occupation as a self - employed person to be entered in the registers of civil status of that ORG in a spelling differing from the phonetic transcription , whereby its pronunciation is modified and distorted .", "CARDINAL . NORP In answering that question , it must first be borne in mind that , as the ORG has stated on numerous occasions , LAW constitutes one of the fundamental legal provisions of the Community . By prohibiting any discrimination on grounds of nationality resulting from national laws , regulations or practices , that Article seeks to ensure that , as regards the right of establishment , a Member ORG accords to nationals of other Member GPE the same treatment as it accords to its own nationals ...", "CARDINAL . It must therefore be determined whether national rules relating to the transcription in NORP characters of the name of a NORP national in the registers of civil status of the Member ORG in which he is established are capable of placing him at a disadvantage in law or in fact , in comparison with the way in which a national of that Member ORG would be treated in the same circumstances .", "CARDINAL . There is nothing in the LAW to preclude the transcription of a NORP name in NORP characters in the registers of civil status of a Member ORG which uses the NORP alphabet . It is therefore for the Member ORG in question to adopt legislative or administrative measures laying down the detailed rules for such transcription , in accordance with the prescriptions of any international conventions relating to civil status to which it is a party .", "CARDINAL . Rules of that kind are to be regarded as incompatible with LAW only in so far as their application causes a NORP national such a degree of inconvenience as in fact to interfere with his freedom to exercise the right of establishment enshrined in that Article .", "CARDINAL . Such interference occurs if a NORP national is obliged by the legislation of the ORG in which he is established to use , in the pursuit of his occupation , a spelling of his name derived from the transliteration used in the registers of civil status if that spelling is such as to modify its pronunciation and if the resulting distortion exposes him to the risk that potential clients may confuse him with other persons .", "CARDINAL . It should therefore be stated in reply to the national court that LAW must be interpreted as meaning that it is contrary to that provision for a NORP national to be obliged , under the applicable national legislation , to use , in the pursuit of his occupation , a spelling of his name whereby its pronunciation is modified and the resulting distortion exposes him to the risk that potential clients may confuse him with other persons . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
