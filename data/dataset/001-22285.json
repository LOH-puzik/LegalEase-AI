They are both NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively . They are represented before ORG of ORG ( Perheen Suojelun Keskusliitto ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "PERSON is the child of PERSON marriage to a citizen of GPE . The marriage ended in DATE . She had sole custody of PERSON In DATE the applicants moved from GPE to GPE . PERSON apparently started to gain more weight than was average for a child of his age . In DATE the applicant mother took him to ORG in GPE for examinations . It appears that a psychologist there reported PERSON \u2019s overweight condition to the social authorities , which appointed a support person for the family .", "On DATE PERSON brought PERSON in for further examinations at ORG . PERSON was voluntarily placed in the department for child psychiatry ( although it is alleged that this was contrary to PERSON wishes ) . PERSON reacted strongly to his placement . PERSON allegedly found out at a later stage that the staff was severely punishing children at the hospital . In DATE she repeatedly requested that PERSON be discharged , but the staff underlined the importance of his continued hospital care . After the hospital treatment had lasted for DATE , the applicant mother demanded that PERSON be returned home in DATE .", "On DATE and DATE PERSON was informed of a proposal to place PERSON in public care . According to a written notice , this proposal was to be considered by the local ORG ( sosiaali- ja terveyslautakunta , social- och h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsn\u00e4mnden ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE .", "On DATE the Board placed PERSON in public care , finding that the applicant mother lacked the resources to set the necessary boundaries for PERSON and that the applicants had \u201c too close a relationship \u201d . ORG estimated that PERSON \u2019s public care was likely to last a long time . PERSON was to be placed in the special children \u2019s home . PERSON appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) , complaining that the written notice had referred to DATE and not DATE ) . She did not appeal against the public care decision as such .", "In DATE PERSON allegedly discovered that PERSON had been severely punished by hospital staff as bruises were found on his body . It was PERSON \u2019s firm wish to go home . The applicant mother \u2019s wish that PERSON be discharged immediately was refused .", "On DATE PERSON was placed in the special unit of the children \u2019s home . On DATE the police decided , in the absence of sufficient evidence , to discontinue the investigation initiated as a result of a report made by the applicant mother about the suspected assault on PERSON at ORG .", "On DATE the director of ORG approved the proposal to modify the substitute care as from DATE ( PERSON was transferred from ORG to the children \u2019s home ) . The applicant mother appealed against this decision , firstly to the ORG and then to ORG . She did not appeal to ORG against the ORG \u2019s later decision of DATE upholding the director \u2019s decision .", "On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , rejected the applicant mother \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE to place PERSON in public care . The court found that PERSON and her representative had both been informed orally before the ORG \u2019s meeting that the written notice had been incorrect and that ORG would consider the matter on DATE . The court upheld the ORG \u2019s decision , stating , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The shortcomings in the care of PERSON , especially taking into account his illness , are seriously threatening his health and further development . The mother is not able to take care of his upbringing at the present time . The open care measures have proved to be insufficient . The public care is found to be in the interest of the child . ORG has , thus , been obliged to take PERSON into public care and to organise his substitute care . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) .", "PERSON sister and brother - in - law then informed the social workers in charge of the case that they could care for PERSON in their home so as to avoid his placement in a children \u2019s home . They were well - off and had a big house with a separate flat which could be used by the applicants . The request was apparently rejected . In proceedings instituted before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) , PERSON sister , PERSON , and brother - in - law , ORG , requested shared custody of PERSON together with PERSON", "On DATE the ORG decided to uphold the decision concerning the change of substitute care made by the director on DATE . As noted earlier , the applicant mother did not appeal to ORG against the decision of DATE .", "According to a social worker \u2019s notes from a meeting which she and apparently other social workers had with PERSON on DATE , PERSON had requested to be allowed to visit PERSON every day at the children \u2019s home . It had nevertheless been agreed at the meeting that PERSON would visit his mother at home DATE and that the applicant mother would visit him at the children \u2019s home for TIME on CARDINAL different weekdays and telephone him DATE at TIME .", "The first applicant later alleged that no such agreement had been reached . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE she pointed out that the care order had not restricted her access to PERSON and that she intended to visit him every day .", "On DATE the ORG restricted PERSON access to PERSON until DATE . She was allowed to receive PERSON in her home DATE , visit him for TIME on CARDINAL different weekdays and telephone him DATE at TIME .", "On DATE the ORG prolonged the restriction until DATE , after having heard the applicant and her legal counsel at its meeting . According to the ORG \u2019s decision , PERSON had a serious overweight condition and eating disorder . It appeared that his mother could not set any boundaries for him as PERSON had managed to gain QUANTITY during a TIME visit to his mother \u2019s home . The applicant appealed against the prolonged restriction , requesting an oral hearing . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal without holding an oral hearing . There is no right of appeal from a ORG decision concerning the restriction of access rights .", "On DATE ORG did not consider the merits of the applicant mother \u2019s appeal concerning the changes made to the substitute care as no appeal is allowed against such decisions .", "On DATE the director of the ORG prohibited on a short - term emergency basis the right of access of the applicant mother to PERSON , including telephone contact , until DATE as the mother - son relationship was found to be too symbiotic and dependant . Moreover , PERSON had started to become very aggressive and stressed in anticipation of the visits and phone calls . He had thrown tantrums and acted in a threatening way towards other children and adults . According to the decision , PERSON had been hospitalised on DATE because of his disorderly behaviour . It was considered that PERSON had to be \u201c removed from his mother \u2019s sphere of influence \u201d and be given \u201c the peace required by his treatment \u201d . PERSON had to integrate into the children \u2019s home .", "A further access prohibition was issued on DATE and lasted until DATE as PERSON had again acted so aggressively at the children \u2019s home that a psychiatrist had to be called to visit him . The decision was taken by the director of ORG . This was a short - term emergency decision which also prohibited the access of GPE and ORG to the child .", "On DATE ORG granted the request for the shared custody of PERSON after having heard , inter alia , ORG . ORG had expressed a negative opinion on the request .", "On DATE PERSON requested ORG to revoke PERSON \u2019s public care . She submitted , inter alia , that PERSON had not received proper care in the children \u2019s home and that she would move to the house of her sister and brother - in - law in order to provide him with optimal care .", "During negotiations with the social workers in charge of the case PERSON requested that she be allowed to take PERSON with her to ORG of ORG in order to obtain support and therapy . This was allegedly refused . Allegedly , the social authorities also prevented PERSON from taking PERSON to be examined by a private therapist specialising in the upbringing of children .", "On DATE ORG rejected PERSON appeal against the confirmation of the care order . It had obtained written submissions from ORG and a written opinion from ORG . This opinion relied on a written opinion submitted by PERSON , a child and youth psychiatrist of ORG in the Social Welfare and ORG ( sosiaali- ja terveysalan tutkimus- ja kehitt\u00e4miskeskus ) . PERSON submitted a rejoinder , pointing out , inter alia , that PERSON opinion had been exclusively based on the documents at her disposal and on her own speculations .", "In DATE PERSON was moved from the children \u2019s home to the home of his joint custodians , GPE and ORG , and PERSON , but his public care was maintained . PERSON withdrew her request that PERSON \u2019s public care be revoked .", "On DATE the head social welfare officer of ORG approved the changes to the substitute care as from DATE according to the care plan .", "On DATE the director of ORG decided to terminate PERSON \u2019s public care .", "The relevant legislation is outlined in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON and GPE ( no .

Those provisions of particular relevance to the present case are described below .", "When the need for child welfare is caused primarily by inadequate income , deficient living conditions or lack of housing , or when these factors constitute a serious obstacle to the rehabilitation of a child and family , local authorities must provide adequate financial support without delay , and improve the family \u2019s housing conditions .
