In particular , she stated as follows :", "\u201c I draw your attention to the conduct of the lawyers Mr PERSON and PERSON , which is not compatible with LAW . It has encroached on the rights of the person they were representing before the court ... and has led to unjustifiable delays in the examination of the merits of the case .
