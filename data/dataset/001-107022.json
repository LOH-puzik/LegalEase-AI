The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a practising lawyer . In DATE the applicant was informed by ORG that it planned to appoint him as legal guardian ( PERSON ) for K , who was suffering from a mental illness , and asked him to comment on the proposal . According to the document supplied by the court , there were no known relatives of K who could become guardians , and the association of guardians ( PERSON f\u00fcr Sachwalterschaft ) had informed the court that it lacked the capacity to take over guardianship .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted comments , stating that his wife objected to the proposal , since K might call the applicant at DATE and disturb their family life . His professional and spare - time activities would also not allow him to take on another duty . He added that he was not trained to deal with persons with a mental illness such as K and was not interested in acquiring the necessary training either . Furthermore , he argued that his professional insurance would not cover the risks associated with being a legal guardian ; therefore , he would have to enter into a separate insurance agreement . The costs would have to be borne by K , who DATE according to the court file which the applicant had received \u2013 did not appear to have the money to cover them .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of ORG of DATE the applicant was appointed as legal guardian for K in matters of management of income and representation before the courts and other authorities . The court found that no other person , such as a relative , was suitable to be ORG legal guardian . The association of guardians did not have the capacity to appoint a legal guardian for PERSON The applicant was the next person on the list of possible legal guardians . This list , which is kept by ORG , contains the names of all lawyers and public notaries in the district . The court also found that the reasons submitted by the applicant were not sufficient to justify his refusal ; it held that neither having CARDINAL children , nor leading a church choir , nor being member of a supervisory board constituted a valid reason as to why he should be declared unsuitable for the task . The court also held that the duty for lawyers to act as legal guardians did not constitute forced labour , as helping weaker members of society was a civic duty and for practising lawyers , rendering help in legal matters was part of their core professional duties and was comparable to a normal civic obligation within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , arguing that if the duty were to constitute a normal civic obligation , it was discriminatory to put only lawyers and public notaries on the list , as other persons also had knowledge of law , such as judges , public servants who had studied law or lawyers working in companies . He also alleged that the tasks he had been ordered to perform did not require special legal knowledge as any adult person could manage their income ; he further claimed that no court proceedings in which K was a party were pending , and thus it was not necessary to appoint a practising lawyer as his guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG , holding that there was CARDINAL trial involving K pending , and that any other tasks the applicant would have to perform in the present case were limited and did not place an excessive burden on him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law to ORG , alleging a violation of LAW in conjunction with LAW , as only lawyers and their associates ( Rechtsanwaltsanw\u00e4rter ) and public notaries and their associates ( PERSON ) , but no other persons who had studied law , were placed on the list of possible guardians . He also complained that lawyers were in principle entitled to remuneration for their services , but this applied only in so far as this would not endanger the fulfilment of the basic needs of the person placed under guardianship . By a decision of DATE ORG refused to deal with the matter , finding that it did not raise an important question of law .", "CARDINAL .

The law in force at the relevant time provided that adult persons of unsound mind who could not handle all or some of their own affairs without the risk of disadvantages for them should be placed under guardianship ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There were varying degrees of guardianship , ranging from a duty to carry out CARDINAL specific transaction or enforce or contest a specific claim , to the carrying out of certain types of duties , such as management of a person \u2019s entire assets or parts thereof , or taking care of all the affairs of the person concerned ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Placement under guardianship was not permissible if and in so far as the person concerned could take care of his or her affairs to a sufficient degree with assistance , especially from the family or from institutions for people with disabilities ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided that guardians should be persons close to the persons placed under guardianship , unless the wellbeing of the person concerned required otherwise ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; if this was beneficial to the well - being of a person under guardianship , a person from a GPE association should be nominated as a guardian , where possible ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If taking care of the affairs of the person concerned required considerable knowledge of law , a practising lawyer ( or lawyer \u2019s associate ) or public notary ( or notary \u2019s associate ) was to be appointed as guardian ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided that the guardian should be in contact with the person under guardianship and should try to ensure that medical and social assistance was given to the person concerned .", "CARDINAL .

A particularly suitable person DATE according to the caselaw , a person belonging to the groups mentioned in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 could refuse to carry out the task only if it was unacceptable to him or her ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The guardian was entitled to remuneration , fees and reimbursement of expenses . If the guardian used his special professional knowledge and skills for tasks for which the services of another person would otherwise have to be engaged , the guardian was entitled to adequate remuneration for these tasks . Remuneration could only be granted in so far as the basic needs of the person under guardianship could still be satisfied from the person \u2019s income ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Non - Contentious Proceedings Act ( Au\u00dferstreitgesetz ) provided that a guardian had to report to the court about contacts with the person concerned , the life the person led and the person \u2019s physical and mental state . The reports had to be drawn up at reasonable intervals , at least once DATE . The court could also require the guardian to draw up a report . Further duties listed in the Non - Contentious Proceedings Act concerned the keeping of accounts for the assets and income of the person under guardianship ; the statements of account were subject to the court \u2019s approval .", "CARDINAL .
