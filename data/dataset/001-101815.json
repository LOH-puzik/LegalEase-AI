On CARDINAL DATE the applicants requested ORG to prohibit the use of the flat .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the ORG prohibited the use of the flat .

It also observed , referring to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( ibid . ) , that any application for judicial review of the decision would not automatically suspend its enforcement .", "CARDINAL . The flat \u2019s owner appealed to ORG . On DATE the ORG rejected the appeal as inadmissible , noting that the impugned decision was not subject to an appeal to a higher authority but only to judicial review .

It noted that by law the decision was enforceable immediately , even if it had been challenged by way of judicial review . However , the courts could in their discretion suspend enforcement and it was justified in doing so because the file did not contain any indications that the conditions envisaged by section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL LAW , which governed the enforcement of nonfinal administrative decisions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were fulfilled . In addition , the court allowed the condominium and the company operating the computer club to intervene in the proceedings , and fixed a hearing on the merits of the case for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

However , the flat \u2019s owner had not shown that these prerequisites were satisfied , nor had the lower court made such a finding . It had merely referred to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW , which was not applicable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently asked LOC to enforce the decision . It seems that they did not receive a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting pursuant to a fresh request by the flat \u2019s owner , again suspended the enforcement of the decision . It held that its immediate enforcement would impede the proper course of the main proceedings and result in damage for the club \u2019s owner . There was no indication that the life or health of others were at risk , that with time enforcement would grow more difficult or be blocked , or that important ORG interests were at stake .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicants , on DATE ORG reversed that order . It found that in principle administrative decisions should be immediately enforced only if , inter alia , that was necessary to safeguard the life or health of others , or to protect important ORG or public interests . However , where the law specifically provided for the immediate enforcement of certain decisions , there was a presumption that such a need existed . Therefore , it was possible to suspend the enforcement of a decision which was immediately enforceable by operation of law only if that would put at risk an opposing interest of the same intensity as the one sought to be protected , which was not the case . Any pecuniary damage sustained by the club \u2019s owner was not of such a nature , as it could be fully compensated for by the payment of money .", "CARDINAL . After that the applicants made numerous requests for the decision to be enforced . However , they were informed that on DATE the local authorities had permitted the use of the club ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that therefore the decision could not be enforced . The applicants complained about that situation to the prosecuting authorities , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG tried to hold a first hearing on the merits of the case on DATE . However , the flat \u2019s owner had not been properly summoned and the court adjourned the proceedings . It fixed the next hearing for DATE . On DATE the applicants complained about the delay to ORG . On DATE that court , noting that according to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) , the proceedings had to follow a fasttrack procedure , instructed ORG to bring forward the date of its hearing . ORG accordingly rescheduled the hearing for DATE . However , as the flat \u2019s owner had again not been properly summoned , the hearing was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made a new complaint about delays . On DATE ORG rejected it , finding that GPE had made all possible efforts to allow the proper progress of the proceedings and that , in view of that court \u2019s busy calendar , the listing of a hearing for DATE did not amount to an unjustified delay .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the ORG started to examine the merits of the case . At the next hearing , held on DATE , the flat \u2019s owner declared that she wished to withdraw her application for judicial review , and the court accordingly discontinued the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC found that the computer club was operating in breach of the condition laid down in the permit of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as its clients were entering through the passageway used by the building \u2019s residents and not through a separate entrance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the flat \u2019s owner informed the authorities that the computer club had ceased its operations . On DATE the FAC , having found after an inspection on DATE that the vending machines and CARDINAL computers had still not been taken out of the club , again prohibited its use and ordered that its electricity and water supplies be cut off .", "CARDINAL . Some time after that the flat was rented by another company , which apparently used it as an office until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , on DATE , the NORP sisters asked ORG to exempt them from paying court fees for a tort claim which they intended to bring against the persons operating the club . On DATE the court \u2019s president refused to examine the request , saying that it could be made only if a claim had already been brought , or if it had been lodged concomitantly with the statement of claim . That ruling was later upheld by ORG and ORG . It seems that the NORP sisters did not bring a claim against the persons operating the club .", "CARDINAL . Having obtained a building permit on DATE , in DATE the owner of the flat occupied by the computer club until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) started transforming it into an electronic games club . The works involved pulling down internal walls , installation of highvoltage cables and changing the flat \u2019s windows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Milevi sisters complained about that to FAC , saying that no assent had been sought from them under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the ORG replied that the works were lawful as they had been carried out under a permit .", "CARDINAL . The NORP sisters then complained to ORG . On DATE it instructed ORG to check the lawfulness of the works . Apparently nothing ensued .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the PERSON sisters contested the building permit before ORG . On DATE the ORG rejected the challenge as being out of time . On an appeal by the PERSON sisters , on DATE the ORG set that decision aside and instructed the ORG to examine the challenge on the merits . The ORG appealed against that ruling , but on DATE ORG upheld it .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the NORP sisters made numerous complaints about the conversion to both the building control authorities and the police , apparently to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a company rented the flat adjacent to the flat of the NORP sisters and started using it as an office . The PERSON sisters asserted that after that they could hear telephones ringing and conversations , loud voices , moving of furniture and banging of doors .", "CARDINAL .
