On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . On DATE the applicant co - operative brought an appeal on points of law before ORG .", "By an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to entertain the appeal . When doing so , the court relied on provisions of LAW as amended in DATE allowing it not to examine manifestly ill - founded appeals or appeals in cases where no serious legal issue arose , even if these appeals had been brought DATE , the date on which the amendments of DATE entered into force .", "Subsequently , on DATE , ORG examined a constitutional complaint in which the complainant ( not the applicant cooperative ) submitted that the DATE amendments to LAW providing for the possibility to leave an appeal on points of law unexamined had come into force after her appeal had been lodged with ORG . She argued that , as a result , the DATE amendments to the LAW breached the LAW insofar as it guaranteed the rule of law , which encompassed , inter alia , the principle that law should not apply retrospectively . It was also argued that these provisions breached the complainant 's right to a fair hearing in that she was deprived of her right to have an appeal on points of law examined in full by ORG .", "ORG held , in its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that the DATE amendments were in breach of LAW , referring to the rule of law as a fundamental constitutional principle . It further held that it was not necessary to determine whether they were compatible with LAW , guaranteeing a right to a fair hearing ( see Relevant domestic law ) .", "On DATE the applicant co - operative lodged a request for the re - opening of the proceedings before ORG , relying on this judgment of ORG . It was argued that ORG interlocutory order given in its case on DATE had been issued on the basis of the DATE amendments , subsequently declared unconstitutional by ORG . Therefore the judgment of ORG provided grounds on which , in conformity with LAW , the proceedings in which a decision based on these provisions had been given should be re - opened and the order quashed .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request for the re - opening of the proceedings . The ORG stated that it was aware of the judgment of ORG of DATE . However , it observed that LAW provided that proceedings could only be re - opened following a judgment of ORG , if the unconstitutional provision had served as a basis for a decision on the merits . In the present case the unconstitutional provisions had served as a basis for an interlocutory order , i.e. for ORG refusal to entertain the appeal on points of law . Therefore the proceedings could not be re - opened , Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure not providing a legal basis for doing so .", "A party to civil proceedings can lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judicial decision of a second - instance court which has terminated the proceedings .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c The cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds :", "CARDINAL ) a breach of substantive law by its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application ,", "CARDINAL ) a breach of procedural provisions , if that shortcoming could significantly affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "Pursuant to LAW , having allowed a cassation appeal , may quash the challenged judgment in its entirety or in part and remit the case for re - examination .", "On DATE a law was enacted amending LAW .

However , LAW provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The provisions being in force so far shall apply to the lodging and examination of appeals against judicial decisions given before DATE of entry into force of [ this ] law . \u201d", "A controversy arose over the latter provision , which led to ORG resolution of DATE ( no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG answered in the affirmative the question whether it may refuse to entertain a cassation appeal against a judicial decision given by the second instance court DATE . The court relied on the principle of the \u201c immediate application \u201d of procedural provisions , which it considered operative under NORP law since DATE . Pursuant to that principle , procedural provisions enter into force immediately and are applicable to proceedings regardless of the moment of their initiation . It found that LAW DATE provided for CARDINAL exceptions to the application of that principle . CARDINAL such exception concerned the examination of appeals against judicial decisions given before DATE . However , that provision related to the \u201c examination \u201d of an appeal whereas , pursuant to the amended Code of Civil Procedure , the court could refuse the examination of certain cassation appeals . It further noted that mere assessment of whether an appeal is manifestly ill - founded or whether a serious legal issue arises can not be regarded as an examination . Therefore , ORG considered that the exception to the principle of \u201c immediate application \u201d , in so far as it relates to the examination of appeals , does not cover cassation appeals .", "The court further pointed out that the amendments to LAW made it possible for that court to carry out properly its tasks relating to the cassation procedure , which at that time were significantly hindered by the enormous backlog of trivial and manifestly ill - founded appeals . It stated :", "\u201c In addition , it must be noted that the backlog in ORG leads in concrete cases to a violation of LAW ( ... ) , which , especially after the most recent judgments of ORG in cases against GPE concerning the unreasonable length of proceedings , can not be discounted . \u201d", "Finally , the court found the amendment at issue compatible with LAW , in particular with the principle of a CARDINAL instance judicial system , and LAW , relying in this connection on the PERSON v. GPE judgment of this Court .", "LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with principles specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed , shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in LAW . \u201d", "At the material time , the complaint had to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the individual decision was served ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) .

Exceptions to the public nature of hearings may be made for reasons of morality , State security , public order or protection of the private life of a party , or other important private interest . Judgments shall be announced publicly . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final .", "CARDINAL . Judgments of ORG , ... shall be published without delay .", "CARDINAL . A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from DATE of its publication ; however , ORG may specify another date for DATE the binding force of a normative act . Such time - limit may not exceed DATE in relation to a statute or DATE in relation to any other normative act . Where a judgment has financial consequences not provided for in the ORG , the Constitutional Court shall specify a date for the end of the binding force of the normative act concerned , after seeking the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A judgment of ORG on the non - conformity with LAW , an international agreement or statute , of a normative act on the basis of which a final judicial decision , a final administrative decision or settlement of other matters was issued , shall be a basis for re - opening proceedings , or for quashing the decision or other settlement in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings \u201d .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that a party to civil proceedings which have terminated with a final judgment on the merits can request that these proceedings be re - opened , if ORG has found that the legal provision on the basis of which this judgment was given was incompatible with LAW . Such a request can be lodged with the competent court within DATE from the judgment of ORG .", "On DATE ORG ruled on the compatibility with LAW DATE amendments to LAW . ORG held that these provisions , taken together with their interpretation given by the resolution of ORG ( referred to above at CARDINAL ) were unconstitutional . This was so as the transitory provisions concerning the procedure to be followed in the examination of appeals on points of law lodged with ORG DATE , the date on which these amendments entered into force , lacked clarity . As a result , their interpretation could legitimately lead to opposite conclusions as to whether appeals lodged before DATE were to be examined under the procedural provisions in force before , or after that date . On the ordinary meaning of the text , a reasonable interpretation was that the appeals lodged before DATE should be examined under the provisions in force at the time when they were lodged with ORG . This , in the opinion of ORG , was indeed the intention of the legislator . However , the interpretation given to these provisions by ORG led to a contrary conclusion . The failure of the legislator to formulate these transitional provisions in a clear and precise manner so as to allow the appellants to know which procedure would be followed by ORG when examining their appeals was in breach of LAW which provides that the rule of law is a fundamental constitutional principle . The rule of law not only requires that legal provisions be clear and precise , but it also imposes on the state an obligation not to enact laws which arbitrarily change the procedure to be applied in the examination of a case after that case had been launched .", "On DATE the ORG gave a judgment in CARDINAL joined cases , in which the complainants had essentially submitted that Article CARDINAL of LAW was unconstitutional . The complainants relied on the fact that their cases the courts had refused to re - open civil proceedings given on the basis of a provision which had subsequently been declared unconstitutional . The courts considered that they could not re - open the proceedings , as the cases had been terminated by interlocutory decisions , not by judgments on the merits .", "ORG held that LAW was compatible with LAW . However , it criticised the legislator for the manner in which this provision had been inserted into the context of provisions concerning the re - opening of proceedings . While this provision was clearly designed to rescind decisions given on the basis of laws subsequently declared unconstitutional , it was so formulated as to allow the erroneous conclusion that such re - opening could only be effected in respect of proceedings terminated by a final decision on the merits . Such interpretation inevitably led to a conclusion that interlocutory decisions based on provisions subsequently declared unconstitutional could be left intact . This , in ORG conclusion , was manifestly unreasonable . However , there were no grounds on which to find this provision as such unconstitutional . It was not so much the provision itself which failed to meet the constitutional standards . It was rather the failure of the courts to interpret it correctly in such a way as to allow for the re - opening of all proceedings based on unconstitutional provisions , regardless of whether the final decision given in such proceedings was an interlocutory order or a judgment on the merits . The courts had at their disposal an array of such measures . It was not for ORG to indicate which measures should be applied in this respect , and in what manner .", "A case ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL is currently pending before ORG in which that court was invited to review whether LAW is compatible with LAW . The complainant submitted that ORG interpretation of Article CARDINAL has not changed despite the suggestions contained in ORG judgment of DATE . Since it led to consistent refusals to re - open civil proceedings terminated by interlocutory decisions given on the basis of a provision subsequently found unconstitutional , the provisions of LAW have thereby been rendered ineffective ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
