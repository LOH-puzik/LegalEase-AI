The applicant was born in DATE . At the time of lodging his application , he was detained in FAC . He was released subsequently .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been continuously addicted to heroin since DATE , when he was aged DATE . He has also been suffering from hepatitis C since DATE and has been HIV - positive since DATE . He has been considered PERCENT disabled and has been receiving an employment disability pension since DATE . He has tried to overcome his addiction to heroin with various types of treatment ( including CARDINAL courses of in - house drug rehabilitation therapy ) , all of which failed . DATE the applicant \u2019s heroin addiction was treated with medically prescribed and supervised drug substitution therapy . Since DATE , the applicant had reduced the dosage of his drug substitution medication ( GPE ) and consumed heroin in addition to that medication .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and taken in detention on remand in FAC , where his drug substitution treatment was interrupted against his will . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking , sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and , having regard to a previous conviction , to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It further ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in a drug detoxification facility , to be executed after a period of CARDINAL months\u2019 detention in prison . The applicant was still not provided with substitution treatment for his heroin addiction . On DATE he was transferred to a drug rehabilitation centre in GPE , GPE , where he underwent abstinencebased treatment for his addiction , without additional substitution treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s detention in the detoxification facility terminated and ordered his retransfer to prison . In a decision dated DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Having regard , in particular , to the views expressed by the applicant \u2019s treating doctors , the court considered that it could no longer be expected with sufficient probability that the applicant could be cured from his drug addiction or could be prevented for a considerable time from relapsing into drug abuse . He had secretly consumed methadone at the clinic and lacked motivation to lead a drug - free life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was transferred back to PERSON on DATE . The prison doctors gave him various painkillers for chronic pain resulting from his polyneuropathy , on a DATE basis . During his detention , the pain in his feet , neck and spine became such that , at least during certain periods , he spent most of his time in bed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was examined by an external doctor for internal medicine , PERSON , on the prison authorities\u2019 request in DATE . H. did not consider any changes in the treatment of the applicant \u2019s HIV and hepatitis C infections necessary . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s chronic pain linked to his long - term drug consumption and polyneuropathy , he suggested that the prison medical service reconsider the possibility of drug substitution treatment . He subsequently confirmed that the applicant should be examined by a doctor specialised in drug addiction therapy to that end .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also obtained , on his request , an opinion drawn up by an external doctor specialised in drug addiction treatment ( B. ) dated DATE , on the basis of the written findings of doctor PERSON and the Kaisheim Prison doctor \u2019s and authorities\u2019 findings and statements , but without having been able to examine the applicant in person . B. considered that from a medical point of view , drug substitution treatment had to be provided to the applicant . He explained that in accordance with ORG Guidelines for LAW ( GPE Bundes\u00e4rztekammer zur ORG der substitutionsgest\u00fctzten PERSON ) of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , drug substitution therapy was internationally recognised as being the best possible therapy for long - standing opioid addicts . Detoxification caused the person concerned serious physical strain and extreme mental stress and should only be attempted in cases of a very short opioid dependence . Drug substitution therapy prevented a deterioration of the patient \u2019s state of health and a high risk to life , which arose particularly after forced abstinence in detention . It further prevented the spreading of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C. It had to be clarified whether , in the applicant \u2019s case , further treatment for the hepatitis C from which he suffered was necessary .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE , which he supplemented subsequently , the applicant made a request to the PERSON prison authorities for treatment with PERSON , PERSON or another heroin substitute for his heroin addiction . Alternatively , he requested that the question of whether such substitution treatment was necessary be examined by a drug addiction specialist .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that drug substitution treatment was the only adequate treatment for his medical condition . Under the relevant Guidelines of the Federal Medical Association for the Substitution Treatment of Opiate Addicts , drug substitution treatment , which he had received prior to his detention , was the required standard treatment for his condition and had to be continued during his detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that , as confirmed by doctor PERSON , the serious chronic neurological pain from which he was suffering could be considerably alleviated by drug substitution treatment , as had been the case during his previous substitution treatment . Having been addicted to heroin for DATE , he stood hardly any chance of leading a totally drugfree life on release from prison . His rehabilitation could therefore better be furthered by providing him drug substitution treatment . While undergoing such treatment previously , he had been able to lead a relatively normal life and to complete training as a software engineer .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , referring to doctor PERSON \u2019s opinion , the applicant claimed that he was in need of ORG therapy in order to treat his hepatitis C infection . In view of his poor physical and mental health , it was impossible to carry out such treatment without simultaneous drug substitution therapy . Substitution also helped to protect other prisoners from infection when using the same needles as he did for the consumption of drugs and diminished the trafficking and uncontrolled consumption of illegal drugs in prison . He also considered that the prison doctors did not have specialist knowledge in drug addiction treatment and asked to be examined by an external specialist .", "CARDINAL . After the prison authorities\u2019 first decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s application was quashed by ORG on DATE for lack of sufficient reasoning , the prison authorities , on DATE , again dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . The prison authorities argued that substitution treatment was neither necessary from a medical point of view nor a suitable measure for the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation . With regard to the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy , the prison authorities , relying on prison doctor PERSON \u2019s statement , considered that drug substitution therapy was not a necessary treatment for the purposes of section CARDINAL of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They found that the applicant , who was severely addicted to drugs , had not received drug substitution treatment prior to his current detention in FAC . He had been placed in a drug rehabilitation centre for DATE before his transfer to FAC , where he had been treated by medical experts with considerable knowledge of drug addiction treatment . The applicant had neither been given substitution treatment in the clinic , nor had the doctors recommended substitution treatment in prison . After DATE in detention , he no longer suffered from physical withdrawal symptoms . Moreover , his condition with regard to his HIV and hepatitis C infections was stable and did not require any therapy for which substitution treatment was a necessary precondition . As suggested by the prison doctor , the applicant should use the opportunity to wean himself off opioids , such as heroin and its substitutes , while in prison , as it was very difficult to obtain drugs there .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s social rehabilitation and treatment ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the prison authorities added that the main reason for which addicts underwent drug substitution therapy was to prevent them from becoming impoverished and from becoming involved in drug - related criminality . In prison , these risks were not present . Furthermore , the applicant had already shown that substitution therapy while he was at liberty had not prevented him from consuming other drugs or committing crimes , which had been caused by his antisocial nature . Moreover , the applicant had also consumed drugs while in detention . Therefore , providing him substitution treatment could lead to a risk to life and limb .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , relying on the reasons he had submitted to the prison authorities , appealed against the decision of the prison authorities to ORG . He further submitted that the authorities of Kaisheim Prison , where no substitution treatment had ever been provided , had omitted to examine the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy under the relevant criteria laid down , in particular , in ORG Guidelines for LAW , which were clearly met in his case . He further argued that under the applicable administrative rules for substitution treatment in prison in GPE , he would be provided with drug substitution therapy , which is carried out in the prisons of the majority of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by the prison authorities , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It added that it was not necessary to obtain the opinion of a drug addiction expert . The prison doctors of Kaisheim Prison had sufficient training to decide on the medical necessity of drug substitution therapy , irrespective of the fact that drug substitution therapies might never have been used in that prison . The administrative rules for substitution treatment in prison applicable in LOC were irrelevant , given that FAC was situated in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . He submitted that ORG failure to investigate sufficiently whether drug substitution treatment was necessary , under the applicable ORG Guidelines and with the help of an independent doctor specialised in drug addiction treatment , had breached section CARDINAL of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act and LAW Refusing him the alleviation of his intense neurological pain with an existing and medically necessary treatment constituted inhuman treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as illfounded . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant had failed to show why drug substitution therapy was the CARDINAL specific medical treatment he needed . He had further failed to prove that the prison doctors of FAC were not qualified to decide about the medical necessity of heroin substitution . The applicant \u2019s objection against ORG decision was rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained that his right to respect for his physical integrity under LAW had been breached because he was denied drug substitution therapy , the only suitable therapy to treat his chronic pain , which would make ORG therapy possible and allow him to reduce his craving for heroin and lead a \u201c normal \u201d everyday prison life without isolation . He further complained that his right to be heard under LAW had been violated as the domestic courts had not taken into consideration the medical opinions he had submitted to show that a substitution treatment was necessary and had failed to consult an independent specialised expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kaisheim prison authorities rejected the applicant \u2019s fresh request to be provided with substitution treatment in preparation for his release . The applicant \u2019s counsel was advised to ensure that the applicant was taken to a drug rehabilitation clinic immediately on his release in order to prevent him from taking an overdose of heroine as soon as he was at liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released . When examined by a doctor on DATE he tested positive for methadone and cocaine . The doctor confirmed that the applicant would receive drug substitution treatment from DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
