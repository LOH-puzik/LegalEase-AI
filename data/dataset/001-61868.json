The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( province of GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , ORG imposed a preventive measure on the applicant , who was placed under special police supervision for DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that numerous criminal complaints had been made against the applicant . In particular , it found that in DATE and DATE a series of criminal complaints had been lodged alleging that he had received stolen goods under cover of his vehicle dismantling and spare parts business . On CARDINAL DATE a preventive measure in the form of a warning ( avviso sociale ) was imposed on the applicant for DATE . On DATE a criminal complaint was lodged against him for aiding and abetting theft and trading in stolen goods ; he was acquitted by a judgment of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested with CARDINAL others in connection with another complaint for receiving stolen goods which had been lodged against him . In the light of the foregoing , ORG considered that there were reasonable grounds for believing that , in spite of his clean record , the applicant was a habitual offender and thus \u201c socially dangerous \u201d , within the meaning of CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . It refused , however , to make a compulsory residence order ( obbligo di soggiorno ) against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The order imposing the preventive measure was forwarded for enforcement to the Brindisi prefect on DATE and served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , but his appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The order became final on DATE and was subsequently served on the GPE municipality on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police drafted , in the applicant \u2019s presence , a document setting out the obligations imposed on him ( verbale di sottoposizione agli obblighi ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was required :", "( a ) to look for a suitable job within DATE from the date of service of the order ;", "( b ) not to change his place of residence ;", "( c ) not to leave his home without informing the authorities responsible for supervising him ;", "( d ) to live an honest life and not to arouse suspicion ;", "( e ) not to associate with persons who had a criminal record or who were subject to preventive or security measures ;", "( f ) not to return home TIME in DATE and TIME in DATE or to leave home before TIME , unless due cause could be shown and in all cases only after informing the authorities responsible for supervising him ;", "( g ) not to keep or carry weapons ;", "( h ) not to go to bars or attend public meetings ;", "( i ) to report to the relevant police station on DATE TIME ;", "( j ) to have on him at all times the card setting out his precise obligations under the preventive measure and a copy of the court order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a declaration that the preventive measure had expired on DATE , that is , DATE after the date on which the order of CARDINAL DATE was served on him .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , ORG found that , even if pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL the special supervision period began on DATE on which the person on whom the preventive measure was imposed was served with the relevant order , compliance with that formality was necessary but not sufficient to constitute an initial step in the implementation of the measure . For there to be such an initial step , it was also necessary under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL for the relevant order to be forwarded for enforcement to the competent police authority . ORG observed that , under ORG case - law , special supervision did not lapse at the end of the period for which it had been imposed , independently of when it was implemented . In the case before it , the initial step in the implementation of the measure had been taken on DATE , DATE on which the GPE police had drafted the document setting out the obligations imposed on the applicant .

It considered that the preventive measure could not automatically cease to apply on the date stated in the order of CARDINAL DATE independently of when it was implemented . Consequently , it concluded that the starting - point for the application of the preventive measure was DATE on which the first steps had been taken to implement it . In this case that had been DATE , when the police had drafted the document setting out the applicant \u2019s obligations under the order .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was filed with the registry on DATE , ORG ruled that the order for special supervision of the applicant had ceased to apply on DATE . It observed that LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL expressly provided that the period of special supervision started to run on DATE the person to be supervised was served with the relevant order . Consequently , contrary to the opinion of ORG , it found that the date on which the document setting out the obligations imposed on the applicant was drafted was not relevant for the purposes of identifying the date on which the preventive measure first took effect . It concluded that the period of special supervision had started to run on DATE on which the relevant order was served on the applicant ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

The power to impose preventive measures was introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE . Such measures are intended to prevent individuals who are considered \u201c socially dangerous \u201d from committing offences .
