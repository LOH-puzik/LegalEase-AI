THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-1;No violation of Art. 5-4;No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , Mr. PERSON , is a NORP citizen born in DATE . On DATE , he was convicted by a court at GPE , GPE , in GPE of dangerous driving and CARDINAL offences of unlawful possession of firearms . Medical evidence was submitted to the effect that he was suffering from mental illness ( paranoid schizophrenia ) and his mental disorder was of a nature or degree which warranted his detention in a psychiatric hospital . The court made a hospital order under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) together with an order under section CARDINAL restricting his discharge without limit of time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was ( after a short period of detention in prison ) initially detained at the local psychiatric hospital , ORG , in GPE , GPE . He twice absconded from ORG and the view was taken that the facilities there were not such that he could be contained . On DATE , the applicant was therefore transferred to ORG , a \" special hospital \" for those requiring treatment under conditions of special security on account of their dangerous , violent or criminal propensities ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE , the applicant \u2019s case was considered on CARDINAL occasions by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which advised on each occasion that he was not ready to be discharged or transferred . The Secretary of ORG for ORG ( \" the ORG Secretary \" ) , who was responsible under LAW for control of the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , followed their advice .", "Periodic reports were also sent by his responsible medical officer to the Secretary of ORG . At his own request , he was also examined , on CARDINAL occasions during this period , by independent doctors . According to all these medical reports , the reasons for his continued detention were that he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia , that his condition in ORG was controlled by medication and supervision , that he was unwilling or unable to co - operate voluntarily in such treatment and that if he were released he might be dangerous .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Dr. PERSON , a consultant forensic psychiatrist who was the applicant \u2019s responsible medical officer at ORG , reported that the applicant no longer posed \" the threat he previously did \" and might properly be treated in an open hospital . In the doctor \u2019s view , the probability that he would be violent had diminished to the point where it was no longer necessary to treat him in the specially secure environment of ORG , although he required continuing treatment in hospital . Dr. PERSON therefore recommended his transfer to ORG . The applicant was also examined by Dr. PERSON , a consultant psychiatrist at ORG , who confirmed this opinion .", "In DATE , in accordance with the relevant regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the Secretary of ORG indicated his agreement with Dr. PERSON \u2019s recommendation . On DATE , the ORG Secretary gave his consent to the applicant \u2019s transfer to a local psychiatric hospital ( section CARDINAL para . ( CARDINAL)(c ) of the DATE Act - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , provided that a suitable vacancy could be found .", "CARDINAL . ORG However , ORG , the local authority responsible for ORG , refused to admit the applicant to ORG and the Secretary of ORG refused to direct his transfer there ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act - see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) . The reason for these refusals was that the CARDINAL branches of the trade union of the nursing staff at ORG ( ORG ) were , and had since DATE been , operating a total ban on the admission of offender patients subject to section CARDINAL restriction orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The union members considered that , owing to lack of adequate resources , they could not provide sufficient treatment , rehabilitation and security for section CARDINAL patients in the open environment of ORG ( as to which , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Secretary of ORG had been advised by ORG that to admit the applicant without the agreement of the nursing staff would be likely to result in a withdrawal of labour which could endanger the health and well - being of other patients and would not be in the applicant \u2019s own interests . They had further advised that such a step would jeopardise the prospects of obtaining agreement of the staff to the lifting of the ban and that to admit the applicant to another hospital might not only result in disruptive industrial action at that hospital , but would be likely to worsen industrial relations at ORG itself .", "No suitable accommodation could be found for the applicant at any hospital other than ORG and he therefore remained at ORG .", "Prior to this , ORG had made enquiries as to the need to continue the section CARDINAL restrictions in the applicant \u2019s case . On DATE , Dr. PERSON , as the applicant \u2019s responsible medical officer , stated his view that \" the restrictions should not be lifted ... until PERSON [ had ] demonstrated stability and indeed improvement in the open conditions of a conventional psychiatric hospital , over a reasonable period of time \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant \u2019s case was again considered by ORG on DATE . The ORG advised that it was essential for the applicant \u2019s well - being that he should remain under direct supervision to ensure that he continued to take his medication , but agreed that his condition was sufficiently improved to warrant transfer to a local hospital . On DATE , the Home Secretary reaffirmed his agreement in principle to the applicant \u2019s transfer . During this period , unavailing attempts were made on behalf of the local ORG to persuade the nursing staff at ORG to lift their ban on the admission of restricted patients .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , having obtained legal aid , the applicant instituted ORG proceedings in DATE to challenge the legality of his continued detention at ORG . He initially claimed various relief including :", "i. ORG a declaration that ORG , which was sued as representing the Secretary of ORG , was under a statutory duty to provide him with hospital accommodation at ORG or some other appropriate local hospital ;", "ii . ORG declarations that the ORG and ORG were acting ultra vires in refusing to admit him to ORG because of the union \u2019s ban ;", "iii . a declaration that the secretaries and other members of the CARDINAL union branches at ORG were acting unlawfully in soliciting or causing the ORG and the local ORG to act in breach of their statutory duty ;", "iv . ORG an injunction restraining the branch secretaries and members from so acting .", "The original statement of claim was amended in DATE to include an allegation that the union members were acting unlawfully in threatening to walk out of the hospital if the applicant was brought there , and to include claims for injunctions and damages in respect of such conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the action against the CARDINAL union branch secretaries , who were being sued personally and as representing the members of the branches , was stayed , on their application , by Mr. Justice PERSON on the ground that proceedings were precluded by section CARDINAL of LAW , which provided :", "\" CARDINAL . No person shall be liable ... to any civil ... proceedings to which he would have been liable apart from this section in respect of any act purporting to be done in pursuance of this Act ... , unless the act was done in bad faith or without reasonable care .", "CARDINAL . No civil ... proceedings shall be brought against any person in any court in respect of any such act without the leave of ORG , and the High Court shall not give leave under this section unless satisfied that there is substantial ground for the contention that the person to be proceeded against has acted in bad faith or without reasonable care .", "CARDINAL . ... \"", "On the application of ORG and the local ORG , an order staying the proceedings against them was granted on DATE by Mr. Justice PERSON on the same ground .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against both orders . On DATE , ORG unanimously ( a ) dismissed the appeal against the order of Mr. Justice PERSON relative to the GPE and ORG and ( b ) allowed the appeal against the order of Mr. Justice PERSON relative to the union secretaries .", "Lord Justice Bridge delivered the first judgment . He noted that no leave had been sought of ORG and that there was no allegation of bad faith or of acting without reasonable care against any of the defendants . The issue was therefore whether or not the acts out of which liability was alleged to arise came within the ambit of the immunity from suit conferred by sub - section CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , as being acts done in the purported pursuance of LAW .", "( a ) ORG As regards the first appeal , Lord FAC , dismissing Mr. PERSON \u2019s main contention , stated that where a statutory authority was acting in good faith in what it believed to be the proper manner of discharging its statutory responsibilities , the fact that it may have been acting in a way which contravened the statute to the point of frustrating its policy and objects , could not lead to the conclusion that the original acts in good faith were not in purported pursuance of the LAW . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW propounded a subjective not an objective test : \" if a person is acting honestly with the intention of performing , in the best way he knows how , the statutory functions or duties which are cast upon him , then it seems to me he is acting in purported pursuance of the statute \" . Although Mr. PERSON alleged a breach of statutory duty under LAW DATE to provide hospital accommodation to meet all reasonable requirements ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the essential act out of which liability was said to arise was the refusal of transfer , which fell within the protection of section CARDINAL . Applying the case of ORG v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL and [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) , he further held that \" section CARDINAL does not create a personal immunity which is capable of being waived but imposes a fetter on the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction which is not so capable \" . For these reasons , Lord FAC , with whom Lords Justice Cumming - PERSON and PERSON concurred , was in favour of dismissing the appeal .", "( b ) ORG As to the action against the union branch secretaries , Lord FAC , after considering the judgment in the case of ORG v. PERSON ( ibid . ) , held that a decision by nursing staff to ban the admission of a whole class of patients , even if taken in the best of faith , was not within the express or implied authority of nurses under LAW . Nurses did not have authority under LAW to take decisions of broad policy . Consequently , the acts of the union secretaries were not protected by LAW and the stay imposed by Mr. Justice PERSON on the action against them should therefore be removed . Lords Justice Cumming - PERSON and PERSON agreed with this conclusion .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the parties leave to appeal to ORG . The union secretaries petitioned ORG for leave but this was refused on DATE . The proceedings against them were ultimately discontinued ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . During the course of the litigation referred to above , reports on the applicant \u2019s condition were made on various occasions . Thus , on DATE , Dr. PERSON wrote :", "\" i. It is my opinion that transfer from ORG for further treatment and rehabilitation in a local psychiatric hospital is an essential step in the plaintiff \u2019s ( i.e. Mr. PERSON \u2019s ) recovery .", "ii . The disappointment at his rejection by ORG has made him tense and irritable . But more seriously , CARDINAL of his former delusional beliefs was to the effect that hospital authorities were persecuting him by continuing to detain him illegally . This delusion cleared when he gained some measure of insight . I fear that continued undue detention here will reactivate this to delusional intensity again and thus precipitate full - scale relapse .", "iii . His present mental condition remains reasonably stable and in my opinion he is suitable for transfer to ORG . \"", "In DATE , the applicant was again examined by Dr. PERSON of ORG . In his report dated DATE , Dr. PERSON confirmed that the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia remained unchanged . He had the impression there had been a slight deterioration in the applicant \u2019s mental condition over DATE . He expressed the following opinion as to Mr. PERSON \u2019s condition :", "\" Although not overtly psychotic this man remains paranoid and I feel that his continued detention in ORG is having an adverse effect on his mental health , i.e. it is making him even more paranoid . His drawn - out involvement with ORG can only aggravate this paranoia and further constrict his outlook . \"", "Dr. PERSON recommended that the applicant was not fit to return to the community but that it should be possible to manage him in an ordinary psychiatric hospital with a closed ward . It was unlikely that he would have to remain in such a closed ward for DATE . The doctor was satisfied that he could be managed at ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Until DATE , ORG continued to advise that they were unable to admit the applicant to ORG because of the union ban on admission of section CARDINAL patients . However , on DATE they stated that an agreement with the union had been reached enabling him to be admitted there . The solution reached involved the recruitment of extra staff in order to service the facilities needed for nursing a restricted patient .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Dr. PERSON reported again that the applicant \u2019s proper rehabilitation continued to necessitate in - patient treatment due to his \" lack of insight and long institutionalisation \" . In the doctor \u2019s opinion , continued detention was \" necessary in the interests of the patient \u2019s health or safety and for the protection of other persons \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Home Secretary and the Secretary of ORG both consented to the applicant \u2019s transfer and he was admitted to ORG on DATE . Shortly thereafter , on the advice of his lawyers , his action against the union branch secretaries was discontinued .", "In a letter of DATE , Dr. PERSON explained that , despite his earlier fears ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , \" the applicant did remain reasonably stable during the relevant time \" prior to transfer .", "CARDINAL . ORG The differences between the CARDINAL regimes and environments at ORG and ORG as experienced by the applicant may be summarised as follows .", "Security is a major concern at ORG . The hospital buildings and grounds are surrounded by a high perimeter wall with a locked gate . Each of the several blocks in the hospital is locked all the time , frequently there is further security within the block and windows are barred . No patient moves beyond his ward without an escort unless he is paroled . The applicant never achieved paroled status . He worked in the kitchen gardens and during DATE he had the relative freedom of this large , open area . Escorted visits to the community or to members of a patient \u2019s family are effectively allowed only in exceptional compassionate circumstances and tend to be rare , not least because there are insufficient staff to undertake escort duties . During his stay at ORG DATE , the applicant made CARDINAL escorted visit to his mother and CARDINAL to the neighbourhood of the hospital . Because of its relatively remote location and difficult communications , the possibility of visits to ORG by members of the patient \u2019s family is limited . Moreover , such visits , at least in the time that the applicant was detained at ORG , were rarely private .", "Ordinary psychiatric hospitals such as ORG house both voluntary and involuntary patients and no appreciable distinction is made in their regimes . Situated within the town of GPE , ORG is easily reached by public transport . There is no surrounding wall and neither the main entrance nor the reception area is locked . As Dr. PERSON had recommended ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant was at first placed in a closed ward for CARDINAL patients , male and female , which was locked , at least at TIME . There was no special security but a high staff / patient ratio . The work available to him at ORG during this initial period , although similar to that at ORG , was subject to less and eventually to no supervision . With effect from DATE , he was allowed freedom , unescorted , in the hospital grounds for TIME a day . In DATE , he was moved to an open ward . Since then , regular , unescorted leave to visit his family has become a feature of his life at ORG . As at DATE , he was going home DATE from DATE till DATE and was free to leave the hospital as he pleased on DATE , provided only that he returned to his ward at TIME .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the material time in GPE and GPE , the law relating to the compulsory confinement of mentally disordered persons , and more particularly the detention of patients concerned in criminal proceedings , was contained principally in LAW . The greater part of this LAW was repealed and replaced in DATE by LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" - see , for example , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "Various general provisions are also contained in ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . Thus , section CARDINAL imposes a duty on the Secretary of ORG to provide hospital accommodation throughout GPE and GPE , \" to such extent as he considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements \" . By virtue of section CARDINAL , he is under a further duty to provide and maintain \" special hospitals \" for those mental health patients subject to detention \" who in his opinion require treatment under conditions of special security on account of their dangerous , violent or criminal propensities \" .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act empowered criminal courts to direct , where appropriate , that a person convicted of an offence be dealt with by way of medical treatment rather than by way of punishment . By virtue of this section , a criminal court could , subject to certain conditions regarding in particular medical evidence , make an order ( a \" hospital order \" ) authorising the convicted person \u2019s compulsory admission to and detention in a mental hospital ( see , for fuller details , the X v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) . Under section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court could by further order ( a \" restriction order \" ) direct that the hospital order be subject to special restrictions in respect of discharge , either without limit of time or during a specified period . Before a restriction order could be made , it had to appear to the court , having regard to the nature of the offence , the antecedents of the offender and the risk of his committing further offences if set at large , that such a measure was necessary for the protection of the public . Where a restriction order was made , responsibility for control of the patient , though not for his treatment , vested in the Home Secretary .", "CARDINAL . ORG The transfer of mental health patients from CARDINAL hospital to another is the responsibility of the hospital managers , this being in the case of special hospitals the Secretary of ORG .", "At the material time , the Secretary of ORG could authorise transfer of an offender patient from a special hospital if he were satisfied that arrangements had been made for admission to the hospital of transfer within DATE ( section CARDINAL of LAW of ORG DATE ) . As far as restricted patients ( that is , patients subject to a restriction order ) were concerned , this power to transfer was exercisable only with the consent of the Home Secretary ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the DATE Act ) .", "However , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act conferred a further power on the Secretary of ORG to direct transfer from a special hospital without being satisfied that the above - mentioned arrangements had been made .", "CARDINAL . ORG In practice , according to CARDINAL reports ( interim report of DATE of ORG under the Chairmanship of Lord PERSON and the special hospitals research report no . DATE by PERSON , funded by ORG ) , special hospitals have for DATE been experiencing increasing difficulties in transferring to ordinary psychiatric hospitals patients no longer considered to be dangerous . The main reasons given by ordinary hospitals for not taking such patients on transfer were lack of room , the patient \u2019s characteristics , nursing - staff refusal and lack of suitable facilities , in particular lack of a secure unit or closed ward .", "CARDINAL . Periodic review of a restricted patient \u2019s case may be made by ORG , which at the material time had the function of advising the Home Secretary on the suitability of further detention and treatment ( section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act - see , for further details , the above - mentioned X v. the GPE judgment , Series A no . DATE , p. CARDINAL , paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The legal position and authority of ORG have been substantially altered by LAW , the relevant sections of which came into force on DATE . In particular , by virtue of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW now have the power in appropriate circumstances to direct the absolute or conditional discharge of restricted patients .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under the LANGUAGE law of torts , that is private civil wrongs , \" the breach of a statute may give rise to an action , commonly spoken of as an action for breach of statutory duty \" ( Clerk and PERSON on ORG , CARDINALth edition , DATE , para . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . However , this is only so if the statute created in the individual concerned an interest which was intended by ORG to be protected by an action in tort ; and one has to look at the statute in question to determine the types of conduct ( whether intentional , negligent or accidental ) in respect of which the interest of the individual is to be protected .", "The entitlement of patients confined under LAW to bring civil proceedings in connection with their detention was subject to the conditions and immunity laid down in section CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "This provision has been replaced by section CARDINAL of LAW , which section came into force on DATE , that is , subsequent to the particular facts of the present case . As from this date , the position has been that proceedings against the Secretary of ORG or against ORG are excluded from the protection from suit afforded by the section . In other cases , the requirement that a person seeking leave to bring civil proceedings should have to satisfy the judge of there being \" substantial ground \" for the allegation of bad faith or negligence has been removed and what remains is the sole requirement that leave should be sought ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
