The applicant , a parent of CARDINAL young children , is a homeless person in priority need of accommodation within the meaning of Part VII of LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Council \u201d ) is a local housing authority within the meaning of the DATE Act and is required , under Part VII of that LAW , to perform statutory functions in relation to homeless persons in its area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied as a homeless person to ORG for assistance in DATE . By letter dated DATE the ORG determined that the applicant was homeless , eligible for assistance , in priority need and not intentionally homeless . The authority therefore accepted that it owed the applicant the \u201c main housing duty \u201d to provide accommodation to her and her family . On DATE the authority made the applicant an offer of accommodation which she refused because she was unhappy with the location . The authority told the applicant that in its view the accommodation was suitable but following a review of that decision , which was determined in the applicant \u2019s favour , they agreed to make her another offer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Housing Officer informed the applicant by telephone that another offer was being made , that a viewing had been arranged and that a letter would follow . The authority claims that on that same day a written offer of accommodation at CARDINAL GPE , GPE was sent to the applicant . That letter contained a statement to the effect that if the applicant refused the offer without good cause the authority would consider that it had discharged its duty to her under Part VII of the CARDINAL Act . However , the applicant denied receiving the letter ; instead , she claimed that she had to telephone the housing office to obtain the address and arrange the viewing appointment . She viewed the property on DATE but declined the offer as she was not happy with the condition of the communal area .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the ORG notified the applicant that , by reason of her rejection of its offer , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW its duty to her under Part VII of LAW had been discharged . By letter dated DATE the applicant notified the ORG that she had not received an offer in writing and requested that the ORG review its decision .", "CARDINAL . While the applicant \u2019s case was pending before the review panel , a further offer of accommodation was made to her pursuant to a different scheme , namely the scheme for the provision of housing accommodation under Part VI of LAW . She did not accept this offer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG Officer employed by the ORG conducted a telephone interview with the applicant to establish her reasons for refusing the offer of accommodation at CARDINAL FAC . The Officer claimed that in the course of this conversation the applicant accepted that she had in fact received the offer letter but refused the offer of accommodation because there was no lift and the entrance to the property was dirty , which could put her youngest son \u2019s health at risk . However , the applicant claims that at the time she had thought she was being questioned about the subsequent offer of accommodation , in respect of which she did not deny having received a letter .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the Homelessness Review Officer upheld the decision that the applicant \u2019s refusal of the offer of accommodation had discharged the ORG \u2019s main housing duty to her under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . In particular , the Officer found that the applicant had been sent an offer letter from the ORG which complied with the mandatory requirements of section CARDINAL of LAW prior to her refusal and there was no reason to believe that she had not received it . In any case , she noted that the applicant had not refused the accommodation because she had not received a written offer but because she did not consider the accommodation to be suitable for her family \u2019s needs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , which allowed for an appeal on a point of law only . The jurisdiction exercised by ORG under section CARDINAL was that of judicial review . In her grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the ORG , in reaching its decision , had taken into account irrelevant considerations and/or acted under a fundamental mistake of fact ; that the ORG had acted unlawfully as it had failed to make adequate inquiries to enable it to reach a lawful decision ; that its decision was one which no rational ORG would have made ; that it had fettered its discretion ; and that it had acted in breach of natural justice .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard on DATE , on which date the judge noted that the only ground of appeal argued before him was that the letter of offer had failed to arrive . The applicant submitted that ORG should hear evidence on the matter so that it could determine it for itself . However , although the judge accepted that ORG was not an independent or impartial tribunal , he found that the decision whether or not the letter had been received was properly and fairly to be made by her and he declined to hear evidence on the point . Although it was not specifically stated in the correspondence between the ORG and the applicant , the judge appeared to consider whether or not the ORG had discharged its duty under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently appealed to ORG and then to ORG . At each level , the grounds of appeal were that the decision taken by ORG had constituted a determination of the applicant \u2019s civil rights for the purposes of LAW ; that the Officer had not been an independent or impartial tribunal as required by LAW ; that the decision of the Officer had turned on the resolution of a simple question of disputed primary fact , involving no application of specialist knowledge ; that pursuant to ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , LAW required that the applicant be able to appeal that simple factual determination ; and , alternatively , that the restriction of all statutory appeals to points of law , no matter what the nature of the decision , was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Both ORG and the ORG decision on the applicant \u2019s appeal followed the decision of ORG in Runa Begum v. GPE of GPE [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL . In PERSON ORG found that judicial review of a ORG Officer \u2019s decision that a claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered to her provided \u201c sufficiency of review \u201d for the purposes of LAW . ORG stressed that although the Officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factual issues , these findings of fact were \u201c only staging posts on the way to the much broader judgments \u201d concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation , which the Officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make . Although the Officer could not be regarded as independent , since she was employed by the ORG which had made the offer of accommodation which the claimant had rejected , statutory regulations provided substantial safeguards to ensure that the review would be independently and fairly conducted , free from improper external influences . Any significant departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the present case could be distinguished from that of PERSON because it concerned the simple question of a finding of primary fact rather than an evaluative judgment , such as a qualitative assessment of \u201c suitability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In doing so , it proceeded on the assumption that the case involved the determination of the applicant \u2019s civil rights for the purposes of LAW . In relation to the question whether the decision of ORG had turned on the resolution of a simple question of primary fact , or whether it required the application of specialist knowledge , PERSON stated that :", "\u201c i ) It is far from easy to draw the distinction advanced in practice . A finding of suitability is itself a finding based on conclusions of primary fact ...", "ii ) There would be considerable complexity in administering a scheme with these distinctions . A scheme which enabled certain factual issues to be subject to a full right of appeal and others which would not be so subject would be too uncertain and too complex ...", "iii ) ... [ I]f the extent of the review by the court was determined by the answer to the questions of whether a finding of fact was a primary finding , or whether that finding required expertise or whether that finding was determinative , the room for argument and uncertainty would be considerable ...", "....", "v ) The additional review which would be provided by the suggested full right of appeal on fact would not in practice be very wide ...", "vi ) The full right of appeal sought from a review officer on fact might have to be significantly different from an appeal from a court ... the procedure adopted by the reviewing officer in reaching findings of fact is informal and there are no transcripts of evidence .", "....", "viii ) There would therefore clearly be significant implications for not only the statutory scheme but for the court and tribunal system , if this court were to hold that a full right of appeal was required on findings of primary fact or on issues of primary fact where the finding was determinative ... The statutory scheme for housing and the statutory scheme for the method of appeals in respect of courts and tribunals are determined by ORG ; funds are provided for their finance by ORG ...", "ix ) The present scope of the appeal provides a real measure of protection for homeless appellants . It is clear from the careful judgments of Judge PERSON and Judge PERSON that both considered that the housing authority had fairly treated both appellants in cases where the determinative issue was a question of fact . This conclusion reinforces the view I have expressed that the review by ORG in cases of this kind was sufficient and that there is no reason to attempt to find that it is outside the scope of the decision in PERSON . It demonstrates , as Lord PERSON observed at paragraph CARDINAL , that the scheme properly operated should ensure fair treatment . I consider that it does whether the decision turns on a simple issue of primary fact or a conclusion of fact based on primary facts ( such as a conclusion on suitability ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON therefore concluded that the decision of ORG in PERSON applied to all ORG appeals under section CARDINAL of LAW , no matter whether the decision turned on a simple issue of primary fact or not . He further held that the decision in Tsfayo , which concerned the housing benefit scheme , did not affect appeals brought in homelessness cases :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In the first place ORG relied on the decision in PERSON in reaching its conclusion and said nothing that cast doubt on the correctness of the decision . Secondly , the decisions in PERSON and Tsfayo each turned on a careful examination of the whole of the statutory scheme relevant to the particular case . Thirdly , it is apparent from the details of the scheme considered in Tsfayo that whereas in the case of prospective benefit , central government reimbursed the local authority PERCENT of what it was required to pay , it only reimbursed PERCENT of backdated awards ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the decision ) ; this fact had been heavily relied upon in argument ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the decision ) for the powerful contention that the hearing had taken place before a tribunal consisting of members of an authority which would be required to pay PERCENT of the benefit if it made an award in the applicant \u2019s favour ; the ORG was not independent of the parties . Finally when the housing benefits scheme was looked upon as a whole , it was readily apparent that a conclusion could be reached , in contradistinction to the scheme under Part VII of LAW , that the particular scheme was not compliant with Article CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that the determination by the ORG , that its duty to secure accommodation for the applicant had ceased , was not a determination of her civil rights within the meaning of Article CARDINAL . Lord Hope of PERSON with whom ORG and Lord PERSON agreed , stated that :", "\u201c ... I would be prepared now to hold that cases where the award of services or benefits in kind is not an individual right of which the applicant can consider himself the holder , but is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments by the provider as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and how the need for it ought to be met , do not engage article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In my opinion they do not give rise to \u2018 civil rights\u2019 within the autonomous meaning that is given to that expression for the purposes of that article . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In supporting that conclusion Lord Hope looked to what the relevant provisions within Part VII of the CARDINAL Act were intended to achieve . He observed that :", "\u201c ... It provides a right to assistance if the relevant conditions are satisfied . But this is not a pecuniary right , nor is the benefit that is to be provided defined by the application of specific rules laid down by the statute . Even where the full homelessness duty arises under section CARDINAL , the content of the statutory duty lacks precise definition . There is no private law analogy . The duty is expressed in broad terms \u2013 to secure that \u2018 accommodation is DATE which leaves much to the discretionary administrative judgment of the authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued , following a review of the jurisprudence of the ORG , by noting that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There are however ... a number of straws in the wind since PERSON that suggest that a distinction can indeed be made between the class of social security and welfare benefits that are of the kind exemplified by PERSON v GPE whose substance the domestic law defines precisely and those benefits which are , in their essence , dependent upon the exercise of judgment by the relevant authority ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Later in his judgment , Lord Hope , for completeness , set out some observations on whether the scheme of decision - making was Article CARDINALcompliant . He commented that the possibility , foreshadowed in argument , of separating simple , formal questions of \u201c gateway \u201d facts , such as the letter issue , from the expert assessment of suitability would needlessly complicate a scheme which was designed to be simple to administer .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court went on to observe that the fact that a ORG did not have a full fact - finding jurisdiction when hearing an appeal under section CARDINAL of LAW did not mean that the applicant was deprived of what was required to satisfy the guarantees of LAW . In this connection , Lord Hope said this :", "\u201c DATE . ... For ease of administration the review is entrusted to a single officer who is equipped to deal with issues as to the suitability of the accommodation that has been declined . An answer to the question whether or not the letters were received was incidental to a more searching and judgmental inquiry into the accommodation \u2019s suitability . ... These cases are quite different from ORG , where no broad questions requiring professional knowledge or experience had to be addressed once the question whether there was good cause had been answered . In these circumstances I would hold that the ratio of the decision in PERSON should be applied and that the absence of a full fact - finding jurisdiction in the court to which an appeal lies under section CARDINAL does not deprive it of what it needs to satisfy the requirements of article CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
