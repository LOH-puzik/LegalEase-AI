The court started by noting that the special means of surveillance regulated by the ORG amounted to interferences with private life , home and correspondence , all of which were permissible under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The court then proceeded to examine section CARDINAL ) of the ORG , which allows , under certain conditions , the use of special means of surveillance before the issue of judicial warrant . It held that LAW could not be read as requiring the prior issue of warrant in every case . The risk of abuse by the executive was reduced by the facts that the possibility of dispensing with prior judicial control was narrowly circumscribed and that immediate subsequent control was mandatory . This state of affairs was also compatible with LAW . In the court 's view , the ORG provided an even higher level of protection than these instruments .", "CARDINAL . As regards section CARDINAL of the ORG , the court found that the possibility for the Minister of ORG to discontinue the use of special means of surveillance was not violative of LAW . While by LAW and section CARDINAL of the ORG the judiciary alone was empowered to authorise the use of such means , it was not the only branch of government which could order the termination of their use . The prerogative of the Minister did not therefore impinge on the independence of the judiciary .", "CARDINAL . With regard to section CARDINAL of the ORG , the court held that its true meaning , when read in the context of the LAW as a whole , was not that the Minister of ORG could order the use of special means of surveillance anew if intelligence outside the scope of the initial request for their use was obtained . It was rather to be construed as allowing the Minister to decide to which authority to forward the intelligence already obtained . His powers in this respect were thus not in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Concerning section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , which entrusts the overall control over the system to the Minister of ORG , the court noted that it was impossible to empower another minister , let alone a nonexecutive body , with such functions , because that would disrupt the equality between , and the independence of , the CARDINAL branches of government . This followed also from paragraph CARDINAL of the concluding provisions of the ORG , which allowed the Minister to issue instructions for its application . Moreover , the logic of the system , which was apparent from the wording of LAW , required that the Minister be made responsible for controlling the use of the special means of surveillance until the moment when the intelligence obtained thereby was given to the judicial authorities . Therefore , the judicial control over the intelligence thus gathered had not been infringed and the resulting situation was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges dissented in part .", "CARDINAL . One of them was of the opinion that section GPE ) of the ORG , which entrusts the control over the use of special means of surveillance to the Minister of ORG , was unconstitutional . In his view , this provision was not sufficiently precise and the powers it conferred to the ORG were not clearly delineated . It followed from the reading of the ORG as a whole that the Minister had powers in respect of both the use and the control over the use of special means of surveillance , which was inadmissible . The resulting lack of external control meant that section NORP ) was unconstitutional . When the law spoke about control over the system , it meant control over both its functioning as a whole and control in specific cases . To bestow controlling functions to the Minister , who also played a key part in the operation of the system , did not provide sufficient safeguards against the unwarranted use of special means of surveillance .", "CARDINAL . The other dissenting judge considered that section CARDINAL ) of the ORG was unconstitutional , in that it allowed the Minister of ORG to order the use of special means of surveillance without the prior issue of judicial warrant , even in cases when their use would interfere with the freedom of correspondence or other communications . In his view , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , which protects those freedoms , required prior judicial authorisation in all cases .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE of Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE ( \u201c the Code of DATE \u201d ) also regulated the use of special means of surveillance in the context of pending or impending criminal proceedings . They coincided almost verbatim with the provisions of the ORG . CARDINAL difference was that LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL provided that the judge who issued the warrant had to be informed in writing when the use of the means was discontinued . If their use had been fruitless , he or she was to order the destruction of the material obtained .", "CARDINAL . These provisions were superseded by Articles DATE of the Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE ( \u201c the Code of DATE \u201d ) , which entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of DATE , the investigation authorities may use special means of surveillance for investigating certain serious offences , which are exhaustively listed , if the relevant facts can not be established in another manner or if their establishment would be extremely difficult . Such means may be used for a maximum duration of DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , which may , if needed , be extended by DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The procedure starts with a reasoned application made by the prosecutor in charge of the case ( LAW ) . The application must contain information about the offence under investigation , a description of the hitherto investigative steps and their results , information about the persons or objects which will be subjected to surveillance , the methods which will be used and the duration of the surveillance ( LAW ) . The surveillance warrant is issued under the hand of the president of the respective regional court or of a specifically authorised deputy ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He or she must issue the warrant or refuse to do so immediately after receiving the application , and give reasons ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If he or she refuses , the application may be resubmitted to the president of the respective court of appeals or a specifically authorised deputy ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . All applications and warrants are recorded in a special nonpublic register ( LAW ) . LAW DATE makes no provision for exceptions from this procedure save in the case of an undercover agent , who may , in urgent cases , start to operate pursuant to a prosecutor 's order , which must be confirmed by the respective judge within twentyfour TIME ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the issue of warrant the special means of surveillance are deployed in accordance with the provisions of the ORG ( LAW ) . The judge who issued the warrant must be informed in writing when the use of the means is discontinued .

It was apparent from LAW of the ORG that information about the use of special means of surveillance was not to be disclosed . The refusal to provide the requested information was thus compatible with LAW . The appellant 's argument that the refusal had been in breach of ORG was inapposite , because the material gathered pursuant to the ORG was outside the purview of ORG , as was the information whether the use of special means of surveillance had been authorised . The appellant 's further arguments that the information requested was not a state or an official secret within the meaning of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LOC and could moreover be divulged because of the expiry of the twoyear timelimit under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of that LAW were likewise unavailing , because that LAW did not apply retroactively .", "CARDINAL .

On the other hand , the eventual intelligence obtained pursuant to a warrant to use special means of surveillance , as well as the warrant itself , were an official secret within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LOC . This followed also from the prohibition to divulge information about special means of surveillance laid down in CARDINAL of the ORG . The court went on to hold that the fact that the use of special means of surveillance could only be authorised by the presidents of the regional courts was sufficient to ensure independent judicial review of the activities of the executive and provided sufficient safeguards against unwarranted restriction on the citizens ' rights .", "CARDINAL .
