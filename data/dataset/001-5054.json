FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants is a NORP national born in DATE . He resides in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer in PERSON .", "In DATE the applicant signed certain employment contracts on behalf of a group of companies . In decisions of CARDINAL DATE the relevant pension insurance company found that as the applicant \u2019s companies had not been registered as legal persons the applicant himself had to be regarded as the employer . As a result the applicant was obliged to pay MONEY ( approximately the same in ORG ) in employer \u2019s contributions . According to the attached notice of appeal , an appeal was to be signed by the appellant himself or any other author . If the appeal was not signed by the appellant , it should include a power - of - attorney and indicate the representative \u2019s profession and address .", "The applicant contested the decisions of the pension insurance company in appeals to ORG ( el\u00e4kelautakunta , pensionsn\u00e4mnden ) . The appeals were signed by the applicant himself but indicated Mr ORG as their author . The addresses of both were stated .", "In decisions of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s appeals . The decisions were dispatched to the applicant \u2019s address by regular mail on DATE . The applicant allegedly received the decisions on DATE and on DATE he appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) .", "On DATE ORG declined to examine the merits of the applicant \u2019s appeals , considering that they had been lodged out of time . ORG noted that the appeals to ORG had been signed by the applicant himself and that he had been \u201c assisted \u201d by Mr ORG . In his appeal to ORG the applicant had explained that the letters from ORG had arrived in a post box which he did not empty DATE , inter alia due to his disability . Having been invited to explain this point further , the applicant had stated to ORG that in DATE he had not been expecting any mail which would have required action . As for ORG forthcoming decisions , he had expected to be notified thereof through his \u201c representative \u201d Mr ORG . ORG found that the applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence , inter alia of his allegation that he had received ORG decisions only on DATE . ORG concluded therefore that the applicant should be deemed to have received them on DATE , in accordance with the presumption stated in the relevant notice of appeal . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s further appeals should have been lodged at the latest on DATE .", "The applicant applied to ORG for restoration of the time - limit for appealing against ORG decisions . He further sought to have ORG decision nullified ( poistaa , undanr\u00f6ja ) and applied for cost - free proceedings with PERSON as his representative . Mr ORG was indicated as the drafter of the application to have the time - limit restored .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant \u2019s request for cost - free proceedings , noting that under law a grant to this effect was not possible in matters before ORG . ORG found no grounds for nullifying ORG decision or reinstating the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
