The ORG relied in particular on LAW of LAW ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber PERSON ) according to which a foreigner will lose his right to a prolongation of a residence permit if he breaches public order . The ORG then weighed the public interest in not renewing the applicant \u2019s residence permit in view of his criminal conviction with his interest in remaining with his family in GPE .", "The ORG considered in particular that the applicant had shown considerable \u201c criminal energy \u201d in that he had regularly committed offences of the same type while in GPE .
