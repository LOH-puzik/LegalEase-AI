They were represented before the Court by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the High Representative removed Mr GPE from his positions as Speaker of ORG and as president of a political party ( NORP demokratska stranka ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) . Mr GPE was also barred , until further notice , from holding any public or political - party positions and from running for election . The decision had immediate effect and did not require any further procedural steps . The main reasons given for the decision are reproduced here :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Despite its constitutionally mandated duty to fully co - operate with ORG [ that is , ORG for the Former GPE ] \u2013 which duty was impressed upon the Republika Srpska further by ORG referenced DATE indicted individuals remain at large within PERSON and have been and are presently assisted in evading justice by individuals in positions of authority and by institutions of a state and political character . That this state of affairs has continued for DATE following the end of the war without a single war criminal being arrested in the territory of ORG by the authorities of ORG , is a source of deep and abiding concern not only for the people of GPE and GPE but for the international community as a whole .", "For over DATE and throughout the war , ORG has held the reins of political power in ORG . The ORG \u2019s failure to apprehend those indicted individuals in flagrant disregard of GPE and GPE \u2019s obligations under international law is , therefore , a damning indictment of ORG \u2019s commitment to proper governance . Given its dubious legacy as the political party founded by and initially presided over by the chief ORG indictee at large , PERSON , it was doubly incumbent upon ORG to effect expiation and rehabilitation by proactively pursuing and bringing to book the erstwhile architects of its odious policies which so disfigured the polity . That it has not done so is a testament , at best , to its negligent abdication of governmental responsibility or , at worst , to its concerted will to obstruct peace implementation by clinging to vestiges ( and figures ) of its bankrupt past .", "As the leading member of the ORG occupying the highest position of responsibility within the party and upon solid information and belief , Mr. PERSON is culpable for the ORG \u2019s failure to purge the political landscape of conditions conducive to the sustenance to individuals indicted under LAW [ of the Statute of the ORG ] , as aforesaid .", "CARDINAL . Persons holding office as President of a political party are placed in a position of trust and confidence not only vis - \u00e0 - vis the members of that particular party but also vis - \u00e0 - vis the taxpayers insofar as political parties are funded , inter alia , from the budgets of the various level of ORG in GPE . As such , they are under an obligation to ensure that the financing of the parties is fully transparent and orderly and to take such step as are necessary to ensure that the party observes and adheres to both domestic law and international obligations and that funds from the ORG , whether private or public , are neither used for the sustenance of criminals or indicted war criminals or their support structures nor to help those evade capture .", "The Report of the Special Auditor for the Republika Srpska shows substantial discrepancies between ORG of DATE and the financial records of ORG offices across ORG . In particular , the Report of the Special Auditor highlights the lack of property lists , poor invoices supporting payments , incomplete payments of required social benefit and employment tax costs for ORG employees , unreported cash income , poorly documented and frequent withdrawals from petty cash , all of which constitute breaches of the PERSON .", "More importantly , the ORG shows a total failure of the central bodies of the ORG to assume their supervisory duties under LAW and to guarantee that the minimum necessary measures are in place for ensuring the effective and proper management and control of the party and its assets . The result of such failures of control amount to a delinquency of duty to ensure that these funds are secure from being used to sustain or assist indicted war criminals , and especially PERSON , the founder of the ORG , who , inter alia , has admitted in a letter that he is in contact with and has received assistance from ORG , a fact which is also supported by certain other evidence .", "For reasons mentioned above , PERSON had a special responsibility to sever the links of the party with the past by ensuring that no material assistance could be or was provided to such an individual . The findings of said Report compel the conclusion that , in the absence of control mechanisms , the ORG and its President are not in sufficient control of the funds of the ORG to preclude party bodies from providing any assistance or succour to its former President .", "On these grounds , the peace implementation is undermined as long as Mr GPE remains in office . Accordingly , he must be removed from office forthwith . \u201d", "On DATE the High Representative removed PERSON from his position in the ORG of GPE and from all his other public and political - party positions . Mr PERSON was also barred , until further notice , from holding any such positions and from running for election . The decision had immediate effect and did not require any further procedural steps . The following are the main reasons given for the decision :", "\u201c GPE has singularly failed to discharge its international obligation to bring closure to arguably the most lamentable chapter of its history . It has failed especially and egregiously in the territory of ORG to apprehend and deliver to just prosecution a number of persons indicted under LAW of the Statute of the ORG .", "PERSON failure could not have occurred without the active assistance of individuals and entities , or indeed without the general culture of both overt and secret complicity and of silence prevalent in the CARDINAL Entity of GPE where such individuals are believed to have found sanctuary , that is , [ in the ] PERSON .", "Despite its constitutionally mandated duty to fully co - operate with the ICTY \u2013 which duty was impressed upon the Republika Srpska further by ORG referenced DATE indicted individuals remain at large within ORG and have been and are presently assisted in evading justice by individuals in positions of authority and by institutions of a state and political character . That this state of affairs has continued for DATE following the end of the war is a source of deep and abiding concern not only for the people of GPE and GPE but for the international community as a whole .", "It now falls on the international community to redress this intolerable situation by initiating direct and sweeping action against those public - office holders of ORG who obstruct international law in the Entity . By dint of their nefarious conduct or failure to carry out their functional responsibilities while associated in differing capacities with public institutions , these individuals have demonstrated that they are not worthy of entrustment with public responsibility .", "Based on the foregoing and upon solid information and belief , it is deemed necessary to remove from public office ORG . ORG holds the office of Deputy Head ORG in GPE . PERSON is , whether through his actions or his failures to act an integral part of the common scheme within ORG to foster a culture of silence and deceit wherein war crime indictees are protected from justice .", "As a constituent of the current political culture within ORG , ORG is derivatively culpable for contributing to the failure to purge from the political landscape of conditions conducive to the provision of material support and sustenance to individuals indicted under LAW [ of the Statute of the ORG ] , as aforesaid . Such failings are inimical to stability and the rule of law . ORG , therefore , obstructs the process of peace implementation and must be removed from public office . The principles of proper governance and transparency , protection of the integrity and reputation of the institutions of GPE , and active support for the rule of law and for the international obligations of GPE \u2013 so essential to the peace implementation process \u2013 mandate this outcome . \u201d", "Following appeals of the applicants , on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG of the Republika Srpska , respectively , decided that they lacked jurisdiction to examine the High Representative \u2019s decisions mentioned above .", "The applicants then appealed to ORG On DATE ORG found that the domestic authorities had failed to secure an effective domestic remedy against the decisions of ORG in the ORG cases , as required by LAW and the equivalent provision of LAW . The domestic authorities were ordered to secure such a remedy . This decision ( no . AP CARDINAL ) was published in ORG no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE . It led to a vigorous response from the High Representative : on DATE he issued a decision removing any practical effect from ORG decision of DATE . The relevant part of the High Representative \u2019s decision reads as follows :", "In order to implement the Decision of the [ Constitutional ] Court [ no . ORG CARDINAL of DATE ] , the Presidency of GPE and GPE shall address to ORG , as ORG of the [ ORG ] , all matters raised in said Decision that ought to be considered by the international authorities referenced in the said Decision .", "Any step taken by any institution or authority in GPE in order to establish any domestic mechanism to review ORG issued pursuant to his international mandate shall be considered by ORG as an attempt to undermine the implementation of the civilian aspects of the [ Peace Agreement ] and shall be treated in itself as conduct undermining such implementation .", "Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any legislation in GPE , any proceeding instituted before any court in GPE , which challenges or takes issue in any way whatsoever with CARDINAL or more decisions of the High Representative , shall be declared inadmissible unless the High Representative expressly gives his prior consent .", "Any proceeding referred to in LAW shall be effectively and formally notified to the High Representative by the concerned court without delay .", "For the avoidance of any doubt or ambiguity , and taking into account the totality of the matters aforesaid , it is hereby specifically ordered and determined , in the exercise of the said international mandate of the High Representative and pursuant to its interpretation hereinunder and by virtue of the said LAW [ to FAC ] , that no liability is capable of being incurred on the part of ORG , and/or any of its subdivisions and/or any other authority in GPE , in respect of any loss or damage allegedly flowing , either directly or indirectly , from such LAW made pursuant to his or her international mandate , or at all .", "For the avoidance of doubt , it is hereby specifically declared and provided that the provisions of the Order contained herein are , as to each and every one of them , laid down by the High Representative pursuant to his international mandate and are not , therefore , justiciable by ORG or elsewhere , and no proceedings may be brought in respect of duties in respect thereof before any court whatsoever at any time hereafter .", "This Order shall enter into force immediately and shall be published without delay ... \u201d", "The relevant law and practice were outlined in GPE and Others v.
