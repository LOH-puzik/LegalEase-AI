On DATE the applicants set up the trade union ORG ( ORG ) to defend their interests and those of the other delivery staff who were under pressure from the company ORG to renounce their claim to salaried status . The applicants joined the union \u2019s executive committee .

Inside the newsletter were CARDINAL articles which vehemently denounced the fact that those CARDINAL individuals had testified in favour of the company P. in proceedings that the applicants had brought against their employer . The newsletter was distributed among the workers and displayed on the noticeboard of the trade union ORG which was located on the company \u2019s premises .", "CARDINAL .

The applicants challenged that decision before ORG no . CARDINAL , which , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed their claims and found that the dismissals were justified , in accordance with LAW and CARDINAL ( c ) of ORG . The tribunal took the view that the company \u2019s decision to dismiss the applicants had been based on a genuine and serious cause , namely the publication and display on a noticeboard inside the company of a cartoon with speech bubbles and CARDINAL articles which were offensive and impugned the dignity of the persons concerned . The first article , entitled \u201c Whose witnesses ? Theirs , of course \u201d , contained caricatures of A. and PERSON , showing them gagged by a handkerchief tied behind their heads , and the text underneath read as follows :", "\u201c We knew who they were and how they behaved , but we did n\u2019t know how far they were prepared to go in order to hold onto their seats and cushy jobs without doing anything .", "As employees of P. we earn our living by selling goods in the street .

It referred in its judgment to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression in the context of labour relations and to the fact that it was not unlimited . It found that the limits to this right had to be interpreted in accordance with the principle of good faith , which in labour relations had to involve respect for the interests of the employer and the minimum requirements of coexistence in a professional environment . The judgment reiterated the ORG case - law to the effect that the right to respect for freedom of expression was subject to limits derived from labour relations , since the contract of employment created a series of rights and reciprocal obligations that circumscribed the exercise of the right to respect for freedom of expression . For that reason , certain manifestations of this right that might be legitimate in other contexts were not legitimate in the context of labour relations , even though the requirement to act in good faith did not always imply a duty of loyalty to the point of subjecting the worker to the employer \u2019s interests .", "As to the newsletter \u2019s content , the tribunal took the view that the cartoon and speech bubbles on the cover , together with the articles inside , were offensive and exceeded the limits of freedom of expression and information , impugning the honour and dignity of the human resources manager and of delivery men A. and B. , and damaging the image of the company P. Lastly , it noted that the dismissal could not be declared null and void , since it was based on serious misconduct as provided for by law , and found that the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the judgment under appeal in so far as it concerned the applicants .", "The court referred , among other things , to the limits imposed by the principle of good faith between parties to a contract of employment and to the necessary balance that judicial decisions had to strike between a worker \u2019s obligations under the contract and his freedom of expression . The balancing exercise had to enable it to be determined whether or not the reaction of the company that dismissed the employee was legitimate . For the court , the publication of the offending drawing and articles had clearly been harmful to the dignity of the persons concerned and had overstepped the limits of admissible criticism , as the exercise of freedom of expression did not justify the use of insulting , offensive or vexatious expressions that went beyond the legitimate exercise of the right to criticise and clearly impugned the respectability of the persons concerned . The company P. had , moreover , duly shown that the ORG dismissal was not a measure of reprisal or punishment , but was based on a genuine , serious and sufficient cause for deciding to terminate their contracts of employment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law , seeking harmonisation of the relevant case - law . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed their appeal on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison , namely a judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , was not pertinent .", "CARDINAL . Relying on DATE ( right to a fair hearing ) of LAW , and on LAW and CARDINAL taken together ( freedom of expression and association ) , the applicants lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . In a decision of DATE , served on DATE , ORG found the appeal inadmissible for lack of constitutional content . The decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ... Firstly ... there is not enough evidence to show that the [ appellants\u2019 ] dismissal was an act of reprisal on the part of the respondent company because of the judicial proceedings they had brought against it to assert their rights ... Secondly , as to the [ alleged ] interference with trade - union freedom guaranteed by LAW ( this complaint incorporating the ORG complaint under LAW in so far as they alleged discrimination on trade - union grounds ) , this is inadmissible as [ the appellants ] have not provided sufficient evidence to show that the company \u2019s action was intended to restrict , hamper or prevent the exercise of their right to freedom of association , on account of their union membership or activities in a trade union . In line with what this court has repeatedly said , such evidence does not consist of a mere allegation of a constitutional violation but must be sufficient for it to be inferred that the violation could have been constituted ... which is not the case here , since the circumstances alleged do not give rise to any suspicion as to the potential violation in question . In their allegations , the appellants have simply expressed their disagreement with the decisions rendered by the courts below , which found in decisions giving reasons and not being manifestly unreasonable that they had committed the acts of which the company had accused them in their letters of dismissal .", "Thirdly , there has not been a breach of LAW taken together with LAW ( a ) , in the form of an infringement of the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression in the context of their union activity , since this fundamental right does not encompass any right to insult others . As the Court held recently in judgment no . PERSON of DATE ( legal ground CARDINAL ) , reiterating its case - law , although the LAW does not prohibit the use of hurtful , embarrassing or vituperative expressions in every circumstance , the constitutional or lack of veracity , are offensive or defamatory and are not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question . The application of that jurisprudence to the present case leads the ORG to the conclusion that the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression has not been infringed , since they used that right in an excessive manner by means of value judgments expressed through cartoons and comments that were offensive and humiliating for the persons concerned and impugned their honour and reputation . [ Those cartoons and comments ] were not necessary for others to form an opinion about the facts of which the appellants wished to complain , and were therefore gratuitous and not necessary for the exercise of freedom of expression in a trade - union context . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

While the imposition of general censorship is primarily a matter that relates to civil liberties rather than to trade - union rights , the censorship of the press during an industrial dispute may have a direct effect on the conduct of the dispute and may prejudice the parties by not allowing the true facts surrounding the dispute to become known . ( See the DATE Digest , para . CARDINAL . )", "CARDINAL . When issuing their publications , trade - union organisations should have regard , in the interests of the development of the trade - union movement , to the principles enunciated by ORG at its CARDINAL session ( DATE ) for the protection of the freedom and independence of the trade - union movement and the safeguarding of its fundamental task , which is to ensure the social and economic well - being of all workers . ( See the DATE Digest , para . CARDINAL . )", "CARDINAL . In a case in which a trade - union newspaper , in its allusions and accusations against the government , seemed to have exceeded the admissible limits of controversy , the ORG pointed out that trade - union publications should refrain from extravagance of language . The primary role of publications of this type should be to deal with matters essentially relating to the defence and furtherance of the interests of the ORG members in particular and with labour questions in general . ORG , nevertheless , recognised that it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between what is political and what is strictly trade union in character . It pointed out that these CARDINAL notions overlap , and it is inevitable and sometimes normal for trade - union publications to take a stand on questions having political aspects , as well as on strictly economic or social questions . ( See the CARDINAL Digest , para . CARDINAL . ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . The American Convention on Human Rights has a special Additional Protocol concerning economic , social and cultural rights , the \u201c Protocol of GPE \u201d .

No one may be compelled to belong to a trade union . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its ORG OC-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG emphasised the fundamental nature of freedom of expression for the existence of a democratic society , stressing among other things that freedom of expression was a sine qua non for the development of trade unions . It found as follows ( paragraph CARDINAL of the Opinion ) :", "\u201c Freedom of expression is a cornerstone upon which the very existence of a NORP society rests . It is indispensable for the formation of public opinion . It is also a conditio sine qua non for the development of political parties , trade unions , scientific and cultural societies and , in general , those who wish to influence the public . It represents , in short , the means that enable the community , when exercising its options , to be sufficiently informed . Consequently , it can be said that a society that is not well informed is not a society that is truly free . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Comparative - law research has shown that the disciplinary powers of employers in the member ORG are very diverse . There is a convergence of legal systems among the CARDINAL countries examined : they all provide for and organise employees\u2019 freedom of expression and trade - union freedom , usually by means of norms of constitutional value , or , where that is not the case , by legislative regulations . Employees serving as representatives benefit from special protection to help them discharge their duties . The regulations in all countries , in order to reconcile the exercise of this right with the essential rights and freedoms of others , fix rules providing for penalties in cases of abuse of the right to freedom of expression . The powers vested in employers allow , if necessary , for the exercise of disciplinary action against an employee or staff member whose conduct can be characterised as improper exercise of his freedom of expression . The case - law in such matters is consistent and shows that there is a systematic examination of proportionality between the dismissal and the conduct on which it is based .", "CARDINAL . The domestic - law instruments provide for the punishment of any conduct by an employee that is capable of infringing the rights and freedoms of others .", "The relevant rules may , firstly , be laid down by LAW , or by provisions concerning the possibility of bringing an action to establish liability . In most cases , criminal notions such as defamation , damage to honour or reputation , or insults will enable the person claiming to be a victim of such infringement to bring proceedings to establish the liability of the person who made the comments at issue .", "Rules in ORG or norms applicable to public servants will also govern the exercise of freedom of expression of staff members , and if necessary provide for the punishment of any abuse . Similar limitations may be imposed on public officials , whether or not they have \u201c civil servant \u201d status .", "CARDINAL . Disciplinary authority is CARDINAL of the essential prerogatives of the employer , whether private or public . In this connection , employers have a broad discretion to impose the sanction that they consider the best adapted to the accusations against the employee ; the scale of possible sanctions encompasses the power to dismiss a person who has seriously compromised the interests of the company or the public service . In parallel , this power of dismissal is accompanied by a prohibition on dismissing employees on grounds relating to trade - union activity . A measure of dismissal may be based on misconduct or on a legitimate ground . In the first case , it relates to DATE identified \u2013 form of conduct . In the second , the conduct is considered in general terms .", "CARDINAL . The proportionality of a measure of dismissal in relation to the conduct of the employee concerned underlies all the legislation analysed .", "CARDINAL . The applicable law in the GPE examined shows that any abuse of the freedom of expression afforded to employees or public servants is always regarded as a reprehensible fact capable of justifying disciplinary measures that could go as far as dismissal . For that purpose , factual elements of an objective nature are taken into account , such as : ( i ) the seriousness of the misconduct ; and ( ii ) the characterisation of the comments , the extent of their publication , and also certain subjective elements . The latter include the personal situation of the employee , any abuse of freedom of expression and the question whether the conduct falls outside \u201c normal \u201d trade - union activity .", "CARDINAL . In all the countries studied , the general rules are clear and allow the employee \u2019s right to freedom of expression to be balanced against the rights and prerogatives of the employer . Their implementation is more problematic , since a restriction on a fundamental right can only be accepted if , having regard to the measure decided , it is proportionate to the aim pursued . Only through a case - by - case approach is it possible to grasp the substance of the jurisprudential solution adopted in each type of situation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
