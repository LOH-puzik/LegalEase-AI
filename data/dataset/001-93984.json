He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant , along with CARDINAL adult codefendants , was convicted of the murder of a DATE girl , who had been held captive and tortured for DATE before being killed . Being under DATE at the time of the offence , the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her ORG \u2019s pleasure under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . Following his conviction the applicant applied for leave to appeal . On DATE leave to appeal was refused by ORG . This decision was affirmed by the full court on DATE .", "In his report dated DATE , the trial judge acknowledged that the applicant , who was much younger , had been corrupted by his co - defendants , but found nonetheless that he had played an active part in the torture and the killing . Having recommended a tariff of DATE for the CARDINAL adult co - defendants , he recommended that detention for DATE was necessary in the applicant \u2019s case to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence for the offence . On DATE the Lord Chief Justice agreed with this recommendation , in view of the exceptional gravity of the case . The Secretary of ORG accepted the proposal and set the tariff which was to be applied in the applicant \u2019s case at DATE .", "Following the ORG \u2019s judgments in GPE v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , both ORG CARDINAL-IX , which held that the setting of a tariff for a juvenile detained at Her ORG pleasure was a sentencing exercise that engaged LAW and therefore should not be done by ministers , the Secretary of ORG announced to ORG on DATE that he would bring forward legislation to provide for tariffs to be set by the trial judge in open court , in the same way as they were already being set for adults subject to discretionary life sentences . For juveniles still in detention who had had their tariffs set by the Secretary of ORG , a transitional scheme would be put in place , under which the Lord Chief Justice would review each case in the light of written representations from the detainee , and make a recommendation regarding the tariff , which the Secretary of ORG would adopt .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors made representations to the Secretary of ORG to enable his tariff to be reconsidered by the Lord Chief Justice . It was submitted that the \u201c welfare principle \u201d had never been considered or applied in the setting of the applicant \u2019s original tariff of DATE , that a tariff of that length was excessive , that it was appropriate to allow a substantial discount in tariff to compensate for the lack of periodic review and that in the applicant \u2019s case it should be set at DATE . Should this not be accepted , the applicant \u2019s solicitors requested an oral hearing of the case , relying on LAW case law .", "On DATE the Lord Chief Justice issued a Practice Statement ( Juveniles : Murder Tariff ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , in which he explained the procedure that he proposed to follow when he was undertaking a fresh review of tariffs for persons , such as the applicant , sentenced as juveniles and currently detained at Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure , as well as in fresh cases pending the necessary change in the law :", "\u201c Before I make a recommendation to the Home Secretary , in both new and existing cases , I shall invite written representations from the GPE legal advisers and also from ORG who may include representations on behalf of GPE families . ...", "Before the first such cases are put before me to make a recommendation to the ORG Secretary , it is appropriate for the general principles which will guide me in recommending tariffs to be made public . This is because it is right that the process by which tariffs are set should be open to public scrutiny . When making recommendations to the ORG Secretary in such cases , I will announce my reasons in open court after taking into account any written representations I receive . \u201d", "No mention was made in this Practice Statement of any provision for the making of oral submissions to the Lord Chief Justice before he made his recommendation to the Home Secretary . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the Secretary of ORG , noting with concern that no decision had yet been made in respect of the applicant \u2019s tariff . They said that the delay was adversely affecting the applicant \u2019s progress through the prison system and had direct implications for his potential future release on licence . They asked for confirmation that a decision would be forthcoming immediately , reserving the right to issue proceedings if they did not receive a reply within DATE .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG sent a memorandum to the applicant stating that the Lord Chief Justice had decided to consider representations from ORG on behalf of the victim \u2019s family and enclosing copies of the documents from ORG and prison reports that would be before him when he considered the tariff . The applicant was informed that any comments that he or his legal representatives might have on this material or on a report covering his most recent period of imprisonment were to be sent to the Secretary of ORG within DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors submitted further representations to the Secretary of ORG , including comments on the material appended to the above memorandum , for inclusion with the papers for the Lord Chief Justice . Reference was made to the detailed representations which had previously been made on his behalf and it was again submitted that a tariff period of DATE was appropriate in his case .", "On DATE the Lord Chief Justice delivered his decision on the applicant \u2019s tariff and his reason for it in open court . He concluded his statement with these words :", "\u201c Although I do not question the tariff which was set , [ DATE ] has made significant progress in detention and it is possible to recognise this by reducing the tariff to DATE . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant was given a copy of a transcript of this decision and informed that the Secretary of ORG had accepted the Lord Chief Justice \u2019s recommendation .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the Secretary of ORG expressing their concern at the fact that the issues which they had identified in their representations , concerning in particular the need to take account of future welfare , had not been addressed . No mention was made in this letter of the request that had been made in the original representations for an oral hearing in the event that the applicant \u2019s tariff was not fixed at DATE . They submitted further representations on the applicant \u2019s behalf on DATE . By a letter dated DATE they were informed that these representations had been rejected .", "On DATE the applicant was given permission to seek judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . It was contended that , in accordance with LAW , the applicant was entitled to an oral hearing before his tariff was set and that the advice which had been given to the Secretary of ORG was defective in that the Lord Chief Justice had failed to have regard to the applicant \u2019s welfare when deciding on the appropriate tariff . There does not appear to have been any complaint under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG taken together concerning the differences in the procedure applied to adults and juveniles convicted of murder .", "On DATE ORG held that the Lord Chief Justice had been under no obligation to afford the applicant an oral hearing and , alternatively , that , if he was entitled to an oral hearing , he had waived that entitlement : [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) . The court also held that the Lord Chief Justice had paid due regard to the applicant \u2019s welfare .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG together with an appeal by the Secretary of ORG in the case of another prisoner detained at Her ORG pleasure , dismissed his appeal : R ( PERSON ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ CARDINAL ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL . It concluded that the applicant had not waived any right to an oral hearing , but that there was no such right .", "The applicant was granted leave to appeal to ORG . In a judgment delivered on DATE ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "Lord PERSON observed that the procedure at issue was no ordinary sentencing exercise . It was procedurally unique , and more closely analogous to an appeal than to a first - instance decision . The applicant \u2019s solicitors had been able to put his case to the Lord Chief Justice and to respond to any adverse points . The Lord Chief Justice could have held a hearing had he deemed it necessary , but if this would not contribute anything of value to the procedure then there were strong administrative reasons not to do so .", "Lord Hope observed , first , that the applicant had had a fair and public hearing at his trial . The proceedings now under scrutiny were part of a transitional scheme . This did not involve trying new facts . Rather , the task of the Lord Chief Justice was to decide where on the scale to put the applicant , in light of the going rate for the setting of tariffs for adult murderers , the age of the applicant at the time of the murder , and his progress in custody . It was a highly unusual process that could best be described as CARDINAL of review . Most of the relevant issues had already been determined before the case came before the Lord Chief Justice , in particular the applicant \u2019s part in the murder . The recommendations of the trial judge and the then Lord Chief Justice , which were based on the evidence led in public at the trial , could not be ignored . The object of the procedure was :", "\u201c to review the appellant \u2019s behaviour after conviction , the reports of those who had been responsible for his case at ORG and the representations that had been received from the victim \u2019s family . He also had to review the representations that had been received from the appellant \u2019s solicitors . But it is important to note that he was not being required to make findings of fact based on this material . What he was being required to do was to make an assessment of the extent to which an adjustment of the tariff was needed in the light of these further factors . \u201d", "He attached particular importance to the fact that the applicant was not seeking to appear personally before the Lord Chief Justice , but simply requesting that his lawyers be allowed to present their arguments on his behalf orally . Since they had already been given ample opportunity to make their case in writing , he considered it unlikely that an oral hearing would have added anything . All the signs were that it would have been a formality .", "In Lord Hope \u2019s view , although the procedure could have been conducted by a ORG judge , there was good reason to entrust the task to the Lord Chief Justice , whose role was to ensure fairness and consistency in the fixing of the minimum periods that life prisoners must serve . He continued :", "\u201c The magnitude of the task that he was being asked to perform must not be underestimated . This was [ ... ] a very substantial burden , to be performed in addition to his existing heavy judicial duties as Lord Chief Justice . He had to have regard to the public interest as well as the interests of each detainee , and he had to have regard to the requirement that this exercise had to be carried out within a reasonable time as article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Convention requires . There is no doubt that if he had undertaken to conduct each one of these proceedings orally it would greatly have enlarged his task , and inevitably it would have caused much delay . \u201d", "As all the relevant material had been disclosed to the applicant \u2019s lawyers , and sufficient opportunity had been given to make written representations , it had not been shown what good purpose would be served by an oral hearing . The Lord Chief Justice could in any event allow this if he felt it to be necessary . Finally , the public nature of the procedure was ensured by the fact that it was based on a published practice statement , and in every case the Lord Chief Justice personally delivered his decision on the tariff in open court .", "The provisions relating to juveniles detained \u201c during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure \u201d at the time of the applicant \u2019s conviction are set out in T. v. the GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE .", "All persons detained on this basis who were sentenced prior to DATE became entitled to a fresh review of their tariffs as detailed in Part A above . All such persons who were sentenced on or after DATE had their tariff fixed by the trial judge , with an appeal against the tariff period to ORG : section CARDINAL of ORG and LAW DATE , which inserted section CARDINALA into ORG ( Sentencing ) Act DATE . The current statutory basis for setting of minimum terms of imprisonment for cases of murder is LAW DATE ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL and Schedules CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
