THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Nigeria)", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was born in DATE , claims to have arrived in GPE at DATE . However , there is no official record of his presence until DATE , when he was DATE . He first came to the notice of the Secretary of ORG for ORG on DATE , when the family court sought clarification of the applicant \u2019s immigration status , while considering an application for a residence order in respect of the applicant by his aunt .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s aunt made an application for indefinite leave to remain in GPE , on the basis of her long stay , and with the applicant listed as her dependant , on DATE . While this application was under consideration , a further application for indefinite leave was made on behalf of the applicant by ORG . This application stated that the applicant had been thrown out by his aunt on DATE and placed in foster care . It also mentioned that the applicant claimed to have been the victim of beatings by his aunt and her boyfriend since DATE . Indefinite leave to remain was granted to the applicant , outside the immigration rules , on DATE . The applicant lived in foster care from DATE until he was DATE , when he began to live alone in council accommodation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted on DATE , at DATE , of CARDINAL counts of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply . He pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in DATE , in which the applicant had been shot . He was sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , and on DATE was notified of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s intention to deport him . The Secretary of ORG found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in GPE since DATE . His aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at DATE , and the first official record of his presence was when he was DATE . Even allowing for his long stay in GPE , DATE had been with valid leave . It was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in GPE , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . It was not accepted that he had family life in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to deport him and his appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The ORG noted the applicant \u2019s previous criminal record : he had been convicted of possession of Class A and Class B drugs in DATE ; handling stolen goods in DATE ; and possession of Class C drugs in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted his claim to be in a relationship of some years\u2019 duration , but observed that he had never mentioned his girlfriend in previous applications to ORG , and that he and his girlfriend had given mutually inconsistent evidence at the hearing . It was not therefore accepted that he was in a serious or permanent relationship . He had no contact with the aunt with whom he had previously lived , but had another aunt in GPE whom he claimed was a surrogate mother to him . However , the ORG found that he could not be as close to this aunt as he claimed , given that she had not taken him in when he had been thrown out , and that it was clear from her evidence at the hearing that she had been unaware of his criminal conviction . The applicant \u2019s relationship with his CARDINAL - brother in GPE was found to have been similarly exaggerated . The ORG concluded that the applicant did not have any protected family life in GPE . With regard to his private life , while it was accepted that he had been in the country since a young age and had been educated there , as well as gaining some work experience , it was not considered that these ties were sufficiently strong to render his deportation an interference with his private life . It appeared that his mother still lived in GPE and , even if contact had been lost , as claimed by the applicant , there was no reason why it could not be re - established . Whilst the applicant would have practical difficulties in relocating to GPE , he could re - establish his private life there . The ORG took into account the case of GPE v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII , in finding that , on balance , and having due regard to the public interest , the applicant \u2019s deportation was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . A deportation order against the applicant was signed on DATE . The applicant made an application to have the order revoked on human rights grounds , which was rejected by the Secretary of ORG on DATE on the basis that all matters raised by the applicant had previously been considered by ORG . An application for judicial review of this decision was refused on DATE . ORG , in refusing the application , stated that the applicant had no family life in GPE , and that the interference with his private life was proportionate . The applicant did not renew his application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was taken into immigration detention on DATE and directions for his deportation to GPE were set on CARDINAL DATE for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant sought interim measures from ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent his deportation . He submitted with his application a report from a specialist psychiatric registrar dated DATE , which stated that the applicant had attempted suicide on CARDINAL DATE , after being notified of the refusal of his human rights application by the Secretary of ORG . He had then been held as an in - patient until DATE . The report also stated that the applicant had continued to express feelings of despair throughout his in - patient treatment . He was described as suffering from moderate depression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Acting President of the Fourth Section decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that it was in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should not be expelled to GPE pending the ORG \u2019s decision . Rule CARDINAL was initially applied by the Acting President for a period of DATE , in order to give the Government the opportunity to comment on the applicant \u2019s mental health history and to state whether any special measures had been put in place to alleviate the risk of suicide prior to and during his proposed removal .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the Government informed the ORG that they had not previously been aware of the applicant \u2019s attempted suicide , but had now considered the psychiatric report of DATE . As regards the logistics of the applicant \u2019s removal , the ORG stated that all appropriate measures to protect the applicant from risk were already in place at the centre at which he was detained . Trained members of staff were aware of the applicant \u2019s situation and the applicant was under constant supervision . As to the risk during removal , the contractor effecting removal would be informed and a suitable escort would be provided , including a medical escort if deemed necessary . The applicant would be escorted up until the point of arrival in GPE . The Government also considered that there were sufficient mental health facilities in GPE , which would be available to the applicant if needed . The Government therefore invited the ORG to lift the interim measure which had been indicated in respect of the applicant . However , on DATE , the Acting President decided to prolong until further notice the interim measure under Rule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant notified the authorities in the immigration detention centre that he had taken an overdose of paracetamol on DATE . He was assessed by the medical team and found only to have taken a few tablets . No further concerns as to his well - being appear to have been raised and the applicant was released from immigration detention on DATE . He does not claim to have made any further attempts at suicide .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against this decision , inter alia , on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim . The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered . The submissions will only be significantly different if the content :", "( i ) had not already been considered ; and", "( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , created a realistic prospect of success , notwithstanding its rejection . \u201d", "A fresh claim , if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of ORG , and if refused , gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits . If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim , their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , ORG considered the case of a GPE national suffering from depression and post - traumatic stress disorder , who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused , and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to GPE . Lord Justice PERSON , delivering the judgment of the court , held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of LAW in a suicide case was , as in other LAW cases involving expulsion , whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person , if returned , would face a real risk of torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to expand upon the nature of the test . It required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . Secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching LAW . The court also found , thirdly , that because of the \u201c foreign \u201d nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of LAW would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving ORG but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . Fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under LAW Fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach LAW in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving ORG , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . A fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of LAW . Finally , ORG also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and/or receiving ORG had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . The existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of LAW as a result of removal .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in CARDINAL stages , namely , in GPE , in transit , and in the receiving ORG . The threshold for LAW of the risk in the receiving ORG was higher than it was in respect of the risk in GPE . In the case of the particular appellant , ORG found that ORG had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in GPE would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the Secretary of ORG would provide appropriately qualified escorts and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant \u2019s fears of return to GPE were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that ORG , the risk of suicide in GPE would not reach the very high threshold of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
