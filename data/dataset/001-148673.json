In his statement , he explained that on DATE of the attack he had been at home in his flat and had drunk CARDINAL litres of cider in the course of DATE . At various times during DATE he had been in the company of X. , B. and M.

Later in the evening , X. , NORP and PERSON had left , although the victim explained , \u201c I do n\u2019t know times and my memory is vague \u201d . He then recalled answering a knock on the door , following which CARDINAL men had entered the LOC by force and attacked him . The victim said :", "\u201c The bigger male out of the CARDINAL started punching me to the face , followed by a man who was on crutches . I was getting punched by all of them and I eventually fell to the floor . I was dragged and pulled into the bedroom where they saw the television and hi - fi system .

Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were subsequently charged , together with another man , NORP , with causing P.R. grievous bodily harm with intent .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution case was that PERSON and PERSON had burgled another flat in the victim \u2019s block of flats , and had taken the stolen property to the victim \u2019s flat . B. and PERSON had pleaded guilty to that burglary . The prosecution alleged that the attack on the victim had occurred when PERSON and PERSON PERSON had gone with NORP , the owner of stolen property , to recover it . They claimed that Mr PERSON was the \u201c bigger male \u201d and NORP was the \u201c male on crutches \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The defence case was that although Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON had gone to the victim \u2019s flat to help recover D. \u2019s property , neither had been involved in the attack .", "CARDINAL . In a statement to the police , PERSON said that the victim had been very drunk , and that he ( Mr PERSON ) had collected the television and returned it to NORP \u2019s flat . He had not seen the attack on the victim .", "CARDINAL . In his statement to the police , Mr PERSON said that he had been drinking with NORP and PERSON . They had gone back to NORP \u2019s flat at TIME and discovered that it had been burgled . NORP had asked if they would go with him and recover what had been stolen , as he had been told where it was . They had gone to the victim \u2019s flat at TIME The door had been opened by a man whom the others had pushed out of the way . They had seen the stolen property .

He had been aware that the victim was getting punched and had not wanted to have anything to do with it . He did not know what happened after that . He had put the DVD player in the lift and returned to the flat . At that point the victim was still lying on the floor and there was blood everywhere . He had not hit the victim . He had not expected them to do what they had done .", "CARDINAL . Another resident of the block of flats , J. , made a statement to the police suggesting that PERSON might have been involved in the assault on the victim . That statement was disclosed to the defence . The defence was ultimately based on the assertion that PERSON was the perpetrator .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution applied to read the victim \u2019s statement at trial , under LAW ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The application was opposed by the applicants under section CARDINAL of ORG \u201c PACE \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the ground that it would be unfair to admit the statement which constituted the only admissible evidence of participation against them , as there could be no opportunity to challenge it and it was inherently unreliable . The applicants relied on the admission by the victim that he had drunk a quantity of alcohol ; on his statement that \u201c I do n\u2019t know times and my memory is vague \u201d ; and on the fact that the description given of the first male did not fit Mr Blackmore .", "CARDINAL . The judge ruled on DATE that the statement should be admitted . He found that the condition in DATE ) was satisfied ( namely , that the witness was dead ) ; and that the fact that the statement was the principal evidence against the defendants did not make its admission unfair . He relied in particular on the fact that the defendants had all admitted being present in the victim \u2019s flat together to recover D. \u2019s property ; that the defendants were going to call PERSON to give evidence that PERSON had been responsible for the attack ; and that the jury could be given directions as to any difficulties faced by the defence on account of ORG statement being read .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the trial commenced before a judge and a jury . D. subsequently pleaded guilty . The jury in the trial were later discharged for unrelated reasons and a retrial was ordered . A second trial commenced in DATE , but the jury were again discharged following an issue in relation to the forensic evidence . A third trial commenced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution relied on other evidence , besides the statement of the victim . X. , who had spent DATE drinking with the victim , gave evidence to the effect that P.R. had been tipsy but not drunk on the afternoon of the attack . He also testified that he had subsequently visited the victim in hospital , where the victim had indicated that he had been attacked by CARDINAL people but that he could not really remember who had attacked him . CARDINAL witnesses gave evidence that the victim had told them that NORP and his friends had attacked him . There was also scientific evidence that the blood on the television matched that of the victim . Forensic evidence suggested that the assault had commenced at the front door and the hallway and then moved to the entrance of the bedroom . There was pooling of blood at the entrance to the bedroom , as if the source of the blood had lain there for some time . Blood on NORP \u2019s crutches matched the victim \u2019s DNA profile . Evidence was also led to show that P.R. had shown no fear of PERSON when meeting him after the attack .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON gave evidence in his defence . He said that he had been drinking all day with NORP and Mr PERSON . In TIME they had returned to NORP \u2019s flat and realised that it had been burgled . They had gone downstairs to another flat and he had followed NORP inside . He had seen a man staggering in the hallway . NORP had then pointed out the items that had been stolen . Mr PERSON had picked up the television and returned to NORP \u2019s flat . He had not seen an assault and had not seen any blood . He , PERSON PERSON and NORP had returned to the pub .", "CARDINAL . Mr Blackmore did not give evidence at trial .", "CARDINAL . P.R. \u2019s neighbour , PERSON , was called to give evidence for the defence . He testified that he had heard some shouting and banging on TIME of the attack and had seen PERSON banging on doors . Later he had seen PERSON holding P.R. in a headlock ; another person had been with him . He had closed the door but had heard a lot of shouting and noise for TIME . His answers in cross - examination were not consistent with his previous statement to the police .", "CARDINAL . The judge , on Mr PERSON \u2019s application , admitted evidence of PERSON \u2019s previous convictions as evidence of a propensity for violence . The judge refused to admit evidence of the previous convictions of PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The judge made clear the importance of P.R. \u2019s witness statement at the outset of his review of the evidence in the summing up to the jury , noting :", "\u201c The prosecution case here depends , does it not , upon the evidence of [ the victim ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He explained to the jury that the victim \u2019s evidence was not agreed , that the defence had not had the opportunity of testing it by crossexamination and that it would carry less weight than evidence from a witness who had come to court and had testified . He set out examples of areas in the victim \u2019s statement which had not been cross - examined .", "CARDINAL . TIME after the jury had retired , they asked to see the victim \u2019s statement ; the judge told them that they could not see it but reminded them of its contents by reading it to them .", "CARDINAL . The jury subsequently returned unanimous guilty verdicts in respect of both PERSON and Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the victim , PERSON , was at home alone in the house she shared with her partner , ORG , preparing to take a bath . CARDINAL men entered the house and stole various items , including jewellery . After threatening the victim with a knife , they kidnapped her by taking her away in the car they had come in . A black FAC car owned by her partner was also taken at the same time .", "CARDINAL . The victim subsequently made a formal statement to the police , containing a statement of truth in the terms outlined above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , giving an account of events on DATE . She stated that , as she had been about to bathe , CARDINAL masked men had entered her bedroom ; CARDINAL had a knife . She had been ordered downstairs where there were CARDINAL other men . They had asked where the jewellery , money and car keys were and she had told them about her partner \u2019s safe in his wardrobe . CARDINAL of the men had then taken her to the car they had come in and had driven off . She assumed that the other CARDINAL men had taken ORG \u2019s car .", "CARDINAL . The men in her car had then asked for ORG \u2019s telephone number , which she gave them , and they had telephoned him . She described the telephone conversations that followed and explained that the men had told her that they wanted QUANTITY before they would let her go . She had also been told that she should not go to the police because she would know what would happen to her if she did . She had been warned not to look at her captors , and had taken the threats to mean that they would kill her if she saw their faces . She said that she had been punched twice in the back of the head , which she understood to have been intended to show her that her kidnappers were serious about hurting her . She had heard her captors say that if they did not get money they would cut off her fingers and toes . CARDINAL of the men had said something about putting her in a vice . She was eventually put in the boot of the car for a while before being dropped off unharmed . After unsuccessful attempts to telephone FAC from various locations , she had eventually spoken to her father who had picked her up . She had arrived home shortly after TIME and the police had arrived TIME . In her statement , she did not identify any person as having participated in her kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a short statement setting out his account of the ransom demands and how the kidnappers had threatened to cut off the victim \u2019s fingers if he did not pay the ransom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was arrested in ORG \u2019s stolen car after having been seen on ORG . A knife was found in the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON made a further police statement . She was shown the knife which had been recovered from the car in which Mr PERSON had been arrested and asked if she had seen it before . She confirmed that it was the knife used to threaten her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police officer visited ORG and the victim , in the presence of the latter \u2019s father , and told them \u201c in no uncertain terms \u201d that the men the police were seeking were dangerous and that it was not beyond them to use guns . He gave as an illustration the use of guns against a couple who had fled and had been murdered in the village to which they had been relocated . He spoke to them about moving .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the victim and ORG made police statements to the effect that they wished to retract their previous statements and did not want the police to pursue a prosecution , as they were scared for the safety of their families .", "CARDINAL . Mr Marquis and PERSON were charged with kidnapping . The prosecution relied on other evidence , apart from the victim \u2019s statement .", "CARDINAL . First , PERSON was seen with other masked men on the ORG cameras entering the victim \u2019s house on TIME CARDINAL DATE . That evidence was not disputed at trial although when initially questioned PERSON had not accepted that he had been to the house or that the person shown on the ORG was him . It was also not disputed that ORG \u2019s car had been taken from outside the house shortly thereafter . The telephone records proving that ORG had subsequently been contacted on his telephone from the victim \u2019s telephone and that a number of calls were made from Mr Marquis\u2019 telephone to ORG were undisputed .", "CARDINAL . There was evidence that PERSON had spent TIME CARDINAL DATE at a hotel and that a woman of his acquaintance , GPE , had gone to the hotel to meet him that night . She gave evidence that she had been told to park her car between a red van and \u201c my XCARDINAL \u201d . When she had gone to Mr Marquis\u2019 room , she had been introduced to a man ( whom Mr ORG refused to identify ) . She had seen a pink telephone which was identical to the CARDINAL owned by the victim . It was accepted that the telephone used to call ORG TIME was also used by PERSON to contact GPE DATE and DATE . A text to her from PERSON at TIME on DATE stated :", "\u201c Hey do n\u2019t let no - one know where I am , you know . Remember I know your address and that . You should have just said you were going . I ai n\u2019t bothered , but if I get arrested , I know it \u2019s you \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP CCTV evidence showed PERSON at the wheel of ORG \u2019s car twice on DATE ; on the second occasion the car had false registration plates .", "CARDINAL . There was also evidence that a man describing himself as PERSON had rented a room at the hotel where Mr Marquis had stayed on DATE and had described himself as the driver of a black ORG XCARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s defence was that there had been no kidnapping . He claimed that the victim and her partner had been involved in an attempted insurance fraud . Mr PERSON denied any involvement in any kidnapping that there may have been .", "CARDINAL . The victim and ORG did not attend court on DATE in compliance with a witness summons that had been issued for the trial . The victim was arrested on DATE and brought to court . On giving an explanation to the judge that , although she was frightened , she would have attended court but had been told not to attend by Witness Support , she was bailed to appear on DATE . She was warned that if she did not attend a warrant for her arrest would be issued and she could be imprisoned for DATE . The trial was fixed for CARDINAL DATE . ORG later surrendered into custody and was also bailed to appear .", "CARDINAL . The victim made a further statement on DATE which was video recorded . In it she said that she had made the retraction statement of CARDINAL DATE because she was scared . She thought that those who had kidnapped her were dangerous and she was very frightened . She said :", "\u201c Since I was kidnapped , I have found that the incident has altered my life . I am petrified . I find myself looking over my shoulder and wondering if the people responsible will come and get me . I feel like this because at the time they said to me , \u2018 You PERSON better not go to the police \u2018 cos you know what will happen if you do\u2019 .", "I perceived this as a direct threat against me and I just do n\u2019t know what they are capable of , considering that they forced their way into my house and kidnapped me . I perceive them as very dangerous people .", "As such I am terrified all of the time and find myself very tearful , and I am almost not sleeping at TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She added that the police had made her more frightened when they told her that she and ORG had to move . She did not feel she could leave her house for fear of what might happen to her and her anxiety had been increased by the court case .", "CARDINAL . She confirmed that the police had explained the possibility of using special measures at trial . She said that her evidence would be \u201c greatly enhanced \u201d if she could speak from behind a screen in the court room . Finally , she said that she had not been subjected to any threats directly or indirectly from those responsible for kidnapping her , but that she still felt scared .", "CARDINAL . G.P. made a statement on video on DATE . In his statement he referred to the police visit in DATE and the advice to \u201c leave town \u201d , which he said had \u201c really frightened \u201d them . He said that he had tried to get in touch , through a friend , with a certain \u201c Bijer \u201d because another friend had recognised the number which had called him on TIME of the kidnapping as that of \u201c Bijer \u201d . \u201c Bijer \u201d had rung him , but it was clear that this was not the person who had rung him on the telephone on DATE . \u201c Bijer \u201d had explained to him that he had sold the telephone DATE . ORG said that he was not scared to give evidence but just did not want to , in case there were reprisal attacks .", "CARDINAL . Neither the victim nor ORG attended court on DATE . The victim \u2019s father \u2019s evidence to the trial judge was that she had packed her bags and fled DATE .", "DATE . On DATE , the prosecution applied to read the statements of PERSON and ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the DATE Act on the grounds that they would not give evidence through fear ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The applicants argued that the statements could not be admitted as the fear did not fall within the meaning of the DATE Act as it had not been generated by any action of theirs or their associates , but by what the police officer had said on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial judge handed down his ruling on the admission of the statements . He noted , in respect of PERSON \u2019s video statement of DATE :", "\u201c I have seen a portion of that tape and it is perfectly clear to me the witness was petrified , genuinely really distressed , breaking down into tears . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge heard evidence from the victim \u2019s father and the police officer who had spoken to her on DATE . He observed that in her witness statement of DATE , PERSON had explained that she was \u201c more \u201d scared as a consequence of the police advice , noting that this was \u201c on top of her own fears \u201d . He also observed that in her statement , PERSON had confirmed that the possibility of special measures at trial had been explained to her . He referred to the warning that he had given her as to the serious consequences if she failed to attend court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He concluded :", "\u201c Having heard all the evidence , the only sensible conclusion is that she was and is so terrified of coming to court to give evidence , she would rather face arrest and imprisonment . I have no doubt she \u2019s in fear of giving evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that there was no qualification in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the DATE Act on how the fear had to have been generated . He accepted that GPE qualified under the LAW to have her statement read as a witness in fear , and stressed that there had been no bad faith by the police in respect of the advice that they had given . The judge found that it would not be unfair or unjust to admit the statement .", "CARDINAL . In the same ruling the judge declined to admit the evidence of ORG as he was not satisfied that his non - attendance was due to fear .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE an application was made to the judge to admit ORG \u2019s statement made on DATE in the interests of justice under section DATE ) of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) so that it could be advanced as part of the defence case of PERSON . It was submitted that PERSON was put at a great disadvantage because the defence could not cross - examine ORG in relation to the voice heard over the telephone on DATE . The judge refused the application on the basis that ORG was not in fear and he was not prepared to go behind his ruling of DATE ; and the evidence covered many matters which implicated the applicants and not just that part of it relating to the recognition of the voice over the telephone .", "CARDINAL . Mr Marquis and PERSON were tried at ORG before a judge and a jury .", "CARDINAL . Oral evidence was heard from LOC , a friend of ORG , which the judge directed the jury to treat with caution . S. said he had been with FAC on TIME of the kidnapping when ORG had received a telephone call . He had answered it and had looked distressed . S. had been able to hear some of the conversation , including a demand for money and a girl crying in the background . ORG had told him that someone had taken his girlfriend and was demanding money . There had then been a couple more calls . ORG had asked him to telephone the police which he had done . The tape of that call recorded the person calling the police as giving an account that CARDINAL black males were demanding money while holding his girlfriend in the bathroom at her house . PERSON gave evidence that ORG had also received further calls from another telephone . S. had recognised the telephone number and when he had put it into his own mobile telephone it had registered as belonging to GPE ( the abbreviation used by PERSON for his first name ) . When PERSON denied that GPE was the same person as Mr Marquis , the judge permitted him to be treated as a hostile witness and evidence was put to him to show he knew Mr Marquis .", "CARDINAL . A police officer gave evidence that he had called PERSON \u2019s mobile telephone and had spoken to a man who had given his name as ORG He had sounded agitated and was shouting that they had kidnapped her . He had then heard a mobile telephone ringing and had been told by ORG that it was his girlfriend \u2019s number . ORG had asked him to listen . He had been able to hear some of the demands for money when the CARDINAL telephones were held against one another . The telephone had rung again and he could hear a girl \u2019s voice screaming that they had taken her . When the telephone had gone dead , ORG had confirmed that it was his girlfriend and that he did not know where she was . He did not say where he was but said that he would be returning to their home shortly . Another call had then taken place during which money was demanded .", "CARDINAL . The victim \u2019s father gave evidence that he had received a telephone call TIME and TIME on DATE from his daughter . She had told him that she had been kidnapped and needed to be picked up . She had sounded distressed . He had collected her and she had given him an account of what she said had happened . She had tried to contact her partner on the telephone , but had not answered . They had gone to her home to see if he was there . When they had arrived at the house , CARDINAL of her friends were there and asked what had happened . She had given an account , tearful and shaken . The victim \u2019s father had then searched the house but ORG was not there . He had found lukewarm water in the bath and had telephoned the police . Before they came , the victim had given an account of what had happened which was consistent with the statement she subsequently gave to them .", "CARDINAL . Mr Marquis gave evidence at trial , denying any role in the kidnapping . He stated that his telephone had been used by him DATE and DATE to contact GPE , but that he had lost it when he got into a car owned by some men on TIME CARDINAL DATE and did not get it back from them until he was at the hotel . The telephone had therefore not been in his possession when the calls had been made to ORG He would not identify the men . When he had gone to the room at the hotel , the pink telephone was already there , but he had no idea how it had got there .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON did not give evidence . He provided no evidence from any person which would have formed a basis for the case that the kidnapping was an attempted insurance fraud . It was nonetheless advanced as part of the defence case to the jury .", "CARDINAL . In his summing up , the trial judge directed the jury in relation to the way that they should treat PERSON \u2019s statement and the disadvantages to the applicants of being unable to cross - examine her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Marquis and PERSON were convicted of kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed against their convictions on the ground that the victim \u2019s statement should not have been admitted as evidence . They submitted that the statement was the sole or decisive evidence against them .", "CARDINAL . Mr Marquis and PERSON appealed against their convictions on the grounds , inter alia , that the victim \u2019s statement should not have been admitted because there was no evidence that the fear had been caused by the applicants , and the police had contributed hugely to the fear . It was also contended that her evidence was decisive in the case , as it was the only evidence that there had been a kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG unanimously dismissed the appeals .", "CARDINAL . The court found that LAW ( d ) did not create any absolute right to have every witness examined and that the balance struck by LAW was legitimate and wholly consistent with the Convention . It noted , however , that there could be a very real disadvantage in admitting hearsay evidence and it needed cautious handling . Having regard to the safeguards contained in LAW , which were rigorously applied , it was of the view that there would be no violation of LAW if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive degree on hearsay evidence . Where the hearsay evidence was demonstrably reliable , or its reliability could properly be tested and assessed , the rights of the defence would be respected , there would be sufficient counterbalancing measures and the trial would be fair . The court considered that it was not appropriate that there should be a rule that counterbalancing measures could never be sufficient where the evidence was sole or decisive .", "CARDINAL . In terms of counterbalancing measures , ORG considered that the power of a trial judge under LAW of the DATE Act to stop the case if the absent - witness evidence was unconvincing ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) provided for a \u201c proportionate assessment of the reliability \u201d of such evidence ; and that it would not serve justice if that power were to be trammelled by a requirement that it be exercised in every case in which the evidence were the sole or decisive evidence . Sole or decisive absent - witness evidence could be wholly convincing and , equally , evidence which was neither sole nor decisive might have such a potential influence on the jury that the judge would be persuaded that a conviction was unsafe . Where there was a legitimate argument that the absent witness evidence was unconvincing and important to the case , the trial judge was required to make up his own mind as to whether a conviction would be safe . PERSON when absent - witness evidence was admitted were well understood by the courts .", "DATE . The Court of Appeal gave guidance as to when it would be appropriate to allow absent - witness evidence to be introduced because a witness was in fear . There was , in the case - law of this ORG , no requirement that the fear had to be attributable to the defendant ; the essential questions were whether there was a justifiable reason for the absence of the witness supported by evidence and whether the evidence was demonstrably reliable or its reliability could be properly tested and assessed . ORG added :", "\u201c DATE . It is , however , important that all possible efforts are made to get the witness to court . As is clear , the right to confrontation is a longstanding requirement of the common law and recognised in Article CARDINAL ) . It is only to be departed from in the limited circumstances and under the conditions set out in the [ CARDINAL Act ] . The witness must be given all possible support , but also made to understand the importance of the citizen \u2019s duty , and indeed that the violent and intimidatory will only flourish the more if that duty is not done , whilst they will normally back down in the face of determination that it be performed . For this reason it is of especial importance that assurances are never given to potential witnesses that their evidence will be read . Unless the defendant consents , it is only the court applying the strict conditions of the [ CARDINAL Act ] based on evidence that can admit such a statement . Any indication , let alone an assurance , can only give rise to an expectation that this will indeed happen , when if it does the impact of the evidence will be diminished and the disadvantage to the accused may result in it not being given at all .", "CARDINAL . ... In the case before us of ORG and PERSON ... the Judge found that the investigating police officer had significantly contributed to the fear of the witness by referring repeatedly to a notorious local example of witnesses being hunted down , although relocated , and killed . Although notorious , that incident was an extreme and very unusual case . The need for police officers to tender careful advice to potential witnesses in order to discharge their duty of care towards them should not lead to such frightening information being laboured out of defensiveness . Whilst the [ CARDINAL Act ] requires fear to be construed broadly , it is not to be expected that fear based upon inappropriate assurances by police officers will result in the evidence being read and the case proceeding on the basis of it to the jury . If the evidence can really only be assessed by the jury by seeing the witness , as will often be the case , it may not be admitted . If it is admitted and central to the case , there is a significant possibility that at the end of the trial the Judge may have to rule under s.CARDINAL that a conviction relying upon it would be unsafe . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having considered the general principles , the court turned to examine the specific facts of the ORG cases .", "CARDINAL . ORG reviewed the victim \u2019s statement and the evidence presented to the trial court . It found that there was substantial evidence independent of the statement to prove that Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had gone to the victim \u2019s flat , that they had been present when the attack had taken place and that both had taken away items from the flat . It noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . i ) PERSON and PERSON both admitted they accompanied [ NORP ] to flat CARDINAL and were present when the door was opened .", "ii ) PERSON removed the TV on his own admission . The TV had [ the victim \u2019s ] blood on it . It is an inescapable inference that PERSON must have been present after sufficient violence had been inflicted on [ the victim ] for blood to have got onto the TV . His account that he saw no violence must have been untruthful .", "iii ) PERSON admitted taking the DVD and stepping over the prostrate body of [ the victim ] . He must have been present when the violence began and he returned to the flat to help with removing the TV , despite knowing that [ the victim ] had been attacked .", "iv ) Neither appellant contended there was anyone else other than [ NORP ] present at that time they first went to the flat or when the DVD or TV were removed .", "v ) The scientific evidence pointed clearly to the attack having taken place at the entrance to the flat and at the door to the bedroom which was near the entrance . The attack must therefore have been visible to anyone who remained at the entrance .", "vi ) It follows from the above that there was a significant amount of evidence which showed that the attack occurred in the presence of each of the appellants .", "vii ) There was no evidence of motive for [ M. ] to have attacked [ the victim ] . On the contrary he was a friend of [ the victim \u2019s ] and [ the victim ] had shown no fear when he saw him ... after he had been attacked . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Despite the substantial amount of independent evidence , ORG accepted that it was clear from the judge \u2019s ruling on admissibility , from the way in which the case was summed up and from the question from the jury that the victim \u2019s statement was to a decisive degree the basis on which the applicants were convicted .", "CARDINAL . However , it considered that the decisive nature of the evidence was CARDINAL of the factors which the court had to put into the balance in the various stages that it had to go through in applying the legislation . It observed that the judge \u2019s decision on the admissibility of the evidence carefully applied the statutory tests under LAW ; that the applicants had been provided with ample material to attack the victim \u2019s credibility , including the notes of his treatment in hospital ; that no application had been made CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act to stop the case ; that the judge \u2019s direction to the jury was very full and that he had drawn attention to the particular matters that put the defence at a disadvantage , in particular the inability to cross - examine the victim as to his memory , his alcoholism , his description of Mr Blackmore and other matters ; and that there was no suggested reason why the victim should have provided an untruthful statement .", "CARDINAL . ORG was satisfied that the jury had been able to make a proper assessment of the reliability of the victim \u2019s evidence contained in the statement . It further considered that the jury was right in placing reliance on the statement , as its convincing nature and reliability in important respects could be tested against other evidence , including the applicants\u2019 own admissions ; the visit of QUANTITY persons to the victim \u2019s flat and taking items away ; the evidence of blood on the television removed by PERSON ; Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence in relation to observing the victim on the floor and the blood in the flat ; and the other independent evidence to which it had already referred .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly concluded that the applicants were provided with sufficient counterbalancing measures to ensure respect for their fair trial rights . They had received considerable information about the victim and his time in hospital ; they were able to draw to the jury \u2019s attention all the arguments for treating the statement as unreliable ; and they were able to put forward an alternative case that the assault was carried out by PERSON by calling independent evidence in support .", "CARDINAL . ORG reviewed the evidence at trial and the judge \u2019s decision to admit the victim \u2019s statement . It also examined the directions given to the jury in relation to the way in which they should treat the statement and the disadvantages to the applicants in not being able to crossexamine the victim , which it considered to be appropriate .", "DATE . It found , having regard to its observations on the ambit of \u201c fear \u201d under LAW ( see paragraph DATE above ) , that the judge was correct in his ruling as to the victim \u2019s fear .", "CARDINAL . The court also took the view that there was sufficient material before the jury to enable them properly to assess the reliability of the victim \u2019s statement . It explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... We also consider that its convincing nature and reliability in important respects could be tested against other evidence including :", "i ) that when the police visited the house , the bath had lukewarm water in it .", "ii ) that a knife was recovered from the ORG in which PERSON was arrested ; she identified it as the one used on her .", "iii ) that [ ORG ] was phoned using her phone and an identical phone was seen in the bedroom at the FAC Inn used by ORG .", "In considering the overall fairness of the decision to admit the evidence of [ the victim ] and in looking at the safety of the conviction , we have taken into account the criticism of the judge \u2019s refusal to admit the statement of [ ORG ] . ORG sought to admit only part of his evidence contained in the statements . The judge had concluded that [ FAC ] was not in fear and could have attended . To have admitted the whole of the evidence in those circumstances would not have been in accordance with the statutory code and to have admitted part of it on Marquis\u2019 application would have been to provide evidence that was misleading without the rest of the evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered it clear that the convictions did not rest on the evidence of the victim to a decisive extent . It noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... i ) The main evidence against PERSON was that there was clear ORG evidence that PERSON had been at the house at the time [ the victim ] said she was kidnapped ; he admitted that , though in his interview he had not accepted that . He was arrested in [ ORG \u2019s ] stolen FAC . [ The victim \u2019s ] statement did not identify him .", "ii ) The main evidence against ORG was that his phone was used to make the ransom demands heard by [ S. ] and [ the police officer ] . It was not disputed that a phone identical to one owned by [ the victim ] was seen by [ GPE ] when she went to Marquis\u2019 bedroom at the FAC . [ The victim \u2019s ] statement did not identify him .", "iii ) The only matter proved by [ the victim \u2019s ] statement was that she had been kidnapped . There was , however , sufficient evidence of that from the other witnesses in the case , particularly her father .", "iv ) There was no evidence to support the case advanced by PERSON that the kidnapping was an attempted insurance fraud .", "v ) Counsel for the ORG had submitted in his application to the judge to admit the statements of both [ ORG ] and [ the victim ] that they were central to the case . However , the fact that this submission was made is an illustration of the difficulty ... of determining in advance whether the evidence is decisive . Self evidently the evidence of [ FAC ] made no difference , as it was not admitted and in the result , for the reasons we have given , the evidence of [ the victim ] was not , in the event , decisive .", "vi ) Thus , if contrary to the view we have expressed , a statement of a person kept away by fear could not be relied upon as evidence of a decisive extent in favour of a conviction , then as the conviction rests on other evidence , then that ground of appeal fails for that additional reason . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the applicants\u2019 defence rights were respected , the trial was fair and the convictions were safe .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG arguing that the decisions to admit the statements in their cases rendered their convictions unfair . They relied heavily on the judgment of the Fourth Section of this Court in Al\u2011Khawaja and PERSON v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and ORG , DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeals . Lord PERSON gave the judgment of the court , with which the other justices agreed . He identified the principal issue raised by the appeals as being whether a conviction based \u201c solely or to a decisive extent \u201d on the statement of a witness whom the defendant had had no chance of crossexamining necessarily infringed his right to a fair trial under LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON began with an analysis of the common law approach to a fair trial and the provisions of the CARDINAL Act . He set out the legal framework under section CARDINAL of the DATE allowing , exceptionally , the admission of hearsay evidence at criminal trials ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , explaining", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he [ Criminal Justice Act ] DATE contains a crafted code intended to ensure that evidence is admitted only when it is fair that it should be . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He went on to detail the \u201c special stipulations \u201d set out in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the DATE Act which were applicable to all hearsay evidence and designed to ensure the fairness of the proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . He summarised the safeguards present at trial to protect against any potential for unfairness arising from the admission of hearsay evidence as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... i ) The trial judge acts as gatekeeper and has a duty to prevent the jury from receiving evidence that will have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that it should not be received .", "ii ) Hearsay evidence is only admissible in strictly defined circumstances . In essence the judge has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution is not able to adduce the evidence by calling the witness .", "iii ) Once the prosecution case is closed , the judge must withdraw the case from the jury if it is based wholly or partly on hearsay evidence and that evidence is so unconvincing that , considering its importance , the defendant \u2019s conviction would be unsafe .", "iv ) The judge has to direct the jury on the dangers of relying on hearsay evidence .", "v ) The jury has to be satisfied of the defendant \u2019s guilt beyond reasonable doubt .", "vi ) The defendant can apply for permission to appeal against his conviction , which will be granted where reasonable grounds for appeal are demonstrated . A failure to comply with the safeguards outlined above , and in particular the admission of hearsay evidence contrary to the rules on its admissibility , will constitute such grounds . Where ORG finds that there has been such a failure , the appeal will be allowed unless the court is satisfied that , despite the shortcoming , the conviction is \u2018 safe\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered the approach to absent - witness evidence in other common law jurisdictions . He then examined criminal procedure in civil law jurisdictions and the case - law of this ORG prior to the ORG judgment in Al\u2011Khawaja and PERSON . He reviewed in some detail the origins and development of the \u201c sole or decisive rule \u201d in the ORG \u2019s caselaw .", "CARDINAL . He then turned to consider the ORG \u2019s judgment in Al\u2011Khawaja and PERSON , citing an extract of the judgment which explained that in the absence of special circumstances arising where the absent witness failed to give oral evidence as a result of fear induced by the defendant , it was doubtful whether any counterbalancing measures would be sufficient to justify the introduction in evidence of an untested statement which was the sole or decisive basis for conviction . He observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL points to be made about this passage . The first is that the ORG appears to have accepted that the sole or decisive rule does not apply so as to preclude the reliance on the statement of a witness who refuses to testify because of fear induced by the defendant . The second is that the ORG did not completely close the door to the possibility of \u2018 counterbalancing ORG being sufficient to justify the introduction of a statement as sole or decisive evidence in other circumstances . The ORG made it quite plain , however , that compliance with the statutory regime under which the statements in the CARDINAL appeals had been admitted carried \u2018 limited weight\u2019 ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , having regard to the judgment of ORG and to the development of the \u201c sole or decisive rule \u201d in cases largely relating to civil law jurisdictions , Lord PERSON concluded that the DATE Act made the \u201c sole or decisive \u201d rule unnecessary in LANGUAGE criminal procedure . He considered that the safeguards it contained meant that if the CARDINAL Act were observed , there would be no breach of LAW ( d ) even if a conviction were based solely or to a decisive extent on absent witness - evidence . He therefore held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In these circumstances I have decided that it would not be right for this court to hold that the sole or decisive test should have been applied rather than the provisions of the CARDINAL Act , interpreted in accordance with their natural meaning . I believe that those provisions strike the right balance between the imperative that a trial must be fair and the interests of victims in particular and society in general that a criminal should not be immune from conviction where a witness , who has given critical evidence in a statement that can be shown to be reliable , dies or can not be called to give evidence for some other reason . In so concluding I have taken careful account of the GPE jurisprudence . I hope that in due course ORG may also take account of the reasons that have led me not to apply the sole or decisive test in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicants\u2019 alternative arguments that , regardless of the application of the sole or decisive rule , the statements should not have been admitted , Lord PERSON relied on the findings of ORG , which he said had given the arguments \u201c careful consideration \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a separate concurring opinion , Lord PERSON observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Obviously , the more crucial the evidence is to the proof of guilt , the more scrupulous must the ORG be to ensure that it can be fairly adduced and is likely to be reliable . In this connection there can be no harm in using the concept of \u2018 sole or ORG so long as it is used broadly ... Understood and applied inflexibly , however , the concept would involve insoluble problems of detailed interpretation and application .", "CARDINAL .
