PERSON was born on DATE at Wilrijk , near GPE ; she is the daughter of PERSON , a NORP national , who is unmarried and a journalist by profession .", "PERSON duly reported PERSON \u2019s birth to the ORG registration officer who informed LOC ( juge de paix ) as is required by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) in the case of \" illegitimate \" children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the District Judge of the first district of GPE summoned PERSON to appear before him ( Article CARDINAL ) so as to obtain from her the information required to make arrangements for PERSON \u2019s guardianship ; at the same time , he informed her of the methods available for recognising her daughter and of the consequences in law of any such recognition ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He also drew her attention to certain provisions of LAW , including LAW which concerns \" exceptional \" forms of inheritance ( successions \" irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res \" ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON recognised her child in accordance with LAW . She thereby automatically became PERSON \u2019s guardian ( Article CARDINAL bis ) ; the family council , on which the sister and certain other relatives of PERSON sat under the chairmanship of the District Judge , was empowered to take in PERSON \u2019s interests various measures provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON adopted her daughter pursuant to LAW . The procedure , which was that laid down by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL , entailed certain enquiries and involved some expenses . It concluded on DATE with a judgment confirming the adoption , the effect whereof was retroactive to the date of the instrument of adoption , namely CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of her application to the Commission , Ms. PERSON \u2019s family included , besides PERSON , her own mother , Mrs. PERSON , who died in DATE , and a sister , Mrs. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complain of the Civil Code provisions on the manner of establishing the maternal affiliation of an \" illegitimate \" child and on the effects of establishing such affiliation as regards both the extent of the child \u2019s family relationships and the patrimonial rights of the child and of his mother . The applicants also put in issue the necessity for the mother to adopt the child if she wishes to increase his rights .", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , no legal bond between an unmarried mother and her child results from the mere fact of birth : whilst the birth certificate recorded at the registry office suffices to prove the maternal affiliation of a married woman \u2019s children ( LAW ) , the maternal affiliation of an \" illegitimate \" child is established by means either of a voluntary recognition by the mother or of legal proceedings taken for the purpose ( action en recherche de maternit\u00e9 ) .", "Nevertheless , an unrecognised \" illegitimate \" child bears his mother \u2019s name which must appear on the birth certificate ( Article CARDINAL ) . The appointment of his guardian is a matter for the family council which is presided over by the District Judge .", "Under Article CARDINAL , recognition , \" if not inserted in the birth certificate , shall be effected by a formal deed \" . ORG is declaratory and not attributive : it does not create but records the child \u2019s status and is retroactive to the date of birth . However , it does not necessarily follow that the person effecting recognition is actually the child \u2019s mother ; on the contrary , any interested party may claim that the recognition does not correspond to the truth ( LAW ) . Many unmarried mothers - PERCENT according to the Government , although the applicants consider this an exaggerated figure - do not recognise their child .", "Proceedings to establish maternal affiliation ( action en recherche de maternit\u00e9 ) may be instituted by the child within DATE from his attainment of majority or , whilst he is still a minor , by his legal representative with the consent of the family council ( ORG CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The establishment of the maternal affiliation of an \" illegitimate \" child has limited effects as regards both the extent of his family relationships and the rights of the child and his mother in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the maternal affiliation of an \" illegitimate \" child , NORP legislation does not employ the concepts of \" family \" and \" relative \" . Even once such affiliation has been established , it in principle creates a legal bond with the mother alone . The child does not become a member of his mother \u2019s family . The law excludes it from that family as regards inheritance rights on intestacy ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Furthermore , if the child \u2019s parents are dead or under an incapacity , he can not marry , before attaining the age of CARDINAL , without consent which has to be given by his guardian ( LAW ) and not , as is the case for a \" legitimate \" child , by his grandparents ( LAW ) ; the law does not expressly create any maintenance obligations , etc . , between the child and his grandparents . However , certain texts make provision for exceptions , for example as regards the impediments to marriage ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . According to a judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG ( Pasicrisie I , DATE , pp CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , these texts \" place the bonds existing between an illegitimate child and his grandparents on a legal footing based on the affection , respect and devotion that are the consequence of consanguinity ... ( which ) creates an obligation for the ascendants to take an interest in their descendants and , as a corollary , gives them the right , whenever this is not excluded by the law , to know and protect them and exercise over them the influence dictated by affection and devotion \" . ORG deduced from this that grandparents were entitled to a right of access to the child .", "CARDINAL . A recognised \" illegitimate \" child \u2019s rights of inheritance on intestacy are less than those of a \" legitimate \" child . As appears from ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL to CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Civil Code , a recognised \" illegitimate \" child does not have , in the estate of his parent who dies intestate , the status of heir but solely that of \" exceptional heir \" ( \" successeur irr\u00e9gulier \" ) : he has to seek a court order putting him in possession of the estate ( envoi en possession ) . He is the sole beneficiary of his deceased mother \u2019s estate only if she leaves no relatives entitled to inherit ( LAW ) ; otherwise , its maximum entitlement - which arises when his mother leaves no descendants , ascendants , brothers or DATE is DATE of the share which he would have taken if \" legitimate \" ( LAW . Furthermore , his mother may , during her lifetime , reduce that entitlement by CARDINAL . Finally , Article CARDINAL denies to the \" illegitimate \" child any rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother \u2019s relatives .", "CARDINAL . Recognised \" illegitimate \" children are also at a disadvantage as regards voluntary dispositions , since Article ORG provides that they \" may receive by disposition inter vivos or by will no more than their entitlement under the title \u2018 ORG on Intestacy\u2019 \" .", "Conversely , the mother of such a child , unless she has no relatives entitled to inherit , may give in her DATE or bequeath to him only part of her property . On the other hand , if the child \u2019s affiliation has not been established , the mother may so give or bequeath to him the whole of her property , provided that there are no heirs entitled to a reserved portion of her estate ( h\u00e9ritiers r\u00e9servataires ) . The mother is thus faced with the following alternative : either she recognises the child and loses the possibility of leaving all her estate to him ; or she renounces establishing with him a family relationship in the eyes of the law , in order to retain the possibility of leaving all her estate to him just as she might to a stranger .", "CARDINAL . If the mother of a recognised \" illegitimate \" child remains unmarried , she has but CARDINAL means of improving his status , namely , \" simple \" adoption . In such cases , the age requirements for this form of adoption are eased by Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . The adopted child acquires over the adopter \u2019s estate the rights of a \" legitimate \" child but , unlike the latter , has no rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother \u2019s relatives ( LAW ) .", "Only legitimation ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and legitimation by adoption ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) place an \" illegitimate \" child on exactly the same footing as a \" legitimate \" child ; both of these measures presuppose the mother \u2019s marriage .", "CARDINAL . GPE has signed , but not yet ratified , LAW of DATE on ORG , which was prepared by ORG and entered into force on DATE . Neither has GPE yet ratified , nor even signed , LAW DATE on ORG born out of PERSON , which was concluded within ORG and entered into force on DATE . Both of these instruments are based on the principle \" mater semper certa est \" ; the second of them also regulates such questions as maintenance obligations , parental authority and rights of succession .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG submitted to the ORG on DATE a PERSON to which they referred the ORG in their memorial of DATE and subsequently at the hearings on DATE . The official statement of reasons accompanying the PERSON , which mentions , inter alia , LAW and DATE cited above , states that the PERSON \" seeks to institute equality in law between all children \" . In particular , maternal affiliation would be established on the mother \u2019s name being entered on the birth certificate , which would introduce into NORP law the principle \" mater semper certa est \" . ORG by an unmarried mother would accordingly no longer be necessary , unless there were no such entry . Furthermore , LAW would confer on children born out of wedlock rights identical to those presently enjoyed by children born in wedlock in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
