The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , married and father of a minor , was arrested on DATE , because the police found several suspicious spare car parts , car documents and various tools in his vehicle . On DATE he was interrogated on suspicion of attempted aggravated larceny , allegedly committed in respect of a van .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution proposed the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . Relying essentially on the above material evidence , it was of the view that there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant and his accomplice , together with other unknown helpers , were active in the car theft business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , referring to , but not substantiating , the risks of absconding , collusion and repetition of crime . An accomplice was detained as well .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , challenging the suspicion against him and pointing out that his settled background \u2013 he had never been convicted before , had legal income , and supported several family members \u2013 rendered unlikely the risks of absconding and repetition of crime . The Pest County Regional Court dismissed the appeal on DATE , without addressing in detail the applicant \u2019s arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged . The decision referred to CARDINAL counts of larceny . In his appeal , the applicant pointed out that the material evidence relating to CARDINAL of the thefts was in no way capable of connecting him to the vehicle in question , whereas in respect of the remaining CARDINAL counts , he had not formally been implicated as a suspect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Without addressing in detail the defence \u2019s arguments , the court pointed out that it could not assess the evidence at that stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested his release . He argued that the living conditions of those supported by him had deteriorated . His request was to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s detention was repeatedly prolonged at the statutory intervals . The reasoning in the decisions was largely identical to that in the previous ones , and the discrepancy in the counts of theft with which the applicant was charged persisted . His requests for release were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution again proposed the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention . This time , reasonable suspicion was invoked in respect of CARDINAL counts of car theft . The reasons for the applicant \u2019s proposed detention remained the same .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing and sustained the prosecution \u2019s motion , while including in the decision the suspicion of another car theft . The applicant \u2019s appeal and subsequent requests for release were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert was appointed to examine whether or not the material evidence found in the applicant \u2019s car was capable of connecting him to any car theft .", "CARDINAL . Further prolongations took place on DATE and DATE , with essentially unchanged reasoning . The applicant \u2019s ensuing requests for release or a less stringent measure were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with further counts of car theft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pest County Regional Court prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention . The underlying reasons were the same as before . In his appeal , the applicant complained that the expert opinion had never been communicated to him .", "CARDINAL . After further prolongations , on CARDINAL DATE a bill of indictment was preferred . The applicant was charged with altogether CARDINAL counts of car theft or attempted car theft and CARDINAL count of forgery of documents . The applicant \u2019s detention was maintained , with reference to the risk of absconding and repetition of crime .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . The applicant \u2019s detention was upheld because , in the trial court \u2019s view , the potential severe sanction gave rise to a risk of absconding . No reason was given as to the risk of repetition of crime .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent requests for release or a less stringent measure were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Apart from DATE , none of the prosecution \u2019s motions to have the applicant \u2019s detention prolonged had made any specific reference to the actual evidence which underlay the alleged risks held against him . The applicant \u2019s lawyer repeatedly complained about having no access to these pieces of evidence \u2013 in particular , on DATE and DATE however , this omission was not redressed ; and the courts did not refute the defence \u2019s allegations of having no access .", "CARDINAL . Of the altogether CARDINAL decisions on the applicant \u2019s detention , CARDINAL contained separate arguments in respect of each of the CARDINAL co - detainees .", "CARDINAL . The authorities prolonging the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention considered the possibility of applying less stringent measures on CARDINAL May DATE and DATE , but eventually they did not avail themselves thereof .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was finally released on DATE . A prohibition on leaving his domicile was imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was convicted at first instance .
