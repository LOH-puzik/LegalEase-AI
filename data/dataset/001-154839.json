The applicant is the owner and publisher of the DATE magazine \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its issue CARDINAL of DATE the applicant company published an article about Mr NORP , at that time a member of ORG , and his cohabitee PERSON The article , with the title \u201c Diary of an escape \u201d and the subtitle \u201c Report . Several myths are entwined around PERSON trip to GPE . The reconstruction of a banal reality \u201d , described the couple \u2019s flight from GPE in DATE as Mr NORP was suspected of having committed the offences of aggravated fraud ( PERSON ) and fraudulent conversion ( PERSON ) . After an international arrest warrant had been issued , PERSON NORP was arrested in GPE on DATE . At the time of the events , great public interest in the criminal proceedings against PERSON existed . After PERSON arrest , PERSON had given interviews on these events . The article was accompanied by a photo , which appeared on another page , showing PERSON standing beside Mr R.", "CARDINAL . The article and its context , namely a short text accompanying photos showing the couple \u2019s hotel and a bar in GPE , contained the following statements :", "\u201c ... Thus , the NORP mutation of \u2018 PERSON and PERSON started on the last part of their trip , a TIME bus ride ... ( Also brach die nieder\u00f6sterreichische Mutation PERSON and PERSON , einer vierst\u00fcndigen GPE ... auf . )", "... DATE , \u2018 PERSON and PERSON hardly ever left the hotel ... ( Die ersten ORG verlassen \u2018 PERSON praktisch nie . )", "... \u2019Bonnie and Clyde\u2019 from ORG wish to rent the Mayor \u2019s bar ... ( \u2018 PERSON Nieder\u00f6sterreich wollen die ORG pachten . )", "... PERSON and PERSON are dreaming of a decent life as pub owners ... ( \u2018 PERSON bescheidenen PERSON als Barbetreiber . ) \u201d", "The article , when describing the arrest of PERSON NORP , further stated :", "\u201c C. G. , against whom no suspicion exists , stays behind . ( PERSON bleibt GPE , gegen die nichts vorliegt . ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mrs PERSON brought proceedings against the applicant company claiming compensation for defamation under Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . Further she requested supplementary measures under LAW , such as the publication of the judgment . She stressed that the applicant company , by publishing the article at issue , had committed the offence of defamation under LAW ( \u00dcble Nachrede ) .", "CARDINAL . She argued that the comparison with the famous criminals \u2018 PERSON and PERSON from DATE , whose story was the basis of a film produced in DATE , could have given the impression that she was also involved in the offences of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court ( PERSON ) dismissed PERSON claim . It found that the average reader would have understood \u201c PERSON and GPE as a synonym for a couple on the run and that it had been a pictorial description with a humorous and entertaining message . It considered that the average reader would have connected \u201c PERSON \u201d with a woman who follows her partner \u201c through thick and thin \u201d and that the characterisation as \u201c PERSON \u201d did not amount to an accusation of having participated in the offences of PERSON R.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) quashed this decision and remitted the case to ORG . It observed that \u201c PERSON and PERSON \u201d had been violent criminals and found that the established connection between PERSON G. and \u201c PERSON \u201d created an \u201c inherent statement of having participated in criminal acts \u201d even though \u201c it had been expressly stated in the article that no suspicion had existed against PERSON G. \u201d . It , therefore , concluded that the applicant company had committed the offence of defamation under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) by publishing the article at issue and stated that its finding had to be taken into account by ORG in its new decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant company to pay compensation of ORG CARDINAL ( MONEY ) for defamation and to reimburse PERSON costs of the proceedings and ordered it to publish an extract of its judgment in its magazine . Following ORG line of argument it found , referring to the above mentioned passages of the incriminated article , that :", "\u201c ... the well - known movie \u2018 PERSON and PERSON described CARDINAL ordinary people who make the NORP dream of liberty and wealth come true by stealing cars , robbing banks and killing people . ( ... ) The reader primarily associates PERSON with a criminal who had , together with her partner , robbed innumerable banks and had killed CARDINAL persons within DATE . ( ... ) Nobody would have connected PERSON only with a naive angel , who followed her partner devotedly but , rather , with a woman who would kill to assist the common purpose \u2018 LOC . ( ... ) Beyond doubt the reader is forced to make a connection with capital crime . ( ... ) The allegation of participating in criminal offences constitutes defamation within the meaning of LAW of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed an appeal and stressed , inter alia , that the incriminating passages had to be considered in connection with the article as a whole . It submitted that the article was written in an ironical style and could not have given the impression that PERSON had committed any criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and confirmed ORG decision as a whole .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mrs PERSON applied to ORG for an injunction under Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Urheberrechtsgesetz ) against the applicant company . She requested that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing her picture without her consent in connection with reporting on the criminal proceedings against Mr NORP or , in the alternative , that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing her picture without her consent in connection with referring to her and Mr NORP as \u201c PERSON and GPE . Furthermore , she requested an order for the publication of the judgment in the applicant company \u2019s magazine .", "CARDINAL . She argued that the publication of her picture in connection with a report on the criminal proceedings against Mr NORP violated her legitimate interests under Section CARDINAL of LAW and that the comparison with the famous criminals \u201c PERSON and PERSON \u201d could have given the impression that she had been involved in the offences of which PERSON NORP was accused .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company , in its observations , argued that the report at issue expressly mentioned that there were no criminal proceedings pending against PERSON and that the report was written in an ironical style and could not have given the impression that PERSON had committed any criminal acts . Moreover , she had willingly given interviews to the media and had her pictures taken by journalists . As regards the comparison of PERSON with \u201c PERSON \u201d , the applicant company submitted that the reader of its magazine understood \u201c PERSON and PERSON \u201d as a synonym for a couple on the run and not for violent criminals . Finally , it contended that the great public interest in the events justified the publication of PERSON picture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court granted an interim injunction ( einstweilige GPE ) . It found the measure justified as the interest in the publication of PERSON picture violated her legitimate interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and dismissed PERSON application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) partly allowed PERSON extraordinary appeal on points of law and granted the interim injunction she had requested in the alternative , i.e. it ordered the applicant company to refrain from publishing PERSON picture without her consent in connection with referring to her and Mr R. as \u201c PERSON and GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that Section CARDINAL of LAW prohibited publishing a person \u2019s picture if the publication violated that person \u2019s legitimate interests and that the publication of her picture had to be considered together with the content of the published report . The court referred further to its case - law in which it had found that the publication of the picture of a spouse of a suspect was not of any informative value and that the concerned spouse \u2019s interest in secrecy , therefore , outweighed the interest of information . The court found , however , that in the present case PERSON was far more involved in the case of Mr NORP than simply being Mr NORP \u2019s cohabitee or girlfriend , as she had prepared the escape with him and had finally escaped with Mr NORP Therefore , the applicant company \u2019s interest in publishing her picture in principle outweighed PERSON legitimate interests in secrecy .", "CARDINAL . The court then argued that the text of the article at issue , compared PERSON with the female partner of the violent criminals \u201c PERSON and PERSON \u201d and could give the impression to the readers of the magazine that PERSON as \u201c PERSON \u201d had been involved in the criminal offences of her partner . ORG , thus , concluded that , although it seemed that PERSON had consented to the publication of her picture in connection with the criminal proceedings against Mr R. , her legitimate interests were violated by the publication of her photo in combination with a comparison with the criminal \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the applicant company from publishing PERSON picture while comparing her and Mr NORP with \u201c PERSON and PERSON \u201d or while connecting her with the commission of criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and ordered the applicant company to pay PERSON costs of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to its decision of CARDINAL DATE , rejected the applicant company \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points on law . This decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation ; the victim can thus claim damages from him . In this context \u201c defamation \u201d has been defined in LAW , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As it may be perceived by a third party , anyone who accuses another of having a contemptible character or attitude , or of behaving contrary to honour or morality , and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem , shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine ...", "CARDINAL . Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document , by broadcasting or otherwise , in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public , shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true . As regards the offence defined in paragraph CARDINAL , he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly , nor in any way made accessible to the public , where injury would be caused to the legitimate interests of the persons concerned or , in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication , those of a close relative . \u201d", "This provision has been interpreted in ORG case - law . In particular ORG has found that in determining whether the publication of a person \u2019s picture violated his or her \u201c legitimate interests \u201d regard is to be had to the accompanying text . Where the publisher of the picture claims that there was a public interest in its publication , the courts have to carry out a weighing of the respective interests involved . As regards reporting on criminal cases , ORG has constantly held that there is no predominant public interest in the publication of the suspect \u2019s picture if it has no additional independent information value . The only effect is that the intensity of such reporting is increased by attaching the suspect \u2019s picture and , thus , making his or her appearance known to the public at large ( see ORG v.
