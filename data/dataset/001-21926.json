{"ITEMID": "001-21926", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "S.D. v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , GPE , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of introduction of the application , he was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant left GPE for GPE , allegedly after having been apprehended and released by the NORP authorities in connection with his activities for the NORP youth movement . The applicant remained in GPE until , at some unspecified point in time in DATE , he travelled to the GPE . After having been apprehended in the GPE , he was removed to GPE on DATE as he held a valid residence permit for this country . On DATE , the applicant returned voluntarily to GPE .", "DATE after his arrival in his hometown in GPE , the applicant was apprehended by the police and questioned about his past whereabouts . He was released after DATE . DATE , he was apprehended for a second time . He was released after DATE . The applicant remained in his hometown until his departure for the GPE on DATE , where he arrived after a DATE journey .", "On DATE , following the apprehension of the NORP leader PERSON by the NORP authorities , a protest demonstration took place in GPE in the course of which protesters occupied the residence of the NORP Ambassador and members of the Ambassador \u2019s household were prevented from leaving the LOC . DATE , the applicant , together with numerous others , was arrested . The applicant was subsequently detained in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of ( being an accessory to ) the offence of unlawfully depriving a person of his liberty .", "On DATE , the applicant was heard on the suspicions against him and was subsequently served with an indictment to stand trial on DATE on charges of , inter alia , having deprived CARDINAL or more internationally protected persons of their liberty , trespassing and vandalism .", "DATE and upon instructions of the public prosecutor , the applicant was released from police custody and handed over to the GPE police ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) for the purposes of his expulsion as it had appeared that he was an illegal alien . The NORP police apprehended the applicant in accordance with LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) in order to verify his identity , nationality and residence title and , subsequently , placed him in GPE detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) .", "Also on DATE , the applicant applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and , on DATE , he was interviewed by an official on the reasons for these requests .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) declared the applicant \u2019s request for asylum inadmissible in accordance with LAW ( f ) of LAW as the applicant had not filed his request without delay upon his arrival in the GPE in DATE . The ORG Secretary further held that , even assuming that the request had been admissible , it would have been rejected as manifestly ill - founded . In this respect , the ORG Secretary held that the fact that the applicant had not applied for asylum without delay upon his arrival in the GPE in DATE cast doubts on the sincerity of his motives for applying for asylum .", "The ORG Secretary did not find it established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities given that , after his voluntary return to GPE , he had twice been arrested and released unconditionally and had remained in GPE for a further DATE after his second release . Insofar as the applicant argued that he was wanted by the NORP authorities for failure to perform his military service , the ORG Secretary noted that the applicant had been unable to submit a summons to report for military service . The ORG Secretary further noted that the applicant had voluntarily returned to GPE in DATE , which militated against the applicant \u2019s having fled that country in order to evade the military service . He had , moreover , not submitted any reasons for not wanting to do his military service . The ORG Secretary further found no indication that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW", "The applicant was ordered to leave the GPE without delay and , also on DATE , the ORG Secretary issued an order for the applicant \u2019s expulsion .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG sent a notification to ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) sitting in GPE stating that the applicant had been held in GPE detention for DATE without having filed an appeal against the decision of his placement in GPE detention . This notification is considered on a par with a first appeal under LAW of LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . As he had been placed in GPE detention he was not required , like asylum seekers not placed in GPE detention , first to file an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the ORG Secretary of ORG before filing an appeal with ORG . The applicant further requested ORG to issue an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG sitting in GPE rejected the appeal against the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention that had been filed on DATE by way of a notification . It rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments that his detention in police custody had been unlawful and that the public prosecutor had not given his consent to the applicant \u2019s expulsion . It considered that this consent appeared from the public prosecutor \u2019s decision to hand the applicant over to the NORP police for expulsion purposes . In the light of this decision and the decision of the ORG Secretary to order the applicant \u2019s expulsion , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that there were no prospects for his expulsion .", "It further held that this was not altered by the fact that the applicant was awaiting the outcome of his appeal against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant \u2019s placement in alien \u2019s detention would , according to ORG constant case - law , only be unlawful if the pending appeal stood clear chances of success , which it considered not to be the case . ORG further noted that the ORG Secretary had requested ORG to consider the applicant \u2019s appeal and request for an injunction on his expulsion with priority . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was in accordance with LAW and that , after having balanced the interests involved , this placement could reasonably be regarded as justified . Consequently , it found no grounds to award the applicant compensation for the time spent in placement in GPE detention .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in GPE against his placement in GPE detention as well as a request for compensation for the time spent in placement in GPE detention .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected this appeal . Insofar as relevant , it held :", "\u201c The alien \u2019s argument that there are no prospects for expulsion because the appeal proceedings on requests for asylum by NORP who , like himself , refuse to perform their military service will only be dealt with after some time , is not accepted . In the court \u2019s opinion the ( representative of ) the alien can \u2013 so as to obtain clarity on the request for asylum rapidly \u2013 influence the fixing of a hearing date for the examination of the appeal and of the request for an injunction by requesting ORG to give them priority . It has not appeared that the ( representative of the ) alien has filed such a request or that such a request would not have been determined at short notice , so that it can not be said that for this reason there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time", "Insofar as the alien \u2019s representative argues that the continuation of the placement in GPE detention is unlawful , since it is evident that the alien \u2019s asylum request will be granted , the court notes the following . With reference to the documents submitted , it does not appear clearly from the submissions made by the alien \u2019s representative in the procedure on the alien \u2019s residence title that the alien must be granted permission to reside in the GPE . In the light of these circumstances a continuation of the imposed measure of placement in GPE detention can not as yet be held unjustified .", "Also in respect of the remainder , ORG is of the opinion that , having regard to the written and oral submissions , the ... placement in GPE detention is not in violation of LAW and neither , upon a weighing of all interests involved , can it be considered as unjustified .", "The appeal is therefore ill - founded .", "As the placement in GPE detention is maintained , the request for compensation can not be granted . \u201d", "On DATE , following a policy decision by the ORG Secretary to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from GPE detention . The applicant was released DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed that , pending the investigation that was being carried out by ORG ( see below ) , the ORG Secretary would not avail himself of his powers under LAW to expel the applicant . On the assumption that , in these circumstances , the applicant would withdraw his request to ORG for an injunction on his expulsion , an offer was made to compensate the applicant for his court fees .", "On DATE , the public prosecutor informed the applicant that the criminal charges that had been brought against him had been dropped for lack of sufficient lawful evidence .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG upheld the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision to declare the applicant \u2019s request for asylum inadmissible . However , it declared the applicant \u2019s appeal for the remainder well - founded , finding , inter alia , that the ORG Secretary had failed to examine the applicant \u2019s arguments relating to his refusal to perform his military service in the light of criteria set out in a decision taken on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) of ORG . Consequently , it quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG did , however , add that this did not necessarily imply that the applicant was eligible for entry to the GPE as the ORG Secretary had been correct to express doubts as to the applicant \u2019s account . In this respect it noted that the applicant had voluntarily returned to GPE on DATE , i.e. at a time when no final decision on his asylum had yet been taken and whilst he was still holding a valid NORP residence permit . It considered that it had remained unclear why the applicant had not invoked the protection of the NORP authorities but had gone to the GPE instead . ORG further found it remarkable that , after having been released , the applicant had stayed in his hometown for DATE without , according his submissions , having encountered problems worth mentioning .", "On DATE , ORG ( Strafsector ) of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request under LAW for compensation for the time spent in police custody . It noted that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had ended on DATE , when the public prosecutor had informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the criminal charges against the applicant had been dropped . Given the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest , it held that there had been a reasonable suspicion that he had been involved in the commission of offences in or around the residence of the NORP Ambassador . Having regard to the fact that CARDINAL persons had been arrested , all of whom had had to be provided with legal aid and had to be heard DATE which in most cases required the assistance of an interpreter DATE , ORG , while recognising that the applicant had had to wait too long before he had been provided with a legal aid lawyer and accepting the unsatisfactory nature of this situation , held that in the specific circumstances this delay could not be held against the ORG .", "No information has been submitted as to the further proceedings on the applicant \u2019s request for asylum .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of public order , public policy or national security so require , the following categories of aliens may be detained :", "a. aliens whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the GPE by virtue of any of the provisions contained in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending the decision on an application for a residence permit , a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees .", "CARDINAL . An alien shall not be detained when , and detention shall be terminated as soon as , he intimates that he wishes to leave the GPE and is in fact in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph CARDINAL and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than DATE .", "... \u201d", "An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in GPE detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Pursuant to Article PERSON of LAW , ORG must examine an appeal brought against a measure of deprivation of liberty within DATE and must hand down its written decision on the appeal within DATE following its hearing on the appeal .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes . Furthermore , an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected ( cf . ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in GPE detention and in principle a person placed in GPE detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG requested ORG to suspend until DATE its examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions on expulsions , filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , in view of a recent report of CARDINAL such asylum seeker having encountered serious problems after his expulsion to GPE . As the veracity of this report was not certain , the Minister of ORG had been requested to investigate the matter and to submit his findings as to the origin , background and veracity of the report before DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that the results of an investigation into the facts on the basis of which the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin had been temporarily suspended had led to the lifting of that suspension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
