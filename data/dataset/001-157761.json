On DATE the applicant declared that he maintained the account he had given in his initial complaint as well as in his statement of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG decided to join the applicant \u2019s complaint to CARDINAL complaints lodged by other individuals who claimed that they had been physically assaulted by the same police officers on DATE . Subsequently , the prosecutor decided not to institute criminal proceedings for abusive investigative conduct as requested by the applicant , since he had not been under investigation at the relevant time . Lastly , the prosecutor held that the investigation for the CARDINAL counts of abusive behaviour of which ORG and PERSON were accused would be continued by ORG of the Arad ORG , which was the competent authority in view of the GPE functions within the police force .", "CARDINAL .

Then he asked them to wait outside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police officer in charge of the investigation took statements from GPE , NORP and PERSON , CARDINAL of the police officers who had responded to the emergency call .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON stated that he had gone to the scene of the incident accompanied by QUANTITY police patrols . He found a group of people who claimed to be the injured parties . Amongst them was the applicant . They said that they wished to lodge a criminal complaint against their aggressors , so he accompanied them to the police station . There he took statements from GPE and GPE , but he did not know whether any of the police officers physically assaulted any of the above - mentioned people . ORG also stated that after statements had been taken , the applicant had been taken home by officer PERSON , while he had accompanied the others home in order to avoid further possible conflicts if they decided to go back to the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . PERSON stated that he was a member of one of the police patrols that had been called to the scene of the incident . When he arrived PERSON told him that he had been physically assaulted by a group of people who had then run away . He maintained that he did not recognise any of the aggressors . The officer further stated :", "\u201c ... I accompanied to the police station the person who had been assaulted [ ORG ] and Mr D.V. , who was also at the scene when the incident took place . The accompanied people had injuries on their bodies , probably caused by the stones with which they had been aggressed and their clothes had also been torn as a result of the incident . ... Subsequently , I was asked by PERSON to accompany home another person involved in the incident in order to avoid other unpleasant incidents , this person was PERSON . While I was with PERSON and until reaching his home ... , he did not tell me that he had been beaten by a police officer , he had traces of violence on his face , his tee - shirt was torn but I did not ask him where this came from , I assumed it had come from the street fight . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON declared that the applicant could not have been assaulted by police officers since he was one of the people who had been injured in the street fight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Arad ORG decided not to pursue the criminal proceedings with respect to the CARDINAL counts of abusive behaviour for which officers ORG and PERSON had been investigated . As for the applicant \u2019s complaint , the prosecutor held that the statements given by the applicant and the QUANTITY persons accompanying him on DATE of the incident had been contradicted by the statements of the officers under investigation as well as by those of CARDINAL other police officers , namely GPE , PERSON and PERSON Therefore , it could not be established with certainty that the applicant had been assaulted by the QUANTITY police officers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained against that decision , claiming that the statements of the QUANTITY police officers and their colleagues were subjective and should have been corroborated by other evidence . He requested again that PERSON ( referred to as ORG in the initial complaint ) be called as a witness and gave his address . He added that PERSON \u2019s testimony would have been relevant , since he had witnessed the applicant receiving a punch from ORG outside the police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision not to bring charges was dismissed by the head prosecutor of ORG of the Arad ORG with the same reasoning , namely that the statements of the injured party had not been corroborated by the statements of the alleged perpetrators and their colleagues .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested the prosecutor \u2019s decision before the court , requesting non - pecuniary damages for the injuries sustained . In his submission before the court , the applicant emphasised that as he had been escorted to the police station by CARDINAL officers , the statement of the third officer should not have been taken into consideration . In addition , the applicant complained that the prosecutor had overlooked important evidence . The only pieces of evidence he had taken into account were the statements of the CARDINAL officers under investigation and the statements of their colleagues , who could not have been impartial . The applicant argued that PERSON , who had accompanied him to the police station on DATE of the incident , should also have been heard by the prosecutors , as he had partially witnessed the alleged ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s complaint , together with the other CARDINAL complaints against the QUANTITY police officers , were analysed jointly and rejected as manifestly ill - founded by a final decision of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the evidence administered during the criminal investigation had sufficed to conclude that \u201c it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that on CARDINAL DATE the defendants had physically abused [ the applicant ] \u201d . The court based its verdict on the discrepancies found between the applicant \u2019s account of the events and the statement given by PERSON More specifically , PERSON declared that he had heard the applicant screaming outside the police station , whereas the applicant claimed that he had been beaten inside . PERSON also declared that the applicant had told him that he had been handcuffed with his hands behind his back , whereas the applicant stated that he had been handcuffed to a radiator . In addition , the injuries on the applicant \u2019s body may very well have been caused during the street brawl . That fact had been confirmed by the QUANTITY police officers who had intervened at the scene , namely GPE , PERSON and PERSON , as well as by the witness , PERSON , who had declared in his statement of CARDINAL DATE that he had been told when he was inside the bar that a group of people were \u201c beating up my brother and PERSON \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
