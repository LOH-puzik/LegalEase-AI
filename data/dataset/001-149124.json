NORP The applicant , Mr ORG , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , of NORP ethnicity , ran an electronics shop in GPE . On DATE a bomb exploded on the street near his shop . He was arrested by the Sri NORP army on suspicion of being involved in the explosion because the bomb had been detonated remotely and his electronics skills made him a suspect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained by the Sri NORP authorities for DATE before being released without charge . He claims that he was interrogated about his links to ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d or \u201c NORP Tigers \u201d ) and ill - treated and tortured by GPE soldiers . He subsequently left GPE with the assistance of an agent on his own passport . He came to GPE via GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and claimed asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused his asylum application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) dismissed his appeal as not credible on the basis of the inconsistencies in his various accounts . Specifically , the ORG commented that aspects of his account were \u201c garbled \u201d and \u201c difficult to follow \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senior immigration judge refused his application for reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . The applicant obtained a medical report dated DATE . The report concluded that the applicant \u2019s account of his scarring was consistent with what he claimed had happened to him in GPE . In particular , the medical report concluded that the tramline scars on his back made it difficult to consider any innocent explanation for his injuries because they could not have been self - inflicted . The report stated that the applicant \u2019s symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post - traumatic stress disorder .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted further representations to ORG on the basis of the medical report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused asylum on the basis of the fresh representations . She did not accept the conclusions of the medical report . The applicant was granted a further in - country right of appeal before the First - tier ORG ( ORG ) ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The judge accepted the findings of the medical report and was therefore satisfied that the applicant had been ill - treated while detained by the Sri NORP army in DATE . However , he observed that the applicant had later been released by the Sri NORP authorities without charge and had not been asked to attend court or report to the authorities . The judge therefore concluded that the Sri NORP authorities had had no further adverse interest in the applicant after his detention . This was consistent with the fact that the applicant had been able to leave GPE in DATE on his own passport without being picked up by the Sri NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The judge further considered and applied the risk factors set out in the country guidance case of ORG ( NORP , ORG updated ) ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . He found that the applicant would not be at risk upon return as a young NORP male who had been detained by the Sri NORP authorities and ill - treated in DATE . Although he accepted that past ill - treatment could be a guide to future risk , he did not agree that the applicant would be at risk of ill - treatment upon return to GPE . His previous record and \u201c extensive scarring \u201d were relevant risk factors but , on balance , the fact that he had been released without charge by the army in DATE and had been able to leave GPE on his own passport was more significant because the authorities would not have released him unless they had not wanted him anymore . The judge therefore concluded that the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE would not breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not apply for permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was detained by ORG ( \u201c UKBA \u201d ) to effect his removal to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant submitted further representations to ORG including an update of the general human rights situation in GPE and a reference to a purported GPE arrest warrant dated DATE supported by a letter from a GPE lawyer attesting its validity .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was interviewed by ORG officials at an immigration removal centre . He claims that they asked him questions about his asylum claim ; that it was clear that they were aware of his past suspected ORG membership and his arrest and detention in GPE ; and that they accused him of having been involved in a bomb blast in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused the applicant \u2019s representations and did not accept that they amounted to a fresh asylum claim . She relied substantially upon the DATE findings of the First - tier ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and concluded that the applicant was of no adverse interest to the GPE authorities and would not be at risk of ill - treatment on return . She further considered that the arrest warrant had been presented solely in an attempt to frustrate his removal and was not genuine given , inter alia , its failure to provide information of the alleged details for which the applicant was said to be wanted by the authorities ; the timing of its production ; the difficulty for accused persons in GPE to obtain copies of arrest warrants ; the ease with which such documents could be fabricated ; and the fact that there was nothing in the applicant \u2019s past to suggest that he would be wanted by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the Secretary of ORG accepted that the applicant was a GPE who had been suspected in DATE of some NORP involvement after a bomb had exploded near his shop . However , considering all of the risk factors set out in LOC ( ORG area DATE Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , she did not accept that he would be at real risk of Article CARDINAL treatment upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued judicial review proceedings seeking to challenge the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE that his further representations did not constitute a fresh claim for the purposes of paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with removal directions to GPE set to take place on a charter flight on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for an order staying his removal until his application for permission to apply for judicial review had been decided . He also filed supplementary grounds of judicial review , including a claim that the Secretary of ORG had failed adequately to consider the arrest warrant ; that ORG had transmitted personal data and details regarding failed asylum seekers to ORG ; and that in light of the transmission of such information he would be at additional risk of ill - treatment , since he would be returning to GPE as an individual with an accepted history of torture and the date of his return on a charter flight would be known to the Sri NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives submitted an application under LAW to stop his removal to GPE . On DATE the Acting President applied Rule CARDINAL to stop the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE . The Judge appointed as Rapporteur under LAW of ORG asked the Government of GPE , under LAW of ORG , to confirm whether the Sri Lankan authorities had been informed that the applicant had made an asylum application in GPE and whether any documents or details pertaining to his asylum application had been provided to GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE ORG granted a stay on removal until determination of the application for permission to apply for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the Agent of the Government of the GPE informed the ORG that a document had been inadvertently passed to ORG in GPE which would have alerted the Sri NORP authorities to the fact that the applicant had previously claimed asylum in GPE . However , the document had not contained any details of the nature of the applicant \u2019s asylum claim and had only provided the date of the asylum claim and the date that the applicant had exhausted his appeal rights following that unsuccessful asylum claim . The Government requested that the ORG lift the interim measure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Acting President refused the ORG \u2019s request to lift the interim measure under LAW and adjourned the application pending the conclusion of the judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for permission to apply for judicial review on the papers . It found the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to be comprehensive and well - reasoned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant renewed his application for permission , relying on the existence of the arrest warrant , the disclosure of his asylum claim to the Sri NORP authorities and his interview with the GPE officials to claim a risk to him of ill - treatment on return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . A rolled up hearing ( i.e. a hearing where , if permission to apply is granted , the hearing on the merits immediately follows ) on the judicial review application took place on CARDINAL DATE . ORG granted the applicant \u2019s renewed application for permission to apply for judicial review but rejected the application on the merits .", "CARDINAL . As regards the disclosure to ORG , the court noted that the Secretary of ORG had accepted that the disclosure of the form , intended to be an internal checklist of data relating to the applicant , was in contravention of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) because it included reference to the fact that the applicant had claimed asylum in GPE and provided the date of the asylum claim and the date that his final appeal had been dismissed . However , ORG did not accept that the disclosure had been deliberate , and noted that there was no suggestion that any details of the applicant \u2019s asylum interview or documents linking him or his family to the ORG had been disclosed . The court considered that the document which had been disclosed told the Sri NORP authorities very little . The court rejected the argument that unlawful disclosure would automatically invalidate any later decision to set removal directions . The question was whether the disclosure changed the applicant \u2019s risk profile so as to amount to a fresh claim . In this respect , the court pointed to country evidence suggesting that the situation seemed more relaxed than before and noted that even in DATE the majority of returned failed asylum seekers were processed relatively quickly and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the arrest warrant , the court acknowledged that its existence was potentially very significant because it might show that the Sri NORP authorities had a continuing adverse interest in the applicant , contrary to the DATE findings of the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . If that were the case , the court said , it would undoubtedly give rise to a realistic prospect of success in any further appeal . The court went on to say that the warrant was a very strange document , since it appeared to relate to proceedings started in DATE and , in the section detailing the particulars of the alleged offence or reasons for the warrant , referred only to a failure to appear before court . The accompanying lawyer \u2019s letter explained that the warrant was \u201c in respect of his absconding from detention \u201d . Yet , ORG commented , nobody had ever suggested that the applicant had absconded from detention or had failed to appear at court . ORG further noted that there was absolutely no evidence of any attempt to execute this or any previous warrant , of any questioning or harassment of the applicant \u2019s family in GPE , or anything else to suggest that the warrant really was a live document which provided valuable evidence about the likely treatment of the applicant if he were returned to GPE . The court also observed that the date of the warrant appeared fortuitous , since the judge in the applicant \u2019s previous appeal had commented that the absence of any warrant was a significant feature and the warrant was dated shortly after that judgment .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as to the interview of the applicant by ORG officials , the court observed that the officials had not seemed to be aware of the existence of an arrest warrant against him ( even though they must have made inquiries about him because they had asked him about his involvement in the bomb blast near his shop ) and they had failed to raise any details of any alleged absconding from detention or failure to appear before a GPE court . Indeed , the officials had appeared to reassure the applicant that they had rehabilitated ORG members and that all the problems in GPE had been solved .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to all of the above , and even bearing in mind the potential significance of the arrest warrant and the presumption which lay behind the prohibition in LAW DATE that mere disclosure of the fact that a person was a failed asylum seeker might expose him to an increased risk , ORG found that there was no change to the risk to the applicant if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The parties subsequently submitted written observations to the ORG on the admissibility and merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . In their further observations , the ORG requested the ORG to adjourn the proceedings . They explained that a new country guidance case concerning GPE ( ORG and others ( post - civil war : returnees ) GPE DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) was pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Section decided to adjourn the examination of the case pending the outcome of the proceedings in ORG and Others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its decision in ORG . The Government subsequently informed the ORG that they would review the applicant \u2019s case in light of that determination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that she did not consider his case to fall within any of the risk categories identified in ORG and Others and that she did not therefore accept that he would be at any real risk of ill - treatment on return to GPE . In particular , she emphasised that ORG in ORG and Others had not found that all NORP , all failed asylum seekers or all students were at risk on return , or that past ORG membership was sufficient to establish a risk . She noted that any risk facing a returnee had to be assessed by reference to the current objectives of ORG , who were mainly concerned with individuals who posed a threat to the stability of postconflict GPE . The Secretary of ORG expressed the view that the applicant would be \u201c of little or no interest \u201d to ORG and that he would accordingly not risk arrest or detention if returned . She remarked that he had not provided evidence of any outstanding arrest warrant or court order that would indicate that he was included on the ORG \u2019s \u201c stop list \u201d and lead to his detention for questioning upon arrival at FAC . Similarly , there was no evidence of his inclusion in a \u201c watch list \u201d that would lead to monitoring in his home area .", "CARDINAL . By letter to the ORG dated DATE the Government confirmed that the applicant \u2019s case had been reviewed and that he had been notified on CARDINAL DATE that his asylum claim had been rejected . They confirmed that it was open to the applicant to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the decision . By letter dated DATE the ORG invited the applicant \u2019s representative to confirm by DATE whether he intended to seek judicial review of the decision and , if not , why not .", "CARDINAL . NORP By reply dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representative requested a stay of proceedings pending consideration of the domestic proceedings . She explained that he had not received notification of the CARDINAL DATE decision . ORG invited her to provide an update by DATE and , in particular , to confirm whether judicial review proceedings had been brought .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representative informed the ORG that she was still awaiting a copy of the letter of CARDINAL November CARDINAL . However , she invited the ORG to proceed to examine the applicant \u2019s complaints . She was asked by the ORG to confirm by CARDINAL DATE whether judicial review proceedings had been brought . By reply dated DATE , she confirmed that no judicial review application had been made .", "CARDINAL . In response to an invitation by the ORG , the applicant and the Government provided updated submissions on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and PERSON ) of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide a right of appeal against an immigration decision made by the Secretary of ORG for ORG , inter alia , on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE appeals in asylum and immigration were heard by the ORG . Section CARDINALA of the CARDINAL Act provided that a party could apply for an order from ORG requiring the ORG to reconsider its decision on the grounds that it had made an error of law . At the relevant time , all applications for reconsideration went through a \u201c filter procedure \u201d , so that it was first made to an authorised immigration judge of the ORG . If the immigration judge refused to make an order for reconsideration , the applicant was able to renew the application to ORG , which would consider the application afresh .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , appeals in asylum and immigration have been heard by the First - tier ORG ) . LAW DATE provides a right of appeal to ORG , with the permission of the First - tier ORG or ORG , on a point of law .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides that further submissions made after an asylum claim has been determined will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered . The submissions will only be significantly different if the content : ( i ) has not already been considered ; and ( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , creates a realistic prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE a claimant could lodge with ORG an application for judicial review of a decision by the Secretary of ORG not to treat further representations as a fresh claim . Pursuant to LAW of ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , permission is required before a judicial review claim can proceed . If ORG refuses permission on the papers , the claimant can request reconsideration at an oral hearing . The court may order an oral hearing for permission with arguments on the substantive merits of the claims to be heard immediately at the hearing if permission is granted ( a rolled up hearing ) .", "CARDINAL . Rule CARDINAL ORG provides that if the ORG grants permission but refuses the application for judicial review on the merits , the claimant can apply for permission to appeal to ORG . An application for permission to appeal can be made to ORG or ORG . If an application is made to ORG , a further application can be made to ORG . If ORG refuses the application on the papers , the claimant can request a hearing unless the case has been found to be totally without merit .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG provides , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies if a person\u2013", "( a ) is to be removed from GPE to a country of which he is a national or citizen ; but", "( b ) does not have a valid passport or other document establishing his identity and nationality or citizenship and permitting him to travel .", "( CARDINAL ) If the country to which the person is to be removed indicates that he will not be admitted to it unless identification data relating to him are provided by the Secretary of ORG , he may provide them with such data .", "( CARDINAL ) In providing identification data , the Secretary of ORG must not disclose whether the person concerned has made a claim for asylum . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG promulgated its decision in GJ and others ( post - civil war : returnees ) GPE [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( ORG ) ( \u201c GJ \u201d ) . In its judgment , ORG concluded that the focus of the Sri NORP government \u2019s concern had changed since the civil war ended in DATE . It said :", "\u201c The NORP in GPE itself is a spent force and there have been no terrorist incidents since the end of the civil war .", "The government \u2019s present objective is to identify NORP activists in the diaspora who are working for GPE separatism and to destabilise the unitary GPE state ... Its focus is on preventing both ( a ) the resurgence of the ORG or any similar NORP separatist organisation and ( b ) the revival of the civil war within GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that if a person was detained by the Sri NORP security services there remained a real risk of ill - treatment or harm requiring international protection . In summary , the ORG identified the following risk factors :", "( CARDINAL ) individuals perceived to be a threat to the integrity of GPE because they were perceived to have a significant role in relation to postconflict GPE separatism within the diaspora and/or a renewal of hostilities within GPE .", "( CARDINAL ) Journalists or human rights activists who had criticised the GPE government , in particular its human rights record , or who were associated with publications critical of the GPE government .", "( CARDINAL ) Individuals who had given evidence to the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission implicating the GPE security forces , armed forces or GPE authorities in alleged war crimes .", "( CARDINAL ) Individuals whose names appeared on a computerised \u201c stop \u201d list ( a list of those against whom there was an extant court order or arrest warrant ) accessible at the airport .", "CARDINAL . The ORG explained that the Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 approach was based on sophisticated intelligence , both as to activities within GPE and in the diaspora . It noted that the Sri NORP authorities were aware that many NORP travelled abroad as economic migrants and also that everyone in GPE had had some level of involvement with the ORG during the civil war . It continued :", "\u201c In post - conflict GPE , an individual \u2019s past history will be relevant only to the extent that it is perceived by the GPE authorities as indicating a present risk to the unitary GPE state or ORG . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
