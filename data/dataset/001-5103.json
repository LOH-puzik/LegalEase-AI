On CARDINAL DATE a warrant of arrest ( PERSON ) was issued against her . The warrant of arrest was based , among other grounds , on the fear that the applicant might continue terrorist activities .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the request of a radio journalist to allow an interview with the applicant because such an interview would conflict with the purpose of the detention on remand as provided for in LAW of LAW ( Strafprozeordnung \u2013 see relevant domestic law below ) . The ORG considered that in respect of a declaration made by the applicant during the trial , it had to be expected that the applicant would explain and advocate ideological positions of the ORG , which would amount to a new act of participation in a terrorist organisation pursuant to ORG ( Strafgesetzbuch - see relevant domestic law below ) . According to the warrant of arrest , the purpose of the detention on remand was inter alia to prevent the applicant from committing further terrorist acts as defined in LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request of a filmmaker to permit the filming of a visit of the applicant 's mother to her daughter in prison . ORG , relying again on LAW of LAW , considered that the film could enable the applicant to influence supporters of the ORG in order to strengthen their support for the latter .

She explained this break with the former strategy of the ORG with the \u201c experiences and the realisation that we [ the ORG ] ourselves do not have answers to many questions and that we , alone , can not and do not want to answer them , as the draft of a global political vision can not be the matter of CARDINAL group [ ... ] like the ORG \u201d .", "She concluded the declaration with the following statement :", "\u201c The fight for a humane future , for a world without government , in which people can live in liberty and self - determination , is still on the agenda . The reversal of the social developments is still a matter for which one must fight . Those who think that they have driven us into a dead - end street , should not rejoice too soon . They should know that we will fight for ourselves . There will be no return to the old strategy as a political concept , but we have our right to self - defence . I do not think that we will watch our destruction without resistance and I wish that everyone would think about our future . \u201d", "In a further declaration of CARDINAL DATE she commented on the murder of the GPE soldier GPE by the ORG :", "\u201c The shooting of the GI Edward Pimental was CARDINAL of the worst mistakes of the ORG . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant read out a statement on the history of the ORG in which she critically commented on the strategy of violent attacks which the ORG had followed in the past . In this context she clearly admitted her commitment to the ORG and to its original aims as she stated :", "\u201c Although I believe DATE that we made many mistakes \u2013 our beginnings and our fight for a different world were at any time well - founded and justified , and that fight has to be conducted as a confrontation . Now the time has come for drawing conclusions from these experiences , because they are important for the determination of future fights and because others should not repeat our mistakes simply because we do not talk about them .", "[ ... ]", "Where the ORG is concerned , I have written my whole text in the first person of the plural \u2013 my personal history has been closely linked to this group for DATE now and thus I believe that I carry the responsibility for its whole history . \u201d", "She subsequently condemned again the shooting of the GPE soldier and asked the question of \u201c how people who had stood up to fight for a more just and more humane world , could have moved away so far from their original ideals ... \u201d .", "In this connection she tried to explain the reasons which had finally driven her to join the ORG . At the end of her statement , she had this to say about the development of the ORG :", "\u201c Our limitation of vision and our dogmatism continuously prevented critical questions and a self - critical reflection . As far as we were concerned , it lasted through DATE until we finally broke with it . \u201d", "She concluded her declaration with the following words :", "\u201c There will be no relevant anti - power here , as long as we DATE and I do not refer to the ORG DATE continue to refuse to understand our own history .
