GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant practices as an ophthalmologist . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE he held a license as a statutory health insurance physician ( PERSON vertrags\u00e4rztlichen PERSON ) . Having renounced his licence , he exclusively treats patients in private practice .", "On DATE ORG ( GPE ) ordered the applicant to participate in the medical emergency services organised by ORG , KVSA ) . His duty was suspended until determination of the modalities of his remuneration .", "On DATE the KVSA informed the applicant about the modalities of his remuneration during emergency services . He was further informed that , notwithstanding the fact that he was not a member of the KVSA , his services and remunerations within the framework of the emergency services were subject to the ORG 's supervision .", "On DATE the applicant informed the KVSA that he refused to serve in the emergency service and would only be willing to serve in an emergency service which was organised by ORG .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that he was statutorily obliged to participate in the emergency service . They pointed out that the emergency service was a common project by the KVSA and ORG and that all pertinent decisions were taken jointly by both associations .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a motion against ORG . He argued that he was not obliged to participate in the emergency service organised by the KVSA , because he did not practice as a statutory health insurance physician . He further alleged that the order lacked a sufficient legal basis .", "On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) dismissed the applicant 's motion as being unfounded . According to that court , the impugned order was compatible with the pertinent law . The emergency service was set up jointly by ORG and by the KVSA in order to avoid overlapping emergency services .", "The pertinent provisions did not violate the applicant 's rights under LAW . The infringement on the applicant 's right to freedom of profession was neither disproportionate nor excessive . Furthermore , there was no violation of the right to equal treatment , as all medical practitioners were equally obliged to provide emergency services to their patients outside consultation TIME . This duty constituted an intrinsic part of a medical practitioner 's occupation . The organisation of emergency services released the medical practitioner from the obligation to be available for his patients \u201c around the clock \u201d , at TIME and during DATE . Having regard to the fact that all medical practitioners DATE and not only those who held a license as statutory health insurance physicians DATE profited from this service , it was justified to order all practitioners to participate in the emergency service .", "The fact that the emergency service was organised by the KVSA did not turn the applicant into a member of that organisation ; he merely profited from its organisational structures .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) refused to allow the applicant leave to appeal . Further to the administrative court 's considerations , ORG found that the duties imposed on the applicant were not excessive , as it was merely envisaged to oblige the applicant to serve on DATE during a DATE - interval . ORG further considered that it was justified to oblige all medical practitioners , irrespective of the fact if they were willing to assure \u201c around the clock \u201d availability to their own patients . The system could only function if , as a matter of principle , all physicians concerned took part in it .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint as there was no indication of a violation of the applicant 's basic rights ( application no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "According to section CARDINAL LAW of the LAW on the Associations of Medical Practitioners for Saxony - Anhalt ( PERSON \u00fcber die NORP f\u00fcr GPE ) ORG is entitled to issue regulations on medical emergency service .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG professional Code of Conduct ( PERSON der GPE ) provides that every resident medical practitioner is obliged to participate in emergency service . Regulations on the organisation of the emergency service have been jointly issued by ORG , representing all medical practitioners , and by the KVSA , representing only those physicians practicing under the public health insurance scheme .", "Non - compliance with the obligations under ORG professional Code of Conduct can lead to disciplinary proceedings . The disciplinary court has the capacity to issue formal reprimands , impose fines and to advice the authorities to revoke a physician 's license ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Associations of Medical Practitioners ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
