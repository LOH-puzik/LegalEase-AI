He is a university lecturer and researcher in private law and is a member of the NORP civil service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was appointed to a post at ORG , GPE , which at the material time was a NORP overseas territory . The holder of the post was required to live in the territory .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to be registered on the electoral rolls for his place of residence . He was entered on the general electoral roll for the municipality of ORG but was refused registration on the special electoral roll for the DATE ballot on self - determination . On DATE the mayor of Noum\u00e9a notified him that he had been deemed not to satisfy the residence requirements laid down in section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE in that he could not show that he had been permanently resident in GPE since DATE . The applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was signed . It laid down transitional arrangements for the political organisation of GPE and for its move to self - determination . It altered GPE constitutional status , making it a sui generis territory with its own specially designed institutions . LAW was consequently amended to provide that the measures required for the implementation of the Accord were to be laid down in an institutional LAW .", "CARDINAL . Institutional Act no . CARDINAL of DATE brought about the twelfth institutional reform in GPE since DATE , giving it its ninth different status since DATE . It strengthened ORG 's powers and introduced a DATE residence requirement for taking part in the election of members of ORG and the provincial assemblies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to be registered on the special electoral roll for the elections to ORG and the provincial assemblies on CARDINAL DATE in the municipality of Noum\u00e9a . He was refused registration on the ground that he could not show that he had been permanently resident in GPE in DATE prior to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for a review of the conformity of the LAW with the LAW , and for registration on the special electoral roll for the municipality of ORG . On DATE the court dismissed his applications .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG , complaining that ORG had found against him despite the fact that the refusal to register him contravened various provisions of domestic and international law , in particular LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , DATE , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE , LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , LAW and the Citizen of DATE , Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the new Criminal Code , and the Preamble to LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal on the ground that the conditions for taking part in elections to ORG and the provincial assemblies followed from an institutional LAW which ranked as constitutional law in that it reproduced the wording of ORG , which itself had constitutional status by virtue of LAW . It dismissed the applicant 's arguments concerning the provisions of the Convention , holding in particular that the precedence accorded to international undertakings did not apply in the domestic legal order in relation to provisions ranking as constitutional law .", "CARDINAL .

The question which the ORG must decide , therefore , is whether this differentiation is compatible with LAW .

It may , however , express its view on whether or not these requirements are excessive . In the present case , the ORG has to decide whether the requirements have the purpose or effect of restricting in a disproportionate manner , given the nature and purpose of the referendums in question , the participation of the ' concerned ' population of GPE .", "...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL ORG considers , first , that the cut - off points adopted do not have a disproportionate effect , given the nature and purpose of the referendums in question , on the authors ' situation , particularly since their non - participation in the first referendum manifestly has no consequences for nearly all of them as regards the final referendum .", "CARDINAL The ORG further considers that each cut - off point should provide a means of evaluating the strength of the link to the territory , in order that those residents able to prove a sufficiently strong tie are able to participate in each referendum . The ORG considers that , in the present case , the difference in the cut - off points for each ballot is linked to the issue being decided in each vote : the CARDINAL-year cut - off point DATE rather than DATE as for the first ballot DATE is justified by the time frame for self - determination , it being made clear that other ties are also taken into account for the final referendum .", "CARDINAL Noting that the length of residence criterion is not discriminatory , the ORG considers that , in the present case , the cut - off points set for the referendum of DATE and referendums from DATE are not excessive inasmuch as they are in keeping with the nature and purpose of these ballots , namely a self - determination process involving the participation of persons able to prove sufficiently strong ties to the territory whose future is being decided . This being the case , these cut - off points do not appear to be disproportionate with respect to a decolonization process involving the participation of residents who , over and above their ethnic origin or political affiliation , have helped , and continue to help , build GPE through their sufficiently strong ties to the territory .", "CARDINAL .
