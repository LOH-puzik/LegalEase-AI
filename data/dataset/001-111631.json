The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that at TIME on DATE he had been taken to the local police station in the town of GPE in connection with an armed assault that had taken place DATE . He further alleged that his arrest had not been recorded and that he had been released TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( ORG ) . The proceedings were instituted upon the complaint of the victim , PERSON , who lived in the same building as the applicant . According to PERSON , at TIME on DATE the applicant , who had been wearing a mask , had attacked him on the ground floor of their building , hit him on the head with a metal rod and grabbed his briefcase , which had been full of expensive jewellery .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was formally arrested on suspicion of having committed the above - mentioned offence . The arrest report was signed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was formally charged with robbery under the above - mentioned Article . The charge sheet specified that following the incident the victim had pursued the applicant , who had been forced to drop the briefcase and flee . It was signed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator applied to ORG to have the applicant detained for DATE on the grounds that he had previous convictions , the offence belonged to the category of serious crimes and that , if at large , he would abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined and granted the investigator \u2019s application , finding that the case materials provided sufficient grounds for believing that the applicant might abscond and obstruct the investigation , having regard to the nature and degree of dangerousness of the offence in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator sought to have the applicant \u2019s detention extended by a further DATE . The application stated that a number of examinations had been carried out during the investigation , including chemical and biological examinations and an examination of the traces left by the crime . However , an additional biological examination had to be carried out and the charge amended . The investigator argued that the applicant , if released , would abscond since he had committed a serious crime and might commit further offences as he had previous convictions . He had not admitted his guilt and would therefore obstruct the investigation . The investigator submitted , in support of his application , a number of case materials , such as the decision to institute criminal proceedings , the arrest report and the decision to bring charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the investigator \u2019s application . The applicant was present at that hearing and was seated next to his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected to the investigator \u2019s application and asked the court to release him on bail . He submitted at the outset that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence . The fact that he had committed offences in the past did not justify detaining him in this particular case . ORG stated in that regard that it was not examining the case on the merits , including the question of the applicant \u2019s guilt , but was examining the validity of the application for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . There was a difference between the issue of guilt and that of the existence of a reasonable suspicion .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that there was no concrete evidence justifying his detention . In response to a request by the applicant to produce evidence , the investigator admitted that no such evidence was available . He submitted that a number of examinations had been ordered and that it was necessary to take a blood sample in order to determine whether the applicant \u2019s blood group corresponded to the traces of blood found on the victim \u2019s shoes . The presiding judge then asked the investigator to present all the materials of the case . Shortly afterwards , the judge withdrew to the deliberation room .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having examined the investigator \u2019s application and the materials confirming that it was well - founded , decided to grant the application in part and to extend the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE until DATE on the ground that on DATE the investigator had ordered a biological examination which had not yet been completed . Referring to LAW ORG ) , the court further decided to refuse the applicant \u2019s request for bail , on the ground that he was accused of a serious crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal . He submitted , inter alia , that there was no reasonable suspicion of his having committed an offence . The documents submitted by the investigator in support of his application , such as the decision to institute criminal proceedings , the arrest report and the decision to bring charges , were not sufficient to found a reasonable suspicion . Moreover , ORG had refused , in general terms , to address the issue of the existence of a reasonable suspicion . The applicant further contested the allegation that he might commit further offences , which was based solely on the fact that he had previous convictions . Furthermore , there was no concrete evidence suggesting that he would abscond , and the need to carry out an additional biological examination could not serve as a ground for his continued detention . Lastly , the applicant argued that the proceedings in ORG had not been adversarial and had violated the principle of equality of arms since the presiding judge , having failed at the hearing to examine any evidence on which to found a reasonable suspicion , had received the entire case file from the investigator before withdrawing to the deliberation room . The applicant had neither had access to any of those materials nor the possibility to comment on them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal upheld the decision of ORG . It stated that the investigating authority had submitted certain evidence substantiating the applicant \u2019s guilt which confirmed his involvement in the event . Thus , there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed an offence . ORG found that there was a need to extend the applicant \u2019s detention , having regard to the dangerousness and nature of the alleged offence and the fact that he might abscond and obstruct the investigation . It dismissed his application for bail on the same grounds . It considered that the decision of ORG to extend detention and refuse bail was well - founded and reasoned and that there were no grounds to amend that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator lodged an application seeking to have the applicant \u2019s detention extended by DATE on the same grounds as before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the investigator \u2019s application . The applicant was present at that hearing and was seated next to his lawyer . He objected to the investigator \u2019s application and asked the court to release him on bail . ORG decided to grant the application and to extend the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE until DATE on the ground that the investigator had ordered a number of examinations which had not yet been completed . The court further decided to refuse the applicant \u2019s request for bail on the same ground as before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charges against the applicant were amended . In addition to the original charge the applicant was also accused of recidivism and attempted murder .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prosecutor approved the indictment and the case was sent to ORG for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to leave the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE unexamined on the ground that the investigation had been completed and the case transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG claiming that his detention had been unlawful since DATE and requesting his release . A similar application was made to the chief of the detention facility where the applicant was held .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the chief of the detention facility refused the request , referring to LAW ORG , on the ground that the case had been transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application of DATE on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to set the applicant \u2019s criminal case down for trial . The decision stated that the applicant \u2019s detention was to remain unchanged .", "CARDINAL . In the courtroom , during the proceedings before ORG , the applicant was placed in a metal cage measuring CARDINAL sq . m. He was represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested to be released from the cage . ORG decided to adjourn the examination of that question .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE the applicant challenged the presiding judge . He submitted , inter alia , that his placement in the metal cage had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment and also violated the principle of equality of arms and the presumption of innocence , despite which the presiding judge had failed to take any measures to eliminate those encroachments on his rights . It appears that this challenge was dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that following the dismissal of that challenge he had again requested to be released from the cage , but the court had refused his request on the ground that it had no other means of ensuring security in the courtroom . The Government alleged that no further steps had been taken by the applicant in that connection following the dismissal of the challenge .", "CARDINAL . During the entire proceedings before ORG the applicant was kept in the metal cage . The proceedings lasted DATE and included CARDINAL public hearings at which the applicant was present . The hearings lasted TIME . It appears that the case attracted public attention in the town of GPE and that the hearings were attended by the applicant \u2019s family and friends and numerous other members of the public , including other inhabitants of the town and many students .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged appeals on points of law against the decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant asked ORG to revoke his detention order or otherwise release him on bail . He submitted that he had been in detention for DATE . There were no grounds justifying his continued detention since all the witnesses had already been examined and he could not obstruct the proceedings . The prosecutor objected to the request , stating that the applicant could not be released on bail because he was accused of a serious crime . ORG decided to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that the examination of the case was not yet over and there were insufficient grounds to revoke his detention or release him on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to return the applicant \u2019s appeals of DATE and CARDINAL DATE for lack of merit .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the prosecutor decided to drop the charges and sought an order from ORG terminating the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the ground that the evidence obtained was not sufficient to support the charges against him .", "CARDINAL .
