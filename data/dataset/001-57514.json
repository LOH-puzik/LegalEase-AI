ORG On DATE , PERSON challenged the chambre du conseil \u2019s order in ORG of ORG .

At the same time , however , it decided that the arrest warrant should remain in force .", "As regards whether there was sufficient evidence of guilt and of serious and exceptional circumstances relating to public safety , ORG founded its judgment on the following reasons :", "\" It is to be noted that even in his own account of the state of the firm \u2019s affairs , given in the form of submissions , the accused conceded that the balance sheet of DATE was inaccurate , although he denied any fraudulent intent and stated that after verification of sums owed to the firm its liabilities came to MONEY , against which he set primarily the expected outcome of a hypothetical action against a third party , whose value he said could \u2018 reasonably\u2019 be put at MONEY ;", "Account must be taken of his admissions concerning the irregular transactions referred to in report CARDINAL of the Verviers police and in the record of his examination by the investigating judge on DATE , corroborated by the admissions of the co - accused PERSON , in police report CARDINAL , although the accused now denies their extent ;", "The foregoing provides sufficient evidence of guilt to justify the impugned arrest warrant , given the extremely large sums involved , the needs of the investigation , which the accused disputed to no avail , and the risk of his attempting to evade justice despite his protestations of good faith and the good intentions he professes - all considerations which are set out in the warrant appealed against , which are serious and exceptional , and which required his arrest in the interests of public safety . \"", "As to the alleged unlawfulness of the warrant , ORG noted , in the first place , that the copy given to the applicant mentioned that the original identified the investigating judge and was signed by him . The court added : \" It [ could ] not be seriously questioned ... that the copy given to the [ applicant ] bore DATE instead of CARDINAL DATE purely as a result of a clerical error of no consequence \" . The court concluded that these circumstances in no way made the arrest arbitrary and could not have prejudiced the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed on points of law to ORG on DATE , putting forward CARDINAL grounds . Firstly , he maintained that mandatory formal requirements had not been complied with , as the arrest warrant was unsigned and the attached order committing him to prison bore DATE . Additionally , he considered the reasoning of ORG judgment to be unclear and contradictory . Lastly , he stated that ORG had relied on reports CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Verviers police - documents that had not been communicated to the accused ; in this connection he relied on Article CARDINAL paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article DATE , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "As regards the first ground of appeal , it noted that the formalities provided for in LAW for serving an arrest warrant were not mandatory and that failure to comply with them did not entail nullity . It reiterated ORG remarks as to the lack of a signature and the error in the date and concluded that there had been no infringement of the rights of the defence or of the principle of personal liberty .", "With respect to the second ground of appeal , ORG held that the reasons given for the judgment appealed against were neither unclear nor contradictory , as the judgment was based not only on the applicant \u2019s admissions concerning the irregular transactions referred to in reports CARDINAL and CARDINAL but also on the extremely large sums involved , the needs of the investigation and the risk that the accused might try to evade justice . ORG inferred from this that there were serious and exceptional circumstances affecting public safety .", "As to the third ground , ORG held that LAW was concerned with the exercise of the rights of the defence in trial courts and not with procedure followed in the matter of detention on remand . Furthermore , the LAW precluded communication of the file to the accused or his counsel at this stage in the proceedings ; this was apparent from section CARDINAL , taken together with the final paragraph of CARDINAL . ORG had accordingly not been able to \" conclude from the non - communication of the file that there had been any infringement of the rights of the defence \" .", "CARDINAL .
