He was also ordered to pay the company ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation for the latter \u2019s pecuniary damage . Having first found the official receiver competent to act on behalf of the company in the proceedings , and having rejected the applicant \u2019s argument according to which the company \u2019s compensation claim for pecuniary damage had been submitted after the relevant time limit had elapsed , ORG found him guilty as charged . It considered that he had failed to prove that he had any lawful right to refuse to hand the shares over to the official receiver . As the company had been prevented from selling the shares because of his resistance , it had suffered financial loss in the form of lost interest it would have earned from the sales price had the shares been sold in DATE for the sales price of ORG CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) which was the estimated sales price at the relevant time .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to re - open the criminal proceedings .
