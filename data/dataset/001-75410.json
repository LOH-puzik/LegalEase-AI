{"ITEMID": "001-75410", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "UPTON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s grandfather made a will in DATE ( and a codicil in DATE ) in which he left his residuary estate ( after payment of certain annuities ) on trust for his children in varying shares in the first place and , after they died , for their children . If a branch failed , the estate was to pass to the other branches . The grandfather died in DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s grandfather had CARDINAL children . The oldest was the applicant \u2019s father , born in DATE . The second oldest , born in DATE , died in DATE without issue . The third child , the only daughter , was born in DATE and the youngest child was born in DATE .", "In DATE , the youngest son married PERSON . CARDINAL children were born .", "In DATE PERSON ( nee Bray ) left her husband and went , with the CARDINAL children , to live with his brother , the oldest son . The applicant was born to DATE . In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother died , and in DATE the applicant was adopted by his father .", "In DATE , the applicant \u2019s grandfather \u2019s daughter died without issue .", "The applicant \u2019s father died in DATE , providing in his will that all of his estate passed to his son , the applicant . He was entitled at his death to a CARDINAL share of the income from his father \u2019s estate .", "The applicant claimed , in ORG , to be entitled to his father \u2019s CARDINAL share of the income . The executors considered that he was not entitled to any share because , as he was illegitimate , he could not inherit as a \u201c child \u201d of his father under the DATE will and codicil .", "On DATE in ORG of ORG , Judge PERSON found that the applicant was not entitled to take any share under his grandfather \u2019s will . He found that it was a well - established principle that a gift to a child or children was , apart from statute , to be construed as a gift to legitimate children unless it was possible to find a contrary intention in the will . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE , which improve the position of illegitimate children ( including in the interpretation of wills ) , only apply to events after DATE , and so could not assist the applicant . Other statutes , which dealt with the effect of legitimation where a child \u2019s parents married after he was born , did not assist the applicant as the applicant \u2019s parents never married .", "LAW , which was in force at the time of the applicant \u2019s grandfather \u2019s will and codicil ( DATE and DATE ) provided that adoption did not confer any right to or interest in property as a child of the adopter , unless a contrary intention appeared in any disposition such as a will . There was no contrary intention and so at the date of death adopted children could not benefit under the will . Again , later amendments to the law were of no help to the applicant because they only applied prospectively .", "Finally , Judge PERSON considered the points raised by the applicant in connection with the Convention . He noted that LAW Protocol No . CARDINAL applied only to existing possessions , but that the applicant had never been entitled to any of his grandfather \u2019s estate . He also noted that the litigation was between private individuals , where the cases of ORG and Inze had both involved claims against the ORG . Finally , he recalled that the legislation relating to adoption and illegitimacy had been changed so that there was now no discrimination on grounds of adoption or illegitimacy save in cases where the will was made before the relevant date . The applicant \u2019s criticism was therefore criticism that the amending legislation was not retrospective so as to affect the interpretation of existing instruments . He considered that there were sound reasons , such as the need for legal certainty , for not making such legislation retrospective . He thus agreed with the applicant that the effect of the rules as to legitimacy and adoption in a case where the will was made in DATE discriminated against him as an illegitimate son of his father , but he did not consider that the position was altered by LAW DATE .", "Judge PERSON therefore concluded that the applicant was not a legitimate child of his grandfather within the meaning of his grandfather \u2019s will , and that the disputed share of the estate passed to the applicant \u2019s grandfather \u2019s youngest son . He also refused leave to appeal , but , according to the Government , extended the time for appealing .", "On DATE , after the time limit for appealing had expired , the applicant filed an applicant \u2019s notice with ORG , seeking an extension of the time for filing a notice . On DATE he sought a further lengthy extension of time in which to lodge a bundle of documents and generally to progress his application . An extension was granted to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG , explaining that he would be unable to comply with the deadline as he had gone to GPE . He indicated that he wished to withdraw his application and sought a refund of his fee . He was sent \u201c dismissal with consent \u201d forms to complete and return , and was told that if the defects in his bundle were not remedied by DATE , his application would be dismissed unless he provided a sufficient reason . Nothing more was heard from the applicant , and on DATE the application was dismissed for failure to complete the dismissal with consent forms , and for failure to progress the case within ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant sought permission to reinstate , and ORG ) dismissed the application after a hearing on DATE . Lord Justice PERSON noted that the effect of reinstatement would be to grant an extension of time of over a year , and he could see no grounds for granting such a substantial extension . Time limits were there to be complied with unless there were good reasons for failing to do so , and the applicant had shown no good reasons . Lord Justice PERSON also referred to the applicant \u2019s reliance on the DATE period for bringing proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW . However , the action before the court was not a proceeding under sections DATE CARDINAL of that LAW , and the CARDINAL-month period had no application . Lord Justice PERSON did not accept the applicant \u2019s submissions that it was not his fault that he was so substantially out of time , and refused to reinstate the earlier application which had been struck out . The judge mentioned in passing that he considered that the proposed appeal had no real prospect of success , and indeed that the judge \u2019s conclusions as to the effect of LANGUAGE statute law were plainly right . He underlined , however , that the application was dismissed for failure to provide good reason for the substantial delay .", "LAW DATE , which entered into force on DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
