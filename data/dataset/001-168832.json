NORP By letter dated DATE the Government of GPE were notified of the applications and were asked if they wished to exercise their right to intervene pursuant to LAW . However , they did not seek to exercise this right .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was arrested by the army at CARDINAL on DATE in relation to CARDINAL attacks on army patrols in GPE . He was handed over to the police at CARDINAL and he was visited by his father and examined by a police surgeon shortly thereafter . No injuries or complaints were noted .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL to CARDINAL the first applicant was interviewed by CARDINAL detectives .

His father was admitted to the interview room at CARDINAL and shown the statements of admission .", "CARDINAL . That evening the first applicant was again medically examined and no complaints or injuries were noted .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was arrested by the army at CARDINAL on DATE in relation to the same CARDINAL attacks on army patrols . He was transferred to police custody at CARDINAL on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During his first interview , which took place between PERSON and CARDINAL.CARDINAL , he admitted to being a member of PERSON na h\u2019Eireann .", "CARDINAL .

He further indicated the location of this incident by reference to a map .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was visited by a relative at TIME . He was interviewed again from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , and from CARDINAL onward . During the second of these interviews he made a written confession in which he admitted to acting as a lookout during both attacks and carrying shotgun cartridges across the border into GPE .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL on DATE he was visited by his parents , who declined to countersign his confessions . He was medically examined on TIME of CARDINAL DATE and again on TIME DATE . On both occasions he denied any ill - treatment and no relevant sign of injury was detected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 trial took place from DATE . The first applicant was charged with CARDINAL count of membership of a proscribed organisation , CARDINAL counts of conspiring to communicate information likely to be of use to terrorists , CARDINAL count of causing grievous bodily harm and CARDINAL of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm . He entered \u201c not guilty \u201d pleas to all counts . However , he was found to be guilty as charged and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .

He was found to be guilty as charged and sentenced to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He did not appeal against either conviction or sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 cases were referred to ORG in GPE by ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) on the grounds that there was a real possibility that ORG would consider that the manner in which they were detained and interviewed involved significant breaches of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and of other protections which they should have enjoyed ( namely , access to a solicitor before or during the police interviews and the presence of a family member or independent adult ) ; that in consequence of those breaches the admissions made were unreliable and/or inadmissible ; and that in the circumstances their convictions were unsafe .", "CARDINAL . Judgment was delivered by ORG on DATE . The court noted that at the time of the ORG trial confessions made in breach of LAW were admissible under the emergency provisions legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) unless obtained by torture or inhuman or degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the first applicant , the court held that although the confessions had been obtained in breach of LAW because he had not had access to a solicitor , independent adult or family member , in light of the statutory background it could not conclude that the admission of the confessions rendered the conviction unsafe . In particular , it noted that the confessions were not contradictory or inaccurate , they were not challenged at trial , and the conviction was not appealed . The first applicant \u2019s appeal was therefore dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The court also found no evidence that the second applicant \u2019s conviction was unsafe . In reaching this conclusion , it noted that he had pleaded \u201c guilty \u201d to most of the offences and had not challenged the admissibility or reliability of his confessions in contesting the CARDINAL counts to which he pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d . The second applicant \u2019s appeal was also dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG certified that the following point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision which ought to be considered by ORG :", "\u201c Where in a trial conducted in accordance with the then applicable statutory emergency provisions a young person was convicted of an offence on the basis of a confession admitted at the time of trial by virtue of the statutory emergency provisions but in circumstances in which such a confession would otherwise have been excluded as having been obtained in a manner which contravened LAW , ORG and the Taking of Statements and the ORG LAW and where such confession was obtained in circumstances which did not provide safeguards subsequently and currently considered to be necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice , does such conviction fall to be considered as unsafe ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG refused to grant leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also refused permission on the grounds that the application did not raise an arguable point of law which it ought to consider and that there was no real possibility that the court would find the convictions to be unsafe .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c Where a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment in GPE , the Commission\u2014", "( a ) may at any time refer the conviction to ORG , and", "... ... ...", "( CARDINAL ) A reference under subsection ( CARDINAL ) of a person \u2019s conviction shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person under LAW against the conviction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In any criminal proceedings for a scheduled offence a statement made by the accused may be given in evidence by the prosecution in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of subsection ( CARDINAL ) below .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If , in any such proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a statement made by the accused , prima facie evidence is adduced that the accused was subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment in order to induce him to make the statement , the court shall , unless the prosecution satisfies them that the statement was not so obtained , exclude the statement or , if it has been received in evidence , shall either continue the trial disregarding the statement or direct that the trial shall be restarted before a differently constituted court ( before whom the statement in question shall be inadmissible ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The effect of section CARDINAL was to suspend the rules and practice governing the admissibility of confessions for the period during which the legislation was in force . However , immediately following the implementation of the legislative changes , judges dealing with cases governed by the DATE Act declared that they retained a discretion to exclude what was , by statute , otherwise admissible evidence ( see , for example , R v. ORG , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . A note preceding the Judges\u2019 Rules indicated they did not affect the principles :", "\u201c ( c ) That every person at any stage of an investigation should be able to communicate and to consult privately with a solicitor . This is so even though he is in custody provided that in such a case no unreasonable delay or hindrance is caused to the processes of investigation or the administration of justice by his doing so .", "... ... ...", "( e ) That it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person , equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person , that it shall have been voluntary .", "The principle set out in paragraph ( e ) above is overriding and applicable in all cases . Within that principle the following Rules are put forward as a guide to police officers conducting investigations . Non - conformity with these Rules may render answers and statements liable to be excluded from evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Administrative Directions accompanied the Judges\u2019 Rules . Paragraph CARDINAL provided that , as far as practical , children and young persons should only be interviewed in the presence of a parent or guardian or , if that was not possible , a person who was not a police officer and was of the same sex as the child . ORG guidance indicated that this requirement should be seen as applying to anyone under DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL ) , a person in custody should be allowed to speak on the telephone to his solicitor or to his friends provided that no hindrance was reasonably likely to be caused to the process of investigation or to the administration of justice .", "CARDINAL . The police code applicable at the relevant time provided that :", "\u201c Police pursuing inquiries involving children and young persons must bear in mind that where at all possible children and young persons should be interviewed in the presence of a parent / guardian or other adult friend , and that the venue selected for the interview should not be one which could be calculated to intimidate , unduly embarrass or frighten the person interviewed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE Advocate v GPE [ DATE ] HCJAC CARDINAL , DATE ORG CARDINAL ORG of GPE sitting with CARDINAL judges ) had held , notwithstanding the decision of ORG in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG DATE , that it was not a breach of LAW read in conjunction with LAW ) for the ORG to rely at trial on admissions made by a detainee while being interviewed without having had access to a solicitor , since the guarantees otherwise available under the NORP system were sufficient to avoid the risk of any unfairness .", "CARDINAL . However , in ORG unanimously found that PERSON had been incorrectly decided as ORG of Justiciary had erred in its interpretation of PERSON . ORG judgment was to be understood as laying down CARDINAL statements of principle : that access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect ; and that the rights of the defence would be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer were used for a conviction . There was room for a certain flexibility in the application of these requirements but they did not permit a systematic departure from it .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG did not accept that the guarantees otherwise available under the NORP system were sufficient to secure a fair trial . Those guarantees were commendable but were , in truth , incapable of removing the disadvantage that a detainee would suffer if , not having access to a solicitor for advice before he was questioned by police , he made incriminating admissions or said something which enabled the police to obtain incriminating evidence from other sources which was then used against him at his trial .", "CARDINAL . That being said , ORG indicated that where incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer were used for a conviction , it would only be appropriate to quash that conviction if it was clear that there was insufficient evidence for it without the evidence of the police interview , or taking all the circumstances of the trial into account , there was a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict had they not had that evidence before them .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG held that , in the interests of legal certainty , the ruling should not permit the reopening of closed cases , but rather should only apply to those cases which had not yet gone to trial , to cases where the trial was still in progress , and to appeals that had been brought timeously . For all closed cases it was a matter for ORG to decide whether the cases should be referred back to ORG and for that court to decide what course it ought to take if a reference were to be made to it by the Commission ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
