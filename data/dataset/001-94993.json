NORP The applicant company is registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a ORG - owned company started construction of an apartment building , with the ground floor reserved for office space . After several changes of ownership of the unfinished building , another ORG company ( L. ) was designated as its owner . A subsequent administrative decision allowed a third ORG company ( M. ) to become a co - owner of the building .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , with the apparent approval of ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) , concluded a contract with a private company ( I. ) . The latter undertook to finish the construction works in exchange for a share of the office space on the ground floor of the building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE I. concluded a contract with the applicant company , under which the applicant company would finance the construction work and in exchange become the owner of a part of the office space in the building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE M. initiated court proceedings against L. , NORP and the GPE for annulment of the DATE contract , as interfering with its right to a part of the building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company initiated court proceedings against NORP , claiming damages for ORG 's failure to fulfil its part of the contract in time . On DATE the applicant company requested ORG to transfer the office space to which it had rights under the contract concluded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company initiated court proceedings against PERSON , ORG and the PERSON municipality , requesting confirmation of its property right over the office space claimed from ORG under the contract of DATE . It noted that it had invested MONEY ( ORG ) in the construction of the building under that contract and that it was using the relevant office space , but that it was still unable to exercise all rights over that property as its rightful owner . It added that \u201c due to ORG 's actions , [ the applicant company ] was dragged into court proceedings against PERSON , the GPE , etc . \u201d The applicant company asked the court to recognise its property right over specifically identified office space in the relevant building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company asked the court to discontinue the proceedings it had initiated against NORP because the latter had accepted its claims and transferred the relevant office space . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant company 's request .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE ORG rejected the claims of PERSON as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and adopted a new one , allowing PERSON 's claims in full .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company asked for a revision of the judgment of DATE . It complained that it had not been joined as a party to the proceedings , even though its property rights had been affected . Moreover , its court action lodged on DATE had not been examined and the judgment of DATE had prejudged the outcome of those proceedings . The applicant company emphasised that it had withdrawn only its court action against ORG and not that against PERSON and the GPE for recognition of its property right over the part of the building which it had been occupying throughout the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company 's request for revision . It found that the applicant company was not the owner of the disputed part of the building . It also found that on DATE I. had concluded the contract with the applicant company in bad faith , since it had been aware of the ongoing legal dispute with PERSON in respect of the building and of the court prohibition on continuing any construction work . The proceedings which had ended with the judgment of DATE did not affect the applicant company 's right to claim damages from NORP for its actions in bad faith .", "CARDINAL . The court also considered that by withdrawing its claims on CARDINAL DATE the applicant company had sought to have the proceedings discontinued in their entirety . It added that \u201c since the applicant company had withdrawn the totality of its claims , but the court decided to discontinue the proceedings only in respect of CARDINAL such claim , the parties have the right to ask for an additional decision discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the recognition of the property right \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , in force before DATE , reads as follows :", "\u201c ...", "If the legally protected rights and interests of persons not participating in the proceedings may be affected by a court judgment because of the nature of the legal relationship or applicable legal provisions , the court is obliged to join such persons to the proceedings as co - defendants or to inform them of their right to join as co - plaintiffs \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows :", "\u201c A request for revision shall be granted if :", "...", "( g ) the court has adopted a judgment affecting the rights of persons who were not parties to the proceedings ;", "( h ) the judgment adopted prevents the taking of a lawful decision in other proceedings ; ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
