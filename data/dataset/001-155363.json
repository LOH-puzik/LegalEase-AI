They had checked officer ORG identity documents introducing themselves as belonging to \u201c PERSON \u201c and acting under the command of GPE . According to the witness , they could have been from the first military regiment stationed in the village of ORG . Then , the witness and his colleagues had understood that the men had been looking for Mr NORP Saydulkhanov . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE these men had arrived again and asked for water . Mr NORP Saydulkhanov who had been standing at the entrance had gone to fetch it , but when he had returned those men had already left . In the ORG opinion , it was possible that Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov had been kidnapped for ransom since his father was the head of ORG and dealt with large sums of money .

However , DATE her husband had found out that Mr NORP had not been at work that night .

On the same dates , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , the investigators also questioned other colleagues of Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov , Mr PERSON . , Mr A.M. and again Mr R.N. All of them stated that they had learnt of his abduction from their colleagues . The witnesses further added that prior to the events , in the morning of CARDINAL January CARDINAL , at TIME right before they were to pass on the duty to Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov and PERSON V.D. , a grey UAZ minivan with blackened windows and without official registration numbers had pulled over at ORG building . CARDINAL armed men without masks , in camouflage uniforms of \u2018 PERSON type , had gotten out and asked them in NORP at what time the employees of ORG arrived at work . In reply the witnesses asked for the men \u2019s identity documents . The latter had refused to show the documents , said that they were just \u201c checking the posts \u201d and then they had driven away . In addition , PERSON . stated that DATE prior to the abduction , he had learnt from a fellow villager , that armed men in camouflage uniforms had arrived at the building of the FAC military commissioner \u2019s office and asked who guarded ORG building and what had been the regular security routes of that building \u2019s security guards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators again questioned the applicant who reiterated her previous statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant argued that it was beyond reasonable doubt that her son had been unlawfully detained and then killed by ORG agents . In support of her allegations she referred to the following : the area where PERSON NORP Saydulkhanov had disappeared was under the authorities\u2019 exclusive control as the roads leading to and from the settlement were blocked by checkpoints ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov \u2019s supervisor had found out that the servicemen who had been on - duty at the checkpoint in PERSON in the morning following the disappearance had stopped a UAZ minivan the drivers of which had refused to show them the person detained in their vehicle ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that the Government failed to provide information concerning the identity of that person allegedly apprehended in GPE and taken to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stated that the witnesses Mr R.N. , Mr DATE and Mr D.Kh . had stated that prior to the disappearance of Mr NORP Saydulkhanov military servicemen from the \u2018 Vostok\u2019 battalion had taken interest in security officers working at ORG in GPE and that they had previously searched for her son ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pointed out that the Government did not refute her assertions that the head of ORG confirmed her son \u2019s detention at the FAC military commander \u2019s office , that the officers from ORG had participated in his abduction and that he had subsequently been detained in PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant submitted that her son must be presumed dead as DATE elapsed since his disappearance .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that from the documents submitted that there was no evidence confirming either that ORG agents had not been involved in the abduction of Mr Muslim PERSON or that he was dead .", "CARDINAL . A number of principles have been developed by ORG when it has been faced with the task of establishing the facts of events on which the parties disagree ( see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) : the factual findings should be based on the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d ; such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII , and ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) .", "CARDINAL . Applying the above principles to cases concerning allegations of disappearances in GPE , the ORG has concluded that it is sufficient for applicants to make a prima facie case that their missing relatives have been abducted by servicemen , such abduction thus falling within the control of the authorities , and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred ( see , among many examples , ORG and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON and Others v. GPE , nos . MONEY , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG , DATE , DATE and DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . When adjudicating on disappearance cases in GPE , the ORG has borne in mind the difficulties associated with obtaining evidence and the fact that , often , little evidence can be submitted by the applicants in support of their applications . The prima facie threshold has been reached primarily on the basis of witness statements , including the ORG submissions to the ORG and to the domestic authorities , and other evidence attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time . The ORG has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment ; the unhindered passage of the abductors through military roadblocks , in particular during curfew hours ; conduct typical of security operations , such as the cordoning off of areas , checking of identity documents , searches of LOC , questioning of residents and communication within a chain of command ; and other relevant information about special operations , such as media and NGO reports . Given the presence of those elements , it has concluded that the areas in question had been within the exclusive control of the ORG authorities in view of military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen ( see , for example , ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; NORP and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; and GPE and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . If the ORG failed to rebut that presumption , this would entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part . However , where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof could not be reversed ( see , for example , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ; ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; and LAW v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Thus , the ORG \u2019s case - law cited above attests that since DATE antiterrorist operations have been carried out routinely in LOC , which in DATE has been plagued by serious disturbances of law and order . As the ORG has found , these operations can entail the detention of individuals in the context of non - acknowledged security operations , and such detention can be considered life - threatening ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . However , in the present case the ORG notes that the incident took place in the absence of any witnesses . Unlike in many other cases concerning alleged abductions perpetrated by ORG agents in GPE , the documents submitted by the parties in the present case contain neither any first - hand accounts describing the events nor any other information pertaining to the actual circumstances of the disappearance ( see , by contrast , among many other cases , PERSON and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , GPE , DATE , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE and ORG and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , GPE and GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . As for the applicant \u2019s information concerning the events surrounding the disappearance , the ORG notes that in her statements given to the domestic authorities she had not mentioned that she had received information concerning her son \u2019s detention either from the head of the local administration or unidentified police officers ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . Further , as for the information concerning the alleged passage of the abductors through the checkpoint in PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG does not consider that it provides enough grounds for a firm presumption that these had been the abductors of the applicant \u2019s son and that they had belonged to ORG authorities . In such a situation the ORG has insufficient evidence on which to draw the conclusion that ORG agents had been involved in the disappearance of PERSON Muslim Saydulkhanov as the factual circumstances of the incident as presented by the applicant do not include any evidence corroborating her account to a decisive extent ( see , for a similar situation , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the material in its possession , the ORG considers that the actual circumstances in which Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov disappeared remain a matter of assumption and that , accordingly , there is an insufficient evidentiary basis for a finding that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation was carried out in respect of him .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , it has not been established to the required standard of proof \u2013 \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d \u2013 that ORG agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr Muslim Saydulkhanov ; nor does the ORG consider that the burden of proof can be shifted to the ORG , having regard , in particular , to the fact that they submitted a copy of the relevant documents from the investigation file as requested by the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
