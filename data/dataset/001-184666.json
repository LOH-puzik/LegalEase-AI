The third applicant was placed in custody on DATE by ORG after finally being identified by the police and charged with the same criminal offence as the first CARDINAL applicants . ORG found that the risks of the third applicant absconding , reoffending and perverting the course of justice warranted her detention . Those risks were linked by the court to the following considerations : the gravity of the charges , the severity of the penalty she faced , her unwillingness to identify other members of the band , her lack of a permanent legal source of income , and her use of an assumed identity while communicating with the police on previous occasions .

It also noted the first applicant \u2019s blanket refusal to confess to the offence with which she had been charged or to any other act prohibited by LAW .

The applicants were to remain in custody until DATE . ORG dismissed the arguments the applicants put forward pertaining to their family situation ( the first CARDINAL applicants had young children ) , the fragile health of the second applicant , the fact that the CARDINAL applicants had registered their places of residence in GPE and that the criminal proceedings against them were already at a very advanced stage . The court also refused to accept personal written sureties given by CARDINAL individuals , including famous NORP actors , writers , film producers , journalists , businessmen , singers and politicians .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the detention order of DATE , considering it lawful and well - founded .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , investigators ordered expert opinions to determine whether the video - recording including the performance of Punk Prayer PERSON , PERSON downloaded from the Internet was motivated by religious hatred , whether the performance of the song at the cathedral could therefore amount to incitement of religious hatred , and whether it had been an attack on the religious feelings of NORP believers . In the first CARDINAL reports , commissioned by a ORG expert bureau and issued on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , CARDINAL experts answered in the negative to those questions . In particular , the experts concluded that the applicants\u2019 actions on DATE at NORP ORG had not contained any signs of a call or an intention to incite religious hatred or enmity . The experts concluded that the applicants had not been violent or aggressive , had not called for violence in respect of any social or religious group and had not targeted or insulted any religious group .", "CARDINAL . A third expert opinion subsequently requested by the investigators from directly appointed individual experts produced an entirely different response . In a report issued on DATE CARDINAL experts \u2013 a professor from ORG , a professor at ORG , and the President of a regional NGO , ORG and Law \u2013 concluded that the performance and video had been motivated by religious hatred , in particular hatred and enmity towards NORP believers , and had insulted the religious feelings of such believers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL applicants were committed to stand trial before ORG . The trial was closely followed by national and international media .", "CARDINAL . The trial court dismissed numerous complaints by the applicants related to the negative impact of security measures in place at the courthouse on their right to communicate freely with counsel and to prepare their defence . In particular , in applications to the trial court of DATE for time for a confidential meeting with their lawyers , they stated that confidential communication was impossible because of the presence of police officers and court ushers around the dock . The applicants raised the issue again in a similar application on DATE , which was repeated at a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants provided the following description of the hearings . Throughout the trial they were held in an enclosed dock with glass walls and a tight - fitting door , which was commonly known as an \u201c aquarium \u201d . There was insufficient ventilation inside the glass dock and it was hard to breathe , given the high summer temperatures . A desk for the applicants\u2019 lawyers was installed in front of the dock . There was always high security around the dock , which at times included CARDINAL armed police officers and a guard dog . Colour photographs of the courtroom submitted by the applicants show police officers and court ushers surrounding the dock , either behind or close to the defence lawyers\u2019 desk . Some photographs show female police officers positioned between the ORG desk and the glass dock containing the applicants . The applicants had to use a small window measuring CARDINAL x QUANTITY to communicate with their lawyers , which they had to bend down to use as it was only a QUANTITY off the ground . The applicants had to take turns to speak to their lawyers as the window was too small for all CARDINAL to use it simultaneously . According to the applicants , confidential communication with their defence team was impossible as a police officer always stood nearby monitoring their conversations and any documents which were passed between them . Furthermore , a dog was present in the courtroom , which was at times particularly disturbing as it had barked during the hearings and behaved restlessly .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , it was virtually impossible to communicate with their lawyers outside the courtroom as they were taken back to the detention facility at TIME , when it was too late to be allowed visitors .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyers applied several times to ORG for permission to hold confidential meetings with the applicants . The lawyers and applicants also sought an adjournment of the hearings to give the defence an opportunity to consult their clients in private , either in the courthouse or in the detention facility , but those requests were fruitless .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , the court dismissed applications to call the experts who had issued the CARDINAL expert reports or to call additional experts , including art historians and specialists in the fields of contemporary art and religious studies , who could have provided opinions on the nature of the performance on DATE . The defence \u2019s challenges to the third expert report issued on DATE were also unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , when there were hearings they were transported from the detention facility to court in a prison van : they were usually transported in a small vehicle when being taken to the courthouse in the morning and in a bigger one when being taken back to the detention facility in TIME . The bigger van consisted of CARDINAL long sections so men and women could be transported separately . The vans had CARDINAL or CARDINAL compartments separated by metal partitions , each designed to accommodate CARDINAL inmate . The common area of the vans was equipped with benches , while the roof was so low detainees could not stand up . The space in the common compartment of the smaller van was CARDINAL sq . m and was designed for CARDINAL people , while the space in the bigger van was QUANTITY m.", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , they were transported in single - person compartments to their custody hearings and in common compartments later on . Most of the time the vans were overcrowded , with detainees sitting directly against each other , with squashed up legs and shoulders . The bigger vans transported CARDINAL detainees , making a number of stops at various GPE facilities to pick up detainees . The vans were sometimes so full that there was no place to sit . Smoking was not prohibited but many detainees did do so . The second and third applicant had severe headaches as a result of the conditions of transport .", "CARDINAL . The temperature in GPE at the time of the trial was as high as CARDINALoC , while inside the vans it reached CARDINAL The natural ventilation in the single - person compartments was insufficient and the system of forced ventilation was rarely switched on . When it was switched on , it was only for a very short time because of the noise it made and so it was hardly ever used . A fan was switched on during DATE but did not make the conditions of the cramped space any more bearable .", "CARDINAL . The journey to the courthouse usually took TIME , but could sometimes last as long as TIME . Detainees were not allowed to use the toilet unless the police van drove past ORG , where inmates were allowed to relieve themselves .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of court hearings the applicants were woken up at CARDINAL TIME to carry out the necessary procedures for leaving the facility and were only taken back to the detention facility TIME . The applicants missed mealtimes at the detention facility because of such early departures and late returns .", "CARDINAL . On leaving the detention facility in TIME they received a lunch box containing CARDINAL packets of dry biscuits ( for a total of CARDINAL each ) , CARDINAL packets of dry cereal , CARDINAL packet of dry soup and CARDINAL tea bags . However , it was impossible to use the soup and tea bags as hot water was only made available to them TIME before they were taken out of their cells to the courtroom , which was not enough time to eat .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were forbidden to have drinking water with them during the hearings : requests for short breaks to drink some water and use the toilet were regularly refused , which caused them physical suffering .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an ambulance was called twice to the court because the applicants became dizzy and had headaches owing to a lack of food , water , rest and sleep . They were both times found fit for trial .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided the following information concerning the vehicles in which the applicants had been transported to and from the courthouse :", "CARDINAL . It appears from the information provided by the ORG that DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants were transported between GPE \u2019s SIZO-CARDINAL remand prison and ORG twice a day for DATE . The trips lasted TIME . The trips back from the court lasted TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the daytime temperature in GPE in DATE and DATE only reached CARDINAL on CARDINAL DATE and that , furthermore , the TIME and evenings , when the applicants were transported , were cooler than the temperature at TIME . All the vehicles underwent a technical check and were cleaned before departure . They were also disinfected once DATE . The passenger compartment had natural ventilation through windows and ventilation panes . The vehicles were also equipped with a system of forced ventilation . The passenger compartment had artificial lighting in the roof . The Government provided photographs of the vehicles and extracts from the vehicle logs to corroborate their assertion that the number of passengers never exceeded the upper limit on places given in the table in paragraph CARDINAL above . People transported in such vehicles could use toilets in courthouses that were on the PERSON route .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the area at ORG where the applicants had been held before the hearings and during breaks consisted of CARDINAL cells equipped with benches and forced ventilation . A kettle had also been available to them . The Government provided reports by the officers on duty at ORG on the dates of the applicants\u2019 hearings to corroborate their statement that the applicants had always been provided with a lunch box and boiling water when being transported to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the CARDINAL applicants guilty under LAW of LAW Criminal Code of hooliganism for reasons of religious hatred and enmity and for reasons of hatred towards a particular social group . It found that they had committed the crime in a group , acting with premeditation and in concert , and sentenced each of them to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The trial court held that the applicants\u2019 choice of venue and their apparent disregard for the cathedral \u2019s rules of conduct had demonstrated their enmity towards the feelings of NORP believers , and that the religious feelings of those present in the cathedral had therefore been offended . While also taking into account the video - recording of the song Punk Prayer \u2013 Virgin Mary , PERSON , ORG rejected the ORG arguments that their performance had been politically rather than religiously motivated . It stated that the applicants had not made any political statements during their performance on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG based its findings on the testimony of a number of witnesses , including the cathedral employees and churchgoers present during the performance on DATE and others who , while not witnesses to the actual performance , had watched the video of Punk Prayer PERSON , PERSON Away on the Internet or had been present at the applicants\u2019 performance at FAC in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The witnesses provided a description of the events on DATE or of the video and attested to having been insulted by the applicants\u2019 actions . In addition , ORG referred to statements by representatives of various religions about the insulting nature of the applicants\u2019 performance .", "CARDINAL . ORG also relied on the expert report issued on DATE , rejecting the first CARDINAL expert reports for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... in light of the provisions of LAW incitement to hatred , enmity or disparagement , as can be seen from the questions put [ to the experts ] and the answers given by them .", "Moreover , the expert opinions do not fulfil the requirements of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The reports lack any reference to the methods used during the examinations . The experts also exceeded the limits of the questions put before them ; they gave answers to questions which were not mentioned in the [ investigators\u2019 ] decisions ordering the expert examinations . The reports do not provide a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in GPE ORG , and the experts did not carry out a sentiment analysis and psychological assessment of the song \u2019s lyrics in relation to the place where the crime had been committed ( an NORP church ) . [ The experts ] examined the lyrics of the song selectively . Given the lack of a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in NORP ORG , the experts made an unfounded and poorly reasoned conclusion , which runs counter to the testimony of the eyewitnesses , the victims of the crime , who expressed an extremely negative view of the events in NORP FAC and of the video - recording . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , ORG found the expert report of CARDINAL DATE to be \u201c detailed , well founded and scientifically reasoned \u201d . The experts\u2019 conclusions were seen by the court as substantiated and not open to dispute , given that the information received from the experts corresponded to the information received from other sources , such as the victims and the witness statements . The court also stressed that it would not call the experts or authorise an additional expert examination as it had no doubts about the conclusions made in the report in question .", "CARDINAL . ORG main reasons for finding that the applicants had committed hooliganism motivated by religious hatred were as follows :", "\u201c The court can not accept the defence \u2019s argument that the GPE actions were not motivated by religious hatred and enmity or hatred against a social group .", "The court finds that the GPE actions were motivated by religious hatred for the following reasons .", "The defendants present themselves as supporters of feminism , a movement for equality between women and men .", "...", "At the present time people belonging to the feminist movement fight for equality of the sexes in political , family and sexual relations . Belonging to the feminist movement is not unlawful and is not a criminal offence in GPE . A number of religions , such as ORG , ORG and ORG , have a religious , dogmatic basis incompatible with the ideas of feminism . And while feminism is not a religious theory , its adherents interfere with various areas of social relations such as morality , rules of decency , family relations , sexual relations , including those of a non - traditional nature , which were historically constructed on the basis of religious views .", "In the modern world , relations between nations and nationalities and between different religions must be built on the principles of mutual respect and equality . The idea that one is superior and the others inferior , that a different ideology , social group or religion are unacceptable , gives grounds for mutual enmity , hatred and personal conflicts .", "The defendants\u2019 hatred and enmity were demonstrated in the court hearings , as was seen from their reactions , emotions and responses in the course of the examination of the victims and witnesses .", "...", "It can be seen from the statements of the victims , witnesses , defendants and the material evidence that ORG performances are carried out by way of a sudden appearance by the group [ in public places ] with the band dressed in brightly coloured clothes and wearing balaclavas to cover [ their ] faces . Members of the group make brusque movements with their heads , arms and legs , accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature . That behaviour does not respect the canons of ORG , irrespective of whether it takes place in a cathedral or outside its walls . Representatives of other religions and people who do not consider themselves believers also find such behaviour unacceptable . PERSON \u2018 performances\u2019 outside religious buildings , although containing signs of clear disrespect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred of a specific social group , are not associated with a specific object and therefore amount to a violation of moral standards or an offence . However , placing such a performance within an NORP cathedral changes the object of the crime . It represents in that case a mixture of relations between people , rules of conduct established by legal acts , morality , customs , traditions which guarantee a socially tranquil environment and the protection of individuals in various spheres of their lives , as well as the proper functioning of the ORG and public institutions . Violating the internal regulations of NORP ORG was merely a way of showing disrespect for society , motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group .", "The court concludes that [ the applicants\u2019 ] actions ... offend and insult the feelings of a large group of people in the present case in view of their connection with religion , [ their actions ] incite feelings of hatred and enmity and therefore violate the constitutional basis of the ORG .", "[ The applicants\u2019 ] intention to incite religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a specific social group in view of its connection with religion , in public , is confirmed by the following facts .", "A so - called \u2018 punk prayer\u2019 was carried out in a public place \u2013 Christ the Saviour Cathedral . [ The applicants ] knowingly envisaged a negative response to that performance on the part of society as they had prepared bright , open dresses and balaclavas in advance and on DATE publicly and in an organised group carried out their actions , which were motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group in view of its connection with religion .", "...", "Given the particular circumstances of the criminal offence , its nature , the division of the roles , the actions of the accomplices , the time , place and method of committing the offence of hooliganism , that is to say a gross violation of public order committed by a group of people acting in premeditated fashion and in concert , and which demonstrated an explicit lack of respect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group , the court is convinced that [ the applicants ] were correctly charged with the [ offence ] and that their guilt in committing [ it ] has been proven during the trial .", "[ The applicants\u2019 ] actions are an obvious and gross violation of generally accepted standards and rules of conduct , given the content of their actions and the place where they were carried out . The defendants violated the generally accepted rules and standards of conduct accepted as the basis of public order in NORP ORG . The use of offensive language in public in the vicinity of NORP icons and objects of worship can only be characterised as a violation of public order , given the place where those actions were carried out . In fact , there was mockery and humiliation of the people present in the ORG , a violation of social tranquillity , unauthorised and wilful entry into the cathedral \u2019s ambon and soleas , accompanied by intentional , stubborn and a lengthy period of disobedience to the reprimands and orders of the guards and churchgoers .", "...", "The court dismisses [ the applicants\u2019 ] arguments that they had no intention to incite religious hatred or enmity or to offend the dignity of a group of people because of their religious beliefs , as those arguments were refuted by the evidence in the case . ...", "Although the members of ORG cite political motives for their actions , arguing that they have a positive attitude to the NORP religion and that their performance was directed against the uniting of ORG and ORG , their words are refuted by their actions , lyrics and articles found [ in the course of the investigation ] .", "The defendants\u2019 arguments that their actions in the cathedral were not motivated by hatred or enmity towards NORP churchgoers and NORP , but were governed by political considerations , are also unsubstantiated because , as can be seen from the GPE statements , no political claims were made and no names of political leaders were mentioned during the GPE acts of disorder in the FAC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Citing the results of psychological expert examinations commissioned by investigators , ORG noted that the CARDINAL applicants suffered from mixed personality disorders , which did not affect their understanding of the criminal nature of the act they had carried out in the cathedral and did not call for psychiatric treatment . The psychiatric diagnosis was made on the basis of the ORG active social position , their reliance on their personal experience when taking decisions , their determination to defend social values , the \u201c peculiarity \u201d of their interests , their stubbornness in defending their opinion , their confidence and their disregard for social rules and standards .", "CARDINAL .
