She divorced PERSON \u2019s father in DATE and has not seen him since DATE . The father was expelled from GPE in DATE .", "In DATE ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) of GPE received a report regarding A. from the student welfare team at ORG school . According to the report , PERSON had been absent from school DATE out of CARDINAL during her first semester , mostly due to other reasons than illness . Those DATE attended school she was often late . The school nurse was in contact with the applicant DATE to ensure that A. attended school . According to A. \u2019s nursery - school teacher , similar problems were known at A. \u2019s nursery - school stage .", "On DATE ORG decided to arrange a contact family for DATE every month with a view to helping and supporting the applicant . However , the decision was never implemented as , subsequently , more far - reaching measures were deemed necessary .", "On DATE the president of ORG decided , pursuant to LAW on ORG ( ORG med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , TIME ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , immediately to take ORG into public care on a provisional basis . The adduced reasons for the decision can be summarised as follows .", "A. \u2019s school attendance was more regular at DATE and DATE . During this period great efforts were made by the school to support this positive development . However , the same problems as before subsequently recurred . The applicant was asked to contact ORG and an appointment was made . However , the applicant did not show up as agreed . On DATE the school nurse and the school psychologist visited the applicant \u2019s home at TIME They found A. still undressed . The applicant told them that PERSON was ill . However , A. got dressed and accompanied them to school . The school psychologist had the impression that A. was glad that they had come to \u201c save her \u201d . The next day the applicant accepted that she and her daughter be admitted to a children \u2019s home at GPE for an investigation . The placement , which started on DATE , was supposed to last for DATE . From a report of the GPE home it appeared that the applicant at the start of her stay there was in a state of mental distress .

A. remained , however , and the staff at the home had the impression that A. developed favourably after the applicant had left . She was more happy and she made progress in her school work . At the same time the applicant was becoming more nervous and showed signs of stress . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant terminated the contract for the investigation .", "The decision of DATE was confirmed by ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE on DATE and by ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE on DATE . A. remained at the GPE children \u2019s home .", "ORG later applied to ORG for a care order concerning NORP under LAW and LAW .", "According to the report of the social authorities accompanying the application , A. had had a worrying and unstable childhood . ORG adduced also an opinion of the school psychologist dated DATE , a report from the GPE children \u2019s home dated DATE , and a psychotherapist \u2019s opinion of DATE . According to the school psychologist , PERSON had been attending school regularly and had taken active part in the school work since her placement at the GPE home . She had also taken good care of her personal hygiene and seemed happy and relieved about her situation . The psychologist deemed that GPE and the applicant needed further qualified assistance to ensure A. \u2019s continued positive development . The report from the GPE home concluded that the ties between A. and her mother were not particularly strong , that the applicant did not understand her daughter \u2019s needs and generally lacked the ability to take care of A. in a safe and normal way , and that the applicant , on occasion , had obstructed the investigation . The psychotherapist , who had examined A. at the GPE home , confirmed that the applicant lacked the capacity to see to it that A. \u2019s needs were met . The applicant did not express any concern DATE absence from school . Instead , she showed clear signs of isolation and a distorted sense of reality . The psychotherapist concluded that A. needed to be placed with foster parents .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case .

These problems had not impaired A. \u2019s development until she began school in DATE . Thereafter , however , A. had frequently been absent from school and the applicant had been unable or unwilling to see to it that A. went to school , although extensive efforts had been made by ORG to help the applicant in this respect . The ORG considered this to be a serious deficiency in the applicant \u2019s care of her daughter . It found that the applicant did not understand A. \u2019s needs and was not able to give her adequate support . Having regard to the above - mentioned opinions of the school psychologist and the psychotherapist , the ORG also considered that the applicant showed signs of isolation and a distorted sense of reality .

It heard the same persons as ORG and , in addition , it heard evidence from CARDINAL further witnesses , CARDINAL of whom had been adduced by the applicant .", "On DATE the appellate court rejected the appeal . It noted that ORG had frequently been absent and had arrived late on numerous occasions during her first school year . Largely , these problems could not be explained by illness or other impediments . The situation had not improved . The applicant had admitted that she had been mentally worn out during the autumn of DATE and DATE and that her care of A. , to some extent , had been lacking in that she had failed to see to it that A. attended school . Having regard to the medical certificates in the case , the ORG found that the applicant had been mentally unstable and unable to meet her daughter \u2019s needs at the time of ORG provisional care decision . Although the applicant \u2019s social situation had improved somewhat thereafter and although she was at the time seeing a psychiatrist in order to solve her problems , the ORG considered that she was still too unstable and that the public care of A. should thus continue .", "On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "At regular intervals ORG decided on the continued care of A. and on the applicant \u2019s access to A. Initially , the applicant met PERSON every third weekend from DATE in the applicant \u2019s home . After the applicant on DATE in DATE and DATE had returned ORG to the foster parents DATE , the ORG decided , on DATE , to restrict the applicant \u2019s access to A. Accordingly , as from DATE , the applicant was allowed to meet A. every second DATE CARDINAL p.m. at a venue designated by the ORG and in the presence of a social welfare officer . Their contacts by telephone were limited to CARDINAL calls per week . The restrictions were confirmed by later decisions of the ORG . The applicant did not appeal against these decisions to the administrative courts .", "On DATE ORG again confirmed the above - mentioned access restrictions with the modification that every second meeting between the applicant and PERSON could take place in the home of the foster parents .", "The applicant appealed against the latter decision to ORG , claiming access DATE in her own home without a social welfare officer being present . She further claimed extended contacts by telephone .", "On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . The applicant appealed to ORG , where a new oral hearing was held . On DATE the appellate court decided that the applicant be entitled to see her daughter in her own home DATE from DATE TIME to DATE TIME without the presence of a social welfare officer .

The decision whether to place a young person under public care is made by ORG following an application from ORG .", "Under Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW , ORG may order the immediate taking into care of a young person ( \u201c provisional care order \u201d ) if it is likely that he or she needs to be provided with care under LAW and a court decision in the matter can not be awaited owing to the risks facing the young person \u2019s health or development or because the continuing inquiry can be seriously impeded or further measures prevented . If such a decision by ORG can not be awaited , an order on taking into public care may be made by the president of ORG . A provisional care order shall be put before ORG which shall rule on whether the order shall be upheld pending the ORG \u2019s judgment regarding the application for public care .", "It is the responsibility of ORG to ensure that the greatest possible provision is made for the young person \u2019s need of access to his or her parents . If it is necessary in view of the purpose of the care , the ORG may decide how the right of access shall be exercised ( LAW of LAW ) .
