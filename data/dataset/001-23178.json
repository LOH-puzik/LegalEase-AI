He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in Eksj\u00f6 . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE S. was attacked several times outside his home by a person using a knife or a bayonet .", "S. was heard by the police on CARDINAL occasions in DATE and DATE . Thereafter , on DATE , defence counsel was appointed for the applicant . A further police interview with PERSON was held on DATE . According to the applicant , he and his counsel were not informed of this interview or invited to attend it .", "The applicant was subsequently charged with attempted murder of S. The applicant and PERSON knew each other , having served time together at the same prison and having met thereafter on a couple of occasions at the home of S.", "On DATE the applicant received a copy of the records of the preliminary investigation . Those records state that the applicant had no objection or comments to the documentation of the investigation .", "On DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON heard the case . On DATE came to the court \u2019s waiting room but then left . The prosecutor stated at the hearing that he had talked to S. in the waiting room who had said that he had nothing to add but that he stood by the information he had given to the police . The court ordered that S. be fetched by the police , proceeded with the hearing but later discontinued it as S. had not been found . On DATE ORG adjourned the case , noting that the police had not been able to enforce the court \u2019s order that S. be brought to the hearing . On DATE again came to the waiting room but left before the hearing started . ORG then decided to continue the hearing of the case in the absence of S. It allowed that his statements made during the preliminary investigation be read out .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated assault of S. and attempted murder of another person who had been attacked on a different occasion . The applicant was sentenced to DATE in prison .", "Both the applicant and the public prosecutor appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . The prosecutor requested that PERSON be heard in person before the appellate court or , alternatively \u2013 in the event that he would not appear \u2013 , that his statements to the police be admitted as evidence . The applicant objected to the alternative request , stating , inter alia , that it would violate the applicant \u2019s rights under the Convention .", "On DATE ORG decided to refuse the prosecutor \u2019s alternative request .", "ORG heard the case on DATE , DATE and DATE . Following S. \u2019s non - appearance on DATE , the court ordered that he be brought to the court by the police . The police were not able to enforce the order in time for DATE . However , on DATE , serving a prison sentence at the time , was taken to the court by the transportation service of ORG ( Kriminal - v\u00e5rdsstyrelsen ) . At the hearing PERSON refused to give evidence except for stating that it was not the applicant who had attacked him and that he had not previously named the applicant as the perpetrator . The court then decided to allow as evidence the statements made by PERSON during the police investigation .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted murder also in regard to the attack on PERSON and sentenced him to imprisonment for a total of DATE for the CARDINAL crimes . With respect to the statements made in the case by PERSON the court stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c During the police investigation [ S. ] first stated that he was attacked by a man , who was accompanied by another man , and then that the attacker came in the company of a woman . ... During the preliminary investigation it also occurred , according to the testimony made by police officer [ NORP ] , that [ S. ] was asked whether the right person was detained in the case , and then nodded affirmatively and said \u2018 you know that , of ORG .", "[ S. ] was summoned twice to ORG main hearing . On both occasions he came to the court \u2019s waiting room but disappeared before the hearing started . During the hearing before ORG , [ S. ] showed signs of being deeply upset . He acted as could be expected from a person , who is afraid of reprisals . ...", "The fact that [ S. ] has not been heard by ORG and mostly refused to give evidence before ORG raises the question of the application of LAW the right to a fair trial and the right to examine or have examined witnesses ... . ORG has in a number of judgments dealt with this issue ( see , inter alia , Unterpertinger ... , where the LAW was found to have been violated , and PERSON ... , where no such violation was found ) . LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) shall be interpreted restrictively in the light of DATE and ORG application thereof ... .", "ORG notes at the outset that the presentation of material from the preliminary investigation in itself can not be considered as a violation of LAW . According to the above - mentioned judgments , it seems that the decisive point as to whether there has been a violation is whether the conviction has been based primarily on this material . In order for ORG to be able to draw a conclusion on this point , it is first necessary to examine the evidence in the case .", "There is no doubt that [ S. ] has sustained the injuries alleged by the prosecutor , nor as to how this happened . As to the identity of the perpetrator , [ S. ] has avoided to directly identify [ the applicant ] . Therefore , a conviction can not be based on [ S. \u2019s ] statements alone . The prosecutor has invoked certain supplementary evidence . In addition to this evidence , it is of importance that [ the applicant ] has not invoked any form of alibi evidence . ORG is of the opinion therefore that the statements made by [ S. ] during the preliminary investigation are not the primary evidence in the sense laid down by ORG . Article CARDINAL of the LAW can not therefore be considered as prohibiting this evidence from being considered by ORG .", "On the basis of the available material , ORG makes the following assessment . According to what [ S. ] has stated , the perpetrator visited him on DATE . This information should be considered in conjunction with the statement of [ witness CARDINAL ] that [ witness CARDINAL ] DATE met [ S. ] together with a person whom [ witness CARDINAL ] has identified as [ the applicant ] , and then lends support to the conclusion that [ the applicant ] is the perpetrator . Although the identification of [ S. ] made by [ witness CARDINAL ] at a photo line - up does not have any real value as evidence , her observation of a man outside the home of [ the applicant ] on DATE confirms what [ S. ] has stated regarding his visit to the home of the perpetrator . The observations made by [ witness CARDINAL ] concerning the perpetrator \u2019s looks do also , to some extent , support the conclusion that [ the applicant ] is the perpetrator . The statements made by [ S. ] during the preliminary investigation have thus been verified on various points . This fact together with what has otherwise been revealed in the case is highly compromising for [ the applicant ] . It is apparent to ORG that [ S. ] throughout the investigation and the hearing of the case has been afraid of [ the applicant ] . The fact that [ S. ] during the oral hearing before ORG denied that [ the applicant ] was the perpetrator can therefore be disregarded . ORG finds it proven beyond reasonable doubt , as did ORG , that [ the applicant ] is identical with the perpetrator . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "LAW , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure provides :", "\u201c A statement made in writing on the occasion of already opened or imminent legal proceedings or a written record of a statement made on the occasion of such proceedings to the prosecutor or the police or otherwise out of court may be invoked as evidence in the proceedings only", "CARDINAL . NORP if this is specifically prescribed ,", "CARDINAL . if the person who made the statement can not be examined at or outside the main hearing in the case or otherwise before the court , or", "CARDINAL . if there are particular reasons , taking into account the costs and inconvenience that an examination at or outside the main hearing may entail , the possible gain of such an examination , the significance of the statement and other circumstances .", "The rules on statements in writing or in written records in the first paragraph apply also in regard to a phonetic or similar record of a statement . \u201d", "Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL reads :", "\u201c During the hearing of a witness , the witness \u2019s prior statement before a court or before a prosecutor or the police may be presented only when the witness \u2019s testimony differs from what he has previously stated or when the witness declares that he can not or will not speak . \u201d", "The latter provision applies also to a hearing of an injured party , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
