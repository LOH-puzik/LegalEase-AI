THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant and his wife entered into a form of agricultural tenancy agreement with ORG which involved the applicant and his wife setting up and running a demonstration farm . Clause CARDINAL provided that", "\u201c Any question difference or dispute which may arise between the landlord and the tenants ... not being a matter compulsorily referred to arbitration under ORG Acts shall if the parties can not settle it by agreement be referred to a single arbitrator to be appointed by the parties hereto or in default of agreement ... by the President for the time being of ORG on the application of the landlord or the tenants . \u201d", "After a series of disputes with the council , the applicant asked for an arbitrator to be appointed . According to the applicant , in DATE the President of ORG appointed an arbitrator . In an opinion of DATE , ORG , in stating that the case fell outside the parameters of the Pro Bono scheme , made a number of comments on the case . In particular , it noted that clause CARDINAL of the tenancy agreement did not stipulate the LAW under which the arbitration should be carried out , did not stipulate the procedure or law to be applied , and did not expressly remove the jurisdiction of the courts .", "On CARDINAL or DATE the applicant brought proceedings against ORG in the Guildford County Court ( PERSON DATE ) for , amongst other things , misrepresentation , negligence and breach of contract . In his claim , he asked the court whether an arbitrator could consider all the points in the claim , or whether the applicant could proceed in the courts on the ground that he had entered into the contract as a result of misrepresentation or , alternatively , whether an arbitrator could deal with some claims whilst the courts dealt with the others . He also included a series of allegations of misrepresentation , breach of contract and deception and misinformation .", "The court stayed the proceedings on DATE : the Government suggested that by the stay the court was declining jurisdiction over the applicant \u2019s claims on the basis that he had agreed that those claims would be dealt with by an arbitrator . A further application by the applicant , of DATE , was dismissed on DATE , and the applicant \u2019s appeal was adjourned on DATE pending an application for legal aid . Leave to withdraw the appeal was granted on DATE , and on DATE the council \u2019s costs ( which the applicant was to pay ) were fixed at \u00a3 MONEY .", "On DATE the applicant and his wife and the council signed an agreement by which a series of disputes were referred to an arbitrator in accordance with LAW . The disputes were defined by reference to CARDINAL bundles . ORG included the matters which formed part of the applicant \u2019s action before the county court .", "Since then , it appears that the arbitrator has made CARDINAL interim awards in the applicant \u2019s favour , in DATE and DATE , but that most of the matters referred to arbitration are still outstanding .", "On DATE the applicant wrote to the GPE court , referring to section CARDINAL of LAW and asking for the arbitrator to be removed . On DATE District Judge GPE declined to dismiss the arbitrator even though he accepted that the delays in the case were inexcusable . The ORG has not been supplied with the judge \u2019s reasons for that decision , although it appears from a letter from the council to the arbitrator that the judge stated that he might have been prepared to change his decision if matters did not proceed at a faster pace ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
