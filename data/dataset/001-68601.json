The body was later handed over to the public prosecutor in the town of PERSON for the establishment of its identity and for an autopsy to be carried out .", "CARDINAL . This report contradicts both the handwritten and the typed versions of the on - site operation report .

The doctor established the cause of death as shooting . As the cause of death was thus established , it was decided not to carry out a full autopsy .", "CARDINAL . There were no documents on the body to help establish its identity . It was subsequently buried after a burial licence had been issued by the PERSON public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the first applicant , submitted a petition to the public prosecutor \u2019s office in the town of DATE , near GPE .

On DATE PERSON , the public prosecutor of NORP , and PERSON carried out external examinations of the bodies of PERSON and PERSON . During the examination , PERSON son identified his father \u2019s body and a cousin identified PERSON body . According to the report , the cause of death of PERSON , who was DATE , was a bullet which had entered from behind the right ear and had exited above the left ear . The death of PERSON , who was DATE , had been caused by CARDINAL bullets which had entered and exited the trunk of his body . As the causes of the deaths were established it was decided not to carry out full autopsies on the bodies .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 lawyers submitted to the ORG a report which was prepared on DATE by PERSON , a forensic expert at ORG and ORG in GPE .

It was also recorded in this report that , after death , skin had been excised from the chest , the upper abdomen , the left upper arm , and the back of the left hand . PERSON concluded that the injuries to the trunk could have been caused by a number of blows to this region with a long , possibly rounded , stick or bar . Furthermore , kicking or stamping on this region could not be ruled out . Such impacts in this area could have resulted in a rupture of the spleen , which was likely to have been fatal without prompt medical attention . The injuries to the face could have been due to blows , possibly from a fist . PERSON further observed a gunshot entry wound on the upper part of the left ear of PERSON , the firearm having been discharged close to the head .", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL and DATE ORG and PERSON made further statements to ORG in ORG and stated that they still had not been questioned by any authorities in relation to the killing of their relatives .", "CARDINAL .

If it had not been for the armed clash , the defendants would have had no reason to use firearms against the deceased persons .

Some of the shots were aimed at the group of people which included the witness , and they ran to take shelter behind a rock .

Terrorists had been known to take shelter in this area and the security forces had already conducted several operations there , during which there had been CARDINAL armed clashes with members of the ORG . Upon receiving this intelligence , a decision was made to organise a military operation in the area and the witness was responsible for its planning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an operation plan was drawn up and the operation was named PERSON . The plans of the operation clearly indicated the position each military unit would take up . CARDINAL soldiers would participate in the operation , which was to cover an area of QUANTITY .

On DATE the operation began at dawn in the NORP hills . The witness followed the operation by radio communication from a temporary command unit established at Erimli gendarme station , which was located outside the operation area but had a view of it .", "CARDINAL . Members of the terrorist organisation would normally use automatic rifles , called BKCs , and the soldiers used MGCARDINAL automatic rifles and RPGs . No helicopters were used in the operation .", "CARDINAL . Although the operation was carried out under his general command , he did not have judicial responsibility . During a military operation , the district gendarme commanders in charge of the participating units were the officers with judicial responsibility and were in direct contact with the public prosecutors .

He considered that the allegations were baseless since the relatives of PERSON had failed to submit their complaints to the commanders of the military units who had been in the area during the operation , which had lasted for DATE , or to the judicial authorities .

He had not been summoned or requested to attend any court hearing in order to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness , PERSON could be considered a successful operation . The measure to gauge the success of an operation was the degree of damage caused to the terrorist organisation . In this operation there were no casualties on the side of the security forces . The witness stated that he did not know whether the citizens who were killed during the operation were innocent or not , and he explained that every operation entailed risks . Nobody would have wanted ordinary citizens to be killed during a military operation .

Dr ORG agreed with the findings in the report compiled by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in which the injuries on the body of PERSON were described in detail .", "CARDINAL . When asked why the large number of bruises and injuries on the body of PERSON , observed by PERSON , had not been recorded in his examination report , PERSON stated that no such wounds had been observed on the body during his examination .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON initially suggested that PERSON ears could have been severed by flying shrapnel but later stated that the ears must have been cut off post mortem as there was no bleeding in that area . However , as this had no bearing on the cause of death he had not deemed it important to include this information in his report .", "CARDINAL . Both witnesses maintained that there had been no need to carry out full autopsies since their examinations of the bodies had enabled them to establish the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was unable to state with certainty the distance from which PERSON had been shot .

The witness , who was the public prosecutor in PERSON at the time of the events , was present at the examination of the body of PERSON . He noted the absence of the ears but did not consider it his duty to find out how the body had been mutilated .

For this reason he decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the killing and sent the file to the prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG in accordance with usual practice . If state security courts required further information , they would put a request to the local prosecutor , who would carry out further investigations .", "CARDINAL .

However , the witness confirmed that the file on the investigation into the killing of PERSON and PERSON had also been submitted to ORG by his office , together with a record ( fezleke ) summarising the investigation .

This witness , who was the ORG public prosecutor at the time of the events , was not involved in the investigation into the death of the CARDINAL persons . His office only attempted to find the addresses of the deceased ORG relatives and other potential eyewitnesses , as requested by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a question concerning the duties of a public prosecutor with whom relatives of murdered persons lodge a complaint , the witness explained that in such circumstances the public prosecutor should first question the relatives .

However , his military unit was not involved in the operation and he had no idea as to what had actually happened during the operation .

In the forested area there were oak trees , bushes and rocks .

However , he did remember that an operation had been conducted and he had heard on the wireless that there had been an armed conflict . When asked why units under his command were named in the operation reports when in fact they had not taken part in the operation , the witness stated that their involvement had been limited to blocking their side of the operation area in order to prevent any terrorists from escaping . However , it was not the practice of commando units to keep records of their activities during an operation and hence no reports existed pertaining to their involvement in this particular operation .", "CARDINAL .
