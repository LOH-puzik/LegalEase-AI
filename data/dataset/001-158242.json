NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and his wife got married in DATE and subsequently had CARDINAL sons . In DATE the applicant \u2019s wife moved to GPE to pursue doctoral studies and , with the applicant \u2019s consent , she took the children with her . DATE the applicant \u2019s wife initiated divorce proceedings before the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City ORG granted the divorce . The court found that the marriage had broken down due to the applicant \u2019s fault \u2013 it was established that he had regularly gambled , using his wife \u2019s and her relatives\u2019 money for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . During the court proceedings , the applicant agreed that the custody of the CARDINAL children be awarded to his ex - wife . He subsequently changed his position , first requesting custody of the older son and later of the both children . However , the court held that the interests of the children were best served by awarding custody to their mother . It found that the children were very attached to their mother and to each other , and that the applicant had not maintained regular contact with them since their move to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was ordered to pay maintenance to the CARDINAL children . The court held that the amount of maintenance had to be calculated according to NORP law and found this amount to be MONEY ( ORG ) per month for each child . The court then noted that the applicant did not have sufficient income to provide this amount : during the court proceedings the applicant himself stated that he was only able to afford CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , approximately ORG CARDINAL ) per month for each child . However , the court also noted that the applicant owned an apartment in GPE , the market value of which was estimated to be LTL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) . Stressing that the interests of children took priority over the interests of their parents , the court awarded the apartment as a form of maintenance jointly to the CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the lower court with certain amendments . The court held that the maintenance needs of the children had to be determined in accordance with NORP ( and not NORP ) law . The court re - evaluated the amount of maintenance on the basis of the documents submitted by the applicant \u2019s ex - wife and accepted her claim that ORG ( FAC ) per month for each child would be appropriate . The court then estimated that the applicant \u2019s apartment , sold at its market price ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , could provide each child with approximately LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) per month until they turned DATE . It also concluded that the applicant \u2019s ex - wife nonetheless had to bear a significantly larger financial burden in the upbringing of their children . Therefore , the court held that awarding the applicant \u2019s apartment for the maintenance of the children was proportionate and justified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG arguing that the decision to award his apartment as a form of maintenance was unjustified . However , on DATE ORG refused to examine the appeal on the ground that it raised no important legal questions .

It is therefore important to secure stability of maintenance ... The parent who lives with the minor child also assumes the DATE care of the child which is normally not compensated for by awarding maintenance [ from the other parent ] . Meanwhile both parents are responsible for ensuring a safe environment and proper conditions for the child to grow and develop , for providing support in the child \u2019s education and realisation of his or her talents and interests . ORG has established in its case - law that inadequate compliance or non - compliance with parental duties can be justified only in exceptional circumstances which are outside the GPE control ; therefore , parents ought to evaluate their financial situation and readiness to take care of a child in advance ; in failing to evaluate their readiness to raise a child , develop his personality and provide suitable conditions for his development , parents consciously assume an increased social risk and its consequences ( ruling of ORG in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . Thus , when assessing the party \u2019s financial status , the court evaluates not only his or her existing possessions and income , but also the action that he or she has taken to ensure income commensurate with his or her age and professional capabilities , which could be used to provide maintenance for his or her children ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
