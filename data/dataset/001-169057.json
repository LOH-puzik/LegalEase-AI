A robbery took place on CARDINAL DATE in the home of PERSON and PERSON ( the former is a lawyer by profession ) . According to the versions of the victims at the time , the robbery was carried out by CARDINAL hooded men who appeared to be under the effects of drugs . They had entered through the roof and sought to find the safe . Various items were stolen and the victims were injured while they were being held face down in the bedroom . According to PERSON during the robbery one of the robbers said , \u201c Give us the CARDINAL buckets of gold you told us you had in your possession \u201d . Further conversations between the robbers indicated that they had a southern NORP accent . When questioned after the incident the victims stated that they had not recognised anyone at the time , since they had been kept face down in the bedroom during the robbery . The Government contested the latter fact , relying on the version of events given by PERSON in DATE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his brother , like their father previously , had done work for the PERSON family as plumbers and electricians .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation Mr PERSON mentioned the applicant and his brother as possible people who had had access to his house and had been familiar with it , without indicating that he identified either of them as the robbers . Thus , despite the fact that the applicant had been questioned by the Police in DATE , neither of them had , at the time , or later , been charged in connection with this robbery and no criminal prosecution ever ensued because of the lack of any evidence pointing in their direction .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the relationship between the brothers and PERSON broke down following PERSON failure to make payments to the applicant \u2019s company . Following this , in DATE ORG ( the company owned in part by the applicant ) instituted proceedings against Mr PERSON claiming payment for services rendered ( these proceedings were eventually withdrawn following payment of the outstanding amount ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that pending the abovementioned proceedings , PERSON had started bad - mouthing the applicant to neighbours who had also suffered burglaries \u2013 stating that it had been the applicant , that is to say the electrician they all used , who had committed them . The PERSON noted that according to the evidence tendered by ORG , a neighbour of PERSON and PERSON ( see below ) , it had been a common perception that families who had been regular clients of the applicant had been robbed . The applicant highlighted that the same GPE , in crossexamination had twice confirmed that he had had no suspicions that the applicant had somehow been involved in the robbery .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the robbery , in DATE , PERSON and PERSON sued the applicant in civil proceedings for the damage resulting from the said robbery as , in retrospect , PERSON considered that he recognised the applicant as one of the robbers .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , the court heard evidence from PERSON ( including a lengthy affidavit ) and accepted an affidavit from PERSON wife . The applicant was unable to cross - examine PERSON on the basis of medical advice given by an ex parte doctor who had testified before the court to the effect that PERSON had been suffering from depression for DATE and that in DATE her state of health had become much worse ( she had been spending her days in bed not wanting to know about anything going on around her and had become dependent on others ) . He considered that there was no hope of this situation changing in the near future . When asked whether PERSON had been in a position to understand what she had been saying at the time of the incident , the ex parte doctor replied \u201c I think so , of course she was \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s request to have PERSON statement expunged from the record was refused .", "CARDINAL . In all , the evidence presented before the court consisted of the following :", "On behalf of the applicant :", "- The affidavit of the applicant , as well as his oral testimony ( where he noted the good relationship that had existed between him and the plaintiff and categorically denied any involvement in the robbery , during which he had been at home sleeping , and claimed that the plaintiffs had instituted the case only in response to the proceedings his company had lodged against Mr Z. , in which they had eventually been successful ; following these proceedings Mr PERSON had started telling neighbours who had been robbed that he ( the applicant ) had been responsible ; he related that the morning following the incident he had been surprised to see the police on the road at the Salibas\u2019 shop , close to Mr Z. \u2019s house and , after hearing what had happened , he had repeatedly tried to call Mr Z. to offer a helping hand . Since he had not been able to get through , he had gone to the house where he had been greeted warmly at the entrance by PERSON , who had recounted what had happened during TIME including a reference to QUANTITY persons who Mr PERSON had claimed had been watching the roof intermittently for a period ; DATE , while the applicant had been visiting a relative in hospital with his family , they had also visited PERSON ; PERSON had been happy to see him ( the applicant ) and had told him not to worry about the money he had been owed as only a little had been stolen and it had not even been worth the beating they got ; the applicant further noted that he had been surprised about PERSON written testimony , given the relationship of mutual respect they had had , and he wished to cross - examine her ; he further recounted how he had been called out to PERSON house during TIME only once , and that he had never fallen off a ladder , contrary to what had been alleged by Mr Z. He further referred to certain jobs completed in the house and to a number of named individuals who could have seen the safe ; he stated that the only times he had avoided Mr PERSON had been when the latter had failed to pay him ; he noted that contrary to what Mr PERSON had alleged , he had had no connection to arms or drugs ( save for possessing a hunting rifle with the relevant police permits , which he had no longer used ) ; he stated that he had not stopped work on CARDINAL of PERSON properties of his own motion , but because PERSON had told him to do so ; the applicant had also explained this to PERSON ( an architect ) ; the applicant also contradicted various elements of PERSON affidavit ; in particular he denied ever having been told about buckets of gold by PERSON , and reference to such gold had only been made by PERSON during the proceedings lodged against him , and by the police one time when they had questioned him ( the applicant ) ) ;", "- The affidavit of the applicant \u2019s wife ( she recounted that the applicant had only left the house twice during TIME since CARDINAL \u2013 once to go to the PERSON family \u2019s premises following an urgent call - out , and once to go to another client ; She also recounted their visit to PERSON after the robbery and in what circumstances they had met prior to the robbery ; she lastly explained how surprised and hurt she was about Mr. PERSON \u2019s actions in their regard ) .", "- The CARDINAL affidavits of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL brothers ( F. and S. ) and the oral testimony of F. ( F. confirmed that he had worked everywhere in the house , including next to the safe , together with other workmen from his company and that other named individuals had had access to the house as they had also rendered services there ; he also denied that he had ever spoken to PERSON ( the PERSON family \u2019s caretaker ) about payments due , and that he had ever taken anything from PERSON without permission , contrary to what had been alleged by him . He further stated that when questioned by the police DATE after the incident they had asked him whether he had been aware of the position of the safe and the buckets of gold ; in his oral testimony he confirmed that he had fallen off a ladder once in PERSON house contrary to PERSON statement alleging that it had been the applicant who had fallen ) ; ( PERSON testified that the brothers had stopped work on CARDINAL of the projects because PERSON had not confirmed that he had wished them to continue and had failed to pay sums already due , and in respect of which they had thus sued PERSON also contradicted other events recounted by Mr PERSON in his testimony and noted that he had never discussed due payments with PERSON )", "- The CARDINAL affidavits of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL sisters ( who denied ever having made certain statements to PERSON , which he had imputed to them in his testimony , or having gone to his house , or even having known him ) ;", "- The cross - examination of Mr PERSON ( at CARDINAL hearings ) ;", "- The crossexamination of the police investigator , PERSON ( at CARDINAL hearings ) ;", "- The cross - examination of a neighbour , PERSON", "On behalf of the plaintiffs :", "- The CARDINAL affidavits of Mr Z.", "In the first affidavit Mr PERSON explained the history and the good relationship he had had with the applicant \u2019s family and how much the PERSON family had cared for and trusted the applicant . He stated that at the time of the robbery the PERSON brothers had been working on project NORP but works had been stalled ; that the applicant \u2019s sisters had gone to his office worried and in fear of the applicant , who they said was clever and armed ; PERSON explained that DATE before the robbery the applicant had been working at the house , including on the roof , and at CARDINAL point , while distracted , the applicant had fallen off a ladder ; PERSON explained that on some occasions both the applicant and his brother had had access to the door of his roof and had known how to open it , and had also worked close to the safe . Mr PERSON stated that in DATE it had been only the applicant who had attended to jobs in the house and who had come during TIME , coming promptly and not charging them , even though he usually charged for all his services , even minor ones \u2013 thus , he had been the only one in the world , and nobody else , who had the knowledge of the house as it would be at TIME time . Mr PERSON related that on CARDINAL occasion , where payment to the applicant was likely to be delayed , he had reassured the applicant by referring to his ( Mr Z. \u2019s ) numerous immovable properties and told the applicant precisely to \u201c rest assured you have CARDINAL buckets of gold as guarantee \u201d . Mr PERSON noted that he had never used these words with anyone else and that the applicant had appeared to take him literally ; he stated that later on the applicant had also admitted to these words having been uttered to him . Mr PERSON recounted the robbery : how , while the Z couple had been asleep , they had heard chaos in the entrance of the house and CARDINAL man had run through the corridor directly towards them and asked him for gold . Another CARDINAL men had followed and kept the couple in the bedroom in the dark ; CARDINAL of them ( who injured his wife while holding her on the ground ) had again asked for gold stating that they would go and consume drugs , while the other had repeated \u201c give us the gold you told us you have \u201d . Mr PERSON stated that he had recognised the words on the spot , as those he had once uttered to the applicant . Mr PERSON noted that the CARDINAL people who had held them in the bedroom had appeared to be under the effects of drugs ; while they had been asking for gold it had become clear that they had been targeting the safe . TIME another voice had called out from the end of the corridor that they could leave and so they had done so . Mr PERSON stated that once the robbers had left the bedroom he had followed them and recognised the applicant as one of the CARDINAL or CARDINAL men - \u201c I recognised him with my eyes , after already knowing that he was CARDINAL of them through my ears \u201d . Mr PERSON held that the applicant had been the only one to have remained silent . Having known the applicant closely and worked with him for around twelve years , PERSON felt that he could recognise his mannerisms , stature , height and behaviour , as well as his movements and head inclinations , which corresponded to what he had seen . Mr PERSON continued to explain that it had been natural not to say anything in that moment of shock and fear , but that :", "\u201c I knew from the start that he was part of the group because I was told so and because I recognised him , he had kept his distance but I saw him leave in the car with the others as if [ qisu ] the bottom part of his face uncovered \u201d .", "While various rooms had been searched , only the contents of the safe had been stolen . Mr PERSON explained that one of the robbers had exclaimed \u201c there it is \u201d and they had initially tried to remove the safe , but then they found the key to it in PERSON purse , which as a habit she regularly kept on the armchair in the sitting room . Confronted with this situation Mr PERSON reiterated that on that date the applicant and his brother had been the CARDINAL persons who had known about the safe as they had been the only people who had entered that part of the house on multiple occasions since DATE , and the louvres had been always closed . Mr PERSON recalled how after the robbery numerous people had come and seen the safe , but not the applicant or his brothers . The applicant had had all the knowledge necessary , including how to open the roof door , where to cut the phone line , where to find the purse , and other useful details to facilitate such a robbery , which had taken place in TIME during TIME . Mr PERSON continued to explain the situation after the robbery . He stated that the working relationship had ended and that the applicant had gone to the house TIME after the robbery ; he had offered no help and had just shown his face ; nor had he offered any help when he had gone to visit PERSON in hospital , with his wife and daughter who , had not been known to the couple . Mr PERSON testified that DATE after the robbery he had gone to buy a bulb from the applicant , who had expressed no sympathy . Mr PERSON stated that subsequently the applicant had called him to tell him he would no longer work on project NORP , and PERSON noted that the architect ORG and their caretaker PERSON had said that the applicant had refused to work for Mr PERSON any longer as he had no longer had money , and that he had failed to pay the brothers money due for services rendered . It had also been strange that sometime after the robbery , Mr. Z had sent invoices claiming such fees and had started avoiding the applicant . Yet in DATE the applicant had sent DATE card and in DATE invited them to his daughter \u2019s wedding . Mr PERSON further referred to various robberies which had taken place in households in the neighbourhood which had been all clients of the applicant . He stated that PERSON had told him that the applicant had been the last person in the room before she had found her jewellery box missing . He reiterated the changed attitude of the applicant towards him following the robbery and had even instituted civil claims in judicial proceedings . The PERSON brothers had also not told him that their father had died , even though he had been the testamentary executor nominated by their late father . According to Mr PERSON the applicant had known that had they not been sure of his responsibility , they would not have instituted proceedings against him .", "In a later affidavit , Mr PERSON clarified that it had been CARDINAL of the sisters who had gone to him in fear of their brother . He considered the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s affidavit as totally untruthful ; likewise the applicant \u2019s ORG , in particular in connection with the reasons why work on project NORP had stopped DATE he noted that the real reason had been the robbery and the fact that the applicant had realised he had been caught \u2013 and in connection with their exchanges with PERSON also considered the applicant \u2019s testimony to have been untruthful and therefore an indication of guilt , and indicated a number of lies therein .", "- The affidavit of PERSON ( to the effect that robbers had targeted the safe , which they had tried to remove entirely until they had found the key to it in her handbag ; she stated that absolutely nobody had known about the safe before the robbery as nobody had entered that very private area of the house ; she further stated that it had been only the applicant who DATE in DATE before the robbery \u2013 had continuously and at all times of day and night entered all parts of the house as he had been their trusted handyman , and that sometimes he had been accompanied by his brother and that they had both known about the safe . She reiterated that it had been only the applicant who had had access to the safe and had known the house by TIME , knowledge which neither his brother nor the domestic help had had . She explained that she had been told that after the incident the applicant had gone to their house and to visit her in hospital with his family ; he had also sent a DATE card and invited the couple to his daughter \u2019s wedding ; however he had not wanted to continue working on CARDINAL of PERSON projects and had eventually sued them in court without giving them prior notice . She considered this to be odd given their good relationship , which had dated back DATE , and she thus considered that they had had something to hide . ) ;", "- The affidavit of the architect on project NORP , ORG ( who stated that the reason given by the applicant for stopping the works on project NORP had been that Mr PERSON had had no money ) ;", "- The affidavit of ORG an employee of the PERSON family ( who testified that the PERSON brothers had been the trusted electricians and plumbers of the PERSON family and they had stopped working on any of the PERSON family \u2019s properties after the robbery ( unlike other workers ) ; he stated that the brothers had once asked him why Mr PERSON had not been paying them as PERSON had told them that compared to the gold he had not even a breadcrumb had been taken . Another time the brothers had told him ( PERSON ) that they had not wanted to work for Mr PERSON anymore as he had had no money . When he ( PERSON ) had told PERSON what the brothers had told him , PERSON had told PERSON that he had once told the applicant not to worry if he had not paid up immediately as he had had CARDINAL buckets of gold as a guarantee for any outstanding debt . Mr PERSON had explained to him ( PERSON ) that the applicant had taken him literally and that the applicant had expected to find more than he had actually found in the safe ; PERSON also stated that he had never entered that private part of the house where the safe had been . Lastly , he denied participation in the robbery ) ;", "- The affidavits of CARDINAL neighbours , GPE and GPE ( ORG stated that he and other neighbours had been robbed while being clients of the applicant who ran a shop on the same road where they lived DATE this fact was known in the area ) ;", "- Evidence of police inspectors LOC and GPE ( LOC confirmed that at the time of the incident they had not known who the robbers had been : PERSON stated that the investigators had spoken about the applicant in DATE and that subsequently he had been questioned ( amongst others \u2013 CARDINAL people altogether ) as a person with the knowhow to commit such a robbery , as well as a result of PERSON claim to the effect that he had mentioned the buckets of gold only to the applicant . ORG also stated that PERSON had said that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL robbers had spoken during the incident ) ;", "- The cross - examination of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL brothers and CARDINAL of his sisters", "- Breakdown of the plaintiff \u2019s claim , confirmed under oath by PERSON , and a number of supporting documents .", "CARDINAL . By a CARDINAL - page judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its civil jurisdiction , considered that the applicant had taken part in the robbery and therefore ordered him to pay damages yet to be quantified , and requested that the plaintiffs submit a claim . The court admitted that there had been various inconsistencies in the testimony of Mr DATE for example statements that the applicant had been silent and yet that the victim had recognised him through his sense of hearing , as well as his statement that someone had told him that it had been the applicant . The court further noted that many of PERSON arguments indicating that the applicant was implicated had weakened his version . These arguments based the applicant \u2019s guilt on the fact that i ) he had fallen off a ladder ; ii ) that he had invited PERSON and PERSON to his daughter \u2019s wedding ; iii ) that he had not informed PERSON and PERSON about the demise of his father ; iv ) that he had been paid for work by means of land ; v ) that he had sent the PERSON family a postcard ; vi ) that the applicant had fallen out with his brothers ; and vii ) that the applicant had been \u201c silent and absent \u201d . Indeed these repeated arguments had been far - fetched and banal , usually an indication that an individual was not convinced of his statement . The court noted that the only established facts were that the robber had known both the house ( allowing him to move comfortably within it and find what he wanted ) and PERSON ( giving the robber a reason to remain silent during the robbery ) . While the applicant had not been the only one to have had these traits , the applicant had been one of the few who had had them . Furthermore , the robbers had known about the \u201c buckets of gold \u201d , which PERSON had allegedly mentioned to the applicant . In the court \u2019s view the robbers had either known this from the applicant and , if so , the applicant would have had no other reason to share this information apart from bad intentions , or the robber had actually been the applicant himself . The court noted that this unfortunately indicated that PERSON had used this factor for the identification of the applicant , and it would have been better to have solely relied on visual identification .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the court considered Mr PERSON \u2019s testimony reliable on the basis that identification could be based on mannerisms , movements and a silhouette , even if the face and voice remained hidden . It concluded that the applicant \u201c had taken part in the robbery \u201d and in application of the civil code was responsible for the damages suffered by the claimants .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of the same date the court ordered Mr Z. to lodge a schedule of damage within DATE .", "CARDINAL . By means of an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE , confirmed under oath by PERSON , the PERSON family claimed damage amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) covering the items and money stolen ( including a list of jewellery drawn up with the assistance of a professional who had not taken an oath ) and the expenses to repair the damage caused to the house . They further claimed medical expenses of LAW in relation to the injuries suffered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made submissions on this point requesting that the court not allow the affidavit of CARDINAL DATE as evidence on the grounds that the stage of putting forward evidence had been closed DATE and Mr PERSON had declared that he no longer had any evidence to submit .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( FAC ) , in its civil jurisdiction , ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in damages , specifically for the EUR CARDINAL in stolen items and cash and for the damage done to the house , as declared by PERSON ; and ORG CARDINAL in medical expenses . The court noted that the victims were not required to have receipts of the items obtained over DATE or proof of how much cash they had had in the house . In such circumstances the best proof was the GPE declaration under oath , the veracity of which ( after having seen the house ) the court had no reason to doubt . Thus , damages for items stolen had to be granted on the basis of PERSON claim . However , as to the medical expenses , while it was true that the claim had also been made under oath , given that the expenses had been incurred after the robbery and after the couple had already decided to sue , the court considered that the claimants should have kept receipts of such expenses and therefore made this award arbitrium boni viri .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of DATE the court refused the applicant \u2019s request not to allow the submission of the claim for expenses rendered by means of an affidavit not confirmed under oath by the ex parte expert and submitted after the stage for submissions of evidence had closed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed against all the above decisions . In his appeal application and again orally during the appeal hearing he asked the court to allow his brother to appear in court ( to show that the victim could not differentiate between the CARDINAL brothers \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above in connection with the testimonies concerning the ladder incident ) . The appeal application read as follows :", "\u201c At this stage , the plaintiff is humbly making a formal request to ORG to allow the applicant to produce as evidence before it his brother [ ORG ] in order for the court to be able to confirm the above ... \u201d", "The Government contested the fact that the written request had been repeated orally , as no such record had been found in the acts of the proceedings . ORG gave no reply to this request .", "CARDINAL . ORG , by a judgment of DATE , reiterated that it was well known that it was not for it to alter the assessment of evidence in the absence of compelling reasons . It noted that for civil proceedings to reach a finding it sufficed for a judge to have a \u201c moral certainty \u201d , as opposed to proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal proceedings . It was true that a more rigorous test was required when a person was being accused of a crime in the context of civil proceedings , particularly when the issue was the identity of the person . However , NORP law did not provide what was necessary for identification , only what was not necessary , thus leaving it to the judge to decide according to his discretion . In the present case , the whole case depended on PERSON identification of the applicant , which the firstinstance court had chosen to believe despite the inconsistencies and contradictions in his and PERSON testimonies . In this connection one had to bear in mind that the memory of a victim of a violent robbery could suffer psychological effects which may result in inconsistencies . Having examined the acts of the proceedings and the applicant \u2019s submissions , it considered that it need not depart from the first - instance court \u2019s findings because the applicant \u2019s arguments were secondary to the actual identification of the applicant and were therefore not justified .", "CARDINAL . As to the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s objection in relation to the claim for damages which were allowed at a later stage , the court considered that the claim was not new evidence as such and it was the only proof of the damage that had been caused . Moreover , it had been the court which had requested that Mr PERSON lodge the claim and the applicant had had the possibility of making submissions in reply , thus no prejudice had been caused .", "CARDINAL . As to the award of damages , ORG noted that PERSON testimony had been made under oath ; the list of jewellery had been drawn up with the assistance of an expert ( although he had not confirmed it under oath ) ; thus , PERSON could not be blamed for not presenting further evidence of the damage , particularly since some items had been inherited and others purchased long before , as well as because certain documents had also been in the safe and had been stolen during the robbery . Mr. PERSON had not valued the items himself and had appropriately engaged a jeweller to perform the evaluation . Had the applicant had doubts as to that person \u2019s expertise , he could have , at the relevant time , challenged him and called him as a witness .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings claiming a violation of , inter alia , LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its constitutional jurisdiction , rejected the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . It considered that the applicant had not been found guilty of a criminal offence , but was responsible for damages arising as a result of that crime . In consequence the proceedings remained under civil law and the burden of proof remained that used for civil cases , namely a balance of probabilities , and did not require a more onerous degree of proof . It noted that the first court had assessed the evidence available and considered that the identification of the applicant had been convincingly established ; ORG found no reason to alter that conclusion . Thus there was nothing which indicated a breach of the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s inability to cross - examine PERSON , it noted that there had been a valid reason , namely her poor health as confirmed by her doctor , and the applicant had had the opportunity to comment on her written testimony . In its view there had been nothing arbitrary in the court \u2019s decision to allow that statement , as it had been acting within its discretion . Furthermore , the applicant had not appealed against this matter before ORG . As to the refusal of the appeal court to call for his brother , it noted that it was not ORG role to re - examine witnesses and the applicant \u2019s brother had already given testimony in written and oral form at first instance . As to the refusal not to allow the \u201c late \u201d claim for damages , it found that this fell within the court \u2019s discretion to proceed with the case in the way it deemed fit in the interests of justice . Lastly , no issue arose from the courts\u2019 acceptance of an evaluation of damage which had not been confirmed under oath by the expert , and such an evaluation fell within the discretion of the courts . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s rights had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It considered that in the civil proceedings the first - instance court had had no doubt about Mr Z. \u2019s testimony and his identification of the applicant and nothing indicated that that court had not taken into consideration all the necessary evidence for its assessment . Furthermore , ORG had not found there were compelling reasons to alter that decision .", "CARDINAL . As to the failure of ORG to hear evidence from the applicant \u2019s brother , it considered that although this request had been made in writing amongst other pleadings in the appeal application , it had not been reiterated in the concluding requests of the appeal application . There was also no note in TIME of the hearings that this matter had been raised orally . In any event , the applicant \u2019s brother had given testimony at first instance and , given that such a decision fell within the discretion of the courts , the applicant had not proved that the failure to re - examine the witness had caused him prejudice .", "CARDINAL . As to the inability of the applicant to cross - examine PERSON , ORG noted that her testimony ( unlike that of her husband ) had not referred to the identification of the applicant , which had been nearly the only factor on which the civil court had based its decision . Thus , no prejudice had been caused to the applicant . It followed that no issue of equality of arms arose as a result of the CARDINAL procedural steps examined above .", "CARDINAL . As to the decision on the damage , ORG considered that the principle of onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit non ei qui negat had been respected , as the civil court had opined that the damage had been proved by Mr Z.", "CARDINAL . According to the documents submitted , following the above judgments the applicant became extremely depressed and unfit for work . He was thus excused from work and began to receive a disability pension . He considered that had he continued to work , he would have earned much more . According to the ORG the applicant was certified as unfit for work on DATE and retired when he was CARDINAL and has since then been in receipt of a pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr and PERSON made a request for a judicial sale by auction of property belonging to the applicant in order to have the courts\u2019 judgment enforced . Another such request was made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant attempted to obtain the entire case file concerning the civil proceedings ; however , he was informed that it had gone missing from ORG ; the applicant lodged the application before this ORG with the documents in his possession . The Government located the file following communication of the application and submitted it to the ORG .", "DATE . In DATE , since they had not yet received payment from the applicant , the PERSON family instituted civil proceedings against the applicant \u2019s brother PERSON , asking the court to declare him responsible for the same robbery and asking the court to order ( in solidum with the applicant ) the payment of the same damages liquidated by ORG in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
