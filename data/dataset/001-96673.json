The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He worked for \u201c GPE za domakinstvo \u201d , a socially - owned company which was DATE restructured under the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE allowing its transformation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was reassigned to the post of technologist with the stated aim of increasing productivity and efficiency and improving operations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action seeking to have the reassignment annulled since , in DATE with the same employer , he had never worked as a technologist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . On DATE ORG quashed this decision ordering the lower court to examine what had been the applicant \u2019s status with the employer ; whether and how had the bankruptcy proceedings , initiated meanwhile against the employer , affected the applicant \u2019s employment and whether the employer had been restructured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court annulled the employer \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE dismissing the applicant ( in respect of which the applicant had brought a separate action ) . According to the Government , in these proceedings the applicant had sought to have the proceedings concerning his reassignment suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s claim was upheld at first instance . The court held that although the reassignment decision had referred to the relevant provisions of LAW and LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic laws \u201d below ) it had not provided the applicant with concrete reasons for his reassignment . In this connection , it stated that section CARDINAL of LAW had been of a declaratory nature without providing any concrete reason for reassignment . On DATE ORG quashed this decision finding that the reassignment decision had provided reasons for the applicant \u2019s reassignment . However , it ordered the first - instance court to determine whether the reassignment had been justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court , deciding the case for the third time , upheld the applicant \u2019s claim and annulled the reassignment decision . The court established that the applicant had worked for the same employer since DATE in different posts and that no concrete reasons had been given for his reassignment . In this latter respect , it referred to a court annulment , for lack of concrete reasons , of the reassignment of Mr R.V. , the applicant \u2019s colleague , which had been based on the same grounds , as the applicant \u2019s ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , \u041f.\u0431\u0440. CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . Noting that the reassignment decision had been rendered under LAW and LAW of ORG , it stated , inter alia ,", "\u201c ... in case of reassignment , an employee should be provided with a reasoned decision in writing so that he or she can protect his or her rights and the court may review its lawfulness . In the present case , the disputed decision does not set out any reasonable ground , which implies that the employer had not established the need for the [ applicant \u2019s ] reassignment . If no reasonable grounds are provided , the reassignment of any employee , including the [ applicant ] , is unlawful . [ The employer ] has only quoted the terms for reassignment , as specified in LAW , without providing any reasonable ground ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also concluded that the reassignment had been unjustified given the applicant \u2019s age and lack of experience required for the new post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the employer \u2019s appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... the reassignment decision does not set out any reasons . The employer has merely referred to ORG objectives of increasing the productivity and efficiency of the applicant and for work organisation purposes . It does not mean that by mere reference to these grounds , the employer has established the need for the [ applicant \u2019s ] reassignment ... It means that [ the applicant ] was reassigned to a post which does not correspond to his work experience ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal on points of law submitted by the employer on DATE and overturned the lower courts\u2019 decisions . It held that they had wrongly applied national law . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW of ORG , it found that the employer had been entitled to assess the need for reassignment - which would be well - founded only if an employee was reassigned to a post commensurate with his or her vocational capacity . It further held that the issue as to whether the employee would be more efficient in the new post went beyond the scope of judicial review . It concluded that :", "\u201c Concerning the grounds for reassignment provided in the [ disputed ] decision , the court considers that it is sufficient to state one of the terms specified in LAW . The disputed decision meets this requirement ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , ORG is the highest court providing uniformity in the implementation of laws by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438 ) , as in force at the material time , provided that in cases where collective agreements applied , an employee could be reassigned to any post commensurate with his or her vocational capacity .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an employee may be reassigned to a post commensurate with his or her qualifications with a view to , inter alia , improving efficiency .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provided , inter alia , that the court should take into consideration the need for the urgent settlement of employment disputes .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL decisions of DATE and CARDINAL , ORG ruled that employers were required to give concrete reasons for reassignment and that mere reference to section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW of the collective agreement was insufficient unless concrete facts , circumstances and grounds were provided for the reassignment ( ORG decisions of DATE ( \u0420\u0435\u0432.\u0431\u0440.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( NORP ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
