Following several hearings , held by DATE , attended by the experts and/or the applicant , on DATE ORG ordered that the latter be subjected to a compulsory examination and placed in a psychiatric institution for a period of no longer than DATE .

On DATE ORG concluded that the applicant suffered from litigious paranoia ( paranoia querulans ) , and recommended that his legal capacity be restricted .

The expert explained , inter alia , that the applicant suffered from a borderline personality disorder , that this disorder was not , as such , a mental illness , but that it was also characterised by occasional psychotic episodes when the applicant ' state could be considered as a temporary mental illness . The decisive factor was the specific situation faced by the applicant and his reaction thereto . In DATE , in view of the relevant circumstances , the applicant was therefore rightly considered as not being criminally responsible , whilst in DATE his criminal responsibility could not be excluded altogether .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in ORG decided that the proceedings should be continued before ORG in FAC .
