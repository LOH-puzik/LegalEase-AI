Mr. PERSON was born in DATE and lives in GPE .

CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant commenced an action before ORG claiming that his dismissal was \" socially unjustified \" ( \" sozial ungerechtfertigt \" ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) . The other party ( \" the defendants \" ) served a defence on DATE , DATE before the expiry of the time - limit granted for this purpose by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the first hearing on DATE , Mr. PERSON \u2019s lawyer submitted new written pleadings . ORG thereupon allowed an application by the defendants for time to reply and adjourned the case until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their written reply of CARDINAL DATE , the defendants , as requested by ORG , gave a detailed account of the reasons for the contested dismissal ; they also described the economic situation of the firm and explained the rationalisation measures taken .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer appended to his counter - reply of DATE a note written to him by his client . This note contained the charge that the managers of the PERSON firm had \" negligently squandered the CARDINAL ( business and private assets ) properly earned by PERSON \" but had \" personally secured to themselves such a safe position that these people are no longer interested in whether or not the PERSON firm gets even deeper into the red \" .", "These accusations prompted the defendants on DATE to send the applicant CARDINAL further notices of dismissal , an extraordinary notice ( ausserordentliche PERSON ) effective forthwith and , as an alternative or precautionary ( vorsorglich ) measure , an ordinary notice ( ordentliche PERSON ) with effect from DATE . The extraordinary notice was based on LAW ( ORG ) which requires a \" serious reason \" for a dismissal of this kind and the giving of notice within DATE from the moment when the employers had knowledge of the facts judged by them to constitute such a reason .", "On DATE , Mr. PERSON \u2019s lawyer filed CARDINAL further sets of written submissions dated CARDINAL and DATE respectively ; appended to the former was a copy of the defendant \u2019s letter of DATE ; the latter extended the plaintiff \u2019s action to cover the CARDINAL dismissal notices of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG delivered judgment on DATE immediately after hearing the final submissions of the parties . It held that neither the notice of CARDINAL DATE nor the extraordinary notice of DATE had terminated the applicant \u2019s contract , since the former was \" socially unjustified \" within the meaning of QUANTITY CARDINAL of LAW and the latter was invalid for lack of a \" serious reason \" as required by LAW .

It ordered the defendants to pay Mr. PERSON CARDINAL arrears of wages but dismissed the claim for future salary .", "The judgment was notified in writing to the parties on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The defendants appealed to ORG on CARDINAL DATE . In their submission , the accusations made by Mr. PERSON constituted a \" serious reason \" warranting the extraordinary notice of DATE ; the CARDINAL ordinary notices of DATE and DATE were likewise valid , the former being \" socially justified \" for pressing reasons connected with the running of the business . They called on the ORG to overrule the judgment appealed from and to dismiss the plaintiff \u2019s action or , in the alternative , to discharge the contract of employment existing between the CARDINAL parties .", "The applicant in turn lodged a cross - appeal ( ORG ) on DATE , seeking payment of arrears of wages for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In the course of this written procedure both the applicant and the defendants had requested ORG not to hold sittings during certain periods , namely from DATE to DATE for the applicant and from DATE to DATE and from DATE for the defendants .", "CARDINAL . Taking due note of this , ORG on CARDINAL DATE set the case down for hearing on DATE . On DATE , the ORG examined , amongst other matters , the exact circumstances surrounding the tendering in evidence of the applicant \u2019s accusations which had been appended to his lawyer \u2019s written pleading of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . When questioned whether he had intended use to be made of these accusations in the lawsuit , he stated that he had relied on the judgment of his lawyer . The ORG also raised the possibility of employing Mr. PERSON in some other capacity ; it directed the defendants to submit within DATE a chart setting out the firm \u2019s commercial staff structure , indicating for each post whether it was suitable for the applicant and , if not , the reason why .", "The applicant was given DATE to reply .", "CARDINAL .

By memorandum of DATE , the defendants refused the settlement proposal ; they referred to the \" undisputed \" fact that the QUANTITY notices of DATE had been served on the applicant on DATE .", "For his part , Mr. PERSON \u2019s lawyer , in a written statement of DATE in which he paid tribute to ORG for its \" thorough and prudent examination of the case \" , declined to accept the suggested settlement ; he specified that he could only agree to such a solution if the contract were regarded as terminated on DATE .", "In addition , on DATE he filed a brief reply to the above - mentioned memorandum of DATE .

He added that he would be absent from CARDINAL May to DATE and requested ORG to fix a hearing in DATE", "On DATE , ORG directed that the hearings should resume on DATE and so advised the parties on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , Mr. PERSON denied that he had actually received the CARDINAL notices of DATE on DATE and asked the ORG to question on his wife on this point , which was material for the purposes of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

At the same time it invited the applicant , who had applied for free legal aid in the appeal proceedings , to supply the necessary certificate for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . The certificate was submitted under cover of a letter of CARDINAL DATE from Mr. PERSON \u2019s lawyer . Consequently , on DATE the ORG granted free legal aid for the applicant \u2019s defence against the main appeal ; it reserved its decision as regards his cross - appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG refused leave for the constitutional application to proceed : even supposing the application to be admissible , it did not offer sufficient prospects of success since there was nothing in the evidence to show that ORG had protracted the proceedings ; having regard to the extreme complexity of the facts of the case , the length of the lawsuit had been caused primarily by the applicant who had continuously supplemented his submissions and called for the taking of further evidence .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge of ORG , which was dealing with the applicant \u2019s case , retired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses in connection with the date of receipt of the dismissal notices .

The charges made by the applicant constituted a serious reason for dismissal within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW and the dismissal notice had been served within DATE laid down by paragraph CARDINAL of that Article . The thorough and convincing explanations furnished by the expert made it clear that Mr. PERSON \u2019s accusations were without foundation ( haltlos ) : apart from being extremely defamatory , they were inappropriate and quite unnecessary for his cause of action contesting the ordinary notice of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The judgment was notified in writing to the parties on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , Mr. PERSON challenged this decision before ORG alleging violation of several basic rights . He complained of the length of the proceedings before the various labour courts , citing this factor as the cause of the contested decision . He further criticised ORG for having terminated a lawsuit \" which in normal circumstances should not have been terminated yet \" ; in view of his application to the Commission , so he contended , ORG had \" clearly not wished to make the breach of the LAW more evident by continuing the proceedings \" . In addition , the applicant claimed that the judgment being challenged was unsustainable as far as its reasoning was concerned ( sachlich unhaltbar ) and constituted an unacceptable domestic sanction intended to punish him for having taken his case to the Commission .", "On DATE , ORG refused leave for the constitutional application to proceed on the ground that it was inadmissible . The applicant had not , it was stated , identified with sufficient clarity any possible violation of his basic rights . In particular , his complaint regarding the length of the proceedings did not warrant a finding that the outcome of the action was incompatible with any of his basic rights ; this was likewise true of his submission that the reasoning of the judgment being challenged did not bear examination .", "As in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Court had sat in judgment as a panel of CARDINAL judges .", "CARDINAL .

In this respect , ORG was more favoured than the labour courts of appeal of the other ORG where , nevertheless , a downward trend was also registered .
