The applicant is an NORP national who was born on DATE in GPE and currently lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE illegally on DATE and applied for asylum DATE . He had CARDINAL hearings before ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr DATE hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was a summary interview at ORG \u201c ORG and Procedure \u201d ( Empfangs- FAC ) in GPE on DATE . The applicant gave an account of the alleged events in GPE leading to his escape from his home country . This account was summarised by ORG interviewer in official TIME . At the beginning of this summary , the interviewer noted : \u201c For lack of staff , the facts - summarised under no . TIME - were not established in detail . \u201d ( \u201c GPE aus GPE auf eine vertiefte PERSON . CARDINAL verzichtet . \u201d ) . An interpreter was present during the hearing and the minutes were translated for the applicant prior to his signing .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the applicant stated that , following serious ballotrigging after the NORP presidential elections on DATE , anti - regime demonstrations had started to take place . He had participated in almost all these demonstrations until DATE . He claimed that he and his friends had organised peaceful demonstrations DATE . As the demonstrations had been brutally oppressed by the NORP regime , he and his friends had documented the demonstrations and had circulated this documentation to people . He further claimed that during the last demonstration he had attended , at DATE , several of his friends had been arrested . He alleged that they had been tortured and that CARDINAL of them had probably mentioned his name to the NORP authorities and had told them about his participation in the demonstrations . Consequently , on DATE , a summons issued by ORG of ORG had been delivered to his residence , namely his GPE house in GPE , by a court courier . He had not been present at the time of delivery as he had been on a visit to his sister \u2019s house in GPE . The summons had ordered him to appear in court on CARDINAL DATE . Fearing that he might be arrested upon his appearance , he had not presented himself in court but had hidden at his sister \u2019s home and at the homes of various friends in GPE . As a result of his non - appearance before the court , agents of the secret service had come to his GPE house DATE ( CARDINAL DATE ) in order to arrest him . Because of his absence , his father had been arrested instead . The applicant had been left a message that he should report to the district police , otherwise his father would remain in detention . For fear of arrest and on his family \u2019s advice , he had fled the country without legal exit papers in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In order to support his account during the first hearing , the applicant submitted the allegedly original summons of ORG of ORG of CARDINAL DATE . He also submitted documentary material pertaining to the anti - regime demonstrations , which had allegedly been produced by him and his friends .", "CARDINAL . The second , more detailed hearing took place at ORG office in GPE DATE after the first hearing , on DATE . A member of the non - governmental ORG of ORG of GPE ( Hilfswerk der PERSON GPE ) was present as a neutral witness in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing . He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the minutes of the hearing in the event that he had witnessed any irregularities , but did not note down any such observations . Again , an interpreter was present during the hearing and the minutes were translated for the applicant prior to his signing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant again gave an account of the alleged events in GPE leading up to his escape . With regard to the events on DATE when the summons had allegedly been delivered to his GPE house ( DATE ) , the applicant now described that members of the ORG security service had come to his GPE house in his absence in order to search for him . They had searched the house , opening chests of drawers and cupboards . As they had been unable to find him , they had issued the summons while at his GPE house and had left it behind . Confronted with the fact that he had not mentioned the house search of CARDINAL DATE during the first hearing , the applicant responded that he had in fact done so , that he had recounted the same facts during the first hearing and that it was not his fault that this fact had not been recorded in TIME first hearing .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , asked about his hiding place prior to his escape from GPE , the applicant stated during the second interview that he had stayed at his sister \u2019s home the whole time . When confronted with his testimony from the first hearing , the applicant explained that he had been with friends as well and added that these people had been friends from work and not friends he knew from the demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the aftermath of the last demonstration he had attended in DATE , the applicant stated during the second hearing that he did not know that the PERSON security forces were planning to arrest him . He again alleged that CARDINAL of the friends arrested during the demonstrations had told the security forces who had participated in these demonstrations . Asked when this friend who had given his name had been arrested , the applicant responded that he did not know and that it had not necessarily been this arrested friend directly who had given his name to the security forces . Arrests of that kind usually started a whole chain reaction : the arrested person would give some names , then these people would be arrested and questioned and give further names , and so on .", "CARDINAL . Questioned further during the second hearing about any special occurrences with regard to his last demonstration in DATE , the applicant stated that the demonstrations had all been rather similar . People had been arrested and agents of the government had beaten up people during the last demonstration just as during any other demonstration . Asked whether he knew the people who had been arrested , the applicant responded that he just knew these people from the street . They had not been people from his region . GPE was a big city and people had come from everywhere . Confronted with his testimony from the first interview , in which he had claimed that friends of his had been arrested , the applicant stated that the people demonstrating together were all friends in a way and that he had used the term \u201c friends \u201d in that sense when giving his account of the events during the demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for asylum and ordered him to leave GPE by DATE . ORG reasoned that the applicant \u2019s statement of facts was not credible as his descriptions of the events in GPE had not been consistent during the QUANTITY hearings . The descriptions diverged considerably from each other with regard to decisive points of the applicant \u2019s story . During the first hearing , the applicant had neither mentioned the appearance of the PERSON security forces at his GPE house , nor had he mentioned the house search , nor the fact that it had been the ORG who had issued a summons directly at his GPE house on DATE , but had simply stated that a courier of the court had brought the summons . Furthermore , the accounts of the applicant \u2019s hiding prior to his escape from GPE diverged from each other , as the applicant had first stated that he had hidden at his sister \u2019s home and at friends\u2019 homes , whereas he had claimed to have stayed exclusively at his sister \u2019s home during the second hearing . Finally , the applicant had only mentioned the arrest of his friends during his last demonstration only in the account he had given during the first hearing and not during the second interview . ORG took into consideration that the applicant had submitted some documentary material including the alleged summons of CARDINAL DATE , but was of the view that these documents could not dispel the doubts about the applicant \u2019s account . The documentary material gave only a general account of the demonstrations , but not specifically anything about the applicant \u2019s alleged participation , and a summons alone could not prove any public persecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , now represented by counsel , appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG ( ORG ) . He asked ORG to quash the decision of ORG , to grant him asylum , to find that the execution of the expulsion order would be an improper and unreasonable measure , and to grant him legal aid .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the applicant claimed that upon the advice of his counsel he had phoned his family in GPE and had asked whether any further summons had been received . On that occasion he had learnt that he had again been summoned to appear before ORG of ORG on DATE . He had also learnt that ORG had convicted him in absentia on DATE because he had participated in demonstrations against the NORP regime and had criticised the regime in slogans . The court had sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and CARDINAL lashes . The applicant claimed to be in possession only of copies of the summons of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE because his family suspected state surveillance and feared that the mail would be checked if they tried to send him the originals by post . The applicant submitted the copies of the alleged new summons and of the alleged judgment to ORG . In his appeal , he also asked ORG and ORG whether the authenticity of the CARDINAL documents could be assessed by ORG in GPE if the originals were handed in or shown there .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the applicant also argued that the deviations between his CARDINAL statements of the facts could be explained by the different nature of the CARDINAL hearings . The first hearing had been only a summary hearing and the applicant had been asked not to go into detail . It was therefore understandable that he had not described the house search of CARDINAL DATE until the second hearing . With regard to his hiding prior to his departure from GPE , his CARDINAL reports were correct and consistent . He had stayed at his sister \u2019s home but he had also met friends from work and spent time with them . With regard to the events during the last demonstration , he had in essence stated the same facts during the CARDINAL hearings , namely that he and his friends had documented the demonstration and had handed out leaflets , that many participants , including his friends , had been arrested , and that he believed that CARDINAL of the arrested persons had passed on his name to the NORP authorities . The applicant further argued that when assessing his CARDINAL statements , it had to be taken into consideration that DATE had elapsed between the CARDINAL hearings and that no one was able to describe events in exactly the same way after such a long time . Finally , the applicant claimed that the second hearing had not been fair , as the interviewer had constantly interrupted him and treated him as if he were lying .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered an interim decision in which it declined the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid , reasoning that his application lacked any prospects of success . In its preliminary assessment of the case , ORG found that the applicant had not convincingly shown that he was persecuted by ORG . His statements of the facts as given during the CARDINAL hearings by ORG diverged from each other with regard to essential points and his story was therefore not credible . The summons of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had no probative value as the applicant had submitted only copies of these documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as manifestly ill - founded . In accordance with section CARDINAL and section CARDINALa of MONEY of DATE ( hereafter \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINALss . below ) , the case was decided by a single judge and the judgment contained only a summary reasoning . An oral hearing was not provided for in the rules of procedure . In accordance with section CARDINALa of LAW , ORG also abstained from the possibility of exchanging observations between the parties . ORG was hence not given an opportunity to comment on the submission of the copies of the alleged summons of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE or on the possibility of having the alleged original documents \u2013 which were allegedly in the possession of the applicant \u2019s family \u2013 checked by the NORP embassy in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided that the applicant had no right to asylum . It further stated that there was no reason not to execute the expulsion order as the applicant had not been able to prove that he had been subject to state persecution in GPE . His accounts of the events during the CARDINAL hearings diverged with regard to essential details and the applicant had not managed to explain these discrepancies to ORG satisfaction . The time that had passed between the CARDINAL hearings could not explain the contradictions , since the applicant had not been expected to describe the events in GPE in exactly the same way but rather in a consistent manner . Furthermore , contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegation , there was no indication that the second hearing had been unfair . The hearing had been attended by a member of ORG of GPE as a neutral witness . This person had not made any remarks about irregularities witnessed during the hearing , although he could have done so . TIME had been translated for the applicant and signed by him . He had therefore had the opportunity to correct any statement had he found that it had not been noted down correctly .", "CARDINAL . The court further found that it could not draw any conclusions from the submitted copy of the summons of CARDINAL DATE or the copy of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the applicant \u2019s favour , as copies had no probative value . The court did not mention the first summons of CARDINAL DATE , the authenticity of which had not been questioned in the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a new expulsion order requiring the applicant to leave GPE before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG and asked for Rule CARDINAL of ORG to be applied in order to stay the enforcement of his expulsion . He stated that he had participated in demonstrations against the NORP regime following the presidential elections of DATE up until DATE and that he had handed out leaflets on these occasions . He further alleged that the ORG security forces had searched his GPE house with the purpose of arresting him . Moreover , he claimed that he had been summoned twice to appear before ORG of ORG and that the same court had sentenced him in absentia on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , the payment of a fine , and CARDINAL lashes of the whip because of his participation in the demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of his claims the applicant attached to his application of CARDINAL DATE documentary material on the demonstrations in GPE , written in NORP , copies of the alleged summonses of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and a copy of the alleged judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that he was now in possession of the original summons of CARDINAL DATE and of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as his sister \u2019s husband had finally dared to send the documents by special delivery in DATE . He also provided the ORG with LANGUAGE translations of the summons of CARDINAL DATE and the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . A translation of the summons of CARDINAL DATE was not submitted . A translation was included in TIME of the applicant \u2019s second hearing , however , and this had been submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the translation of the summons of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was summoned to appear before the CARDINALth division of ORG of ORG on DATE at TIME , because of \u201c participation in demonstrations against the public safety and the system of GPE \u201d . The summons was signed by an \u201c investigating authority \u201d on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The translation of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of ORG reads in its material part :", "\u201c Charge : Undertakings and activities against the sacred order of ORG", "Judgement", "In the case of the accused Mr. PERSON , the court \u2013 due to the charge sheet of the CARDINALth division of the public prosecutor \u2019s office for the General and ORG of Teheran , due to the existing exhibits and his file , due to the credible report of the intelligence service and the clarification as well as the investigations of public prosecutor \u2019s office mentioned above , due to the testimonies of the persons under arrest as well as due to the especially useful information on file , moreover because of the punishable participation in illegal gatherings , because of the disturbance of the peace and the system of GPE , because of being a troublemaker and the writing of slogans , calling for resistance against the polity by distributing flyers and non - appearance before court despite being summoned , as well as due to the waiver of defence in court DATE comes to the conclusion that his guilt has been established .", "For these reasons , in application of Art . CARDINAL of the NORP law , he is sentenced to DATE of imprisonment , CARDINAL strokes of the whip and to a fine of MONEY which is to be paid to the treasury .", "An appeal against this judgment delivered in absentia is possible within DATE after disclosure . After this period of time , a request for reconsideration can be submitted to the competent courts of the province of GPE . \u201d", "The translation also states that the judgment had been", "\u201c disclosed on CARDINAL DATE \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
