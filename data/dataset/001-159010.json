NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant made a technical invention , for which he applied for a patent on DATE . Subsequently , on DATE , he received a patent for his invention which was , however , later withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant joined a big telecommunications company in GPE . He told the company early on about his invention and proposed cooperation with the company . The company apparently learned about his patent application on DATE but was not interested in cooperation . On DATE the applicant \u2019s employment with the company ended .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant noticed that the company was infringing his patent and informed the company of this . The company initiated civil proceedings against the applicant , claiming ownership of the applicant \u2019s invention . On DATE the Helsinki ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) rejected the company \u2019s claim to ownership of the applicant \u2019s invention but accepted its alternative claim and confirmed that the applicant had made the invention in question while working for the company . The court also confirmed that the company held a licence for the invention and that it had to pay the applicant reasonable compensation for this patent licence . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld ORG judgment . This judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant and the company could not agree on reasonable compensation for the patent licence , the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the company in LOC on DATE . He claimed , inter alia , compensation of MONEY ( ORG ) for the use of the patent licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s claims partly and ordered the company to pay him ORG CARDINAL in compensation . The applicant was also ordered to pay the company \u2019s costs and expenses before ORG , which after mitigation amounted to LAW . The court found that the applicant had not been able to show that the company had actually used the invention for which it held the licence . The invention had thus had no greater value for the company . The fact that the company held the patent licence had not prevented the applicant from patenting the invention or giving further licences to it , as the applicant still held all rights . As there were CARDINAL separate patents , the court estimated the proper compensation to be LAW for each patent and thus ORG CARDINAL in total . At the same time as the judgment , the parties also received , for information , a statement drafted by the technical experts appointed by the court and given to the court in the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to the ORG requesting , inter alia , that the company be ordered to pay him ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for the holding of the patent licence and that he be freed from the obligation to pay the company \u2019s costs and expenses . He requested that an oral hearing be held and that the technical experts attend this hearing . Moreover , the applicant complained about the fact that the obligation to pay costs and expenses completely cancelled out his right to compensation and asked to be dispensed from paying . The company lodged a counter appeal , requesting that the compensation be reduced to LAW and that the applicant be ordered to pay the company \u2019s costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , after having held an oral hearing , accepted the company \u2019s claims and reduced the amount of compensation payable to the applicant to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It also ordered the applicant to pay the company \u2019s costs and expenses before FAC and ORG to a total of EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL plus interest . The court found that as the compensation concerned just CARDINAL patent , to which the company held only a licence , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL was proper compensation . As to the costs and expenses , the court found that the different material positions of the applicant and the company spoke for the mitigation of the payment obligation in the applicant \u2019s favour . However , even though the invention had been important to the applicant , he had requested compensation equal to PERCENT of the DATE turnover of the whole company - group . His claims had , from the outset , been manifestly ill - founded and non - itemised , and no evidence had been presented to support them . The grounds for mitigation were not therefore fulfilled and the applicant was ordered to pay the costs and expenses of the company in full .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG . Moreover , he stressed the fact that the technical experts had not attended ORG hearing and requested that they be asked to present a further statement on the matter at hand . If that option was not available , he requested that the case be referred back to ORG for the hearing of the experts .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( patenttilaki , patentlagen , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as in force at the material time ) , ORG is competent to hear patent matters . When examining a patent matter , ORG is to be assisted by CARDINAL technical experts appointed by the court . The experts are to give their views on the matters submitted to them by the court . Their views are entered in the record and they are entitled to question the parties and witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Patents Act provides the following :", "\u201c The ORG shall appoint an appropriate number of experts as referred to in CARDINAL for DATE . Before making the appointments , the ORG shall request the opinion of ORG . Such appointment may not be refused without statutory justification .", "Before taking up his appointment , an expert shall be required to take the prescribed oath .", "Experts shall be paid a reasonable fee for each case as laid down by ORG together with compensation for travelling expenses as prescribed by the Government . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears from the ORG proposal HE CARDINAL vp that the practice at the relevant time was that the experts practically always gave their statement after the conclusion of the oral hearing . The parties to the proceedings were not given a possibility to comment on the experts\u2019 statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP This state of affairs changed when LAW was amended with effect from DATE ( Act no . CARDINAL ) . According to the new section CARDINALc of the LAW , the ORG shall provide the parties a possibility to comment on the statement of the experts before deciding the case . According to the transitional provisions , if such a matter has already become pending in a ORG before the entry into force of the amendment , the previous provision is applicable .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken , Act no .

The statement shall be compiled in writing , unless the court deems there to be reason to allow for its being given orally . When a person is appointed as an expert witness not on the basis of his or her official position or function , the court shall determine the time within which the statement is to be given .", "An expert witness who has given a written statement shall be orally heard in court , if a party so requests and the hearing is not evidently irrelevant , or if the court deems the hearing of the expert witness necessary . If there are several expert witnesses , one or several of them may be called to be heard . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
