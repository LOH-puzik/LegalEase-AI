The applicants were members of an informal group of residents of GPE opposed to the ORG terminals , called \u201c GPE \u201d . GPE was formed in DATE and had CARDINAL members who met regularly . The applicant became involved in GPE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Construction and operation of the ORG terminals at GPE requires , inter alia , planning permission granted by the relevant local planning authority ; hazardous substances consent granted by ORG ; compliance with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) Regulations ; compliance with international certification requirements for vessels ; and compliance with byelaws , general directions and FAC . A brief outline of these requirements is set out below . For further details of the relevant domestic law see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . Planning permission was required for the construction of the ORG terminals , including the jetties and piers , and the use of the land for that purpose . The power of the local planning authorities to grant planning permission for development was subject to Regulations which prohibited the grant of planning permission unless relevant environmental information had been taken into account .", "CARDINAL . The operation of the ORG terminals also required consent from the appropriate hazardous substances authority . The key role of the hazardous substances authority was to control the presence of hazardous substances on , over or under land .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was a statutory consultee in respect of the applications made for hazardous substances consent . This meant that the hazardous substances authority was obliged to consult the ORG and to take account of its representations , but was not bound to follow them . The role of the ORG was to provide advice on the nature and severity of the risks presented by major hazards to people in surrounding areas so that they could be balanced against other material planning considerations .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG terminals remain subject to ORG , which apply mainly to the chemical industry but also to some storage activities , explosives and nuclear sites and other industries where threshold quantities of dangerous substances are kept or used . The purpose of LAW is to reduce the risk of major accidents to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable by imposing on - site safety control .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and ORG Wales ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) monitor compliance with LAW of the ORG operations at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The marine vessels used to transport ORG to GPE are subject to certification for compliance with international standards . Compliance with those standards is monitored by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for GPE and GPE , an agency of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Milford Haven Port Authority ( \u201c MHPA \u201d ) has a statutory duty to provide , maintain , operate and improve port and harbour facilities in , or in the vicinity of , the haven . It has the power to make byelaws to regulate the use of the haven and to issue directions for the purpose of promoting or securing conditions conducive to the ease , convenience or safety of navigation in the haven and its approaches .", "CARDINAL . The Port Marine Safety Code ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , with which ORG complies , was issued by ORG and the Regions in DATE , and has since been updated . It introduces a national standard for every aspect of port marine safety . It is supplemented by a Guide to Good Practice on ORG dealing with risk assessment and safety management .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Petroplus , an oil refiner , applied to ORG , the relevant local authority , for planning permission to develop an ORG terminal on a site at GPE harbour ( \u201c the Dragon terminal \u201d or \u201c the Dragon site \u201d ) . The application was supported by ORG . The planning application was duly advertised and publicised by ORG and ORG and the ORG were consulted . Any member of the public who wished to do so was able to make comments regarding the proposed development .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of ORG , dated DATE , dealt with operational safety . It noted that marine and navigational safety for the delivery of ORG by marine tankers to the jetty was recognised as an area of concern . Petroplus had therefore commissioned a marine risk assessment and a simulation of the manoeuvring and berthing of a large ORG tanker within the waterway , in conjunction with ORG pilots .", "CARDINAL . The Statement identified the main risks arising in respect of the handling of ORG as fire and explosion . It noted that guidelines for assessment and tolerability of risks existed but that there was no definitive or prescriptive methodology in GPE . While this could lead to differences in the levels of tolerable risk in GPE compared to other countries , overall levels of risk tolerability were broadly similar across ORG and other safety conscious countries . Work which had been carried out in respect of risk assessment and evaluation included a Hazard Identification to identify major hazards ; a quantitative risk assessment ( \u201c QRA \u201d ) in respect of major hazards identified ; and a calculation of levels of individual and societal risk .", "CARDINAL . The Statement also considered environmental risk from potential incidents . As regards a possible spillage to surface water it noted :", "\u201c ... complete evaporation of the ORG would take place . As ORG and water are immiscible no residue would remain to cause ongoing pollution . The adverse phenomena would be a cooling of the water body local to the spillage as the ORG absorbs heat to evaporate . Given the large volume of water within the GPE waterway it is most unlikely that this cooling would be of significance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a section on \u201c ORG and Navigation \u201d , the Statement noted :", "\u201c Petroplus is involving the ORG in planning of the marine aspects of ORG terminal to ensure that its proposals will meet the ORG \u2019s requirements for safe navigation and prevention of pollution . The involvement includes :", "Consultation in the development of a marine risk assessment for the development ;", "Commissioning of real time simulation for the movement of ORG vessels in FAC ;", "Arranging for ORG pilots to witness the operation of ORG vessels at a NORP terminal ; and", "Further consultation during the design , construction and operational stages of the project . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of the real time ship simulation exercise conducted , the Statement clarified that ORG pilots had been able to undertake trial navigation of an ORG vessel , including turning and berthing activities , under a variety of wind , wave and tidal conditions . It concluded that the output from the simulations had confirmed that the large ORG tankers could be safely operated in the GPE waterway under certain restrictions regarding wind conditions set out in the Statement . The ORG pilots who participated in the simulation exercise indicated that they were satisfied with the simulation and made recommendations as to maximum wind speed .", "CARDINAL . The Statement further noted that a risk assessment had been carried out on the effect of increased traffic in the haven from the introduction of ORG vessels . The findings were set out in some detail in the Statement , which explained that an average of CARDINAL vessel movement took place in the haven DATE and that an increase of CARDINAL movements per year could be expected once the ORG terminal was operational . The Statement concluded that the proposed operations would have little significant impact on the marine traffic environment of the haven .", "CARDINAL . As to mitigation measures for marine aspects , the Statement noted :", "\u201c As the ORG is responsible for safe marine operations in GPE , mitigating measures would include :", "Continuing consultation of ORG during the design , construction and operational stages of the project ;", "Implementing further simulation exercises to assess additional aspects , such as strong wind conditions in the approach channel , emergency situations , failures and aborts ;", "Implementing simulation training for all ORG pilots who will handle ORG vessels prior to commencement of vessel operations ;", "Application of conservative operational requirements , under specified wind conditions initially ; with modification when the pilots become more experiences with the ORG vessels ;", "Installation of wind monitoring facilities on the Petroplus berth . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its conclusions and management recommendations , the Statement summarised the impact of the proposed development on a wide variety of aspects including ecology and nature conservation , transport , social and economic issues , tourism and recreation , air quality and noise . On the safety aspects of the development , the Statement concluded that the level of risk presented by the ORG terminal was tolerable and observed that the operation of the terminal would be subject to ongoing inspection and audit by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted its views to ORG . It noted that :", "\u201c As a ORG , we have a duty to assess anticipated building works in the waterway in respect of their impact upon navigation , and also of course have a responsibility for maintaining and regulating the use of the waterway in a safe and effective manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . MHPA indicated that its marine department had been working closely with marine advisers to Petroplus to assess the feasibility of ORG vessels transiting the port area and berthing at the proposed jetties with suitable modifications . This assessment had included periods using the ORG simulator , based in the GPE , where a variety of different situations including different ways of approaching the berth , various sizes of ships and different weather and tidal conditions were all able to be trialled . The conclusion was that the identified and agreed means of navigation and operation \u201c more than adequately \u201d contained the risks associated with handling such vessels . ORG also pointed to the benefit to the marine service community of the increase in traffic which would result from the development and the diversification into new sectors of activity . In short , ORG was :", "\u201c ... supportive of [ the ] proposed development and have no concerns regarding safety or navigation in this respect \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted planning permission for an ORG terminal at the Dragon site .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an application was made by Petroplus to extend the ORG terminal at the Dragon site . Again , ORG advertised and publicised the planning application and consulted various statutory consultees , including the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . A further Environmental Statement , dated DATE , was prepared to consider the implications of the extension . It appears to have been a revised version of the original Statement . In the section on \u201c operational safety \u201d , the report addressed the potential increase in risk to safety which would arise from the increase in the stored quantity and throughput of ORG at the site . It noted that a revised safety report would be required under LAW to examine the hazards , risks and potential consequences of a major accident , to complement the report which had been accepted by the ORG for the existing installation . It further noted that a new risk assessment had been undertaken to consider the cumulative risk from the approved scheme together with the additional tank and regasification facilities , as well as ongoing operations .", "CARDINAL . The Statement noted that current movements per year at the Petroplus berths were in the region of CARDINAL , and that there were around QUANTITY ferry movements . When the increase in movements was considered in the context of these statistics as well as the statistics for movements in the haven as a whole , it was clear that the increased traffic would have little significant impact on the marine traffic of the waterway .", "CARDINAL . The Statement concluded that the risks posed by the extended ORG terminal remained acceptable , observing that the expansion of the terminal would be subject to further scrutiny by the ORG under LAW .", "CARDINAL . A report prepared by the ORG for consideration on DATE demonstrated some initial examination of the modalities and consequences of a major release from a delivery ship whilst moored at the jetty . The relevant section concluded :", "\u201c It is clear that such plumes , centred on the jetty , are capable of engulfing the densely populated developments of GPE ( town ) , PERSON or FAC . But without FAC on the frequency to be assigned to the release , an ignition probability analysis can not be undertaken to determine the significance in risk terms ...", "...", "The paper has included some consideration of releases from delivery ships whilst moored at the jetty , but the analyses are incomplete due to shortage of data . A complete methodology could be developed over time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The application , together with ORG and responses to the consultation , was considered at ORG Planning and Rights of ORG meeting on DATE . The minutes noted that the ORG had not advised against the granting of permission for the extension on safety grounds . They also recorded that ORG strongly supported the proposal and was confident that the port had the capacity to handle the extra shipping traffic and that there would be no negative impacts on the satisfactory risk assessment already undertaken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Petroplus made a further planning application , accompanied by an Environmental Statement , dated DATE , for amendments to the approved ORG terminal . The application was again publicised and was the subject of consultation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE planning permission was granted for an extension at the Dragon site and for the amended scheme .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , Petroplus applied for hazardous substances consent for the storage of ORG . ORG consulted the ORG and ORG and publicised the planning application .", "CARDINAL . A report dated DATE by ORG recorded that strong objections to the application had been received from residents of nearby areas calling , in particular , for \u201c all health and safety information concerning the proposed GPE LNG Terminals [ to be ] made publicly available and openly debated before any further consents are given to build \u201d . It also noted that the ORG had confirmed that its statutory obligation was complete when all shore - based activities had been assessed and had been taken into account . Such activities , in the present case , would include the transfer of ORG from the ship to the shore and storage and regasification of the ORG . They would not , however , include the risks from ships moored at or approaching the jetty . The assessment of such risks would fall to the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The report continued :", "\u201c The ORG has confirmed that as the national maritime administration , it would have responsibility for the safety of ORG tankers , transporting the cargo , whilst inside GPE territorial waters . Although it would continue to have some general responsibility for the vessel when it passed from GPE territorial waters into ORG jurisdiction area , the ORG take the view that primary responsibility passes to the competent harbour authority . The ORG has stated that it would be reasonable to assume that there is some , unspecified increase in \u2018 risk\u2019 by virtue of the explosive nature of ORG as a cargo . ORG would be expected to allow the proposed activity to go ahead only where this risk has been reduced to \u2018 as low as reasonably practicable\u2019 . The mitigating actions initiated by ORG would then be reflected in the ORG \u2019s safety management system which they are required to have in place through FAC . The ORG have a range of responsibilities for various \u2018 operational\u2019 aspects of the code including a general monitoring role for compliance with the LAW by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The ORG \u2019s role in regard to ORG ships specifically would be that of ORG looking into the condition and standard of shipboard operations of the vessels from a safety standpoint . ORG has confirmed that its marine personnel , including pilots , have participated in risk assessments with teams from both proposed terminals facilitated by independent risk consultants . The ORG state that the outcome has been to confirm that GPE has the capability of handling these vessels safely . ORG has also confirmed that the security issue addressed through FAC which sets out detailed security requirements for ships and port facilities based on risk assessments to determine the level of risk and the measures necessary to meet that risk . Port facilities including Petroplus have been required to produce a security plan before operations start and this plan has been and will continue to be approved by ORG as ORG body responsible for security . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report recommended that the application be approved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the application for hazardous substances consent in respect of the Dragon Site .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE Petroleum and ORG applied for planning permission to develop an ORG terminal at another site at GPE harbour ( \u201c the LOC terminal \u201d or \u201c the LOC site \u201d ) . Unlike the Dragon terminal , the LOC site fell within the authority of both ORG and ORG and an application was accordingly made to both bodies . In DATE , the operators of the site opened a public exhibition and visitors\u2019 centre in the town centre of GPE regarding the proposed development . The ORG and ORG were , among others , consulted on the application . It was also advertised and publicised to allow members of the public to submit any views on the proposed development .", "CARDINAL . GPE Petroleum and ORG instructed ORG in respect of the proposed development . A draft dated DATE has been provided to ORG . It noted that the ORG industry had an excellent safety record and that the ORG transport and distribution industry in GPE had not experienced a major accident in a history of DATE . A qualified risk assessment was also commissioned by the developers which identified potential hazards in respect of the ORG terminal .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the Statement dealt with major hazards . It was noted at the outset that the discussion of the hazards was general , but that a detailed and specific safety report was being prepared .", "CARDINAL . The Statement summarised the basic obligations arising under LAW , noting :", "\u201c Operators of sites that come under ORG have a general duty to take all measures necessary to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences to persons and the environment ... These sites are classified primarily according to inventory of hazardous substances , with CARDINAL being classified as \u2018 lower tier\u2019 , where operators must prepare a Major Accident Prevention Policy ( MAPP ) . CARDINAL sites , with larger inventories of dangerous substances , are classified as \u2018 top ORG and are subject to additional requirements . These include submitting ORG to the CA [ competent authority \u2013 in this case the ORG and the ORG ] , preparing and testing a site emergency plan , and providing information to local authorities to enable off - site emergency plans to be developed . The proposed installation will be top tier . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to assessment of risks , the Statement explained :", "\u201c The COMAH Regulations govern land based industrial hazards . Under these , the proposed terminal will include the jetty , to the point where the loading arms connect to a berthed ORG carrier . The jetty comes within the jurisdiction of ORG , which has responsibility for marine navigational safety and loss prevention issues within QUANTITY GPE . The close contact between the project and local expertise was recently manifested in a formal , DATE marine hazard identification exercise . Attendees included representatives of ORG , pilots and tug masters , as well as master mariners from the project . Potential mitigation measures were identified in this exercise and are being evaluated for incorporation into the design ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It summarised the identified hazards . Most pertained to the on - site activities but CARDINAL hazards were identified which would have an impact beyond the site itself . The first was the possibility of a vapour cloud with delayed ignition . Safeguards proposed related to the design of the containment tanks , an emergency shut down system to limit release and gas detention to identify leaks . The second was a ship collision at the jetty . Safeguards included emergency release coupling to allow the ship to depart quickly , an emergency shut down system and a firefighting system .", "DATE . On DATE MHPA responded to the consultation in support of the proposed development , in terms similar to their letter of DATE in respect of the Dragon site ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , the Chief Executive of ORG wrote to ORG with responses to questions asked . He observed that it was necessary to ensure that large ORG ships were managed in such a way that they were safely and effectively accommodated . He indicated that ORG \u2019s approach to accommodating the ORG vessels was by detailed risk assessment , taking into account the characteristics of the ships and the terminal to be used and making use of simulators and their own pilots and technical teams working with those of the project proposers , together with a wide range of specialist consultants , to determine the requirements to meet this objective . The result would take into account , for example , the number of tugs required for a movement ; the number of pilots ; whether tugs should be escorting the vessel ; the limits on any weather conditions to allow a movement to take place ; and the timing of any movement related to tidal conditions . He explained that ORG did not intend to close the port while an ORG ship entered or left as it was not necessary and did not improve the situation . He continued :", "\u201c ... What we will probably be seeking to do ( and I say probably because we are still very much involved in the risk assessment of a wide variety of scenarios ) is that there will be a restriction on vessels being within a given distance of an ORG ship when transiting the GPE ...", "I also understand that some questions have been raised about the distance at which other vessels will be allowed to pass an ORG ship at the LOC , given that this stretches some way into the GPE and that the main shipping channel in this vicinity is used by all other commercial ships being that their berths are further upriver . Again , we are researching this , testing on the simulators and undertaking risk assessments , but it is likely that we will be looking to undertake some dredging to widen the shipping channel to the LOC so that some vessels , including the ferry , will be able to pass the LOC with an ORG ship alongside at a further distance than would be the case otherwise . We are also looking at other ways of controlling shipping passing LOC in such circumstances which could include criteria of speed , tugs in attendance , maybe even a \u2018 guard\u2019 tug in the vicinity of the ORG ship and restricting any movements to CARDINAL vessel at a time , certain weather conditions etc \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG newspaper published a question and answer article with ORG regarding the ORG terminal .

Or could it explode for any other reason ?", "The South Hook sponsors have been working closely with organisations such as ORG to ensure that the possibility of a shipping incident is extremely low . Vessels are also designed to withstand significant impact . If an ORG release were to occur from a shipping incident , and if it were ignited , then the effect would be localised to the vessel and its immediate surroundings and unlikely to impact the land .

On DATE the Chief Executive of ORG responded to a letter from a Member of ORG regarding the ORG terminals as follows :", "\u201c As to the perception that we as a ORG are \u2018 reluctant\u2019 to publish risk assessments ... this really flows from a lack of understanding of the role of ORG . Unlike applications for the shore terminals where the process that is undertaken is very clearly defined and results on a go / no - go decision , our role as a ORG is different . We do not have the ability to deny access to any ship ( other than in very specific and individual circumstances ) given that the GPE operates what can be loosely termed an \u2018 open ports policy\u2019 . What we do have is a responsibility to ensure that any shipping movements are managed in a safe and efficient manner . To this end we have undertaken , and continue to undertake , a wide range of risk assessments to determine the way in which this safe and effective management will be carried out . There is therefore no one single document or set of documents that clearly define the situation in which a \u2018 go / no - go LOC can be determined , but rather a continuing process of scenario setting , risk assessment , trial , refining scenarios and identification of mitigation and prevention measures in which a wide number of variables are taken into account \u2013 some of which are still being developed as decisions as to the type of ships and their characteristics are being defined by the terminal operators and their teams . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a report dated DATE ORG Register Risk Assessment Services , on the instructions of ORG , examined and summarised high level statistics for worldwide accidents involving ships . Experience of a fire or explosion on board a ship large enough potentially to injure people nearby was \u201c as likely per year as being struck by lightning \u201d . The report observed that the likelihood of an ORG incident was extremely low and that there had never been a recorded incident of a major release of ORG from a ship to external atmosphere and no member of the public had ever been injured by ORG from a ship . The authors explained that the report carried a moderate level of error in light of the high level statistics used and concluded that more detailed research could be carried out to address the specific risks at GPE .", "DATE . In a paper of CARDINAL DATE , the Chief Executive of ORG summarised the position regarding the ORG terminals .

The terminal developers themselves have also undertaken quantified risk assessment some of which related to shipping movements and we have made use of these in our own processes .", "To assist us in this we recently commissioned a report from ORG looking specifically at the risk of incidents in GPE large enough to potentially injure people nearby .", "Their conclusion was that there is as much risk of being struck by lightning as there is of being injured by any explosion including fire from ORG in the GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a journalist contacted ORG asking what risk assessments it had undertaken in relation to plans to import ORG to the South Hook and PERSON sites , with specific regard to the marine - based risk .

As to the reason for the delay in applying for judicial review , Mr Justice PERSON rejected the ORG contention that the delay resulted from a \u201c labyrinthine decision - making process \u201d . He accepted that there was a mass of material , but considered that this was because the claim form had adopted a \u201c scatter gun \u201d approach and sought permission to challenge not merely the decision on DATE in respect of the Dragon site , but also the earlier decisions in respect of that site going back DATE , and the decisions going back DATE in respect of the LOC site . He noted that , in so far as the applicants complained of the absence of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment or its failure to take account of marine risks , the complaints were directed towards the grant of planning permission itself , rather than hazardous substances consent . In relation to both sites , relevant planning permissions had been granted DATE before the judicial review proceedings were brought .

The evidence before PERSON made it clear that ORG was satisfied as to the safety of the terminal proposals , so far as its own sphere of responsibility was concerned , while ORG had advised that it was content so far as the land - based activities were concerned . Both these bodies had advised the decision - makers , ORG and ORG , who were entitled to rely on the specialist advice received from those bodies . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It is stressed that a population of CARDINAL lies within a radius of QUANTITY of LOC and PERSON sites ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , PERSON disagreed that the risk assessment had been inadequate .

He pointed out that ORG had advised both bodies responsible for granting planning permission and consents that it had the \u201c capability of handling these vessels safely \u201d . As to counsel for the applicants\u2019 argument that an assessment of the risk of collision was insufficient and that there was a lacuna because of the absence of any assessment of the consequences for the local population of a vapour cloud , PERSON concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I do not accept that the evidence before us , including the evidence submitted on behalf of the applicants since the oral hearing , demonstrates any such arguable lacuna . One has to bear in mind in this connection the very extensive assessments carried out by ORG , because these provide the context for ORG assessment . ORG did assessments which considered both the consequences and the likelihood of an escape of ORG for all landbased and jetty - based activities . Those included the risk of catastrophic failure of an ORG storage tank at the terminal ; the failure of a loading arm at the jetty while ORG was being transferred from ship to shore ; and \u2018 major release from a delivery ship while tied up at a jetty\u2019 : see ORG responses to ORG , DATE , and the ORG Summary Grounds of Resistance , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Having carried out these assessments , ORG did not object to the proposal for either terminal on safety grounds . The applicants do not criticise the work done by ORG .", "CARDINAL . That body made it clear in its response of DATE that it was not responsible for advising on accidents \u2018 whilst the ship is not attached to the ORG . But ORG , which is responsible for advising on such accidents , did participate in an assessment process which led to a risk assessment submitted by ORG in DATE \u2018 to identify hazards , consequences and possible mitigation measures\u2019 relating to the use of the port as proposed : see ORG Summary Grounds of Resistance , paragraph GPE ) ( emphasis added ) . It refers in those grounds to a number of other reports and exercises carried out , so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety . In any event , once ORG had concluded that there were no unacceptable risks to the local population arising from either a catastrophic storage tank failure on land or a major release of ORG from a tanker tied up at a jetty , the crucial element in any assessment of risk from a vessel not moored to the jetty must have been the risk of a collision . The risks to the population from a vapour cloud travelling over land or sea had already been considered by ORG , since the jetties end far out in the GPE . What ORG needed to concentrate on above all else was the risk of a collision , and that it seems to have done . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Permission to appeal was refused . In a subsequent discussion of the application for disclosure , PERSON noted that it was related to the prospect of a substantive hearing had permission to bring judicial review proceedings been granted , and that permission had not been granted . Accordingly , no order as to disclosure was made .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the judgment being handed down , the applicants had been provided with a copy in draft for comment on typographical errors . The applicants\u2019 legal advisers immediately recognised that the judgment contained an error of fact at paragraph CARDINAL , where PERSON had made reference to the ORG assessment of the consequences of a \u201c major release from a delivery ship while tied up at a jetty \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants\u2019 solicitor wrote to the court on DATE advising that no such assessment had in fact been carried out and requested the court to consider the implications of the factual error before confirming its conclusions in the draft judgment . In the event , no change was made to the relevant paragraph of the draft judgment before it was handed down in its final form .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants\u2019 solicitor made an application to ORG under LAW CARDINAL to have the judgment of CARDINAL DATE reopened ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The application was made on the basis , inter alia , of an obvious factual error . The solicitor noted in the application that although as a matter of routine such applications go back to the original tribunal , he would imagine that the members would recuse themselves in this case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Treasury Solicitors on behalf of the ORG advised all parties involved in the proceedings as well as ORG of a mistake in the ORG \u2019s Summary Grounds . The statement to the effect that the ORG \u2019s comprehensive risk analysis included risks associated with \u201c major release from a delivery ship while tied up a jetty \u201d was incorrect . The correct position was that :", "\u201c Risks that may arise from the presence of other substances , or from the presence of ORG on a delivery ship , either when sailing or when berthed , have not been taken into account in the assessment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG declined to vary its order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the matter came before the original ORG . It heard and refused an application that its members recuse themselves . Counsel for the applicants accepted that there was no appearance of bias as a result of the narrow question whether the application for permission to appeal should be opened on the ground that the court was misled by the ORG \u2019s summary of objections . However , he argued that the court appeared to be acting in a partisan way in circumstances in which it was prepared to reopen the question following receipt of a letter from the ORG Solicitor confirming the true position , whereas it had not been prepared to reopen the matter when the ORG solicitor had made representations as to the issue of fact that was in dispute . PERSON , giving judgment for the court , held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . For my part , I can see no appearance of bias arising from that fact . The positions changed in an important respect when the letter from the ORG Solicitor was received . Until DATE , there was an issue of fact : whether or not the ORG had carried out the tests and risk assessments which they said they had carried out . That issue of fact arose because the applicants asserted that those risk assessments had not been carried out . The ORG , in a summary of grounds \u2013 the truth of which was verified by its solicitor DATE asserted that they had been . That question of fact had been determined against the applicants in the judgments which this court handed down on DATE ... It is clear that it was determined against the applicants in reliance on what was said by the ORG in the summary grounds of objection .", "CARDINAL . In those circumstances , it would have been inappropriate for the court to reopen that question of fact in the period between making its judgments available in draft and the formal handing down of those judgments . The purpose of making the judgments available in draft is not to invite further submissions on questions of fact which have already been decided , but to enable the parties to draw attention to obvious errors of fact , such as a mis - name or a mis - date . Nor would it have been a proper ground for reopening the application for permission to appeal that the claimants , through their solicitors , continued to assert that the court had reached the wrong conclusion of fact on the evidence . But a significant change occurred when it became clear that the court had reached the conclusion of fact which it did as a result of being misled by the ORG though the statement of objections . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused permission to reopen the application . PERSON highlighted that the error of fact arose in the context of his discussion of a matter which he had indicated was not strictly necessary in light of his other findings . He nonetheless considered the implications of the factual error identified and concluded that although ORG might well have concentrated on the safety of navigation , it was clear that in light of the work it had done it felt able to advise that it had no concerns regarding safety or navigation in respect of the proposed developments . He concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The significance of the error in terms of public safety has to be seen in context .", "CARDINAL . That context is that both the ORG and ORG had undoubtedly carried out a number of exercises and studies before advising the planning authorities that there was no objection on safety grounds . The ORG for its part had assessed the consequences of an escape of ORG from a land - based storage tank ; from the failure of a loading arm at the jetty ; and from the guillotine rupture of a QUANTITY pipeline between the jetty and the storage tanks ... Those assessments have not been criticised . It is to be observed that the ORG assessments of the failure of a storage tank on land included that of a catastrophic failure , which would take place at a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population than the proposed jetties . Yet the ORG was satisfied that public safety would not be jeopardised , presumably because of the very low likelihood of such an incident .", "CARDINAL . ORG for its part had carried out a range of studies referred to in its summary Grounds of Resistance at paragraph CARDINAL . Those were , as one might expect , largely directed towards an assessment of marine risks . They included a report from a Senior Risk Analyst at ORG , commissioned to assess the risk of explosion and gas release from ORG carriers ... There was also evidence before the judge and before this court that there had never been an incident of major release of ORG from a ship to the external atmosphere ...", "CARDINAL . ORG has statutory responsibilities for safety within the ORG and it advised the decision - makers , ORG and ORG , that there was no such risk to public safety as to warrant refusal of the applications . It was principally for ORG to decide on what research was necessary for it to be so satisfied . It is not for this court or any court to try to second guess the ORG \u2019s decision on what it needs by way of research in order to advise the decision - makers , unless it is obvious that it has neglected its statutory duties . The evidence falls far short of that . In short , the factual point now seen to be mistaken was of limited significance even on this aspect of the case . Moreover , as PERSON on behalf of ORG submits , that ORG has powers , if at any time it should appear to it that the risks are likely to be greater than presently seem to be the case , to prevent the jetties being used for ORG unloading , and of course the planning authorities also have powers to revoke the consents with which these proceedings are concerned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having set out the position as regards assessment of marine risk , ORG concluded :", "\u201c But in any event , I come back to the fundamental point , which I indicated earlier , namely that the mistake of fact now relied on by the applicants did not occur in an essential part of this court \u2019s reasoning when it dismissed this application for permission to appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 solicitor subsequently wrote to the then Head of ORG asking for advice on what could be done .

In respect of information not falling within those ORG , Beatson J concluded that the applicant had failed to demonstrate an arguable case that there was an obligation to provide the information arising from a positive duty on the authority under LAW and DATE . He noted that ORG had advised the decision - making authorities that the risks were so low as not to warrant the refusal of planning permission or hazardous substances consent and that ORG had , in the earlier judicial review proceedings , found that the authorities were entitled to accept that advice . Accordingly , the activities in question could not be considered \u201c dangerous \u201d such as to give rise to an obligation under the ORG to allow the public access to the information . He further considered that insofar as the applicant sought disclosure of assessments required for the previous judicial review proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the claim was an \u201c improper use of judicial review \u201d . He noted that the matter had been before PERSON in the original judicial review proceedings and found that had it been arguable that the applicants were entitled to this information , then the matter would have been dealt with then . He concluded that the application was either out of time or an attempt to reopen a matter which had already been decided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal the ruling .

This is exactly the sort of endeavour which the court ought not to support . This appellant has had the opportunity to seek these documents at the time of the earlier proceedings , and it seems to me that the conclusion arrived at by Beatson J was entirely apposite : that this is indeed a reformulation of what was being sought in those proceedings . Those proceedings have already occupied the time of ORG for a lengthy leave hearing , followed by CARDINAL considerations by ORG and it would be wholly wrong that permission should now be granted to bring judicial review in the present form . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Pure methane is lighter than air ... but it is the temperature of the entire cloud , not just its gaseous component , [ that ] determines its behaviour . Other components too must warm to higher temperatures before vertical dispersal ensues . Meanwhile the cloud will continue to disperse in a generally horizontal direction , developing a shape similar to an elongated plume .", "In practice the geometry and behaviour of a gas cloud will be determined by the specific circumstances of the release . The single biggest determinant will always be the volume of ORG released .
