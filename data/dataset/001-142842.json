The applicant was born in DATE . His address is unknown .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife came to GPE in DATE and applied for asylum on DATE . They had travelled from GPE via GPE to GPE . When the applicant and his wife first arrived in GPE they lived in a camp . They subsequently lived with people traffickers for DATE , and then in public parks . The applicant claimed that he had queued to apply for asylum in GPE , but had been beaten by the police and driven away . He and his wife had no access to financial support and had had to live in the parks after their money had run out . After CARDINAL failed attempts , the traffickers managed to take the applicant and his wife to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his request for asylum in GPE the applicant claimed in substance to have had problems with the ORG in GPE . He submitted inter alia that DATE the ORG had kidnapped CARDINAL of his brothers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application on the grounds that GPE was responsible for examining it , pursuant to section TIME DATE LAW ( DATE ) in connection with LAW ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c Dublin II Regulation \u201d , hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) , and ordered his expulsion to GPE . It found that the applicant was not facing any real risk of illtreatment within the meaning of LAW upon his return to GPE . The authority referred to a number of country reports , in particular those of the ORG of DATE and of ORG . It acknowledged the ongoing criticism with regard to proceedings and treatment of asylum - seekers in GPE , but did not consider the applicant \u2019s story of his experiences in GPE credible . ORG noted the ORG \u2019s concern about the difficulties with which many asylum - seekers in GPE were confronted . This applied particularly to the facilities for asylum - seekers , access to asylum proceedings and the quality of the proceedings . On the other hand , ORG noted that GPE was the only country to have declared that it would no longer transfer asylum - seekers to GPE under LAW . ORG also mentioned a recent decision by ORG , according to which there was no reason to suspend further transfers to GPE . ORG quoted the ORG position paper , which welcomed GPE \u2019s reform attempts aimed at strengthening its asylum system . It further noted that a working group had been established , including members of the NORP authorities and the ORG , to tackle the \u201c most burning \u201d problems with the asylum system . Furthermore , ORG held that the relevant NORP directives were binding for GPE . Lastly , ORG referred to a fact - finding mission conducted by ORG in DATE reacting to the harsh criticism voiced by various NGOs . The final report of that mission had concluded that there were no humanitarian or other reasons to refrain from returning asylum - seekers to GPE under LAW . In view of the fact that the asylum authorities of the other ORG countries had not stopped transferring asylum - seekers back to GPE , ORG concluded that it was not necessary to make use of the sovereignty clause in the present case . It further noted that people who had never before lodged an asylum application in GPE and had been transferred to GPE under LAW had full access to asylum proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision , referring again to the deficiencies of the NORP asylum system , the danger of refoulement to GPE and the lack of subsistence for asylum - seekers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as unfounded . It found that an accumulation of proceedings under the sovereignty clause would endanger the \u201c effet utile \u201d principle of Community law . Furthermore , LAW was based on the assumption that all member GPE were safe countries and that a deportation to CARDINAL of them could not constitute a human - rights violation . Therefore , arguments against such a deportation would need to be especially substantiated . Referring to the report of a mission of ORG to GPE in DATE that showed that all DATE monitored cases had had access to NORP asylum proceedings , it found that there were no deficiencies in the conditions of access to asylum proceedings in GPE . With regard to the present case , the NORP authorities had already stated that the applicant would have access to asylum proceedings once he returned to GPE . Again referring to the mission report of ORG , it found that the support of asylum - seekers in GPE was acceptable . Asylum - seekers were allowed to work in GPE . Lastly , there would be no risk of refoulement . In conclusion , the applicant would not be at real risk of treatment contrary to LAW on being returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife was expelled to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

At the ORG \u2019s request , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s representative informed ORG exact date of the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE , namely DATE . He stated that despite being his counsel , he had not received any further information about his client since then . In later submissions he stated that he could establish contact with the applicant , if necessary , via trustworthy persons the applicant still knew in GPE . He did not , however , provide the applicant \u2019s current address to the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
