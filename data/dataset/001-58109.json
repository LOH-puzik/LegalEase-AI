THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P1-1;No violation of Art. 14+P1-1;No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 14+6-1", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were at all relevant times building societies within the meaning of LAW DATE . Building societies operate under the status of \u201c mutual societies \u201d under LANGUAGE law as opposed to the status enjoyed by companies under company law . A building society \u2019s members are made up of its investors who deposit savings with it and receive a rate of interest or a dividend in return , and its borrowers who are charged interest on their loans . By and large , loans are taken out by borrowers to buy private residential property .", "CARDINAL . Investors with a building society are liable to pay income tax in respect of the interest earned on their deposits . The income tax owed to ORG for the purposes of DATE to CARDINAL DATE of DATE was in practice calculated or measured with reference to a period of equal length preceding DATE . The so - called \u201c measurement principle \u201d required that the period measured be always equal in length to the period taxed . The taxpayer was not in fact taxed on the income of DATE but assessed to tax on the income received in DATE , the amount of DATE income being artificially computed by reference to the income of DATE . Accordingly , in normal circumstances , individual investors with building societies would be obliged to declare in their tax returns for DATE in question the amount of interest or dividends earned on their deposits in a preceding reference period of equal length to DATE , and the Inland Revenue would have to make individual assessments to tax on the strength of the information supplied by the investor .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in view of the very large number of building society investors , many of whom had only modest savings and were thus only liable to small amounts of income tax , or to no tax at all , it had for many years up to and including DATE CARDINAL/CARDINAL been the practice for ORG to make voluntary arrangements with building societies for the payment by each society of a single annual composite amount . The effect of this payment by a building society was to discharge its investors\u2019 liability to income tax at the basic rate on the interest which they earned . These arrangements , which were for DATE operated on a non - statutory basis , were at the relevant time given statutory recognition under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE \u201c the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . The composite - rate payment under the voluntary arrangements was calculated for DATE by reference to the global amount of interest paid by the society to its investors . However , in order to reflect the fact that some of the investors would not have been liable to tax at all given the modest amounts of their savings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) a reduced rate of tax was applied . For this reason the annual ORG payments made under this scheme were known as \u201c reduced - rate tax \u201d or \u201c composite - rate tax \u201d , or \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The amount paid to investors by way of interest on their investments took account of the fact that their liability to income tax was discharged by the building society via the payment of ORG to ORG . Investors thus received their interest net of tax .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the \u201c revenue - neutrality \u201d principle , set out in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , the ORG payment reflected only the amount which would have been paid by the investors themselves had they been obliged to declare and pay tax on the interest they earned through their deposits .", "CARDINAL . To achieve this , the ORG , following negotiations with ORG , set DATE , by statutory instrument , the ORG rate . In doing so , it was required to aim at a result whereby the same amount of tax was collected at source from building societies for DATE in question as would have been collected from the individual depositors had they been taxed directly on the interest they received over a preceding reference period ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Until CARDINAL , a \u201c prior - period \u201d system applied in respect of ORG . The amount of ORG to be paid by each building society for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was calculated by reference to the interest which it paid to its investors not during the actual year being taxed , but during the society \u2019s own CARDINAL months\u2019 accounting period ending within DATE . The tax was in every case paid on or CARDINAL January of the year of assessment . As noted above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the legal effect of this payment representing income tax was to discharge investors\u2019 basic - rate liability on the interest earned in DATE being taxed .", "CARDINAL . There was no legal requirement to have a harmonised accounting period . Different time frames were used by different building societies , but in all cases the time frames represented a period equal in length to DATE , having regard to the requirements of the measurement principle ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The following accounting periods were operated by each of the applicant societies :", "Thus , on or DATE , the CARDINAL applicant societies paid to ORG , to discharge their ORG liability to income tax at the basic rate for DATE , sums measured by reference to the interest paid to their investors in their accounting periods ended DATE ( the GPE ) and DATE ( ORG and the GPE ) . Under the effect of the voluntary arrangements ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , these payments completely discharged the income - tax liability of their investors in respect of the interest paid to them by the respective societies for DATE .", "On that basis each of the applicant companies paid the following amounts by way of ORG to the Inland Revenue :", "CARDINAL . With a view to putting the taxation of the interest paid by building societies to investors on a similar footing to the scheme which had been introduced for banks by LAW DATE , the ORG proposed the introduction of a mandatory regime for the collection of tax on ORG interest and the payment of the tax DATE on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE instead of DATE in DATE . In his budget statement on DATE announcing the introduction of the new scheme , the Chancellor of the ORG declared that it would not produce any additional revenue . The proposal was adopted by ORG in the form of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL amended section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by inserting a new sub - section ( CARDINALA ) which had the effect of bringing to an end the long - standing voluntary arrangements as from DATE . It also empowered ORG to make regulations introducing a new system of accounting for DATE and for subsequent years . Under the Income Tax ( Building Society ) Regulations CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE Regulations \u201d ) , which came into force on DATE , tax was to be calculated on a DATE basis on the actual interest paid during DATE of assessment , as opposed to a prior period .", "CARDINAL . However the ending of the voluntary arrangements exposed a gap ( \u201c the gap period \u201d ) between the end of the applicant GPE accounting periods in CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the start of DATE under the new regime . In the case of the GPE the gap period was from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE , and in the case of ORG and the GPE it was from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . In order to ensure that each payment of interest formed the basis of an assessment to tax , transitional regulations were introduced which deemed payments falling into the \u201c gap period \u201d to have been made in a later accounting period , with the result that they formed the basis for an assessment to tax under the new \u201c DATE \u201d arrangements . In the view of the Government the legislative intention was to ensure that the same amount of tax was collected as would have been collected if the previous arrangements had continued and that the building societies did not receive an undeserved windfall in respect of the gap period .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , LAW ( read in conjunction with LAW ) of the DATE Regulations purported to require building societies to account for tax relating to payments of interest to their investors in their respective gap periods . LAW ( CARDINAL ) provided for tax to be charged on interest paid in the gap period at CARDINAL rates , i.e. PERCENT , the basic rate of income tax being PERCENT for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Each of the applicant societies took the view that the transitional regulations ran counter to the Government \u2019s declared intention that the new regime introduced by LAW DATE should not produce any additional revenue ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which view was reaffirmed during the parliamentary debates on section QUANTITY . They considered that the effect of Regulations CARDINAL and CARDINAL was to impose tax again on interest they had paid in CARDINAL , DATE for which liability on their ORG interest had already been discharged ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . For the applicants this had the result that , for CARDINAL months\u2019 interest paid to its investors in DATE and DATE , a society like the GPE , with DATE , was required to pay tax on CARDINAL months\u2019 interest . For ORG and the GPE , each would have to pay tax on DATE months\u2019 interest for DATE period covered by DATE and DATE . In the view of the applicant societies these consequences ran counter to the measurement principle according to which the measurement period forming the basis of assessment to tax can never exceed the length of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Each of the CARDINAL applicant societies did in fact pay the tax claimed to be due under the transitional provisions of the ORG as follows :", "CARDINAL . The Government point out that the payments were made \u201c without formal protest \u201d . However , the applicants assert that they made clear from the outset that they disputed the lawfulness of the tax and that they associated themselves with the proceedings initiated by ORG ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) to challenge the lawfulness of the transitional provisions in Regulation DATE . For its part the GPE issued a press release when the Regulations were still at the draft stage , drawing attention to , inter alia , their complaint that the ORG would have the objectionable effect of subjecting building societies to double taxation . The affidavit sworn by the Executive Vice - Chairman of the PERSON referred to the Leeds\u2019 support for its decision to initiate legal proceedings against the transitional arrangements . Both ORG and the GPE made requests for the repayment of the amounts they had paid to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG commenced judicial review proceedings seeking a declaration that LAW was unlawful as being outside the scope of the enabling legislation . It was further alleged that the transitional arrangements transgressed the fundamental principles of constitutional and taxation law and that the machinery adopted by LAW in order to implement the change in the system resulted in a double charge to tax over the gap period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government introduced in ORG a measure intended to validate retrospectively the impugned ORG and to give effect to what they claimed to be the original intention of ORG when adopting them ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The responsible Government minister informed ORG that the ORG did not affect the amount of tax collected , only the timing of payment and reiterated that they would not bring extra tax to ORG . On DATE LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) received the Royal Assent . Section CARDINAL of the LAW retrospectively amended section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) with the purpose of authorising ORG to make regulations requiring the taxation in DATE and subsequent years of assessments of sums paid to investors in the gap period and not previously brought into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a writ against the Inland Revenue claiming repayment of the sums paid by way of tax under the transitional provisions of the ORG , as well as interest from the date of payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON granted the application in PERSON CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and made a declaration that LAW was void in its entirety and that the remaining Regulations were void in so far as they purported to apply to payments made to investors prior to DATE . He held that :", "CARDINAL . The Inland Revenue appealed against the decision . They conceded that Regulation CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) was invalid but contended that this partial invalidity did not invalidate the rest of the Regulation .", "CARDINAL . Towards DATE , ORG repaid to the ORG the sum of GBP CARDINAL with interest from CARDINAL DATE ( the date of the order of PERSON ) but refused to pay interest from any earlier date . Thus , the remaining issue in the PERSON CARDINAL proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) came to be whether or not PERSON had grounds for claiming interest on the payments made by them up to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON dismissed the PERSON CARDINAL action , holding that the PERSON was not entitled to recover the sums in issue under any general principle of restitution or as having been paid under duress . He took the view that the sums had been paid under an implied agreement that they would be repaid if and when the dispute about the validity of LAW was resolved in favour of the PERSON . Thus , the PERSON had no cause of action to recover the money until the date of his order of CARDINAL DATE . The PERSON appealed against the decision and order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal of ORG in the PERSON CARDINAL proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court held that :", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal of the PERSON in the PERSON CARDINAL proceedings . ORG , Lord PERSON dissenting , declared the transitional provisions in LAW to be ultra vires on the grounds that Regulation CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , as the Inland Revenue had previously conceded , and Regulation CARDINAL , so far as it related to the period after DATE and before DATE , were ultra vires the empowering statute . ORG considered that Regulation DATE ) could not be severed from the rest of Regulation CARDINAL and that the transitional provisions in LAW were therefore void in their entirety .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , delivering the judgment of the majority , concluded :", "\u201c ... I confess that I find the conclusion irresistible that ORG intended by these words [ section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ] to enable the Revenue to take account of and to charge to tax sums which , rightly or wrongly , it regarded as otherwise representing windfalls in the hands of building societies . CARDINAL has only to look at the circumstances . LAW had been made and had been objected to . They were made the subject of a direct challenge in legal proceedings , the evidence in support of which clearly adumbrated the arguments advanced before the judge and ORG . The notion that ORG should go to the trouble of enacting an expressly retrospective amendment in order to provide , unnecessarily , for the use of these sums as a measurement of tax liability \u2013 a matter never remotely in issue \u2013 is simply fanciful ...", "... I am bound to say that I think it unfortunate that the Revenue , through ORG , should have chosen by secondary rather than primary legislation to take what was , on ordinary principles , the very unusual course of seeking to tax more than DATE income in DATE of assessment , but section CARDINAL of LAW DATE is , on any analysis , a very unusual provision and I have , in the end , found myself irresistibly driven to the conclusion that this was what ORG intended should occur . It may be \u2013 I do not know \u2013 that the legislature did not appreciate fully that the effect of the arrangements made in DATE was to discharge all liability for tax on interest paid in DATE of assessment CARDINAL , including tax on interest paid after the end of a society \u2019s accounting year , and that , accordingly , to tax those sums again in DATE was , in a sense , to tax them twice . But even making that assumption it amounts to no more than saying that the legislature should not have intended to do that which it plainly set out to do . I would , for my part , therefore , reject the ORG \u2019s principal argument . \u201d", "This ruling declaring LAW ( CARDINAL ) void on technical grounds meant that no mechanism existed to achieve what the ORG claimed to be ORG \u2019s initial intention that interest payments made during the gap period should be assessed for tax . This led the ORG to introduce new legislative provisions . A draft press release was circulated DATE for the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer . The draft indicated that the Chancellor in his budget - day speech on DATE would introduce legislation to validate retrospectively the ORG which had been struck down in the PERSON CARDINAL case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the ORG of Lords\u2019 decision in the ORG CARDINAL proceedings , and after having made several requests for repayment , the GPE commenced proceedings on DATE against ORG for the restitution of the sum of GBP CARDINAL paid pursuant to LAW which had been declared void in the PERSON CARDINAL proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , which had also sought but was refused repayment , commenced proceedings against ORG for the restitution of the sum of GBP CARDINAL paid pursuant to the void Regulations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in his budget statement , the Chancellor of the ORG announced the introduction of legislation to remedy \u201c the technical defects in the Regulations \u201d . This legislation became section CARDINAL of the Finance Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which entered into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL provided , inter alia :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the [ CARDINAL Act ] ... shall be deemed to have conferred powers to make all the provisions in fact contained in [ LAW ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The provision had retrospective effect , save that by subsection ( CARDINAL ) it had no effect \u201c in relation to a building society which commenced proceedings to challenge the validity of the ORG before DATE \u201d . The PERSON was the only building society which satisfied this condition .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE the Director - General of ORG informed the Financial Secretary to the ORG that the decision of the Government \u201c [ did ] not come as any great surprise , although it will still be very disappointing to the societies concerned \u201d . In fact , the concrete effect of the measure was to stifle the GPE CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Although they had shown support for the PERSON \u2019s judicial proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) neither had formally commenced legal proceedings before DATE . At the costs hearing the Government conceded that they had no defence to the action brought by the GPE and ORG had it not been for section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . Costs were awarded against the Government .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , by a majority , allowed the appeal by the PERSON in ORG and awarded the interest claimed .", "CARDINAL . The majority of ORG accepted the PERSON \u2019s primary submission that , where money was paid under an illegal demand for taxation by a government body , the payer had an immediate prima facie right to recover the payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE applied for leave to commence judicial review proceedings for a declaration that the ORG Orders establishing the composite - rate tax for DATE and for DATE were unlawful ( \u201c GPE CARDINAL \u201d ) . The GPE claimed that :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was granted leave to commence judicial review proceedings similar to those in GPE CARDINAL for a declaration that the ORG Orders establishing the composite - rate tax for DATE and subsequent DATE were unlawful because of the retrospective validation of the Regulations ( \u201c ORG CARDINAL \u201d ) . The application was joined with the GPE CARDINAL proceedings and with a similar application made by the GPE and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE applied for leave to commence similar judicial review proceedings for a declaration that the ORG Orders establishing the composite - rate tax for DATE and subsequent DATE were unlawful ( \u201c FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . Further proceedings were commenced by the GPE on DATE ( \u201c GPE CARDINAL \u201d ) , by the GPE on DATE ( \u201c GPE CARDINAL \u201d ) and by ORG on DATE ( \u201c ORG CARDINAL \u201d ) . In those proceedings the applicant societies claimed restitution of the money due to them if the judicial review proceedings ( GPE CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL , and GPE CARDINAL ) were successful ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE section CARDINAL of the Finance ( No . CARDINAL ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force . This legislation had been anticipated as from DATE when the ORG Secretary in a reply to a parliamentary question noted that his Government intended to introduce legislation to validate retrospectively the impugned ORG Orders . Section CARDINAL provided , with retrospective effect , that the ORG Orders \u201c shall be taken to be and always to have been effective \u201d . The Government acknowledged during the parliamentary debates on section CARDINAL that the measure was intended to pre - empt the legal proceedings launched by the applicants to challenge the validity of the Treasury Orders and that it would result in the PERSON being treated more favourably . However , they pointed out that the challenge to the composite rate for ORG in DATE into doubt the lawfulness of the collection of all sums from building societies , banks and other deposit institutions in the periods in question . While there was no doubt as to the lawfulness of the collection in respect of the vast majority of those sums , the effect of impugning the rates set would have been to render the collection of all sums unlawful . The amount at stake was in the region of GBP MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The effect of section CARDINAL was to extinguish the remaining proceedings lodged by the applicants for judicial review of the validity of the ORG Orders and for restitution ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , dismissed ORG appeal in the PERSON CARDINAL proceedings .", "ORG did not accept that , on the facts of the PERSON case , there was any implied agreement for the repayment of the money paid under LAW if and when the dispute was resolved in the taxpayer \u2019s favour .
