The applicant was born in DATE and was at the material time serving a prison sentence in FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having robbed an individual of his vehicle , his mobile phone , and a sum of money while armed . He was placed under investigation DATE and questioned twice . He protested his innocence , providing an alibi , and said that he had cancer and was undergoing treatment at an oncology clinic . The applicant was identified by the victims . Maintaining his innocence , he refused to sign the record of the identification procedure .", "CARDINAL . During questioning on DATE , the applicant repeated his alibi and complained about his state of health . On DATE he was charged with theft and armed robbery ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Criminal Code respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an application by the prosecutor to place the applicant in pre - trial detention for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the decision was upheld by ORG , despite the applicant \u2019s submission that he was ill and would not attempt to evade justice . The applicant was placed in FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found guilty of the charges and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment by the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . After examining the witness statements in the light of the other evidence , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s alibi lacked credibility . By a judgment of DATE , it amended the judgment of DATE in the part concerning the classification of the offences , but upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG of GPE dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant on an unidentified date .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had an operation to remove a malignant tumour from his right testicle . He subsequently had chemotherapy on a sporadic basis . As the illness then returned , he had another operation in DATE . According to a medical certificate dated DATE , the applicant also suffered from chronic hepatitis C ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after being placed in detention , on DATE , the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital . After confirming the diagnosis of chronic ORG and that he had been recently treated for cancer of the right testicle , doctors recommended he have a consultation with an oncologist and a special medical examination . On DATE the head of the surgical unit wrote to the prison hospital \u2019s acting head doctor , informing her that the applicant needed to be examined by a urological oncologist at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He noted that the applicant was ready to bear all the costs himself . In DATE doctors again recommended he be seen by an oncologist specialising in urology . The case file shows that the applicant was not transferred to the ORG or examined by an oncologist . He stayed at the prison hospital until DATE and , according to his medical records , he was provided with treatment for his symptoms , which consisted of pain medication .", "CARDINAL . After several prison transfers and given that his health was still unsatisfactory , the applicant returned to the prison hospital on DATE . On DATE an oncologist concluded after examining the applicant that the cancer had returned and that he also had pain in his left testicle .

They diagnosed him with cancer of the right testicle at stage CARDINAL B in clinical group ORG . The experts considered that given the degree of the tumour \u2019s malignancy the applicant \u2019s state of health could be considered as potentially serious . The rest of the tumour would have to be removed and the applicant given an intensive course of chemotherapy in conditions of stability . He would have to undergo check - ups every three months for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sent back to GPE Prison no . CARDINAL . The authorities refused a request for his return to the prison hospital sent by his lawyer to the director of the prisons department of ORG , the prison governor and other authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sent to the ORG for a course of chemotherapy . On DATE , before being discharged , the oncologist recommended that the applicant return after DATE for a check - up and more chemotherapy .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a complaint with ORG , drawing the judge \u2019s attention to his client \u2019s poor health , caused by a lack of adequate treatment which , in his view , could lead to his death . He complained in particular about the fact that the applicant had not been able to attend intensive chemotherapy sessions , despite ORG recommendations . The lawyer asked ORG to order an expert report to reassess his client \u2019s state of health , determine whether the prison hospital was able to provide him with the necessary treatment and whether the conditions of his detention could have a negative impact on his health . It also had to establish whether the applicant \u2019s life would be put at risk if the authorities failed to place him in a specialist clinic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , having received an objection from the prosecutor , rejected the lawyer \u2019s request and decided to summon the oncologist who had signed the recommendation of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In the meantime , in the context of the criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant , ORG ordered that he be examined at the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was admitted to the ORG , where he stayed until DATE in order to undergo a course of chemotherapy . At the same time a report concerning his medical condition was issued , which confirmed the diagnosis of cancer of the right testicle at stage CARDINAL B in clinical group ORG . The experts held that the results of the chemotherapy meant that the applicant \u2019s state of ill health could not be described as serious . Nevertheless , given the malignancy of the tumour the cancer could return . Consequently , several chemotherapy sessions were necessary to consolidate the success of the previous treatment . In addition , the applicant needed check - ups in a specialist clinic DATE .", "CARDINAL . He was then returned to the prison hospital on DATE , with a recommendation for another course of chemotherapy after DATE . In DATE the doctor in charge of his case repeatedly noted in his medical records that he required chemotherapy . The medical file shows that only treatment for his symptoms was available at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant returned to the ORG for chemotherapy . On DATE he was transferred back to the prison hospital with a recommendation for regular DATE medical tests . On DATE he was sent to ORG no . CARDINAL and given a recommendation for an examination after DATE . No record of his medical care at FAC no . CARDINAL and the subsequent DATE , if any , has been submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital , where he had various medical tests and had a consultation with an oncologist and a chemotherapy specialist . The latter concluded that there was no need for continued chemotherapy and noted that the applicant was due to return to the prison hospital for another check - up within DATE . As for the applicant \u2019s ORG , a liver function test had helped establish that the amount of bilirubin was within the norm and that no antiviral treatment was required at that stage . On DATE the applicant complained about being discharged from the prison hospital and of a lack of adequate medical care , particularly for his ORG . He stated that the chemotherapy had had an adverse effect on his liver and that he required urgent care in that regard . Notwithstanding his complaint , on DATE he was transferred to ORG no .

Without those reductions , the family would not have been able to pay for his treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting under LAW , indicated to the Government that the applicant should be placed in the prison hospital , where he could be provided with adequate medical treatment for his cancer and chronic ORG . The Government were also directed to ensure that the applicant was provided with all the relevant medical tests before commencing antiviral treatment and that his treatment be determined in consultation with an oncologist .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was transferred to the prison hospital DATE . On DATE , he was taken to a specialist civilian medical institution , where he underwent a tomography scan , which revealed a cyst - like lump . Doctors recommended a cancer marker blood test and an examination by an oncologist . Upon his return to the prison hospital , on DATE , the applicant had a consultation with a chemotherapy specialist , who concluded that he required several liver tests in view of his ORG diagnosis and further chemotherapy . The applicant was immediately offered chemotherapy at the prison hospital under the surveillance of an oncologist and a chemotherapy expert . However , he rejected that offer and on DATE requested a transfer to a specialist medical establishment . In that connection , the applicant argued that the conditions at the prison hospital were not appropriate for chemotherapy and that the relevant specialists were not present on a permanent basis to monitor his condition .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a medical panel at the prison hospital , including an oncologist , chemotherapy doctor and a liver specialist , concluded that treating both of the applicant \u2019s diseases simultaneously was not advisable . They concluded that chemotherapy was the priority and that the antiviral treatment should be postponed . On DATE the applicant was again offered chemotherapy at the prison hospital , but he refused and requested a transfer to the ORG . In reply to his request , by a letter of DATE , the head of social services at the prisons department asked the applicant to substantiate his request and explain the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the prison hospital . The applicant noted in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that the prison hospital , inter alia , did not employ a chemotherapy specialist who was present on a DATE basis and that he would therefore be left without DATE medical supervision there .", "CARDINAL . According to the medical file , the applicant on CARDINAL DATE again had a consultation with a chemotherapy doctor . Whilst confirming the need for chemotherapy , the doctor also noted that the applicant required various liver tests before antiviral treatment could commence .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the head of social services stated that the prison hospital was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with chemotherapy under the supervision of relevant specialists . He noted that several other inmates had had such treatment at the prison hospital and there was therefore no need to transfer the applicant to a specialist civilian hospital .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG in a letter of DATE about the applicant \u2019s refusal to have chemotherapy in the prison hospital . Treating it as obstructive behaviour and referring to the associated health risks , the ORG asked the ORG to provide them with any further indications at its earliest convenience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant asked the ORG , under Rule DATE , to indicate to the Government to transfer him to the ORG for chemotherapy . He reiterated his argument concerning the inadequacy of the equipment at the prison hospital for providing the requisite treatment for his cancer . In support , he noted that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL prisoners who had had chemotherapy at the prison hospital had passed away .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , acting under LAW , requested that the Government transfer the applicant to the ORG for more chemotherapy . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the ORG , where he had a tomography scan , which showed that there had been no progression of his retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in the abdominal cavity and that tumour markers were within normal limits . At the same time the scan revealed changes in his left lung and doctors recommended that he have a further examination . Following additional medical tests the applicant was diagnosed with tuberculosis ( \u201c TB \u201d ) in the left lung . On DATE he had a resection of the upper part of the left lung . On discharge from the ORG in DATE , it was noted that his condition was stable but that he required specialist treatment in a tuberculosis unit . The need for DATE oncological check - ups was also noted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had a consultation with a liver specialist , who noted a low level of pathological activity in the applicant \u2019s ORG and prescribed treatment with various hepatoprotectors . At the same time he was offered anti - TB treatment within the ORG programme ( Directly Observed Treatment , GPE \u2013 the treatment strategy for the detection and cure of GPE recommended by ORG ) , which he refused . On DATE and then on DATE the applicant also had ORG tests . The results showed no replication of the hepatitis and accordingly no need for antiviral treatment .

By a letter of DATE , the applicant objected to being discharged from the prison hospital . He stated that the medical evidence submitted by the Government did not support the assertion that he did not require further medical treatment . He also noted that he had never been provided with any treatment for his chronic ORG and that his health would again deteriorate if he was transferred to FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the information provided by the parties , ORG DATE decided to lift the interim measures previously indicated on DATE and DATE under Rule DATE .", "CARDINAL .
