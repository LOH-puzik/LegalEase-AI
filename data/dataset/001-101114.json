GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently confined in a psychiatric hospital in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in Neuwied . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of sexual abuse of a DATE girl . He confessed and was released DATE .", "On DATE the applicant voluntarily admitted himself to a psychiatric clinic at GPE .", "In the course of the applicant \u2019s trial at ORG it was established that DATE the applicant had committed QUANTITY offences of sexual abuse of children . At the time of the first offence the applicant was DATE . The applicant had manipulated the genitals of his victims , girls between DATE and ten , with his hands , whereupon he had spontaneous ejaculations or masturbated . He ceased the sexual manipulations as soon as his victims resisted him . The first sixteen offences of sexual abuse had been committed DATE . The victims were schoolmates of the applicant at a special boarding school for visually impaired persons which the applicant , who suffers from a serious congenital visual impairment himself , attended from DATE to DATE , first as a pupil and later as an apprentice . The other victims were children of relatives or of other acquaintances .", "On DATE ORG , following a confession by the applicant and after consulting a medical expert at the GPE psychiatric hospital , who diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a personality disorder characterised by very low self - esteem and difficulties with social integration as well as from a serious sexual deviation in the form of heterosexual paedophilia , acquitted the applicant . ORG considered that the applicant had committed his offences without criminal responsibility and ordered him to be placed in a forensic psychiatric clinic , since there was a high risk that he would commit further serious sexual offences ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) . Since then the applicant has been confined in psychiatric hospitals for CARDINAL .", "The applicant was initially detained in the forensic psychiatric hospital at GPE , then from DATE in GPE , where it was established that the applicant \u2019s sexual deviation was the consequence of a compulsive neurotic development and that - among other factors - the applicant \u2019s congenital visual impairment and problematic family background had led to his social marginalisation and prevented him from learning how to deal adequately with his sexuality .", "Following a failed therapy attempt the applicant was retransferred to the GPE psychiatric hospital in DATE , where he stayed until DATE . An authorisation to work in an external sheltered workshop for disabled persons was revoked in DATE when the applicant extended his journeys to work without permission on several occasions .", "In DATE the applicant was transferred to a forensic psychiatric clinic in GPE , where he entered into a homosexual relationship with a fellow patient . In DATE he was transferred back to a ward of the GPE clinic in GPE , where he has remained .", "Expert opinions established at regular intervals by the respective clinics in the period from DATE ( for instance on CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) while acknowledging that the applicant had adapted to life in the institution and had made some progress in his therapy , highlighted that he had a tendency to trivialise the offences he had committed and was not ready to deal with his personality disorder , and that it could not be ruled out that he would commit similar offences if released . An external expert opinion commissioned by ORG at the request of the applicant and rendered on DATE suggested that further therapeutic measures be pursued with the applicant , that accompanied exits from the hospital be allowed , and that his criminal prognosis be reviewed after DATE . Subsequent accompanied exits of the applicant from the clinic and further relaxations of his detention did not give cause for complaint .", "In DATE the applicant entered into a further homosexual relationship with a fellow patient , which was qualified by the attending therapists as relatively stable and estimated as the beginning of development towards a mature form of sexuality . Pursuant to an expert report rendered by the clinic on DATE the applicant showed progress in dealing with the offences he had committed but there was still a risk that he would commit related sexual offences .", "In an expert opinion dated DATE the same external expert who had rendered the opinion of DATE came to the conclusion that the applicant was not suffering from paedophilia and that the offences committed were to be qualified as compensatory acts of an inhibited and severely visually impaired person , who had considered his victims little adults . In view of the progress made by the applicant , as confirmed by the attending therapist , the expert found that the criminal prognosis for the applicant was rather positive and recommended that following a DATE probationary period a conditional release of the applicant and his placement in supervised accommodation ( Betreutes PERSON ) could be considered .", "The expert further pointed out that he had hardly ever come across a case where a person detained in a psychiatric hospital had been exposed to so many different treatments and transferred so often from CARDINAL clinic to another , resulting in alternating positive and negative prognoses . For instance , a course of therapy at the ORG psychiatric clinic showing positive results was interrupted in DATE when the applicant was retransferred to the clinic in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital has been reviewed at regular intervals ( compare Article PERSON and Article CARDINAL of LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) by the relevant courts , and his requests for probationary suspension of his detention have repeatedly been refused by the courts .", "For instance , by a decision dated DATE ORG , while refusing a further request by the applicant for a probationary suspension of his detention , held that after DATE of detention its further continuation might no longer be proportionate and that therefore the hospital was under an obligation to expedite rehabilitation measures , in particular in view of the applicant\u2019Regional ORG reduced the statutory DATE period for the subsequent review of the applicant \u2019s detention to DATE .", "An appeal by the applicant against a subsequent refusal of a similar request by ORG was dismissed by ORG by a decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG , in a decision confirmed on appeal , again rejected the request of the applicant for a probationary suspension of his detention .", "On DATE ORG rejected a further request for conditional discharge and ordered a review of his detention after DATE instead of the statutory DATE period .", "On DATE ORG , after hearing the applicant , dismissed his request to have his detention in a psychiatric hospital terminated or suspended on probation ( see Article CARDINALd and LAW of LAW ) . Having heard the applicant on DATE in the presence of his counsel as well as the ward physician and another doctor and relying in particular on an expert report by the GPE psychiatric clinic dated DATE , ORG found that since the last review of the applicant \u2019s detention on DATE the applicant , who had for a while been displaying aggressive behaviour , was now participating regularly in therapy groups again but had only agreed to do so after being informed that a refusal to undergo treatment would have a negative impact on his legal and medical prognosis . While taking into account the length of the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG emphasised the fact that the latter was still at the beginning of a new therapy attempt , that he was trivialising the committed offences on the ground that he had never used force against his victims , that he did not show any empathy with them and was incapable of speaking about his emotions . The ORG held that for these reasons there persisted a high risk that the applicant would commit similar sexual offences if released .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG was convinced that the applicant was still suffering from paedophilia and stressed that this diagnosis had repeatedly been confirmed by attending doctors . ORG further emphasised that it was not persuaded by the findings to the contrary of the external expert in DATE . It pointed out that in DATE the applicant had abused his unsupervised journeys to work in a sheltered workshop in order to visit locations frequented by children and juveniles , that pictures depicting child pornography had been discovered in his room and that he had subscribed to magazines for children and young people . ORG held that a probationary suspension of the applicant \u2019s detention would only be possible in the event that his therapy could be regarded as having reached such an advanced stage that the remaining threat to pre - adolescent girls would be low . These conditions had not been met in the instant case and it had to be assumed with certainty that the applicant would sexually abuse little girls if released .", "ORG referring also to its previous decision of DATE further considered that in view of this risk the applicant \u2019s continued detention for DATE was still proportionate . Having regard to the nature of the offences at stake and the obligation of the ORG to protect the rights of individuals and of the general public it was unjustifiable to release the applicant . Even lifelong detention in a psychiatric hospital could be proportionate and constitutional if justified by protection of the rights of third parties .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on the ground that it had no prospect of success . It held that the courts dealing with the execution of the applicant \u2019s detention were under an obligation to independently assess statements made or opinions rendered by experts and to reach a decision on the resulting prognosis . ORG was not bound by the conclusions of the external expert but was free to make its own assessment as to whether the conditions of Articles DATE of LAW had been met in the instant case . ORG conclusion had been in line with the findings of other experts , who had obviously assumed for DATE that the applicant was a paedophile . It had had sufficient regard to the external expert \u2019s findings and evaluations and had not come to any arbitrary conclusions . A negative legal prognosis for the applicant had been justified in view of the fact that he did not show any empathy with his victims and had a tendency to trivialise the committed offences . When assessing the proportionality of the continuing detention ORG had struck a fair balance between the applicant \u2019s request to be released after DATE of detention in a psychiatric hospital and the threat he posed to society .", "On the occasion of a subsequent review of the applicant \u2019s detention ORG , by a decision of DATE after hearing the applicant , and relying on an opinion by the attending doctors of CARDINAL DATE , again ordered that the applicant remain in a psychiatric hospital . The attending doctors had confirmed the diagnosis of paedophilia and given a negative criminal prognosis for the applicant , in particular in view of insufficient progress made in the course of his therapy and the resulting risk of recidivism . As regards the assessment as to whether the duration of the detention was still proportionate , ORG referred to ORG reasoning in its aforementioned decision of DATE . The applicant \u2019s related appeal was dismissed by ORG as manifestly ill - founded by a decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG obtained an external expert opinion in view of a further review of the applicant \u2019s detention . The expert found that the applicant was suffering from heterosexual paedophilia and that the homosexual relationships he had established with other prisoners had to be qualified as compensatory acts . The expert was of the opinion that the applicant continued to show paedophilic tendencies and that there persisted a risk that the applicant would commit similar sexual offences if released . In view of the external expert \u2019s conclusion and after hearing the applicant , ORG confirmed his continued detention by a decision dated DATE .", "On DATE ORG , after hearing the applicant and on the basis of a statement of the attending doctors of CARDINAL DATE , again found that a probationary suspension of the applicant \u2019s detention could not yet be envisaged , since the risk persisted that he would reoffend . The applicant \u2019s paedophilia and personality disorder remained unchanged and his capacity and willingness to cooperate in therapy was severely limited due to his lack of acknowledgement of his illness and need for treatment . He was still trivialising the offences committed and was incapable of showing sufficient emotional concern and empathy . The ORG , while taking into consideration the considerable length of the applicant \u2019s detention , pointed out that there was no doubt that his placement in a psychiatric hospital was still proportionate . The crimes which had been at the origin of the applicant \u2019s placement in the psychiatric hospital were serious and there persisted a high risk of recidivism . According to the statements of the attending doctors there were no other measures capable of responding to such a risk , in particular since the applicant \u2019s attitude towards his sexuality and paedophilic tendencies was completely unclear . Thus , at present the interest of the safety of the general public could only be protected by means of the applicant \u2019s continued detention and still took priority over the applicant \u2019s interest to be released .", "On DATE ORG dismissed a related appeal by the applicant .", "The German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( PERSON ) and socalled correction and prevention measures ( Ma\u00dfregeln der Besserung und GPE ) to deal with unlawful acts . Penalties ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of prison sentences and fines . The penalty is fixed according to the defendant \u2019s guilt ( LAW ) . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or a detoxification facility ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) . The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders or to protect the public from them . Placement in a psychiatric hospital may be ordered against offenders who have acted without , or with diminished , criminal responsibility . The measure must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants concerned , as well as to the danger they present ( LAW ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , a person who upon commission of a criminal offence is incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of the act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation due to a pathological emotional disorder , profound personality disorder , mental defect or any other serious emotional abnormality , acts without guilt .", "Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility pursuant to Article CARDINAL , the court orders their placement without a maximum duration in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive evaluation of the defendant and his act reveals that as a result of his condition he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore dangerous to the general public .", "Article PERSON of the Criminal Code governs the duration of detention . If the court considers following the commencement of detention in a psychiatric hospital that the conditions for the measure are no longer met or that further execution of the measure would be disproportionate , it declares the measure terminated ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides for review of a person \u2019s detention , inter alia , in a psychiatric hospital . The court may review at any time whether further execution of the detention order should be suspended on probation . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of Article CARDINALe ) . For persons detained in a psychiatric hospital , this time - limit is DATE ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
