On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON , born in DATE , was first interviewed at a hospital child psychiatric clinic on a suspicion that she had been sexually abused by the applicant . That suspicion was initially based on PERSON \u2019s own account of what her father had done to her .", "CARDINAL . Dr S. examined PERSON at the clinic on CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The sessions were recorded on videotape . Following those sessions the hospital staff proposed that a meeting be arranged between the applicant and PERSON to enable the observation of their interaction . Such a meeting was never held , presumably due to the opposition of PERSON \u2019s mother , the applicant \u2019s former wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant met a social worker and a nurse at the hospital . He denied any sexual abuse , suspecting that the mother had manipulated PERSON into saying negative things about him in order to prevent his visits with the child . The applicant and PERSON \u2019s mother had divorced in DATE and they had not been able to agree on the child \u2019s custody and visiting rights . They had subsequently been afforded joint custody of PERSON by a court . Against this background , the applicant urged that other possible reasons for PERSON \u2019s behaviour than sexual abuse be taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . In a feedback discussion held on DATE Dr S. informed the applicant about the results of the examinations , which in his opinion supported the suspicion of abuse by the applicant . The applicant was told that a meeting between him and PERSON was to be arranged and that he would be informed about the date of the meeting later on . The applicant requested copies of PERSON \u2019s examination reports .", "CARDINAL . No meeting between the applicant and PERSON was arranged .", "CARDINAL . As copies of PERSON \u2019s examination reports had not been sent to the applicant , his counsel made fresh requests to that end on CARDINAL and DATE . She also insisted that the applicant be heard regarding the examinations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE E. was examined at the clinic by PERSON That session was also videotaped . No meeting with the applicant was arranged in respect of the results of that examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital refused to submit copies of PERSON \u2019s examination reports to the applicant , finding that their disclosure might be detrimental to her health or treatment and that it might conflict with another very important private interest .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG ( tietosuojavaltuutettu , dataombudsmannen ) to obtain access to PERSON \u2019s medical file . No decision was given by that authority before the beginning of the subsequent trial against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . E. \u2019s therapy at the hospital started in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police began a pre - trial investigation of the applicant during which his counsel was given the opportunity to view the video recordings of PERSON \u2019s examinations by ORG Apparently , counsel was also given copies of CARDINAL of the documents pertaining to the case . The investigation was closed on DATE . In his final statement to the pre - trial investigation , the applicant requested that the investigating authorities acquire the totality of PERSON \u2019s medical file from the hospital . His request was not complied with as the police and the public prosecutor did not regard PERSON \u2019s patient records as having any influence in the matter .", "CARDINAL . While the investigation was still pending , in DATE and DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel had again asked the hospital authorities for access to those documents in PERSON \u2019s medical file which were not already in the possession of the defence . The requests were refused . The applicant appealed against the decisions to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor brought a charge against the applicant , alleging aggravated sexual abuse of PERSON DATE . On DATE the applicant submitted a written request to ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) to gain access to PERSON \u2019s medical file , claiming that it was necessary for his defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the hospital authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him access to E. \u2019s medical file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It stated that the examination reports requested by the applicant were not included in the trial material , and his request thus lacked legal basis . Furthermore , the court held that the applicant was entitled to obtain any medical documents given to or acquired by ORG in the course of the criminal proceedings . Moreover , he had already been given copies of the video recordings and documents included in the pre - trial investigation material .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a preparatory hearing on DATE , in which the applicant repeated his request to obtain all of PERSON \u2019s examination reports . On DATE , having obtained the consent of PERSON \u2019s mother , the court ordered the hospital to submit to the court the requested documents . In another preparatory hearing , held in DATE , the applicant was finally afforded the opportunity to acquaint himself with the remainder of PERSON \u2019s medical file .", "CARDINAL . NORP The main proceedings against the applicant began on DATE . The court received testimony from the applicant and CARDINAL other persons , including PERSON , PERSON and other doctors . A number of documents , including medical reports drawn up by the doctors treating PERSON , were referred to in evidence . The videotaped examinations of PERSON were played back before the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of the charge , finding that there was at least reasonable doubt as to his guilt . The court noted that the examination reports obtained during the pre - trial investigation had been exceptionally important to the outcome thereof . According to the court the examinations seemed to have been based on the presumption that PERSON had been sexually abused by the applicant . Nevertheless , the applicant had not been afforded an opportunity to acquaint himself with PERSON \u2019s medical file while the examinations at the hospital were being conducted and had only gained access to the totality of her examination reports shortly before the trial . There had thus been crucial shortcomings in the pre - trial investigation , contrary to the rights of the defence as set out in FAC ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslag ; DATE ) and the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor and PERSON , represented by her mother , appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . In his reply to that court , the applicant contended , inter alia , that the investigation against him had de facto been carried out by the doctors and not by the police . He had not been given an opportunity to put questions to PERSON , even indirectly , when she had been examined at the hospital , or at any later stage of the proceedings . He had only seen the video recordings when the pre - trial investigation was already well underway . It transpired from those recordings that during the examinations PERSON had claimed sexual abuse not only by her father , but also by several other persons . Further , the applicant had only been given access to PERSON \u2019s medical file at the beginning of the trial , which meant that he had not had adequate time to prepare his defence .", "CARDINAL . ORG held an oral hearing DATE . The evidence presented to the court was in most part the same as had been before ORG . As to the applicant \u2019s involvement in the examinations , PERSON testified that during the feedback discussion of DATE he had asked the applicant whether he had any questions . The applicant had not indicated at that point that he wished to have any further examinations conducted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appellate court quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and convicted the applicant of aggravated sexual abuse . He was sentenced to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment . The court found that PERSON \u2019s account , recorded on videotape , was essential evidence , but not the sole evidence , against the applicant . In its conclusions the court emphasised PERSON \u2019s behaviour , as it transpired from the video recordings , and the statements of ORG , who had examined her , and of another doctor who had treated her . This evidence was supported by CARDINAL other witness testimonies regarding PERSON \u2019s behaviour . The court further stated as follows :", "\u201c Given that [ E. \u2019s ] account is essential evidence supporting the charge , [ the applicant ] or his counsel should have been given an explicit opportunity ( \u201c olisi ... selke\u00e4sti tullut varata tilaisuus \u201d ) to put questions to [ E. ] through the pre - trial authorities or to request further investigations . However , this opportunity has not been provided within a reasonable time nor at a stage when it would have been useful , namely before the beginning of [ E. \u2019s ] therapy . The procedure has therefore been deficient in part . [ Dr S. ] has , however , given [ the applicant ] an opportunity to request further examinations . Having regard to the fact that also other evidence in addition to [ E. \u2019s ] account has been presented , ORG finds that the above - mentioned procedural error can not lead to the dismissal of the charge . Taking into account the legal protection of the child and her state of health as well as the fact that she had already been undergoing treatment for a long time , it would not have been reasonable to follow the adversarial procedure at a later stage . Naturally , the child \u2019s account and her behaviour , as they transpire from the video recordings , must be taken with circumspection when assessing the evidence . However , ORG considers that the taking of evidence , assessed as a whole , meets the minimum requirements of a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) contending , inter alia , that the proceedings had been unfair in the light of LAW as he had been denied adversarial proceedings and the timely opportunity to acquaint himself with the totality of the case material . On DATE he was refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the proceedings in question , apart from the leave to appeal proceedings in ORG , there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of testimony given by a child prior to the trial .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , as in force at the material time , provided that a statement included in a pre - trial investigation report or another document , or a statement recorded by other means , could not , as a rule , be admitted as evidence in court . The court might , exceptionally , admit such a statement as evidence , if the witness in question could not be questioned before the court ( LAW , articles CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ORG ) , Act No . CARDINAL ) . It was at the court \u2019s discretion to hear as a witness a person DATE ( LAW , LAW no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure was amended with effect from DATE . According to the current provisions , the testimony of a person under DATE , or a mentally disturbed person , recorded on audio or videotape during the pre - trial investigation , may be used as evidence if the accused has been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to the person giving the testimony ( LAW , article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . According to the explanatory report to the relevant Government PERSON ( No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , this new provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to , inter alia , a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . A more detailed description of the domestic law regarding pre - trial investigation and receipt of evidence in court may be found in the ORG \u2019s judgment of GPE v. GPE ( no .
