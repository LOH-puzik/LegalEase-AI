{"ITEMID": "001-72783", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "Z. and T. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON born in GPE in DATE and T. born in GPE in DATE are NORP citizens currently resident in Hull . They are represented before the ORG by Mr D. Foster , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant sisters are NORP . Their parents , PERSON and PERSON , were active in the NORP community in GPE and PERSON was a ORG minister for DATE . In DATE , the second applicant , PERSON married her cousin , also a NORP and son of a minister in DATE . She went to live in GPE and from DATE worked as a teacher in ORG in GPE . The first applicant , PERSON had married a fellow NORP in DATE and moved to live in ORG .", "On DATE , after the attacks in GPE on DATE , there was an attack on the NORP church in GPE . Machine guns were fired into the church and many worshippers were killed and injured . CARDINAL of the policeman on duty at the church was killed . PERSON was among the severely injured . Mr and PERSON , and their son PERSON fled to GPE to obtain medical treatment for PERSON Their son PERSON was already in GPE . All were granted asylum . The applicants\u2019 sister PERSON was also granted asylum on DATE .", "On DATE , the first applicant travelled to GPE with her children on a visitors visa to see her mother who continued to be unwell .", "On DATE , PERSON died .", "On DATE the second applicant came to GPE with her family to attend the funeral .", "On DATE , DATE after her arrival , the first applicant applied for asylum , along with her husband and daughter , invoking Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention . She stated that there had been a bomb threat on their church in ORG during DATE when the police had deactivated an explosive device , while in DATE her husband and his brother had been attacked by extremists . In the latter incident , although there was shooting , CARDINAL was hurt and the assailants absconded with her husband \u2019s motorbike . She and her husband had also received threatening telephone calls .", "By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG gave reasons for refusal , considering that the applicant had never been physically attacked or ill - treated on the basis of her beliefs and had not been present during the bomb threat at the church where the police had successfully intervened . He noted that NORP were a recognised minority group under LAW , that the Government were taking measures to curb acts of sectarian violence and that they were willing and able to take action to protect NORP churches and communities .", "By decision of DATE , the Adjudicator refused her appeal , finding that the authorities offered protection to churches , inter alia convicting CARDINAL men for an attack on a NORP church . He also noted that the applicant had not herself been personally or directly threatened with violence and that she had lived some distance from GPE , having no direct connection with the incident there . He noted that the assault on her husband in DATE had been reported as robbery without any mention of religious motivation for the attack . He found no problem arising under LAW as there was no bar on NORP as shown by the fact that her father had been a minister for DATE . He concluded that she had not shown that she was risk .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) , refused the first applicant permission to appeal noting a recent precedent from ORG in GPE ( R ( GPE ) v. a Special Adjudicator [ CARDINAL ] PERSON CARDINAL ) and finding in line with that authority that the situation of NORP in GPE who , for example , had their own representatives in ORG was not so flagrantly bad as to allow exceptionally a case to proceed under LAW where there were no grounds under LAW .", "On DATE , the second applicant applied for asylum , together with her children and husband . She invoked ORG , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention , claiming that she feared that if she returned to GPE she would be subjected to attack by NORP extremists because she was a NORP . She referred to having received nuisance telephone calls during TIME after the incident on ORG .", "By letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused asylum , noting inter alia that NORP were a recognised minority group under LAW , that the Government were taking measures to curb acts of sectarian violence and that they were willing and able to take action to protect NORP churches and communities . He also did not consider that the applicant was at risk because of the incident at GPE as she lived in GPE and since the incident had suffered nothing more serious than nuisance telephone calls . He found no ground for a breach of LAW as she had not shown any risk of a flagrant denial of her rights .", "By decision of DATE , the Adjudicator refused the applicant \u2019s appeal , noting that the applicant had not applied for asylum at the time of the DATE attack but had remained in GPE for DATE . While she claimed to have received unpleasant telephone calls , she had been able to deal with them by switching off the phone . He found no indication that there would be insufficient protection offered to her by the authorities who had placed guards on the churches and on the school where she worked .", "On DATE , the ORG refused permission for an appeal , noting that the second applicant had not raised her Article CARDINAL complaint before the Adjudicator even though she was represented by specialist advocates and finding no error in the Adjudicator \u2019s decision .", "In the case of NORP ( on the application of GPE ) v. PERSON ( [ CARDINAL ] PERSON CARDINAL ) , the claimant entered GPE from GPE and applied for asylum , claiming to have a well - founded fear of persecution as a result of his religious beliefs . The Secretary of ORG dismissed his claim and held that he had not qualified for permission to remain in the country by reason of any LAW . The claimant \u2019s appeal was dismissed , the Special Adjudicator finding that he did not have a well - founded fear of persecution and that , while LAW could be engaged in such a situation , the Secretary of ORG had acted lawfully and proportionately and in pursuance of the legitimate aim of immigration control in refusing leave to remain .", "ORG dismissed the claimant \u2019s further appeal , holding that where the Convention was invoked on the sole ground of the treatment to which an alien was likely to be subjected by the receiving ORG and that treatment was not sufficiently serious to engage LAW , the court was not required to recognise that any other LAW was , or might be , engaged .", "ORG dismissed the claimant \u2019s further appeal . However , differing from ORG , the ORG held that where in relation to the removal of an individual from GPE the anticipated treatment did not meet the minimum requirements of LAW , other ORG of the LAW might be engaged . While it was hard to conceive that a person could successfully resist expulsion in reliance on DATE without being entitled either to asylum on the ground of a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of religious or personal opinion or to resist expulsion in reliance on LAW , such a possibility could not be ruled out . It would be necessary for a claimant to establish at least a real risk of a flagrant violation of the very essence of the right before the other ORG could become engaged . ORG found that , in the instant appeal , the claimant \u2019s case had not come within the possible parameters of a flagrant , gross or fundamental breach of LAW such as to amount to a denial or nullification of the rights conferred by LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
