ORG In their youth , both Mr. and Mrs. PERSON had spent some time at PERSON , a home for the mentally retarded . However , an examination by a psychologist in DATE revealed that they then had an average level of intelligence . Other children of theirs had been in social care and PERSON has been subject to various forms of special education since DATE , when he was registered with ORG for the Handicapped by reason of his being mentally retarded .", "Prior to the events giving rise to the present case , a number of different social authorities had been individually involved with the family ; they co - ordinated their activities from DATE onwards . Mr. PERSON - who is in receipt of a disability pension - and Mrs. PERSON were both given certain additional social assistance DATE . They stated that they lived apart on CARDINAL occasions , the first time for DATE and the second for DATE .

This decision , which had been prompted by the fact that PERSON and PERSON had been found cycling around and unable to make their way home , was confirmed on DATE by ORG after a meeting on DATE at which the applicants were present and made oral submissions .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the ORG decided , at a meeting at which the applicants were present and had an opportunity to submit their views , that the children should be taken into care , pursuant to sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . This decision was based , inter alia , on a report compiled by the social administration and dated DATE , which was produced at the meeting . The report reviewed the family history and background ; recorded the applicants\u2019 opposition to the children \u2019s being taken into care ; concluded that the latter \u2019s development was in danger since they were living in an environment which was unsatisfactory due to their GPE inability to satisfy their need for care , stimulation and supervision ; noted that preventive measures had been taken , but with no result ; and recommended the taking into care . Appended to the report were statements from PERSON \u2019s former teacher , from ORG No . CARDINAL ( concerning GPE and PERSON ) and from the home where the children had been placed for investigation , together with a medical report dated CARDINAL DATE and issued by ORG at a hospital ( \" \u00d6stra sjukhuset \" ) in GPE . The medical report was signed by chief doctor PERSON , a consultant at the above - mentioned home , and by PERSON , a psychologist , both of whom were members of the team that was in touch with the family . It read as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" The above - mentioned children have been assessed at the children \u2019s psychiatric clinic at \u00d6stra sjukhuset on DATE . Both parents have been summoned to separate doctor \u2019s discussions but have not appeared . The family has been known at the children \u2019s psychiatric clinic since DATE , when the social worker requested observation and an assessment of the development of PERSON following his admittance to that clinic for pneumonia and an investigation for urinary infection . After referral from the doctor responsible , the assessment of NORP development was made on DATE by a psychologist , PERSON . This psychologist and welfare officer ( kurator ) PERSON thereafter participated in conferences at social welfare office no . CARDINAL on DATE and CARDINAL DATE with all those involved in the case , concerning the supportive measures the family had received previously and for the planning of further measures . Social welfare office conferences , together with the parents , also took place on DATE , at which an application for a day - centre placement for PERSON and PERSON was decided upon , and on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , at which DATE home or camp was planned for GPE and PERSON . During a home visit on DATE , ORG was also the subject of an assessment of her development by the psychologist PERSON . PERSON was also the subject of a new assessment of his development on DATE . During NORP stay at the hospital , welfare officer PERSON had contact with the parents . I have taken note of the investigation report of DATE , with proposals concerning supervision , and the report of CARDINAL DATE , with proposals concerning a care order . I have also taken note of the children \u2019s medical files . On DATE , PERSON , welfare officer at the school for retarded children , provided certain information by telephone concerning PERSON .", "It appears from the medical file that at DATE PERSON was admitted to the GPE children \u2019s hospital for assessment of his development and already at that stage he was found to be considerably retarded . At DATE he was retarded by DATE . During a new test at DATE he was found to be at the developmental level of DATE child . The psychologist PERSON considered him at that time to be passive , afraid and cautious . He was withdrawn and was most significantly retarded as regards his linguistic development . He was considered to be in great need of stimulation and the psychologist questioned whether there were sufficient opportunities for this in his home environment . He could not feed himself , could not run properly and he was not accustomed to playing with other children . According to the file , the parents were \u2018 not interested in taking him to a special play - centre\u2019 . On DATE , it was noted that he never had cooked food , could not construct sentences , did not play outside , cried easily , could feed himself but did it rarely , and seemed pale and lethargic . PERSON now attends DATE in a school for the retarded . It appears that he is one of the weakest pupils . At the beginning of his time at this school , the home conditions appeared to be acceptable since the family had a home - therapist . Subsequently , however , there were alarming reports that PERSON ran around outside and was often taken care of by the police . He could not control his urine and bowels , was teased by his friends because he smelled badly , and he was even undressed by them , according to the school welfare officer PERSON . Food problems have also occurred , according to the school nurse . PERSON mostly ate only sandwiches . The boy is short - sighted and needs to wear glasses , but he does not do so . Since the parents have also had difficulties in supervising and caring for PERSON , different ways of placing him have been discussed . A placement in an educational home appeared to be a good solution , but the parents withdrew at the last moment . Placement in a foster home has also been proposed , but the father reacted with depressive symptoms and kept the boy at home and away from school .", "During a medical assessment on DATE PERSON gave the impression of being very retarded in his development but , in addition , he was cut off in his personal contacts , did not hear questions , did not treat play material in an adequate manner and seemed to have a limited concentration and attention span . His behaviour was clumsy . He could not write his own name and , when drawing with a pencil , he folded the paper at an angle of CARDINALo . He did not wear his glasses .", "During a development assessment in her home on DATE , carried out by PERSON , PERSON attained a level comparable to that expected of her age . During a visit to the children \u2019s welfare clinic , however , ORG was considered passive , looked afraid and had an undeveloped use of language . She has been going to a clinic since DATE for stomach problems , but this has not led to any measure being taken . During an assessment on DATE she was shy when there were several persons in the same room , did not say anything and behaved as a mother towards PERSON , giving him toys and embracing him now and then . The same behaviour has been noted at the children \u2019s home .", "Thomas\u2019 development has been assessed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE by PERSON . During the first assessment he was somewhat below the level of development which was expected and was also somewhat passive and withdrawn in his contacts . During the second assessment he was seriously quiet , cautious and his face was without expression . His development was DATE behind . His language ( at DATE ) corresponded to a degree of development of DATE child . He became clearly stimulated by play and test material and seemed to have development potential . He gave a clear impression that he had not received sufficient stimulation at home . In the medical file it has been noted in DATE that the mother \u2019s way of feeding PERSON was clearly abnormal . She held the feeding bottle at a distance and , even after having been asked to pick him up , there was no natural close contact . At the children \u2019s home it has been observed that the father still treats PERSON as a baby .", "In summary , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON are CARDINAL children whose parents have been registered as being retarded . The father has retired early . In addition , the GPE inter - relations are bad . They have separated for DATE and are now separated again . The family has moved CARDINAL times in DATE . PERSON and PERSON show clear signs of backwardness , probably of different origins . Furthermore , there is a lack of care for the children on the part of the parents , and the children \u2019s behaviour is disturbed . PERSON has had enuresis and encopresis , feeding difficulties , social difficulties with other children and has shown vagrancy tendencies . His special need of clean clothes , glasses ( he is myopic ) , and extra care and stimulation because of his backwardness , has not been met by his parents . The linguistic development of all the children is retarded . Such backwardness is the most frequent sign of under - stimulation . PERSON , who is of average intelligence , is inclined to take too great a responsibility for her brother PERSON . PERSON has not had any opportunity of adequate training either physically or psychologically .", "Since measures taken up to now in the form of a home - therapist , day - care nursery - home placement , supervision , etc . have not improved the situation , we recommend that PERSON , PERSON and PERSON be taken into care and be given foster homes . \"", "The applicants alleged that , before this medical report was prepared , Dr. PERSON had never met them and had never visited their home . They also complained of the fact that she did not herself examine the children until DATE , after they had been placed in care for investigation on CARDINAL DATE ; at that time they were in a state of shock as a result of violent police action on their removal from their home and of their completely new environment .

The action of these social workers is completely in conflict with the applicants\u2019 own understanding of how children and adults and family members and others ought to show respect and consideration . ... It must be added that if the applicants were to co - operate with the foster parents and the social workers they would risk passing on to their children the totally wrong impression that the separation of children and parents and the placement of the children in foster homes had occurred with the consent of the applicants . This would be completely disastrous to the self - respect of the applicants\u2019 children if they had the wrong impression that their natural parents did not wish them to be at home with them . \" ( ibid . , paragraph CARDINAL in fine )", "CARDINAL . ORG Following a request by the applicants for termination of the care of the children , a meeting was held on DATE at the ORG \u2019s office , at which the applicants , their lawyer and official counsel for the children were present .", "On DATE , the ORG rejected the request . It based its decision on reports compiled by the social administration and dated CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , which concluded that the parents were then incapable of giving the children the necessary support and encouragement . Annexed to the reports were statements from the psychologist PERSON , social workers and a school teacher , indicating that the children had made satisfactory progress since being taken into care .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants thereupon appealed to ORG . It held a hearing on DATE , at which the applicants were present and assisted by a lawyer ; the ORG was represented by a lawyer and CARDINAL social workers and the children by official counsel . Dr. PERSON and a social expert from ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) gave evidence - the former at the request of the applicants\u2019 lawyer - and various written opinions from a psychologist , a welfare officer , a school teacher of PERSON and his school doctor were read out . The President of the ORG also summarised the documents on which the ORG \u2019s decision had been based .", "The applicants submitted that the medical report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) contained clearly false information , by affirming that they were mentally retarded , and did not indicate any concrete facts showing that the children would have been in danger if they had continued to live with their parents . The ORG , for its part , asserted that its refusal to terminate care had been based not on the applicants\u2019 being mentally retarded but on their inability to satisfy the children \u2019s need for care , stimulation and supervision .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , in addition to confirming the restrictions on parental access to PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , held as follows ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" The facts of the case show that the children suffered to a greater or lesser extent from different types of disturbance when they were taken into care . PERSON was disturbed in his development at a level comparable to special lower class . Following the placement in a foster home , his social abilities have improved and his language development has accelerated . His incontinence has to a large extent disappeared . In the special lower school PERSON has developed favourably having regard to his abilities . As regards PERSON and PERSON , they have developed favourably in the foster homes . The assessment of these CARDINAL children \u2019s psychological development undertaken in DATE shows that the previous delays and disturbances have now been caught up or have disappeared , and that their development is now completely at the same level as that to be expected for their age .", "As far as the applicants are concerned , their circumstances seem to have stabilised in recent times . Thus , the couple moved from Angered in DATE and since then have been living in a more child - adapted environment in the community of GPE . The dispute which prevailed in the marriage at the time when the children were taken into care has been overcome , and it seems now as if the relations between the applicants are better . Following a request from their representative , the applicants have been examined by psychologist PERSON from GPE . This investigation shows that both applicants have an average level of intelligence .", "Under LAW [ see paragraph DATE below ] , the decisive issue in determining whether care under the LAW in question should be terminated is whether it is no longer necessary . Facts such as the apparent improvement and stabilising of the applicants\u2019 situation and the children \u2019s favourable development in their foster homes are an argument in favour of the termination of care . However , there are several circumstances militating in the opposite direction . PERSON , who during DATE has had several permissions to visit the GPE home , has been disturbed in various ways upon his return to the foster home and has relapsed into his previous negative behaviour . PERSON \u2019s return trip to the foster home on DATE does not seem to have been well planned and it developed in an unfortunate way for him . In addition , the applicants have so far had difficulties in co - operating in a satisfactory manner with PERSON \u2019s foster home and ORG . In making an assessment of all the facts of the case , the ORG finds that the applicants still show a lack of comprehension and ability to give the children satisfactory care and education . It must therefore be feared that a termination of care under the LAW can at present involve great risks for the health and development of the children . Care is therefore to continue and the appeal is rejected . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants then appealed to ORG . After a hearing on DATE , at which they were present and assisted by counsel , the appeal was dismissed on DATE . The applicants had unsuccessfully requested that Dr. PERSON be called as a witness at the hearing .", "Mr. and Mrs. PERSON sought to appeal to ORG , but on DATE it refused them leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG A fresh request by the applicants to the Council for termination of the care of the children was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the ORG rejected further requests by the applicants for termination of the care of GPE and PERSON and of PERSON , respectively ; on the first of these dates it also declined to lift the restriction on visits to GPE and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Appeals by the parents against these decisions were dismissed by ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively .", "The applicants thereupon appealed to ORG , which joined the CARDINAL cases . After holding a hearing at which Mr. and Mrs. PERSON were present and gave evidence , ORG , by judgment of CARDINAL DATE , directed that the public care of PERSON be terminated : it took into consideration his recent positive development , his GPE increased understanding of his needs and their agreement that he should complete his current term of schooling at ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the appeal concerning GPE and PERSON - the scope of which was confined by Mr. and Mrs. PERSON themselves at the hearing to the care issue , to the exclusion of the access issue - was dismissed . ORG opinion that the public care of these CARDINAL children should continue was based primarily on the fact that the applicants were unable to understand and satisfy the special needs arising in connection with re - uniting parents and children after so long a period of separation .", "Following an appeal by the parents , ORG , by judgment of DATE , directed that the public care of GPE and PERSON should terminate , there being no sufficiently serious circumstances to warrant its continuation . ORG pointed out that the question to be determined in deciding whether care should be discontinued pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph DATE below ) was whether there was still a need for care . The problems associated with the removal of a child from a foster home and its possible detrimental effects on him and with his reunification with his natural parents - on which ORG had relied - were matters to be considered not under section CARDINAL but in separate proceedings , namely an investigation under LAW of LAW DATE ( socialtj\u00e4nstlagen CARDINAL ) . The latter section empowers a ORG to prohibit , for a certain period of time or until further notice , the removal from a foster home of a minor who is not or is no longer in public care , if there is thereby a risk , which is not of a minor nature , of harming his physical or mental health .", "CARDINAL . PERSON is now reunited with his parents .", "However , on DATE the ORG , acting pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , prohibited them until further notice from removing PERSON and PERSON from their respective foster homes . An application by Mr. and Mrs. PERSON for the interim suspension of this prohibition was refused by ORG on DATE ; this decision was confirmed by ORG on DATE and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal . On DATE , ORG rejected on the merits the applicants\u2019 appeal against the prohibition ; it expressed the opinion that \" a prohibition against removal should not be valid for too long a period \" and that \" a precondition for the rescission of the prohibition ... is that efforts should be made to improve contacts between the parents and children , both through Mr. and Mrs. PERSON and through ORG \" . According to information supplied to ORG by the Government on DATE , an appeal by the applicants to ORG against this judgment was then pending ; in the meantime , they remained free to visit GPE and PERSON at the foster homes .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to NORP child - welfare legislation , each municipality is responsible for promoting the favourable development of children and young persons by taking , if necessary , supportive or preventive measures ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It may also take a child into care and place him in a foster home , a children \u2019s home or another suitable institution .", "The legislation divides measures of the latter kind into CARDINAL categories : the first concerns \" voluntary care \" , enabling a parent to place his child into the care of a local authority ; the second provides for \" compulsory care \" , by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court decision or order committing a child to its care . It was recourse to this machinery that was in issue in the present case .", "CARDINAL . ORG Decisions concerning the applicants\u2019 children were taken under LAW and under LAW containing Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons DATE ( lag DATE : CARDINAL med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga - \" LAW \" ) . LAW complements LAW DATE , which deals with voluntary care ; on entering into force on DATE , they together replaced LAW . In general , decisions taken under LAW which were still in force on DATE were considered to be decisions taken under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW , the competent local authority in child - care matters - ORG ( barnav\u00e5rdsn\u00e4mnden ) or , in GPE and GPE , ORG - was obliged to intervene ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" [ if ] a person , not yet DATE , is maltreated in his home or otherwise treated there in a manner endangering his bodily or mental health , or if his development is jeopardised by the unfitness of his parents or other guardians responsible for his upbringing , or by their inability to raise the child . \"", "Section CARDINAL(b ) of LAW ( which was not applied in the present case ) provided that the local authority also had to intervene if a minor needed corrective measures because of his criminal , immoral or otherwise asocial behaviour .", "CARDINAL . ORG As regards section CARDINAL(a ) , the preparatory work to LAW stated , inter alia , the following ( translation from the NORP ) :", "\" In the future too , an important reason for intervention must be that a minor is exposed to physical maltreatment . The specific reference to this in the text of the statute seems to some extent to obscure the importance of the fact that children and young persons must also be protected from other kinds of treatment which may be harmful to their bodily or mental health . For this reason , the PERSON instead makes it a prerequisite for intervention that the minor is being maltreated in his home or that he is otherwise treated there in such a way as to endanger his bodily or mental health . This amendment in relation to the law now in force does not aim at bringing about any material change . Reasons for intervention , except for physical maltreatment , may be such as are given as examples in the preparatory work to the legislation now in force : for instance , that a child , who is perhaps being cared for with great tenderness , is all the same continuously exposed to mortal danger owing to his mother \u2019s mental illness , or that an infant is being cared for by a mother who is suffering from tuberculosis in a contagious state . Further examples may be that the minor is obliged to do work that is unreasonably hard considering his age or his strength , that he does not get enough to eat and is for that reason clearly undernourished , or that his home environment is marked by a considerable lack of hygiene . According to the practice that has been applied hitherto , it should also be possible to intervene in those instances where the parents - perhaps because of their religious convictions - omit to give the child the medical care and treatment that he needs . Among the cases where children are exposed to mental injury or danger may be mentioned the one where parents - with evident symptoms of mental abnormalities or of pathological attitudes - bring up their children in a way , as the committee puts it , that includes a kind of spiritual error and which often in the end causes their personality to develop in an undesirable way . When such upbringing has the result that the child \u2019s mental health is endangered , it comes under the section now dealt with .", "For an intervention under section [ CARDINAL ) ] of LAW to be permitted , there must be a danger of the child \u2019s becoming a misfit because of his GPE vicious way of life or their negligence or inability to educate the child . The provision in question thus concerns abnormalities in the parents or in their capacity to educate ; it lays down that those abnormalities should be such as to endanger the child \u2019s social development . Parents and other custodians should be treated on equal terms in this respect . Otherwise only amendments of a formal nature seem to be required . Thus , it is suggested that the words \u2018 vicious\u2019 and \u2018 negligence\u2019 be replaced by the expression \u2018 unsuitability as ORG , which seems more appropriate in this context . Obviously , the scope of this expression is somewhat wider than the one currently in use . Apart from \u2018 vicious\u2019 and \u2018 negligent\u2019 custodians , it thus also covers those suffering from serious mental abnormalities . There seems to be no reason to object to this enlargement of the field of application of this rule . Society should be entitled to intervene as soon as there is a danger of a young person \u2019s unfavourable social development owing to shortcomings in the custodian . Since the notion of \u2018 misfit\u2019 , as the committee has found , should be excluded from this legislation , the intervention of ORG has instead been made subject to the prerequisite that the development of the young person is in jeopardy . This means that intervention shall take place whenever needed to prevent such abnormalities of behaviour as are indicated under section [ CARDINAL ) ] . It should be pointed out that , just as is the case under the law now in force , an intervention does not require that there have so far been any signs of maladaptation in the young person in question . \" ( Reproduced in CARDINAL II - FAC , \" Journal for Legislation \" - DATE , pp .

( translation from the NORP ) .", "ORG stated :", "\" An important point of departure for the reform of the social services is that salient features in the handling of individual cases should be respect for liberty and the right of the individual to decide about his own life . The aim of the social services should be to co - operate with the client as far as possible , in order to make him take part in decisions as to the planning of treatment and make him co - operate actively in carrying it out . The social services should offer help and support , but not take over the individual \u2019s responsibility for his own life . Personal initiative and responsibility must be made part of care and treatment . In this manner the social services may work more actively in a preventive way , and the opportunity to achieve more long - lasting results will be improved .", "This fundamental principle of the new legislation has been laid down in section CARDINAL of the Social Services Bill , which stipulates that the measures taken by ORG in regard to any individual person should be conceived and carried out in co - operation with the person concerned . Consequently , all social services\u2019 opportunities to use coercive measures on adults have been abolished . It is true that , regarding young people and children , the possibility of providing care outside their home contrary to the wishes of the young person or his parents is retained . In this field too , the reform means , however , that the right of the individual to be a party to those decisions that concern his own fate is more strongly stressed . The individual should be able to turn to the social services confidently and ask for help , without risking undesired effects in the form of various coercive measures .", "At the same time there is unanimity in considering that in certain cases society must be able to use coercive measures against an individual , whenever this is needed to avoid an immediate risk to somebody \u2019s life or health . \"", "The Minister of ORG stated :", "\" LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL , indicates that CARDINAL ground for measures on the part of society is that lack of care for a young person in his home or some other situation in his home constitutes a danger to his health or development . This rule refers to situations where the young person does not receive sufficient care in his home or is exposed to treatment in his home that means there is a danger to his mental or physical health or to his social development . By the word \u2018 home\u2019 is to be understood the home of the parents , as well as any other home where the young person is residing permanently . Under this description come , inter alia , cases where the young person is subject to maltreatment in his home . Even a slight degree of maltreatment must be supposed to cause danger to the health or development of the young person . If , in such a case , the parents oppose such measures as ORG may consider necessary to assure the protection of the young person , application of the law may come into focus . In case there has been maltreatment of a more serious kind , the young person should as a matter of course be provided with care outside his home , at least for some time .", "As with LAW , this provision may also be applied in those instances where the parents intend to place the young person in an environment that will endanger his health or his development , or where they do not prevent him from being in such an environment .", "This section thus embraces all those situations where the child is being exposed to physical maltreatment or negligent care . This legislation may also be applicable if parents endanger the mental health of a child by their personal characteristics . If the child \u2019s mental health or development is being endangered because of parental behaviour - for instance , by way of continuously recurring scenes at home owing to abuse of alcohol or narcotics - or because of the mental abnormality or state of the parents , it should be possible to provide care for the child under LAW .", "...", "The LAW is primarily aimed at enabling the social services to provide for the young person \u2019s need of care . It is the current need of care , and what can be done at the moment and in the future to see to it that this need is met , that will govern the measures taken by ORG . As I have pointed out in my general statement concerning this PERSON , this legislation can , however , not be used to provide for society \u2019s need for protection . It is a different matter that , in those instances where a young person needs to be taken into care according to this LAW , this measure will also have the effect of protecting society .", "ORG is to take appropriate measures as soon as it considers that a situation such as has been indicated in the second paragraph under points CARDINAL and CARDINAL arises . It may , for instance , have come to the knowledge of the ORG that a child is being exposed to unsuitable treatment or even to actual danger at home . During an inquiry the situation may appear to be such that the child ought to be provided with care outside his home . The ORG should then in the first place try to meet the need for care by reaching an understanding with the parents . In case the parents and the ORG can not reach an agreement as to the question of how the child should be cared for , the ORG must turn to ORG to obtain a decision on care under LAW , with an inherent authorisation permitting the ORG to make decisions regarding the way in which the care should be implemented . \"", "CARDINAL .

ORG If ORG found that the child \u2019s situation corresponded to that described in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it had , before resorting to care , to endeavour to remedy the matter by preventive measures ( f\u00f6rebyggande \u00e5tg\u00e4rder ) . These could consist of CARDINAL or more of the following steps : advice , material support , admonition or warning , orders pertaining to the child \u2019s living conditions , or supervision ( section CARDINAL ) . If such measures proved insufficient or were considered pointless , the ORG had to place the child in care ( section CARDINAL ) .", "However , a child had to be taken provisionally into care for investigation ( without the need for prior preventive measures ) if there was a probable cause for intervention under LAW and if there would otherwise be a risk of deterioration in his situation .
