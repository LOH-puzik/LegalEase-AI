On DATE the applicant asked ORG of GPE to order the return of PERSON from GPE to the GPE in accordance with LAW of DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG dissolved the marriage between the applicant and S. The court reserved the issue of ORG \u2019s custody , finding that it did not have jurisdiction over that issue pursuant to GPE Statutes \u00a7 DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG of GPE issued a certificate declaring PERSON \u2019s citizenship of GPE pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Citizenship Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Justice , acting in the applicant \u2019s interests , lodged a claim with LOC of Chernihiv ( \u201c the LOC \u201d ) , asserting that PERSON had been wrongfully retained in GPE and must be returned to the GPE in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that he had expected PERSON to return from GPE to the GPE on DATE ; however , PERSON changed her plans and decided to stay on with PERSON in GPE after that date . During the hearings the applicant stated that he was prepared to cover travel expenses for both the child and the mother if the latter were to be ordered to accompany the child to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . S. objected and submitted that it was the applicant who had asked her to stay in GPE with the child beyond DATE . In that regard PERSON stated that on DATE the applicant had sent her CARDINAL parcels from GPE containing all her and PERSON \u2019s personal belongings , including toys and clothes . The applicant also sent her PERSON \u2019s vaccination certificate for his admission to a child - care centre in GPE . In DATE , despite the divorce action initiated by the applicant in the GPE , GPE agreed to spend a holiday with him and their son in GPE , trying to restore good relations . She further submitted that the applicant had arrived in GPE in DATE and stayed for a considerable period of time but had not attempted to meet up with the child . S. therefore alleged that there was no factual child abduction or unlawful retention which would necessitate a return order under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG found that PERSON had arrived in GPE with both GPE agreement , but that later the mother had retained the child in GPE without the father \u2019s consent . The court found that such retention was wrongful within the meaning of LAW and that the child should be returned to the country of his habitual residence , the GPE . No exceptions under LAW applied . Given the applicant \u2019s verbal assurances , the court considered that there were no objective obstacles to the mother \u2019s accompanying the child to the GPE and resolving the custody dispute before the courts of that country . In the operative part of the decision , the court ordered that PERSON should be returned to ORG to the father \u2019s home address in GPE \u2012 specifying that the child should be accompanied on the journey by both parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Desnyansky ORG issued an additional decision stating that if the child were not returned voluntarily , S. would be ordered to transfer the child to the applicant at his home address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . S. appealed against those decisions , maintaining that there was no abduction or unlawful retention of the child and that , in any event , there were grounds to apply the exception provided by LAW b ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as regarded the risk of psychological harm to the child and his being placed in an intolerable situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and Youth of ORG issued a certificate stating their psychiatrist \u2019s opinion that PERSON was \u201c well settled in GPE and , having regard to the strong bond between the child and the mother and the need to avoid causing the child psychological trauma , it would be inappropriate to remove the child to the other place of residence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Appeal ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim as unsubstantiated . The court considered there was a grave risk that PERSON \u2019s return to the GPE would expose him to psychological harm or would otherwise place him in an intolerable situation , as provided in LAW ( b ) of LAW . In that regard ORG stated that PERSON was completely settled in his new environment , as he had been living in GPE since DATE . PERSON had always lived with the mother and there were close ties between them . There was no realistic possibility for the mother to accompany PERSON to the GPE and stay near him in that country . In addition , ORG noted that the applicant had not provided any information regarding his actual place of residence in the GPE , his current living conditions , or his level of income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE for ORG ( \u201c the Cassation Court \u201d ) quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and upheld the Desnyansky ORG decisions of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) , noting that they were well substantiated and had been adopted in compliance with the requirements of LAW . It found the submissions concerning the risk of exposing PERSON to psychological harm unconvincing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a writ of execution in respect of its decisions of DATE and DATE . On DATE PERSON \u2019s lawyer contacted ORG in GPE and enquired about applying for a GPE visa in the specific circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted enforcement proceedings , resulting in the imposition of fines on S. for failure to comply with the return order .", "CARDINAL . In DATE S. submitted a request to ORG for review of the case on the grounds that LAW had been applied divergently in the cassation proceedings , resulting in inconsistent judicial practice . On DATE ORG declared the request admissible and referred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered PERSON \u2019s request for review of ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the grounds of divergent application of the law by the cassation courts . Having examined the domestic judicial practice , ORG found that Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been applied divergently . It set out the principles which had to be followed when interpreting and applying those provisions . As regards the present case , ORG found that the domestic courts had failed to apply the provisions properly . In particular , there had been no clear stance on the question of whether or not the removal or retention of the child had been wrongful , and \u2012 if that were the case \u2012 at what moment it started to be wrongful , nor as to whether or not the father had consented to or subsequently acquiesced as regards the child \u2019s retention , nor whether facts existed demonstrating that the child was settled in his current environment . ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Cassation Court quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on the grounds that ORG had breached procedural rules and had failed to establish all the relevant facts . The case was remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that there was no dispute regarding removal of the child because the father had only complained about the wrongful retention of the child in GPE . ORG then considered the applicant \u2019s updated submissions , in which he no longer argued that the retention of the child had been wrongful as from DATE but rather as from DATE , which was the date when he had first expressed his disagreement with the child \u2019s retention in GPE . It was also established that in DATE the applicant had sent parcels to GPE containing the child \u2019s belongings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the period commencing on DATE , ORG considered that the applicant had continued to consent to the child \u2019s retention in GPE as there was no express objection on that point before the request was made under LAW . ORG found that on DATE the applicant \u2019s divorce claim was delivered to S. \u2019s representative . In that claim the applicant also sought to establish sole custody of the child ; however , that claim did not mean that the applicant disagreed with the child \u2019s ongoing stay in GPE . Moreover , in DATE , the applicant had spent DATE with PERSON in GPE and in DATE , after his return to the GPE , he had sent PERSON \u2019s vaccination certificate in order to facilitate PERSON \u2019s admission to a child - care centre in GPE . ORG concluded that in these circumstances the applicant enjoyed custody rights in relation to PERSON and that he had failed to demonstrate that those rights had been violated . For those reasons the child \u2019s retention in that period could not be considered wrongful within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG next stated that , even assuming that there had been a wrongful retention of the child , the return request could be rejected under the provisions of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG examined the evidence relating to the child \u2019s place of residence in GPE , and the social and medical care provided to him in GPE , and found that PERSON was assured of all the conditions necessary for his proper development . Based on the evidence presented and having regard to the overall period during which the child had lived in GPE , ORG found that PERSON was entirely settled in his current environment . It also considered that PERSON \u2019s return to the GPE without his mother \u2013 who no longer had legal basis for entering and living in the GPE \u2013 would not be in the best interests of the child . ORG therefore quashed the Desnyansky ORG decisions of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed appeals on points of law brought by the applicant and ORG and upheld the decision of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
