The applicant was born in DATE and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . During TIME there was a theft from an administrative building in the village of GPE , LOC . A fax machine , an electric kettle , a wristwatch and a desk clock were stolen . On DATE the authorities opened a criminal inquiry and arrested a Mr A. During his interview , from TIME , he admitted the theft and named the applicant as his accomplice . A search was carried out in the applicant 's house ; several compact discs , a radio receiver and a telephone set were seized .", "CARDINAL . It appears that at TIME on TIME the applicant was arrested at his home by CARDINAL officers from the GPE district police station in LOC . The applicant was taken to the police station and placed in the temporary detention centre . At an unspecified time on the same day Mr S. , an investigator with the GPE district police , notified the GPE district prosecutor of the applicant 's arrest . The notification had no reference number and no indication of TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at TIME on DATE he swallowed an open safety pin in order to protest against his allegedly unlawful arrest . He was taken to a public hospital for an X - ray examination , which confirmed the presence of a safety pin in his stomach . At TIME the applicant was brought back to the police station . Policemen stripped him down to his underwear and handcuffed both his hands to the bars in the lobby of the detention centre . At TIME he was given a chair . During TIME he was allowed to sleep on the floor . He remained handcuffed , was given some water and tea but no food . The applicant was interviewed by an investigator on TIME CARDINAL DATE . At TIME he felt sick and was examined by paramedics . At TIME the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , at TIME on DATE the applicant swallowed an open safety pin . After he had been examined at the hospital , he was brought back to the police station . He threatened to slit his veins . He was taken out of the cell , inspected and handcuffed with one hand to metal bars . He remained under the supervision of the on - duty officer . At TIME the applicant was given a mattress and bedding . The handcuffs were regularly moved from one hand to the other . The applicant was taken to a toilet , at his request , and was given water and tea . On TIME investigator PERSON interviewed the applicant . At or QUANTITY the applicant alleged that he felt sick because he had swallowed a razor blade . He was examined by paramedics , who found that the complaint was false .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr A. was interviewed again and stated that he had committed the theft alone . It does not appear that the applicant was subsequently prosecuted for the theft committed during TIME to CARDINAL DATE . It appears , however , that he was sentenced to a prison term in relation to other criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . As can be seen from an undated certificate issued by ORG of LOC , the arrested persons ' register and the arrest notification register for DATE did not contain any information that the applicant had been arrested DATE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant sued the GPE district police station for compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage caused by his allegedly unlawful detention and handcuffing on CARDINAL and DATE . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his claim . The applicant was neither present nor represented at the hearing . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment on the ground that the applicant 's attendance had not been secured , and remitted the matter for a fresh examination . ORG joined the resumed proceedings as a co - defendant .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim . On the basis of testimony by investigator PERSON , it found that the applicant had been lawfully detained from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE with a view to dispelling or confirming the suspicion of his involvement in the theft . ORG further found that the use of handcuffs had also been lawful and justified . In so finding , it took statements from witnesses : another detainee , PERSON , and CARDINAL on - duty officers , PERSON . and PERSON . They stated that the applicant had been verbally abusive and had shouted , banged at the door , incited to mass disorder and threatened to slit his veins with a razor blade . He had been handcuffed to prevent mass disorder and self - harm . While handcuffed , he had been given food and drink and a mattress to sleep on during the night , and had also been allowed to use the toilet . ORG found that the use of handcuffs from TIME on DATE to TIME on DATE had been compatible with the requirements of section CARDINAL of LAW for the prevention of mass disorder or attempts to inflict self - harm ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In ORG view , the application of handcuffs had not impaired the applicant 's rights , inflicted physical suffering or diminished his honour or dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . It noted that the applicant 's deprivation of liberty had been in compliance with NORP law and the Convention because he had been lawfully arrested for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offense .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE the applicant had asked the NORP regional prosecutor to open a criminal case against the police officers who had been allegedly responsible for his unlawful detention and handcuffing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr M. , an investigator with the GPE district prosecutor 's office , refused to institute criminal proceedings . He noted that the GPE district police station possessed no documents or records concerning the applicant 's arrest in DATE . He took a statement from investigator PERSON , who denied that he had ever detained the applicant as a suspect . On the strength of that evidence the investigator concluded that the applicant had not been arrested or detained at the police station from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE district prosecutor annulled Mr PERSON 's decision and asked his deputy , PERSON . , to resume the inquiry .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE PERSON . refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant 's allegations . He had not interviewed the applicant in person but instead quoted his statements to ORG . He had interviewed investigator PERSON , who had retracted his earlier statement and stated that he had apprehended the applicant as a suspect . A record of the arrest had been properly compiled , but after the applicant 's release , he had taken it away from the police station with a view to putting it in the file but had subsequently mislaid it . PERSON . also interviewed the director and deputy director of the temporary detention centre , who claimed that the record of the arrest had been properly drafted and that the handcuffs had been applied to prevent self - harm . CARDINAL on - duty officers testified in the same vein . Relying on those statements and the findings of ORG in the civil proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON . determined that the use of handcuffs had been lawful and justified .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld PERSON . 's decision by way of judicial review . It found that the inquiry had been thorough and complete and that sufficient evidence of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the applicant 's arrest and handcuffing had been collected . ORG took note of the certificate from the head of the district police station showing that the record of the arrest and the detention registers for DATE had been destroyed after DATE storage . ORG held in that connection that the \u201c documents had been wrongly destroyed before the expiry of the correct retention period \u201d but that there was no proof of malice on the part of the public officials . In ORG view , PERSON . had not been required to hear the applicant in person because he had set out his allegations in sufficient detail . Nor had he been required to examine further witnesses , including other detainees , because the statements by police officers had been sufficient . Lastly , ORG dismissed as insignificant the applicant 's argument that the use of handcuffs had not been recorded in any reports , as required by domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the applicant that the present application had been communicated to the respondent Government .
