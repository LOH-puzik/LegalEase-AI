He was born in DATE and lives in Bruck an der Leitha ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , and by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "PERSON , the applicant \u2019s cousin , owned real estate in former GPE . On DATE he made a will appointing his son PERSON his universal heir and the applicant his testamentary substitute . PERSON died on CARDINAL DATE . As his son did not acquire the estate , it became hereditas iacens ( a \u201c dormant \u201d inheritance ; le\u017e\u00edc\u00ed poz\u016fstalost ; ruhender ORG ) .", "The property was confiscated on DATE under President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "PERSON , PERSON widow , requested that the property be excluded from the confiscation , as her husband had been loyal to the NORP State during the NORP occupation . Her request was rejected by the ORG ( okresn\u00ed n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor ) on DATE . ORG ( zemsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor ) upheld this decision on DATE .", "On DATE PERSON died . As a result , the right to take over the hereditas iacens passed to the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a claim for restitution of the property which had been confiscated from PERSON .", "On DATE ORG ( okresn\u00ed pozemkov\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad ) held that the applicant was the owner of part of the property . It found that PERSON had died as an NORP national and that ORG ( ministerstvo zem\u011bd\u011blstv\u00ed ) had subsequently ordered the confiscation of his property under President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ORG decision stated that the confiscation proceedings had been held in respect of the hereditas iacens which had been considered under LAW CARDINAL as being formally possessed by the deceased person until acquired by an heir . ORG established that the confiscation could have been effective only after a final administrative decision had been taken and that the confiscation proceedings should have been held subsequent to the ex officio inheritance proceedings , in which the heirs could have lodged their inheritance applications in order to acquire the estate . It held that confiscation proceedings could not have been conducted against the hereditas iacens and that there had never been any proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s inheritance . It concluded , with reference to LAW , that the property had been transferred to the ORG unlawfully and that the applicant \u2019s property rights had been infringed during the period covered by that legislation .", "On DATE the ORG Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) , upon the defendant \u2019s appeal , quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to the administrative authority , on the ground that ORG had insufficiently established the facts of the case . The court considered , in particular , that ORG had failed to examine the date on which the confiscation of the property had taken place . That issue was relevant for establishing whether the applicant \u2019s case ought to be examined under LAW DATE . The court established that ORG legal opinion that the confiscation had been null and void was not supported by the evidence adduced . In ORG view , the confiscation proceedings ended with the former ORG decision of DATE , and thus fell outside the period laid down in CARDINAL of LAW . The court noted that the restitution requirements set out in section CARDINAL of LAW could be fulfilled , provided that the relevant chronological requirement was satisfied .", "The decision further stated that ORG had failed to establish whether any proprietary wrong had in fact been caused to the applicant and , if so , whether it had been caused within the relevant period . The court did not share ORG opinion that ( i ) the confiscation proceedings had been held by authorities which lacked power to deal with the case contrary to President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and that ( ii ) the final decision on confiscation had not become effective . The court further found , contrary to the view expressed by ORG , that the relevant provisions of LAW had not excluded confiscation of the hereditas iacens .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG found that the applicant was the owner of the other part of the property claimed by him . It held that the confiscation proceedings had been conducted against the deceased owner , and that under LAW CARDINAL the hereditas iacens had been considered as being in the possession of the testator until acquired by an heir . Accordingly , the confiscation of PERSON property had been null and void , and the ORG had acquired the property illegally . ORG concluded that the applicant had suffered a proprietary wrong within a period covered by LAW , and that his restitution claim fell within the scope of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that LAW .", "On DATE the ORG , upon the defendant \u2019s appeal , quashed this decision and remitted the case to ORG for further consideration . The court held that the main reasons for which the property of PERSON had been confiscated were that he had opted for NORP nationality and the NORP language as his mother tongue in DATE , that he had been active in associations having NORP professional or other interests , that he had acquired , on DATE , a NORP passport indicating that he was a NORP national , that he had become a member of a NORP political party ( Sudetendeutschen Partei ) on DATE , and that he had joined the NORP political party ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . The court established that the property had been transferred to the ORG by operation of President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on DATE , and that the subsequent decisions on confiscation had only had a declaratory character .", "The court found that the applicant \u2019s case fell outside the scope of LAW which covered exclusively the period DATE and DATE . It rejected ORG argument that the legislation in force in former GPE had not provided for the confiscation of the hereditas iacens . With reference to LAW and CARDINAL of the Civil Code CARDINAL , the court noted that the proprietary nature of inheritance rights allowed their confiscation pursuant to President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It also noted , with reference to a decision of ORG of DATE , that the hereditas iacens was to be understood as a legal person sui generis . The court added that PERSON had been represented by a guardian in the confiscation proceedings . The court finally stated that , even assuming that the confiscation could be deemed null and void , the ORG would have acquired the property without any legal title outside the relevant period prescribed by LAW , as the confiscation proceedings had terminated in DATE . It ordered ORG to examine whether PERSON satisfied the conditions for the restitution of property laid down in the Restitution Act DATE .", "The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) which was rejected as being premature by ORG ( GPE soud ) on DATE .", "On DATE ORG , after having joined the cases , decided that the applicant was not the owner of the estate . ORG , being bound by the judgments of the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ORG and the \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice Regional Court , held that the property had been confiscated lawfully and that the confiscation fell outside the relevant period specified in LAW . ORG also held that the original owner had not satisfied the conditions for the restitution of property fixed by LAW DATE as he had become a NORP citizen on DATE and had not re - acquired NORP citizenship . ORG stated that the applicant had neither acquired the estate from PERSON , as provided for in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , nor had they kinship as specified in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Act .", "On DATE ORG held that the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE was to be considered by ORG .", "On DATE the ORG upheld the administrative decision . In addition to the reasons set out therein , the court held that , pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of the Civil Code CARDINAL , an heir had acquired property upon a court decision and that an estate had been considered as being in the possession of the testator until delivered to an heir by a decision of a court of law . ORG also held that , since the inheritance in the form of a hereditas iacens was in general of a proprietary character , it could have been subject to confiscation under the President PERSON Decrees . The property in the form of a hereditas iacens was a legal person sui generis with legal capacity . As a result , it could have been confiscated after the original owner \u2019s death , provided that it had not yet been transferred to an heir in inheritance proceedings .", "On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given in ORG judgment of DATE , and referring to its decision no . II \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , rejected as being manifestly ill - founded the applicant \u2019s second constitutional appeal , in which he claimed a violation of his right to a fair hearing and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions .", "LAW governs , inter alia , the restitution of certain agricultural and other property defined in LAW which was assigned or transferred to the ORG or other legal persons DATE and DATE .

The applicants claimed a violation of their property rights , alleging that their father had been the principal heir and they had been his substitutes in succession .", "ORG stated that , pursuant to LAW , an heir had had the right either to accept or reject the hereditas iacens ; however , an hereditas iacens could only have passed to an heir by virtue of a court decision . It established that , as the hereditas iacens in question had not been considered by the national courts in inheritance proceedings , the GPE inheritance title to the property had been irrelevant for the purposes of the restitution proceedings .", "The court further stated that the property claimed had been confiscated pursuant to President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on DATE , and that the subsequent administrative decisions on confiscation had only been declaratory . It noted that the national courts had rightly applied the Restitution Act DATE instead of LAW on the facts of the case , as the former was a lex specialis .", "ORG concluded that only the owner of the confiscated property had to comply with the conditions for restitution of property laid down in LAW ( i.e. to show that he or she was a NORP citizen , that the property had been confiscated under President PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and that he or she was loyal to the NORP State and had acquired NORP citizenship ) .
