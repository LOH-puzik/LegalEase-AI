The applicants PERSON and PERSON , born in DATE and DATE respectively , are the children of PERSON ( born in DATE ) . The applicant PERSON , born in DATE , is the mother of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON died in ORG , GPE , GPE , whilst in the care of ORG GPE government as a convicted prisoner .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had a long history of intravenous heroin addiction and was asthmatic , for which she had been admitted to hospital on CARDINAL occasions during DATE .", "It is purported that PERSON had , prior to being imprisoned , told her mother , who now cares for her children PERSON and PERSON , that she wanted rehabilitation assistance to rid herself of the heroin addiction . She told her solicitor that she had tried to refer herself for help but that it was impossible to obtain appointments without inordinate delays .", "CARDINAL . After having been convicted of theft , PERSON was sentenced at ORG , on DATE , to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , despite an alternative proposal for a probation order with a condition that she be treated for her addiction . Thereafter , she was detained at FAC , GPE . She stated to her solicitor that she intended to use the period in custody as an opportunity to rid herself of her addiction to heroin .", "CARDINAL . At the health screening on her arrival at the prison on DATE , PERSON was noted as not seeming excessively withdrawn , depressed or anxious . She weighed QUANTITY . She complained of swelling to her left arm , withdrawal symptoms from her addiction and suffering from severe asthma especially when withdrawing , and was kept in the health - care centre pending an examination by a doctor . TIME , PERSON telephoned her mother complaining of her infected arm and asthma . During TIME , when she was observed to be wheezing , she was given an inhaler . She was also given paracetamol .", "CARDINAL . The prison medical records showed thereafter that she was complaining of withdrawal symptoms and that she was vomiting frequently . The records consisted of the continuous medical record , prescription and administration charts and the nursing assessment notes . Her blood pressure , temperature and pulse were checked DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was examined by PERSON , the prison senior medical officer , who prescribed antibiotics for her arm , inhalers for her asthma and medication , ORG , to appease the symptoms of heroin withdrawal . The nursing notes stated that she threw a cup of tea across the cell , was \u201c locked in for education \u201d and that during the night she was very loud and demanding . ORG was not administered at TIME . The applicants alleged that this was a punishment , while the Government submitted that it was on the instructions of the doctor due to a drop in PERSON blood pressure . The entries in the nursing notes show that PERSON was seen by a medical officer that TIME and the drugs record sheet , signed by PERSON , indicates that after a blood pressure reading of CARDINAL/CARDINAL the next dose of ORG was omitted at TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the record noted that she remained demanding . She had been told to clean her cell prior to education , which was a reference to the routine tidying - up of the cell and in accordance with normal practice . It was noted that she refused to comply . She was locked in during the education period and declined every meal . In the evening her weight was recorded as QUANTITY . It was noted that she had vomited during TIME and had complained of vomiting during TIME . She was encouraged to take fluids and given CARDINAL doses of a mild anti - nausea drug ( magnesium trisilicate ) by the nursing staff .", "CARDINAL . Her situation was reviewed by PERSON on DATE . As stated later in a statement to the coroner dated DATE , her medical readings ( temperature , pulse and blood pressure ) remained satisfactory . She did not appear dehydrated \u2013 it was noted that her tongue was moist and clean \u2013 but as she was still complaining of vomiting she was given an injection of anti - emetic medication . She complained of diarrhoea and stomach cramps to the nurse on duty during the night . A dose of magnesium trisilicate was given for nausea but it was recorded that this had little effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON called her mother in tears , complaining that despite having been given an injection , she could not stop vomiting and was getting no other medical support to assist her to come off drugs . She said that she was having to clean up her own vomit and thought she was going to die . The Government stated that there was a lavatory in her cell which she would have been able to reach and that the practice was for nursing staff to clean up if vomit landed on the floor or any other area . The only member of staff involved in the care of PERSON who remains with ORG and who is head of nursing care at the prison has informed the Government that a prisoner would not have been asked to clean up her own vomit and she has no recollection of PERSON being asked to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was recorded as keeping down a cup of tea and a glass of juice but was vomiting again during the afternoon and evening . At TIME she was found smoking in bed and when asked what the matter was , she replied \u201c nothing \u201d . DATE , she was found to be \u201c opiate positive \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The doctor examined her on DATE . She was given a further injection of medication to help with her symptoms . He found her general condition to be stable . In his statement of CARDINAL DATE he noted that , following the injection , she was able to keep down oral fluids during DATE , although she vomited again in the evening . The Government stated that the doctor checked her for signs of dehydration but did not find any . This was confirmed by PERSON evidence to the coroner . The notes stated that her tongue was moist and clean . In the case of a person who was severely dehydrated , he would have expected the person to be physically very weak and possibly bedridden , to have a fast pulse rate and low blood pressure and , on examination , the eyes would appear sunken , the tongue dry and cracked , the lips drawn and the skin drawn and thin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she continued to vomit and suffered from diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort . Her weight was recorded as QUANTITY . She ate nothing . The nursing notes recorded that she had had a better night . There was a reference : \u201c Continues to vomit on occasions ? hand down throat . \u201d The medical record stated that she had been observed with fingers down throat and vomit on her hand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE according to the nursing entries , there was no vomiting complained of or witnessed apart from twice at DATE . It was also recorded that she ate a small dinner and slept for long periods that night . There were no entries in the medical record on DATE . The doctor stated in his statement of DATE that on CARDINAL and DATE her temperature , pulse and blood pressure all remained within normal limits . Oral doses of anti - emetic drugs ( metoclopromide ) were prescribed to follow the injections , and administered on CARDINAL occasions DATE . In her evidence to the coroner , the head of nursing care stated that the drugs were not given on DATE as PERSON had stopped vomiting .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , at TIME on DATE , the following was noted in the continuous medical record :", "\u201c ... went to see inmate in cell , as she got out of bed she collapsed against me vomiting ( coffee ground ) . Laid on floor in recovery position and summoned help . Patient appeared unresponsive and appeared to be having a fit . Ambulance called ( CARDINAL ) . Regained consciousness , still vomiting , CARDINAL nurses helped her onto bed . Oxygen in situ . ECG taken . Unable to obtain pulse or ORG . Unable to gain PERSON access due to abscesses on arms and previous drug use . Next of kin rung at TIME at FAC request , unavailable , son to pass on message within TIME . Taken to hospital by ambulance . Ambulance arrived at TIME and left at TIME for ORG , GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lots of \u201c coffee - ground \u201d vomit ( altered blood in the stomach ) was recorded as being found on her bed . ORG medical records showed that she was admitted at TIME Her mother was informed around that time that PERSON was in hospital and that she was ill but had stabilised . She was recorded as being", "\u201c ... drowsy but movable and responsive . Staff nurse informed me that the white cell count was raised , with abnormal kidney and liver function ... possible diagnosis of ... drug abuse \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Her mother later learned from the nursing staff that on admission PERSON hair was matted with vomit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the following entry was recorded :", "\u201c Transferred to Ward CARDINAL ; Ward CARDINAL contacted in the middle of an emergency with her , arrested , but has been resuscitated ( sic ) and now is having a blood transfusion and an airway [ made ] ... \u201d", "At TIME :", "\u201c ... Ward CARDINAL contacted to ask if relatives have been informed of deterioration , they are with her now , they are going to reassess her in TIME and if no improvement turn off the ventilator . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The hospital informed the family that PERSON was in a critical condition and might have suffered brain damage due to the cardiac arrest . Her liver and kidneys were failing and they could not stabilise her . She was ventilated by hand as there were no beds in ORG ( ICU ) . The doctors said that they would stop the medication to see if she came round and breathed on her own and , if not , they would leave her . A NORP priest was called . The family was advised to say goodbye to PERSON and did . She then recovered a little and at TIME she was moved to FAC where there was an ICU bed available . She was stable on the ICU ward although she was kept on life support and was heavily sedated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , PERSON condition was recorded as stable but critical . At TIME she was given a very poor prognosis . By TIME on DATE , her condition had improved a little . She remained on a ventilator , although sedation had then been stopped . She made jerking movements at times and appeared to be waking up slowly . On TIME DATE , she opened her eyes and responded to light , although the brain scan did not reveal any activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was transferred to ORG to ORG and from there to Ward CARDINAL . It was recorded on DATE that although her eyes were open , she remained unresponsive and in a critical condition . On DATE her mother visited with the children . Her eyes were open but she appeared dark yellow in colour and making jerky movements associated with brain damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital advised the family to go to the hospital immediately . The prison medical record stated that PERSON died at TIME", "CARDINAL . The autopsy report , following the post - mortem examination of CARDINAL January DATE , noted that PERSON weighed QUANTITY . It stated that although one symptom of heroin withdrawal can be vomiting , the cause of the applicant \u2019s vomiting was never fully established . Episodes of severe vomiting could have caused a tear in the upper gastro - intestinal tract ( \u201c a PERSON tear \u201d ) though this would most likely have healed by the time she died . This was the most likely cause of haemorrhaging in the stomach which could result in coffee - ground vomiting . If she had lost a substantial amount of blood , rendering her anaemic , this could have triggered the cardiac arrest . The cardiac arrest precipitated hypoxic brain damage and multi - organ failure with an inevitably fatal outcome .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the coroner informed the family that an inquest would be held before a jury . At the inquest , which took place on DATE , evidence was given by PERSON , the prison doctor , PERSON , the head of nursing care at the prison , the forensic pathologist who carried out the post mortem , CARDINAL consultants from the PERSON and ORG who had been involved in treating PERSON and the third applicant , PERSON mother . The latter was represented during the proceedings by a solicitor who put questions to the witnesses on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . During the evidence it emerged that the scales used to weigh PERSON in prison were inaccurate and incompatible , those used on reception being QUANTITY out compared with those used subsequently in the health - care centre . Due to this discrepancy , PERSON explained that he placed greater importance on his clinical impressions of PERSON regarding any effect of possible weight loss , but was aware of the potential problem and had given instructions for her weight to be monitored . Notwithstanding that antibiotics had been prescribed for her septic arm , it was also indicated that these had not been given to her over DATE out of QUANTITY doses that she should have received over DATE , she received CARDINAL . The head of nursing care , PERSON , was unable to explain the omissions although she suggested that the nurse could have forgotten to sign the medicine card .", "CARDINAL . Both PERSON and PERSON gave evidence that PERSON did not give a clinical impression of being very ill during this period , stating that she was up and about and associating with others . PERSON stated that her symptoms had been diminishing and that given her blood pressure , temperature , pulse and her general condition , he had no concern that she was gravely ill or that there was any need to admit her to an outside hospital . It was revealed that PERSON did not work in the prison on DATE and was not present therefore on DATE before PERSON collapse . A part - time doctor attended on DATE TIME and the prison depended on calling a doctor on agency if required . This explained the lack of any record in the notes for DATE . Sister N. explained that the entry in the nursing notes on DATE which stated that PERSON had been \u201c locked in for education \u201d referred to the routine procedure whereby those prisoners not participating in the education class were detained in their cells during that period .", "CARDINAL . Evidence was also given by the CARDINAL consultants who treated PERSON in hospital , concerning her state on arrival and her subsequent deterioration . They were unable to say with any certainty what had caused her collapse or the bleeding in her stomach . PERSON considered that she was dehydrated on arrival at hospital but , due to her disturbed state , he was unable to put in a central line which would have allowed an accurate analysis to be made . Under questioning , he stated that the signs consistent with dehydration could also have been caused by fresh bleeding but not by one episode of coffee - ground vomiting .", "CARDINAL . In his summing - up to the jury , the coroner summarised the evidence as follows :", "\u201c ... for DATE PERSON was admitted in ORG ... she was then seen by the doctor , [ Dr PERSON ] , on DATE , on DATE . He examined her and made a note . She was still retained in ORG but as DATE proceeded , PERSON started to become unwell . You have heard evidence of the fact that she was a heroin abuser and it was known that if she was to withdraw from heroin she might develop some unpleasant symptoms ... those symptoms might manifest themselves for example with diarrhoea and vomiting , possible stomach cramps , depleted sleep patterns and the like and in fact the information that PERSON gave to her mother when she first rang rather gave you the impression that she knew that possibly she was to have a rough road ahead but she was prepared to put up with that .", "Certainly throughout DATE ... it is well - documented that PERSON was vomiting profusely . Although she was given medication for that on occasions it only worked for a very short time and it is fair to say that from DATE she was vomiting at some stage DATE . There was also reference to the fact that she had diarrhoea and she was generally unwell .", "Her nutritional state may well have been not all that it should have been and although drinks were available for her there was no means of monitoring how much liquid she was taking in . It was not possible to monitor whether she was actually drinking and vomiting it back or not drinking at all . There was no attempt at measuring fluid during the course of DATE and her vomiting actually progressed and on some occasions it was described as a lot of vomiting . It was referred to in the notes \u201c vomiting + + + \u201d which means rather a lot and although she was seen by nursing staff DATE and by the doctor on other occasions the medical staff at FAC were under the impression all along that PERSON was showing no signs of being dehydrated . In other words , she was not being depleted of fluids and [ Dr PERSON ] explained in his evidence his findings and the fact that he could see no real evidence that she was dehydrated at the time and felt that even with hindsight there was no necessity for her to be admitted into hospital .", "DATE after her admission to [ prison ] on TIME when she woke up ... she virtually collapsed in the presence of nursing staff and she vomited a large amount of ... coffee ground vomit ...", "There was some discussion during the evidence ... as to whether PERSON had actually had a cardiac arrest at that time . In fact all the doctors who subsequently examined her ... felt that that was not likely to have been the case , although there was certainly a collapse and although she may well have lost a fair amount of blood as a consequence of that . There was no evidence at that particular time that she had experienced a cardiac arrest .", "She was taken by ambulance to ORG ... where she was immediately placed under the care of PERSON ... His working diagnosis at the time was that PERSON may well have some degree of liver failure and that there could also be some ... bleeding from the upper gastro - intestinal tract , the oesophagus ... because of the fact that she had vomited the coffee ground vomit .", "The evidence of Dr PERSON , the Pathologist ... found some residual material in PERSON \u2019s stomach which could well have resembled blood or changed blood but ... was at pains to explain that she could find no source of any bleeding within PERSON \u2019s internal organs ... CARDINAL possible likely cause of the bleed that had produced itself in the coffee ground vomiting was that the retching which she had sustained ... might have caused a small tear either in her oesophagus at the point where it reaches the stomach or alternatively in the lining of the stomach itself ... that is a medical condition known as a PERSON tear but she could not find evidence of that . Her view was that possibly that small tear might well have healed by the time that she saw PERSON \u2019s body which was obviously by then DATE . That is the only explanation as to why there was any bleeding ... The significance of that bleed is appropriate because it is highly likely that as a consequence ... PERSON will have lost some volume of blood which will have meant that her heart might have had to work harder in order to overcome that and certainly when she was at ORG she was extremely unwell .", "PERSON was of the view that he felt that PERSON was in fact dehydrated but he could not prove that specifically because you will recall from PERSON evidence that it was not possible for him to insert a central line . Had he been able to do that then it might have been that could have been used as a diagnostic tool ... certainly PERSON was of the opinion that there would seem to be some suggestion that PERSON was dehydrated , notwithstanding , according to the medical staff at FAC , they felt that that was not the case as DATE had gone on .", "On TIME DATE ... unfortunately PERSON experienced a cardiac arrest and it was felt that as a consequence of that she had become deprived of oxygen and ... there would have been a deprivation of oxygen to her brain which would have caused her to sustain what was called hypoxic brain damage .", "... The post - mortem evidence ... explained the cause of death and PERSON was able to confirm that the cause of death was hypoxic brain damage , deprivation of oxygen to the brain , caused by a cardiac arrest which PERSON felt was as a consequence of an upper gastro - intestinal haemorrhage of an undetermined cause ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The coroner invited the jury to return a verdict of death through natural causes or an open verdict . The jury unanimously returned an open verdict .", "CARDINAL . Legal aid was granted to the CARDINAL applicants to pursue domestic remedies for compensation . Their solicitors sent a notice of issue , under cover of a letter dated DATE , to the ORG Solicitor requesting disclosure of medical and prison records in view of a claim for damages with respect to the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated DATE , the doctor consulted by the applicants stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c It is my understanding that repeated vomiting can be a symptom of heroin withdrawal and while I have no personal experience in managing people undergoing a detoxification programme , I would , however , be very unhappy about managing anyone who was vomiting repeatedly , without the use of intravenous fluids , the intravenous administration of anti - emetic drugs and the facility to monitor blood chemistry frequently .", "... PERSON was severely under weight .", "Her poor overall nutritional state was almost certainly longstanding and probably connected to her heroin addiction but any prolonged bout of vomiting , from whatever cause , was likely to cause a serious imbalance of her blood chemistry very quickly . Apart from electrolyte disturbance and dehydration , she would be very likely to have had difficulty maintaining an adequate blood sugar level , as she would have had no reserves in the form of stored carbohydrate substances within the body , that could have been utilised , when she was unable to absorb adequate nutrients from her gastrointestinal system due to her persistent vomiting .", "In such circumstances a vicious circle can occur . A low blood sugar level itself can cause more nausea and vomiting . Multiple metabolic pathways can be interfered with . The subject can become irritable . The level of consciousness may be severely reduced and coma can even occur .", "Intravenous access is often very difficult in intravenous drug abusers , even for clinicians such as anaesthetists who routinely insert needles . Central lines are likely to be needed . These are special long catheters , often with CARDINAL lumen , that are inserted into major blood vessels close to the heart . I would not expect the average prison medical officer to be proficient in inserting such a line .", "It is preferable for these lines to be inserted in hospital , by personnel with the necessary skills . After insertion , the correct positioning ... needs to be checked by ORG before it is used to administer drugs and fluids . Once inserted their maintenance requires skilled , aseptic nursing care ...", "I would be inclined to attribute the agitation and apparent lack of cooperation displayed by PERSON after her admission ... and before her second collapse to cerebral irritation . Cerebral irritation is often seen following a period of cerebral hypoxia . Certainly , a degree of cerebral hypoxia probably occurred at the time of her collapse [ in prison ] and continued up to the time that resuscitation was underway at PERSON ...", "The bleeding that occurred , following a period of persistent and violent vomiting , could certainly have been caused by a PERSON tear as suggested ... in the autopsy report .", "If PERSON had been admitted to hospital earlier , it might still have proved difficult to control the vomiting and , in view of her poor general and nutritional state , if the cause of her bleeding was a PERSON tear , this might still have occurred , but she would not have had such a degree of dehydration and/or biochemical disturbance , and the consequences of such an occurrence would probably have been less serious .", "Alternatively , if her vomiting had been brought under control at an earlier stage , the subsequent sad sequence of events might have been prevented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his opinion of DATE , counsel advised the applicants in the light of this medical report that there was insufficient evidence to establish the necessary causal link between PERSON death and the allegedly negligent care afforded to her in custody . They did not pursue their claims in negligence .", "CARDINAL . A person who suffers injury , physical or psychiatric , in consequence of the negligence of another may bring an action for damages for that injury . An exacerbation of an existing condition constitutes such injury . Upset and injury to feelings resulting from negligence in the absence of physical or psychiatric damage or exacerbation , do not entitle a plaintiff to damages . Any personal injury action maintainable by a living person survives for the benefit of his estate and may be pursued after his death .", "CARDINAL . Claims arising from the death of an individual caused by negligence are brought under LAW DATE or LAW ( LAW DATE . The former enables those who were financially dependent upon the deceased to recover damages for the loss of dependency . The scheme of the CARDINAL Act is compensatory and save for the sum of MONEY for bereavement to the spouse of a deceased or parent of a deceased child under CARDINAL at the time of death , damages are awarded to reflect the loss of support . The latter enables damages to be recovered on behalf of the deceased \u2019s estate and may include any right of action vested in the deceased at the time of his death together with funeral expenses ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
