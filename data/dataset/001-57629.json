It is therefore of little importance that the matter which was to be kept confidential was known to a limited or indefinite number of people because confidentiality had already been breached by a third party or by the same person .", "The actus reus of the offence punishable under LAW is therefore made out .

LAW ORG ) is therefore not applicable to the disclosure that the first complaint had been lodged , because this was punishable as defamation , or to the disclosure that the second complaint had been lodged , because no investigation was commenced . The decision is therefore well - founded on that point .", "The disclosure of the challenge is not information about an investigation . The challenge is not the purpose of the investigation , and the disclosure that such a challenge has been made says nothing about the purpose of the investigation , its content or its results . It remains true , on the other hand , that the existence of such an investigation is disclosed ; but such a disclosure is not punishable under LAW ORG , since it was punishable as defamation .", "The disclosure of the orders for production and sequestration of the accounts in the file does amount to information about an investigation .", "It remains to be considered whether one can talk of disclosure , given that the matters had already been made public at an earlier press conference .", "...", "LAW ORG , which is designed also - and even primarily - to protect the public interest in ensuring that investigations take place in the best possible conditions , prohibits parties from communicating information from the file ; it is therefore sufficient that the matters should be confidential in nature , without necessarily still being confidential ; communication of matters of a confidential nature to someone who knows them already as a result of an earlier indiscretion is therefore a punishable offence . Furthermore , the applicant can not rely on common knowledge when that knowledge is due to an earlier disclosure that he himself has made .", "The appellant was therefore rightly convicted .", "... \"", "Finally , ORG set aside of its own motion the entry of the fine in the cantonal register . It noted that under GPE law and notwithstanding that they were convertible DATE of imprisonment ( arr\u00eats ) , the fines for \" procedural offences \" , such as breaching the confidentiality of a judicial investigation , were disciplinary in nature , since they were designed to ensure that the investigation proceeded normally . On this point cantonal law differed from federal law .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON lodged a public - law appeal with ORG . He relied on ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . In his view , LAW ) applied because of the criminal nature of the fine , which under LAW DATE was convertible into a custodial sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted in particular :", "\" ...", "CARDINAL . The applicant ... maintained that LAW ) violates in the abstract , and in the alternative in the specific case , freedom of expression as secured in federal constitutional law and in LAW ) of LAW ( ECHR ) . In so doing , he overlooked that it may be legitimate in the public interest to impose certain restrictions on the exercise of that fundamental right ... LAW ( article LAW ) in fine ORG , moreover , provides expressly that such restrictions are permissible where they are necessary in a NORP society , in particular for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . The rule enacted in LAW ORG clearly conforms to these principles . A weighing of the competing interests at stake leads to the same conclusions . While it may indeed be readily appreciated that the applicant had grounds for rebelling against the sometimes unorthodox course taken by the proceedings against him , it must not be forgotten that the usual remedies were open to him ; and , indeed , on a number of occasions he successfully availed himself of them . His interest in expressing his views on this matter in public and the public \u2019s interest in being informed by this means can not outweigh the interest in ensuring that the judicial system can function as smoothly and impartially as possible . The prohibition against communicating information about an investigation until its completion and the penalties attaching to the offence are undoubtedly consistent with the proportionality principle . Consideration of whether the impugned interference was founded on sufficient reasons which rendered it necessary in a NORP society , having regard to all the public - interest aspects of the case ( ORG , DATE ORG case , Series A no . CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL ) leads inevitably to the conclusion - particularly if the interests at stake in the DATE ORG case previously cited and in the applicant \u2019s case are compared - that there was no violation of freedom of expression .", "...", "In the instant case the appellant was liable to a fine not exceeding MONEY ( LAW ) and was fined MONEY . Under GPE law , such a penalty typically comes within the sphere of rules of conduct to be observed during proceedings . That is not decisive , however , according to the NORP institutions .", "Such rules are generally directed primarily at barristers , and in that instance their disciplinary nature is not in doubt ; the parties to criminal proceedings , however , may also be subject to certain disciplinary rules . Admittedly , it has to be recognised that the measure taken against the appellant could have been based on a combination of LAW , which lays down that judicial investigations shall be confidential , and LAW ) , which provides that anyone who makes public any proceedings in a judicial investigation or deliberations by an authority which are secret by law shall be punishable with imprisonment or a fine . In that event the application of LAW would have justified an application of LAW ( article DATE ) ORG . This was not the case , however , and it was on the basis of a cantonal rule of procedure that the appellant suffered a penalty whose disciplinary or criminal nature can be determined only by assessing the degree of its severity .", "The appellant showed , aptly enough , that such a fine was convertible into CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment under LAW on the recovery of fines and their conversion into imprisonment . That procedure indeed leaves the authorities only a very limited discretion and at all events does not enable them to comply retrospectively with the requirements of LAW . The appellant overlooks , however , that LAW , second sub - paragraph , of LAW ( SCC ) enables the judge to rule out conversion where the person convicted has proved that , through no fault of his own , he is unable to pay the fine . In view of the foregoing , the possibility of a custodial sentence could not make the penalty imposed in the instant case a criminal one .", "Ultimately , while the fine imposed in the instant case was not a negligible one , it nonetheless came into the category of penalties which by their nature , duration or manner of execution are deemed not to be appreciably detrimental . The possibility of conversion into a custodial sentence makes no difference , since conversion is possible only in the event of the appellant \u2019s refusing to pay the fine out of sheer unwillingness . The safeguards provided for in LAW ( article DATE ) ORG were therefore not applicable in the instant case . \"", "The applicant paid the fine in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It is therefore not a LAW concept which should be construed according to the principle of reasonable expectation , that is to say in the meaning which the other signatory GPE might and should in good faith give it , or directly under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW of CARDINAL DATE , which GPE has not yet ratified . A reservation made when ratifying a treaty is a unilateral declaration which must in general be interpreted by reference to the domestic law of the ORG which has adopted it , like a provision in a statute or regulation .", "In the case of a reservation , an interpretation in accordance with the will of the declaring ORG makes it possible to take into account the real purpose of the reservation , whose justification lies precisely in the special features of national law ...", "That being so , regard should be had to the meaning which ORG and ORG intended giving to the expression \u2018 administrative authority\u2019 . While ORG accepted the reservation without discussion or comment , ORG gave the following particulars in its DATE Communication ( ORG [ ORG ] DATE II p. CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "\u2018 ... In GPE , as was pointed out above , the administrative authorities may have to determine private - law disputes and impose penalties in the way that a criminal court would .
