In DATE , PERSON became involved in commercial disputes . In DATE PERSON solicitors were retained in relation to those disputes . However , ORG fees were not settled in full by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON commenced legal proceedings against PERSON in FAC of ORG ( the first - instance civil court in GPE in respect of claims over a certain value ) for payment of MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) in respect of fees relating to a dispute against ORG former accountants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Arakin issued a counterclaim alleging professional misconduct and negligence . It sought ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The dispute gave rise to CARDINAL sets of overlapping proceedings . First , the proceedings to establish ORG fees , which ran from DATE to DATE ( in this the courts were assisted by the auditor for taxation , an expert officer of ORG who advises the court on disputes concerning legal fees ) ; second , proceedings in respect of PERSON \u2019s allegations of fraud against ORG running from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ; third , proceedings concerning the principal claim and counterclaim which ran from DATE to DATE ; and fourth , proceedings settling the overall costs of the case ( excluding the fraud proceedings ) which ran from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered a detailed account of the fees owed to be produced to the auditor for taxation , in order for the amount of the fees due in respect of the litigation in question to be determined .", "CARDINAL . By DATE all accounts had been lodged with the auditor . On DATE the taxation hearing began before the auditor . It lasted DATE . On DATE the auditor issued his reports .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties objected and from DATE ORG which was responsible for overseeing the taxation proceedings , held a number of hearings to settle the procedure and deal with the notes on objections , and also to hold a preliminary debate in the claim and counterclaim ( the third proceedings ) . Some hearings were discharged at FAC request . The court however refused PERSON \u2019s request to stay the case .", "CARDINAL . The auditor issued his report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By DATE ORG then solicitors had ceased acting for it . In DATE PERSON \u2019s new solicitors withdrew from acting . From that time onwards PERSON had no legal representation . The applicant sought to appear at hearings in DATE , on ORG behalf .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently applied for summary decree in the counterclaim and dismissal of the principal action . This was dismissed as incompetent on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , ORG sought to regulate the procedure in relation to the notes of objection lodged by both parties in respect of the accounts and dealt with other motions lodged by the applicant . It held a number of hearings .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , no further progress could be made on the notes of objections until the allegations of fraud had been determined ( the \u201c second proceedings \u201d ; see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . In the course of DATE and DATE , the court heard various incidental motions by the applicant who increased the sum sought in the counterclaim to ORG CARDINAL . He also renewed motions which had previously been refused .", "CARDINAL . The allegations of fraud made by the applicant having been determined , ORG on DATE ordered a DATE hearing on the notes of objections for DATE , which finally concluded on CARDINAL DATE . In total , around CARDINAL objections had been made , of which , CARDINAL were lodged by PERSON and the remainder by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a judgment on the notes of objections , running to CARDINAL paragraphs . PERSON appealed . On DATE the Inner House ordered that there should be a hearing on DATE .

On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment , finally determining all questions relating to the valuation of the accounts . The taxation proceeding were therefore at an end .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime in DATE , the applicant made allegations about the authenticity of the court papers , which developed into allegations of fraud against PERSON and their solicitors . Hearings took place before FAC DATE . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to lodge , by DATE , particulars of his allegations . On DATE it directed that the case be heard on DATE . On DATE , having regard to further allegations made by the applicant , it ordered that he lodge details of these allegations within DATE . On DATE , a factual hearing on the allegations was fixed for DATE . This hearing lasted DATE but was ultimately insufficient .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the court repeatedly attempted to fix hearing dates that the applicant did not accept ; the case was finally heard in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court issued an opinion rejecting the applicant \u2019s allegations in their entirety . It concluded , inter alia , that none of the allegations were well - founded ; that the applicant had made representations which he knew or ought to have known were incorrect ; that the hearing had taken an inordinate length of time because the applicant had persistently resorted to irrelevant lines of inquiry and had been disorganised in his presentation ; that the hearing had been used as a vehicle to air grievances going beyond its scope and to advance the applicant \u2019s interests in other litigation ; that the applicant \u2019s approach had been reckless ; and that he had had no reasonable grounds for his asserted belief in the truth of the allegations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal the decision to ORG of ORG . On DATE the ORG dismissed the application to appeal as incompetent since leave had not been obtained from ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG awarded costs against the applicant at a punitive rate in light of his conduct . The court also ordered that their payment was a condition to proceed with the counterclaim . DATE the amounts remained unpaid and the matter proceeded on the basis that the only issues to try were contained in the principal claim .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant paid the amounts to which the order of CARDINAL DATE referred .", "CARDINAL . Following the conclusion of the taxation proceedings , the ORG heard the parties on several occasions DATE and DATE to determine future procedure and finally listed an eightday hearing of legal issues to commence on DATE . By the time of the hearing the applicant sought over GBP CARDINAL in his counterclaim . On DATE , after an DATE hearing , the court reserved judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered its opinion . It noted that ORG claim was a simple one , namely an action for payment of a debt . The applicant \u2019s position , it said , was \u201c a great deal more complicated \u201d . Despite lengthy written pleadings , the court had found it \u201c difficult to determine the precise factual background \u201d upon which he relied . Turning first to his defences to the principal claim , the court rejected all except CARDINAL , namely the applicant \u2019s argument that he had paid the fees due in full . This , the court said , was a matter for evidence appropriate for the subsequent factual hearing .", "CARDINAL . As to the counterclaim , after a careful examination of the applicant \u2019s evidence , the court held that it was an \u201c abuse of process \u201d . It noted that very grave allegations had been made but that the applicant had produced no expert opinion to support them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision . DATE and DATE the ORG dealt with various procedural aspects of the appeal . On DATE the Inner ORG heard the appeal and refused it . The case was remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG heard both parties and fixed a hearing on the facts . On DATE that hearing took place . A day was set aside for further argument and the parties lodged detailed notes of arguments , the applicant \u2019s running to CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court handed down its judgment . It noted that ORG case was \u201c straightforward and cogent \u201d but that it had been \u201c very difficult to discern the defence to the action \u201d . The applicant had repeated \u201c scurrilous allegations \u201d against partners in PERSON and the witnesses he had led had been of no assistance in determining the question before the court . The court also commented that the applicant had sought to revisit many points which had already been decided . It found in favour of PERSON in the principal claim and held that the applicant was liable in the sum of GBP GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE the Inner ORG found the appeal suitable for urgent disposal . A hearing took place on CARDINAL and DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It commented that it \u201c had not found it easy to understand the arguments which [ the applicant ] sought to advance \u201d . It further noted :", "\u201c Throughout the course of this protracted litigation PERSON has sought to revisit arguments and allegations which have not found favour with the court on previous occasions ...", "Many of the issues which PERSON has sought to argue before us can not be argued competently before us now . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It held that it was not open to it to revisit the various decisions it had made previously concerning aspects of the litigation in the context of interim appeals . This brought to an end the substantive issues in the litigation .", "CARDINAL . The only remaining issue was costs . PERSON applied for its costs and the applicant lodged various applications . ORG listed a hearing to take place on DATE . However , the applicant contacted the court stating he was unwell , so it was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE . He then told the court he was on DATE on DATE . The court found this an inadequate reason for non - attendance and maintained the date .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appear at the hearing on DATE . ORG granted a further DATE adjournment in order to allow the applicant a \u201c final opportunity to appear \u201d . The clerk of court and ORG solicitors sought to bring the hearing , which had been re - listed for CARDINAL DATE , to the applicant \u2019s attention by e - mail , telephone and by personal attendance at the applicant \u2019s home address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant did not appear and the hearing proceeded in his absence . The judge found in favour of PERSON on the issue of expenses at an enhanced , punitive rate of expenses in light of the applicant \u2019s conduct . The court commented :", "\u201c When this action was first raised in DATE , it appeared to be in short compass . The pursuer sought payment from the defender of its outstanding professional fees . It was therefore a simple action for recovery of a debt . Since then , PERSON has introduced a great many factual and legal issues , which have been exhaustively examined over many hearings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In relation to the applicant \u2019s conduct he found that it had been :", "\u201c ... unreasonable and incompetent . He has thereby caused the pursuer unnecessary expense ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It also awarded an additional fee to PERSON to reflect the \u201c huge amount \u201d of correspondence and documents sent to ORG solicitors by the applicant , much of which was irrelevant , the complexity of the proceedings , having regard to the \u201c number , difficulty and novelty of the questions raised \u201d , the skill time , labour and specialist knowledge required of the solicitors and the accusations of deception , incompetence and bad faith levelled against individual solicitors at ORG . It rejected a number of motions lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and lodged a number of documents . The appeal was refused on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was found \u201c liable in the expenses \u201d ( that is , liable for the costs ) of that appeal . His various motions were dismissed . ORG again noted that the applicant had sought to reopen issues already determined and continued to express his dissatisfaction with the court \u2019s substantive decisions .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE the Lord Advocate ( the chief legal officer of ORG ) applied to have the applicant declared a vexatious litigant . He relied on CARDINAL sets of proceedings , including the ORG litigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared the applicant a vexatious litigant but excluded the ORG litigation from the order . It referred to the applicant \u2019s ill - founded allegations about lack of authenticity of documents which it said were a \u201c serious abuse of process \u201d . In coming to this conclusion it also took into account the finding that he had used a proof in the ORG litigation for collateral purposes . Moreover , he had wasted time because of his disorganisation and persistent pursuit of irrelevant matters in that litigation . It noted that the applicant had accepted that his lack of legal expertise had caused delay in the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
