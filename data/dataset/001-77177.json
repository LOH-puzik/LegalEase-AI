The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having carried out a robbery of a petrol station in GPE . On DATE he admitted being responsible for the robbery . He was charged at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the applicant made his first appearance in the GPE court , where he instructed his solicitors to make an application for release on bail . The police officer gave evidence to the court stating that the robbery was not connected with terrorism and that , subject to the proper conditions , he would have no objection to bail . The sitting resident magistrate refused the application , indicating that the offence was a scheduled offence and that he therefore did not have the power to order release ( section GPE ) of LAW and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of GPE ( Emergency LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for bail . On DATE the High Court heard and granted his application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty in ORG to an offence of robbery and was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 detention in a young offenders\u2019 institution , followed by DATE of probation .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant made an application for judicial review , seeking a declaration of incompatibility of the legislation cited above with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . Mr PERSON held :", "\u201c There is nothing in the text of LAW nor in the jurisprudence of ECtHR which requires that the court before which an arrested person must be brought should be the same court that has power to grant him bail . He must be brought promptly before a court or an officer authorised to exercise judicial power . He must also have the opportunity to apply for bail . It is not necessarily the case , however , that these CARDINAL separate and distinct rights require to be vindicated at the same time or in the same forum . Provided that the arrested person is brought promptly before a court that has power to review the lawfulness of his detention and that he has the opportunity to apply without undue delay for release pending his trial , the requirements of LAW are met .", "The applicant was brought before the GPE court promptly DATE within TIME of his arrest . His appearance before the magistrate was automatic and did not depend on any initiative from the applicant . Moreover , the resident magistrate was empowered to review the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention ... Here the magistrate can review the legal basis on which the arrested person is detained . He must be satisfied that the arrest and continued detention are lawful . If he is not so satisfied , he must order the release of the person detained . The applicant in the present case was therefore entitled to a prompt automatic examination by a competent judicial officer of the legal basis of his arrest and continued detention . He was moreover entitled to \u2013 and did obtain \u2013 a prompt examination by a judge of his right to release on bail . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also rejected the arguments under LAW that accused members of the security forces were treated more favourably concerning bail than other accused persons and refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG , but certified as points of law of general public importance whether the legislation was compatible with the LAW and whether LAW required that the court before whom an accused person was brought pursuant to LAW should have the power to admit him to bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE leave to appeal was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( which came into force on DATE ) is substantially the same as section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE ( in force at the time of the applicant \u2019s appearance ) , and provides :", "\u201c Subject to subsections ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , a person to whom this section applies shall not be admitted to bail except \u2013", "( a ) by a judge of ORG or ORG , or", "( b ) by the judge of the court of trial on adjourning the trial of a person charged with a scheduled offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The sole jurisdiction of ORG , ORG and trial judge to grant bail in the case of scheduled offences dates from DATE and is based on the original provisions of GPE ( Emergency LAW DATE . The rationale derives from ORG ( \u201c Report of the Commission to consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in GPE \u201d ( QUANTITY . DATE ) ) , which concluded that resident magistrates who heard bail applications were particularly susceptible to threats and intimidation ( at the relevant time one had been shot and the homes of CARDINAL others bombed ) . LAW provides for the position to be DATE reviewed by ORG . DATE reports on the working of the legislation are laid before ORG for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . In the DATE report of ORG , PERSON of Berriew ORG recommended the return of bail applications to the GPE court , noting that the requirement for all applications in scheduled offences to go before ORG led in practice to some defendants spending DATE in custody and that a significant proportion of cases were ultimately not proceeded with , or defendants were acquitted or given non - custodial sentences . He recommended that the power be given to a small number of specially trained magistrates . However , in his DATE report , he noted a continuing danger from sophisticated terrorist crime and numerous serious criminal offences with a strong terrorist link , with syndicated crime having a paramilitary connection increasing and significant levels of intimidation remaining . In considering whether or not to give resident magistrates the power to deal with bail applications , he did not repeat his earlier recommendation , observing that the security assessment was that there would be a significant threat of intimidation and violence towards them and those close to them . He did , however , agree that bail hearings should be available at the weekends and this change was brought into force immediately .", "CARDINAL . Robbery , in so far as it involves any explosive , firearm , imitation firearm or weapon of offence , is specified in paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of schedule CARDINAL to LAW CARDINAL as a scheduled offence .", "CARDINAL . This was set out in the Rules of ORG ( GPE ) Order CARDINAL , supplemented by Practice Direction DATE no . CARDINAL . This provided for ORG to sit DATE except DATE and DATE for the purpose , inter alia , of hearing bail applications . The Practice Direction instituted a deadline for papers to be lodged by TIME on DATE before bail applications were heard . From DATE , the deadline was moved to TIME and the office adopted the practice of accepting faxed applications . A bail judge would also consider admitting a late application in a genuinely exceptional case .", "CARDINAL .
