In a letter of DATE the GPE district public prosecutor 's office informed LOC police station and FAC that the applicant had to be recalled to prison to serve the outstanding part of his sentence in case no . CARDINAL . The reasoning of the district public prosecutor 's office was that the period during which the applicant had been serving his sentence of imprisonment in case no .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . In its reasoning , it stated :", "\u201c Correctly ... the prosecutor from the GPE district public prosecutor 's office took into account the period of the remand in custody of the [ applicant ] in case no . CARDINAL ... [ as being ] only from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , because subsequently he had started to serve a sentence of ' imprisonment ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on an unspecified date the applicant requested ORG to interpret , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , its judgment of DATE in case no . CARDINAL . He argued , inter alia , that he had been remanded in custody during the whole period DATE and DATE . He further maintained that this period of DATE , DATE and DATE plus the sentence of DATE imprisonment in case no . CARDINAL , which the applicant had already served , meant that he had effectively served the whole sentence of DATE and DATE imprisonment in case no . CARDINAL . The public prosecutor 's office meanwhile , apparently relying on a report prepared by FAC that the applicant 's remand in custody in case no . CARDINAL had been suspended on DATE , considered , inter alia , that the applicant still had to serve DATE of the sentence imposed by the court in case no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held in the presence of all the parties on DATE . In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for interpretation of the judgment of DATE as it considered it to be clear . It found , inter alia , that its judgment quite unequivocally indicated that the whole period of the applicant 's remand in custody DATE and DATE should be deducted from his sentence of DATE and DATE imprisonment . In this respect it stated the following :", "\u201c Accordingly , the will of the court is to deduct THE WHOLE OF THE ABOVE STATED PERIOD [ emphasis added by ORG ] , i.e. the period during which the measure for securing the [ applicant 's ] appearance before the court in the present case was a ' remand in custody ' , and not [ just ] a part thereof . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that it was not competent to rule on the lawfulness of the decision of the public prosecutor 's office to seek execution of the part of the sentence it claimed was still outstanding .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE after serving the remaining part of the sentence which the public prosecutor 's office had alleged was outstanding in case no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action under the ORG and ORG DATE ( the \u201c ORG \u201d , which was renamed in DATE ) against the public prosecutor 's office and ORG .", "CARDINAL . He contended that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty since CARDINAL DATE because he had had no outstanding prison term to serve . He sought compensation for the non - pecuniary damage he had allegedly suffered as a result .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG established , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ... the [ applicant ] was remanded in custody in case no . CARDINAL from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . From DATE to DATE [ he ] served his sentence in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... This sentence can not , by virtue of ORG CARDINAL of LAW , be combined [ with the other sentences ] and it was served separately . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the [ applicant ] served his sentence in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . This sentence was combined with the sentence in case no . CARDINAL and therefore under LAW of LAW the [ trial ] court when delivering its judgment in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL should have deducted the whole period of the sentence [ which had been ] served . It should [ also ] have deducted the whole period of the remand in custody from DATE to CARDINAL DATE on the basis of LAW of LAW . These CARDINAL periods amount to DATE , DATE and DATE . When the [ trial ] court wrote in its judgment that it was deducting the time during which [ the applicant ] had been detained , calculated from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , it in practice wrongly included the time during which he had been serving his sentence [ in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] DATE from DATE to DATE . [ Accordingly , ] from the sentence of DATE [ the trial court ] deducted DATE , being the period DATE and DATE and it [ thereby ] transpired that the [ applicant ] had no time left to serve . The [ trial ] court made this mistake in spite [ of the fact that ] the case file contained information from FAC [ detailing ] the periods served by the [ applicant ] . In its decision [ of CARDINAL DATE ] dismissing the request to interpret its judgment , the [ trial ] court stated that its intention had been to deduct the whole period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , i.e. the period during which the [ applicant ] was remanded in custody and not [ just ] a part thereof . This shows that the [ trial ] court was misguided [ in thinking ] that [ the applicant was remanded in custody in case no . CARDINAL throughout ] this entire period . Thus , with this judgment , DATE of the [ applicant 's ] sentence was pardoned , because DATE should have been deducted . In spite of this , the public prosecutor 's office did not appeal against the judgment and it became final ... After [ the judgment ] became final , it became binding on the public prosecutor 's office under LAW of the [ ORG ] which should have implemented it instead of attempting to correct the [ existing ] mistake by interpreting the intention of the [ trial ] court . In the period DATE and DATE , including from CARDINAL DATE to DATE , the date the present action was brought , the [ applicant ] unlawfully served a sentence of imprisonment , which if the mistake had not been made he [ would ] have served lawfully . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In spite of the above conclusion , ORG found that the applicant had failed to prove conclusively that he had suffered any nonpecuniary damage as a result of having been deprived of his liberty DATE and DATE . It therefore dismissed his action and ordered him to pay the resulting court fees . The applicant appealed against that judgment on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and upheld the lower court 's findings . The reasons for its decision were , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c Irrespective of the wrongful deduction of the time during which the [ applicant ] was serving his sentence ... in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , when sentencing the applicant to DATE and DATE imprisonment the [ trial ] court deducted DATE , DATE and DATE . This was the period DATE and DATE . The remaining [ period ] was DATE and DATE , which the applicant had to serve in view of the delivered final judgment ... in case no . CARDINAL of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a cassation appeal on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and upheld the lower courts ' findings . In its reasoning , it indicated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c In the reasons [ for its decision of DATE , ORG ] stated that the intention of the [ trial ] court had been to deduct from the so determined combined sentence the period during which the [ applicant ] was remanded in custody . With this clarification it became clearer what the intention of the [ trial ] court had been . The GPE public prosecutor 's office made a justified assessment that the period stated in the judgment to be deducted , namely from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , included a period of DATE when the [ applicant ] served a sentence of ' deprivation of liberty ' under the judgment in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... , which sentence was not combined with [ the sentence ] in case no . CARDINAL ... , and therefore was to be served separately . After deducting the period during which the [ applicant ] had served this first sentence the public prosecutor 's office rightly established that not all the sentence in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... had been served and the [ applicant ] was recalled to prison on DATE to serve the remaining part of the sentence . There is no indication that he was detained in prison for a period longer than [ required ] for serving the sentence imposed . Accordingly , the contention that he suffered damage as a result is unfounded . The incorrect indication in the judgment of the period of [ remand in custody ] to be deducted does not change the stated intention [ of the trial court ] in respect of the length of the sentence of ' imprisonment ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure ( DATE ) did not contain express provisions establishing a procedure to be followed in cases where there was a dispute as to whether a person had effectively served a prison sentence or not .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG provided that the court which had imposed the sentence would rule on all difficulties or uncertainties relating to the interpretation of its judgment . That did not include , however , issues concerning the execution of sentences and , in particular , the lawfulness of a continuing detention .", "CARDINAL . In general , the authority responsible for supervising the lawfulness of the execution of sentences was the competent public prosecutor ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , section CARDINAL of LAW DATE and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . In particular , the public prosecutor was under a duty to order the release of every imprisoned person whom he or she found to have been unlawfully deprived of his or her liberty ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ) .
