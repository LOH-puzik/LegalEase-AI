He was represented before the Court by Dr A. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was sued for an amount of money which he allegedly owed the plaintiffs in respect of a purchase he made from them . He thus became a party to civil proceedings before ORG ( \u201c SCT \u201d ) .", "On DATE the ORG found against the applicant . It noted that the contractual agreements undertaken were not ideal . However , it was not competent to decide whether such agreements could have been made or not . It was solely competent to decide whether the applicant owed the sum of CARDINAL NORP Liras ( ORG ) to the plaintiffs . Finding that the versions of the parties were diametrically opposed the court considered that it had to base itself on the credibility of their testimonies . It found that , on the one hand , the plaintiffs had been coherent in their submissions throughout the CARDINAL separate hearings . On the other hand , the applicant \u2019s testimony had been contradictory and in its view false . It noted , inter alia , that the applicant claimed that on signing the initial agreements he had not understood what he was signing and that he would consequently have to make payment . This notwithstanding , he had started making regular payments by means of a standing order . When asked about the latter he had replied that he did not know what such a thing was , notwithstanding that it was general knowledge that such an order could only be made at the request of the account holder . The court was of the view that his claim that he was illiterate and that he did not understand what had been going on was only an excuse to avoid the obvious .", "On DATE , the applicant instituted constitutional proceedings claiming a violation of LAW . He complained that the ORG was not an impartial tribunal in view of its composition , namely an adjudicator , who was a lawyer appointed on a part - time basis for a term of office of DATE , and who could in the meantime continue to practise as a lawyer before the ordinary courts . This system left room for prejudice against lawyers who might have been the adjudicator \u2019s opponents in previous or future litigation , or advantages for clients represented by the same firm as that of the adjudicator , together with any other likes and dislikes among colleagues of the same profession acting in the same courts of law , as was the case in GPE . The fact that the adjudicators were not obliged to take the oath administered to judges and magistrates sitting in the ordinary courts was a matter of further concern .", "On DATE ORG ( FAC ) rejected the applicant \u2019s claim as the system was safeguarded by the possibility of challenging adjudicators or of their withdrawing ex officio .", "The applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . Noting that the guarantees of impartiality were best respected by the ordinary courts having full - time judges , it considered that although it would have been preferable that such adjudicators did not continue to practise their profession , the fact that they did so did not mean that the ORG lacked objective impartiality . Although it could be envisaged that in certain circumstances , as mentioned by the applicant , an issue could arise , the applicant \u2019s complaint in the present case was in the abstract .", "Section CARDINAL of the Small Claims Tribunal Act , LAW of LAW , reads as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) The ORG shall be presided over by an adjudicator sitting alone :", "Provided that CARDINAL adjudicator may be appointed to sit in any of the said Tribunals , but CARDINAL adjudicator shall sit in any CARDINAL case .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG shall be appointed by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister . A person shall not be qualified to be appointed as Adjudicator unless he has practised as an advocate in GPE for a period or periods amounting in the aggregate to not DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) A person shall be disqualified from being appointed an adjudicator if such person -", "( a ) is a member of ORG ; or", "( b ) is a member of ORG ; or", "( c ) is an undischarged bankrupt ; or", "( d ) has been sentenced by any court to imprisonment for any term or has been found guilty by any court of any of the crimes in LAW , V or ORG of Book First of the Criminal Code .", "( CARDINAL ) ( a ) Adjudicators shall receive such remuneration as the Prime Minister may by notice in the ORG determine and such remuneration shall be a charge on ORG ; such remuneration shall not during the tenure of office of an Adjudicator be altered to his disadvantage .", "( b ) During the term of their appointment , ORG shall be precluded from the exercise of their profession in cases before the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG shall be appointed for a term of DATE and , on the lapse of their term , they shall not be eligible for reappointment :", "Provided that if the office of Adjudicator is vacant or if the Adjudicator is unable to perform the functions of his office , then , until a person has been appointed and has assumed the functions of that office , those functions shall be performed by any other Adjudicator in office or by such other person qualified for appointment as Adjudicator as may be appointed to act as Adjudicator by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister . Such person shall continue to act for the period of his appointment or , if no such period is specified , until his appointment is revoked by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister .", "( CARDINAL ) In the exercise of his functions under LAW , an Adjudicator shall not be subject to the control or direction of any other person or authority .
