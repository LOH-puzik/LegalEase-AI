The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Gda\u0144sk .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , the applicant was a member of ORG and a member of the PERSON and Justice party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and several other politicians , experts and journalists , participated in a live television programme , Warto rozmawia\u0107 ( \u201c It \u2019s good to talk \u201d ) , shown on TVPCARDINAL . The programme was also broadcast on TVP Polonia on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the programme the applicant took out a copy of PERSON , a NORP DATE newspaper and , pointing to particular pages , said :", "\u201c I would like to show you the nature of the relationship between this media agreement ( \u201c uklad \u201d ) ... and the attacks on PERSON and ORG . I will show you PERSON , which for the first CARDINAL pages , for example DATE , is a frenzied attack on PERSON and ORG . Out of modesty I will not mention that a horrible piece about me , full of lies , is on the first page . On the second page , a frenzied attack on PERSON and ORG . Here , \u201c Students fear flogging \u201d , etc . etc . , \u201c ORG miracles \u201d . This is just obsessive propaganda . But let \u2019s go further , to page CARDINAL . And what do we see ? We see an advertisement entitled \u201c We have built one of the world \u2019s biggest stock markets with the participation of NORP shareholders . We are proud of that . \u201d This is an advertisement for the company ORG ....", "So the paradox is that usually in newspapers they advertise washing powders , cosmetics , beers , or cars , that is , widely available consumer goods ( powszechnego nabycia ) . This [ company ] is a monopolist . It does not need any advertising . This company imports most of the crude oil into GPE and drives MONEY away from GPE to another company , which is registered somewhere in GPE . This is not about an advertisement . This is [ about ] financing mass propaganda against PERSON and ORG through an agreement which has been threatened by PERSON and ORG , so that such dubious deals ( geszefty ) ...", "The point is that PERSON and ORG has interfered with extremely serious connections , which have been draining ...", "Just one sentence ... but the jokes are over , and this structure ( uk\u0142ad ) understood that there will be no early elections , there will be no minority government , this is a chance for an institutional construction ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s statement CARDINAL of the journalists interrupted him by saying : \u201c But this would be more appropriate if someone from PERSON was here . \u201d However , the applicant continued with his statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , the publisher of ORG , brought a civil claim against the applicant for the protection of its rights . It claimed that the applicant \u2019s statements during the television programme on DATE had harmed its good name and credibility and asked that the applicant be made to have an apology published in PERSON and broadcast on TVPCARDINAL and to pay MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the claim and ordered the applicant to issue an apology via PERSON and TVPCARDINAL for the statements he had made . It further ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL ( approximately MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity and ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees .", "CARDINAL . The text of the apology to be published by the applicant was as follows :", "\u201c I declare that the public statement I made during the programme Warto rozmawia\u0107 , broadcast on DATE on TVPCARDINAL , included untrue , defamatory allegations and suspicions about ORG , a company registered in GPE , and about its publishing activity regarding PERSON . I confirm that those allegations caused negative consequences for ORG in conducting their business activities , in particular a loss of indispensable credibility and trust .", "Consequently , I apologise to the GPE - registered company ORG ( the publisher of PERSON ) for having publicly disseminated untrue , defamatory statements which could have harmed its good name , credibility and reputation .", "The above statement is made as a consequence of losing a civil case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant submitted that it had not been his intention to offend the plaintiff . In the television programme he had merely expressed a value judgment relating to aggressive and clearly CARDINAL - sided articles published in PERSON . He further noted that as his statements had been value judgments he had not had to prove their veracity .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the applicant had breached the plaintiff \u2019s rights , in particular in respect of its good name , credibility and reputation . It could be seen from the applicant \u2019s statement that he had wished to point out to the audience that the plaintiff and PERSON had had some kind of media / business agreement , whereby articles against PERSON and ORG had been published in PERSON and financed via advertisements .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s statement had contained both facts and conclusions drawn from those facts .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that an accusation that a newspaper had published articles ordered by a sponsor was clearly offensive to the publisher . Likewise , it was offensive to the publisher to be associated with a company that allegedly conducted morally doubtful activities . The defendant had not submitted any evidence in support of his allegations . He had failed to explain on what basis he had drawn the conclusion that the income obtained from a particular advertisement had resulted in articles being published in PERSON . Furthermore , there had been no reason to believe that the income obtained from the ORG advertisement had been connected with any particular articles in PERSON , particularly the ones that the applicant had referred to as \u201c a frenzied attack on PERSON and ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court stressed that ORG had at the relevant time placed advertisements in several newspapers and magazines . However , the applicant had not alleged that those other newspapers or magazines had been involved in the alleged agreement ( uk\u0142ad ) . The court pointed out that a publisher could not refuse to publish an advertisement unless CARDINAL of the grounds set out in the press law existed , which had not been the situation in the present case . Moreover , as a rule , a publisher was not responsible for the content of advertisements .", "CARDINAL . The court did not agree with the applicant that he had not wished to infringe the plaintiff \u2019s rights . It noted that the applicant had prepared in advance to make the statement in question . He had already had a copy of PERSON when he had entered the television studio and he had had it in his hand while making the statement . In the court \u2019s opinion , the declaration had not been made spontaneously .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court observed that the applicant \u2019s statement could not have been explained on the grounds that it had been in the public interest . On the contrary , it was in the public interest that public figures such as the applicant , a member of parliament , should base the opinions they expressed in the media on verified facts and did not breach the rights of others .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment . He argued , amongst other things , that ORG had wrongly classified his statements as facts and not as value judgments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay MONEY ( about EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees for the proceedings at second instance .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the first - instance judgment had not related to the part of the applicant \u2019s statement concerning articles about himself and PERSON and ORG , even though he had called them \u201c frenzied attacks \u201d , because it was well known that PERSON was critical of PERSON and ORG and that was not something which needed to be proved . However , the applicant \u2019s allegations that ORG had conducted unclear or even suspicious dealings under the cover of placing advertisements in PERSON , and had in fact financed them only to destroy PERSON and ORG , which , for its part , had been fighting against the \u201c agreement \u201d between the company in question and PERSON , had been statements of fact . Nevertheless , the applicant had not proved the truthfulness of his statements about the connections between the plaintiff and the ORG company .", "CARDINAL . The court agreed with ORG that the applicant had prepared in advance to make the statement in question . The programme had concerned different issues and the statement had not been a response or reaction to the discussion between the participants . During the programme the applicant had kept a copy of PERSON under his chair , which he had shown to the cameras at the relevant moment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the PLN MONEY ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) to be paid to a charity , the court considered that to be a modest sum and the costs of publishing an apology a normal consequence of the applicant \u2019s wrongdoing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment . He argued that ORG had wrongly applied the standards of LAW and had thus considered his statement to be one of fact rather than a value judgment . In his opinion , he had expressed value judgments during a public debate and had therefore not undermined the plaintiff \u2019s good name .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s cassation appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the statement in question , in so far as it had concerned relations between ORG and PERSON , had been a statement of fact . The applicant had spoken of suspicious links between PERSON and the publisher of the advertisement and the creation of fictional reasons for receiving funds from that publisher , which was all aimed at allowing PERSON to oppose PERSON and ORG . Such a statement , according to the court , had gone further than being a simple opinion about an advertisement in the press . Adding more information had put ORG advertisement in a completely different , negative light . Asking the applicant to prove such a statement had not been excessive and had not interfered with the freedom of political debate , but had been necessary for the accuracy and pertinence of such a debate .", "CARDINAL . The court further referred to LAW and stressed that freedom of expression was not absolute . Noting the case of NORP v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVIII ) , it further reiterated that where a statement amounted to a value judgment , the proportionality of the interference may depend on whether there existed a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement , since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive . In the present case , the defendant had not even attempted to prove the accuracy of his statements about the alleged connections of which he had accused the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted enforcement proceedings in order to summon the applicant to comply with the obligations imposed by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to publish the apology in question in PERSON ( in a smaller size than originally indicated ) . Since the applicant failed to comply with that order , on DATE ORG allowed ORG to publish the apology in PERSON in the applicant \u2019s name and ordered him to cover the costs of publication of ORG MONEY ( about EUR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
