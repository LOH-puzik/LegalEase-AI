If a fine is imposed , the defendant will add himself to the group of illegal labour immigrants who do everything to avoid compliance with the NORP migration legislation . The penalty of administrative removal is also necessary for the sake of national security , to avoid the spread of various infectious diseases such as HIV , tuberculosis and leprosy , and to ensure the optimal balance of labour resources and in order to support , as a matter of priority , the employment of NORP nationals ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The marriage with PERSON was concluded on DATE , which was a long time after the commission of the offence by [ the applicant ] ... The administrative offence record did not contain any information relating to his family life in GPE . No such information was adduced during the proceedings before the first - instance court ...", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] prolonged violation of the migration legislation since DATE amounts to abuse of GPE \u2019s hospitality and thus should be treated as a breach of the receiving country \u2019s interests ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant received a copy of the appeal decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The penalty of administrative removal was not enforced .

It appears that the applicant engaged lawyer PERSON to assist him in those proceedings and had a meeting with him in the detention centre . On DATE the applicant called the lawyer from the detention centre , complaining of beatings .

Despite the above , the applicant failed to leave GPE ... At the time he did not apply for asylum and continued to stay in GPE unlawfully until the imposition of the penalty of administrative removal .", "The following violations of the migration rules for foreigners should be pointed out :", "The applicant arrived in GPE under a business visa , whereas his actual goal was employment . Thus , his declared aim did not correspond to the actual aim for arriving in GPE .", "The applicant was unlawfully engaged in employment activities ...", "In DATE he was twice prosecuted for administrative offences .

On DATE the applicant , assisted by lawyer PERSON , sought judicial review of the refusal of temporary asylum under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and asked ORG of PERSON to put in place an interim measure by way of suspending enforcement of the judgment of DATE . On DATE the court refused to deal with the case , concluding that it had to be lodged before a court with jurisdiction in the area of the applicant \u2019s current \u201c place of residence \u201d ; his stay in the detention centre did not qualify as a place of residence .", "CARDINAL . Assisted by PERSON ( who is his representative before ORG ) the applicant resubmitted his application for judicial review to ORG of GPE . On DATE ORG left the matter without examination because the applicant had not indicated the date and place of his birth ; had not specified whether he had a law degree , which was relevant because the case could only be lodged by a person in possession of a law degree ; and had not provided evidence that his representative had a law degree .

The court held that the applicant was at risk of violence which was no more intensive than for other people living in GPE :", "\u201c The grounds for granting temporary asylum on account of humanitarian considerations include the following situations : a grave medical condition for which the foreigner will not receive the requisite medical care in the country of nationality , thus putting his or her life at risk ; a real threat to his or her life or liberty on account of hunger , epidemics , emergency situations of environmental or industrial origin or on account of an internal or international conflict that encompasses the entire territory of the state of nationality ; a real threat of being subjected to torture or another cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country of nationality .", "Under LAW parties to the case must prove the circumstances to which they refer as the basis for their claims or objections , unless otherwise provided for by LAW .", "Assessing the evidence submitted to it , the court concludes that [ the applicant ] has not adduced convincing arguments that he is at risk of being persecuted by the authorities or by groups of the population on account of his religion , race or membership of a social group ... Despite the difficult social and political situation in GPE , there are no grounds to consider that his life will be at a higher risk than that of other people living in this country ... According to information from ORG , people returning to GPE may reach directly the city of GPE , which is under the control of the government . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant received a copy of the judgment in DATE and lodged an appeal . He argued that the first - instance court had not paid proper attention to his argument relating to the risk to his life and physical integrity in the event of his removal to GPE ; the migration authority had not refuted his argument while the court had shifted the burden of proof onto the applicant and had placed undue emphasis on the illegality of the applicant \u2019s presence in GPE . His appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The appeal court held as follows :", "\u201c The first - instance court considered that the applicant did not fall within the scope of the notion of \u201c refugee \u201d under LAW ... In view of the applicant \u2019s failure to submit specific facts disclosing that in the event of his removal to GPE he would be exposed to a real threat to his security ... or that he was persecuted in this country , the appeal court agrees with the first - instance court ... The appeal court also notes that the applicant arrived in GPE in DATE but only sought temporary asylum in DATE . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
