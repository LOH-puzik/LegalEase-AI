The first and second applicants are husband and wife . They were unable to have a child of their own because the second applicant is infertile .", "CARDINAL . After a number of unsuccessful attempts to conceive a child using in vitro fertilisation ( ORG ) with their own gametes , the first and second applicants decided to undergo ORG using the gametes of the first applicant and an egg from a donor with a view to implanting the fertilised embryos in the uterus of another woman . Accordingly , they went to GPE , where the process is legal , and entered into a gestational surrogacy agreement .", "The applicants specified that , in accordance with NORP law , the \u201c surrogate mother \u201d was not remunerated but merely received expenses . They added that she and her husband were both high earners and therefore had a much higher income than the applicants and that it had been an act of solidarity on her part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the surrogate mother was found to be carrying twins and , in a judgment of DATE , ORG , to which the first and second applicants and the surrogate mother and her husband had applied , ruled that the first applicant would be the \u201c genetic father \u201d and the second applicant the \u201c legal mother \u201d of any child to whom the surrogate mother gave birth within DATE . The judgment specified the particulars that were to be entered in the birth certificate and stated that the first and second applicants should be recorded as the father and mother .", "CARDINAL . DATE the third and fourth applicants DATE were born on DATE and their birth certificates were drawn up in accordance with the terms stated above .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant went to the NORP consulate in GPE to have the particulars of the birth certificates entered in the NORP register of births , marriages and deaths and the children \u2019s names entered on his passport so that he could return to GPE with them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that many NORP couples in their situation had previously succeeded in carrying out that procedure . The consulate rejected the first applicant \u2019s request , however , on the grounds that he could not establish that the second applicant had given birth and , suspecting a surrogacy arrangement , sent the file to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . As ORG had issued GPE passports for the twins on which the first and second applicants were named as their parents , the CARDINAL applicants were able to return to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a preliminary investigation was carried out at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an investigation was commenced against a person or persons unknown for acting as intermediary in a surrogacy arrangement and in respect of the first and second applicants for false representation infringing the civil status of children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with the submissions of the NORP public prosecutor , the investigating judge gave a ruling of no case to answer on the ground that the acts had been committed on GPE territory , where they were not classified as an offence , and therefore did not constitute a punishable offence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , on the instructions of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the particulars of the birth certificates of the third and fourth applicants had been recorded in the central register of births , marriages and deaths in GPE by the NORP consulate in GPE .", "CARDINAL . However , on CARDINAL DATE the NORP public prosecutor instituted proceedings against the first and second applicants in the NORP tribunal de grande instance to have the entries annulled and the judgment recorded in the margin of the entries thus invalidated . He observed that an agreement whereby a woman undertook to conceive and bear a child and relinquish it at birth was null and void in accordance with the public - policy principle that the human body and civil status are inalienable . He concluded that , as the judgment of ORG was contrary to the NORP concept of international public policy and of NORP public policy , it could not be executed in GPE and that the validity of civil - status certificates drawn up on the basis of that judgment could not be recognised in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the NORP tribunal de grande instance declared the action inadmissible . It found that \u201c the entries had been recorded on the sole initiative of the public prosecutor with the purpose , since avowed , of bringing proceedings to have the entries annulled \u201d . It concluded from this that \u201c an action by the public prosecutor on grounds of public policy which he himself ha[d ] infringed could not be deemed admissible where the provisions of LAW on which he [ relied ] allowed him to verify the validity of the certificates in any respect and to reject any request for registration that would render them binding in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed to ORG , which upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment on DATE . ORG also considered the public prosecutor \u2019s action for annulment of the entries in the GPE central register of births , marriages and deaths inadmissible as a matter of international public policy . It substituted its own grounds for that decision , however , finding that the contents of the entries were accurate as regards the judgment of ORG and that the public prosecutor \u2019s office was not disputing the fact that the judgment was binding on GPE or that , under LAW , the certificates drawn up in GPE in accordance with the usual procedures in that ORG should be deemed valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) quashed that judgment on the ground that the public prosecutor \u2019s office had an interest in bringing proceedings for annulment of the entries since , as established by ORG , the birth certificates in question could only have been drawn up following a surrogacy arrangement . It remitted the case to ORG with a differently constituted bench .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned the judgment remitted to it , annulled the entries pertaining to the birth certificates and ordered its judgment to be recorded in the margin of the invalidated birth certificates .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the admissibility of the action brought by the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the court found that it could not be seriously alleged that the prosecution authorities had contravened public policy or disrupted peaceful family relations by requesting that the contents of an entry that they themselves had ordered be annulled , since the purpose was to frustrate the effects of a foreign civil status which they considered contrary to NORP public policy or to guard against an application to have the entries recorded .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled on the merits as follows :", "\u201c ... The birth certificates were drawn up on the basis of ORG judgment of DATE which declared [ the first applicant ] the genetic father and [ the second applicant ] the legal mother of any child to which [ the surrogate mother ] gave birth between CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The civil - status documents are therefore indissociable from the decision underlying them and the effectiveness of that decision remains conditional on its international lawfulness .", "ORG , on national territory , of a decision delivered by a court of a ORG that is not bound to GPE by any convention is subject to CARDINAL conditions : the indirect jurisdiction of the foreign court based on the connection between the court and the case ; compliance of the merits and procedure with international public policy ; and absence of circumvention of the law .", "It has been established in the present case that following a surrogacy agreement [ the surrogate mother ] gave birth to twins who were conceived from the gametes of [ the first applicant ] and of a third party and were relinquished to [ the first and second applicants ] .", "Under LAW , whose provisions deriving from Law no . MONEY of DATE , and not amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , are a matter of public policy by virtue of LAW of the same Code , any agreement concerning reproductive or gestational surrogacy is null and void . Accordingly , the judgment of ORG , which indirectly validated a surrogacy agreement , contravenes the NORP concept of international public policy . Consequently , without having to ascertain whether the law has been circumvented , the entries in the NORP central register of births , marriages and deaths of the particulars of the GPE birth certificates naming [ the second applicant ] as the mother of the children must be annulled and the present judgment recorded in the margin of the invalidated birth certificates .", "[ The applicants ] can not seriously claim that they have not had a fair hearing ; nor do they have justifiable grounds for arguing that this measure contravenes provisions laid down in international conventions and domestic law . The concepts to which they refer , in particular the child \u2019s best interests , can not allow them \u2013 despite the practical difficulties engendered by the situation DATE to validate ex post facto a process whose illegality , established first in the case - law and subsequently by the NORP legislature , is currently enshrined in positive law . Furthermore , non - registration does not have the effect of depriving the QUANTITY children of their GPE civil status or calling into question their legal parent - child relationship with [ the first and second applicants ] recognised under NORP law ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law , submitting that the children \u2019s best interests \u2013 within the meaning of LAW of LAW on the Rights of the Child \u2013 had been disregarded and complaining of a breach of their right to a stable legal parent - child relationship and , further , of a violation of LAW taken alone and in conjunction with LAW . They submitted , further , that the decision of a foreign court recognising the legal parent - child relationship between a child and a couple who had lawfully contracted an agreement with a surrogate mother was not contrary to international public policy , which should not be confused with domestic public policy .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the advocate - general recommended quashing the judgment . He expressed the view that a right lawfully acquired abroad or a foreign decision lawfully delivered by a foreign court could not be prevented from taking legal effect in GPE on grounds of international public policy where this would infringe a principle , a freedom or a right guaranteed by an international convention ratified by GPE .", "He noted in particular that in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) the ORG had taken account , in its examination of the case under LAW , of an \u201c effective family life \u201d and \u201c de facto family ties \u201d between a single mother and the child she had adopted in GPE , without attaching any importance to the fact that the former had gone abroad in search of a legal system which would allow her to obtain what the law of her country of origin refused her . In the advocate - general \u2019s opinion , if the same rationale were applied in the present case , even where domestic law had been circumvented , a legal relationship lawfully created abroad could not be prevented from producing the relevant legal effects where it concerned an effective family set - up and allowed it to function and evolve in normal conditions from the standpoint of LAW . He also observed that the third and fourth applicants had been living in GPE for DATE and \u201c [ were being ] brought up there by genetic and intended parents in a de facto family unit in which [ they were receiving ] affection , care , education , and the material welfare necessary to their development \u201d and that this effective and affective family unit DATE fully lawful in the eyes of the law of the country in which it had originated \u2013 [ was ] \u201c legally clandestine \u201d , \u201c the children having no civil status recognised in GPE and no parent - child relationship regarded as valid under NORP law \u201d . As to whether that state of affairs infringed their \u201c right to a normal family life \u201d , the advocate - general replied as follows :", "\u201c ... At this stage CARDINAL answers are possible : either \u2013 somewhat theoretically and largely paradoxically \u2013 the refusal to register the birth particulars is inconsequential and does not substantially affect the family \u2019s DATE life , which means that registration is a mere formality and it is therefore difficult to see any major obstacle in the circumstances to recording the details of certificates with such minimal legal effect that it is inconceivable that they are capable in themselves of shaking the foundations of our fundamental principles and seriously contravening public policy ( since they do not intrinsically contain any mention of the nature of the birth ) .", "Alternatively , the refusal to register the birth details permanently and substantially disrupts the family \u2019s life , which is legally split into CARDINAL in GPE \u2013 the NORP couple on one side and the foreign children on the other \u2013 and the question then arises whether our international public policy \u2013 even based upon proximity \u2013 can frustrate the right to family life within the meaning of Article CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] or whether , on the contrary , public policy of that kind , whose effects have to be analysed in practical terms as do those of the foreign rights or decisions that it seeks to exclude , should not be overridden by the obligation to comply with a provision of the ORG .", "If the second alternative is retained on the grounds that international conventions must take precedence over public policy based on a standard provided for in a legislative provision , this will not necessarily result in the automatic collapse of the barriers erected by the domestic public - policy provision in such circumstances . As long as ORG has not given a clear ruling on the question of the lawfulness of surrogacy and allows the GPE to legislate as they deem fit in this area , it can be considered contrary to public policy to validate , on grounds of respect for family life , situations created illegally within the countries which prohibit them .", "However , where it is merely a question of giving effect on the national territory to situations lawfully established abroad \u2013 be this at the cost of deliberately disregarding the strictures of a mandatory law \u2013 there is nothing to preclude international public policy \u2013 even based upon proximity \u2013 from being overridden in order to allow families to lead a life in conformity with the legal conditions in which they were created and the de facto conditions in which they now live . Furthermore , the best interests of the child , envisaged not only under LAW but also under the case - law of ORG which has established this criterion as a component of respect for family life , also militate in favour of this interpretation . At least this is the lesson that I think we can draw from the judgment in PERSON [ and PERSON ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE ORG ( ORG ) gave judgment dismissing the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... the refusal to register the particulars of a birth certificate drawn up in execution of a foreign court decision , based on the incompatibility of that decision with NORP international public policy , is justified where that decision contains provisions which conflict with essential principles of LANGUAGE law . According to the current position under domestic law , it is contrary to the principle of inalienability of civil status \u2013 a fundamental principle of LANGUAGE law \u2013 to give effect , in terms of the legal parent - child relationship , to a surrogacy agreement , which , while it may be lawful in another country , is null and void on public - policy grounds under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW .", "Accordingly , ORG correctly held that , in giving effect to an agreement of this nature , the \u201c NORP \u201d judgment of DATE conflicted with the NORP concept of international public policy , with the result that registration of the details of the birth certificates in question , which had been drawn up in application of that judgment , should be annulled . This does not deprive the children of the legal parent - child relationship recognised under NORP law and does not prevent them from living with PERSON and PERSON in GPE ; nor does it infringe the children \u2019s right to respect for their private and family life within the meaning of LAW ... , or the principle that their best interests are paramount as laid down in LAW of LAW on the Rights of the Child ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an application with the GPE - le - ORG for a certificate of NORP nationality for the third and fourth applicants . The senior registrar sent him acknowledgement - of - receipt forms dated DATE and DATE , indicating that the request \u201c was still being processed in [ his ] department pending a reply to the request for authentication sent to the consulate of GPE , GPE \u201d .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
