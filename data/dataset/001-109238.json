The applicants are NORP nationals . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . s , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicants , as members of a ORG - supported housing construction cooperative , paid various amounts of money in NORP roubles , the then legal tender , to the GPE municipality in exchange for the local authority \u2019s undertaking to provide them , under privileged conditions , with newly built apartments . The payable amounts were calculated according to the prices prevailing on the NORP real property market at the material time . The validity of that transaction was confirmed by a number of legal acts issued by the municipality during the same period .", "CARDINAL . Owing to financial crises which hit the country in the course of its transition from the old NORP , ORG - controlled economy to a market one in DATE , the GPE municipality failed to fulfil its contractual obligation . Thus , the construction of the relevant block of flats for the applicants never started .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 case was not an isolated instance of non - fulfilment by the State of its contractual housing obligations . There were many other such housing construction cooperatives all over the country , which , despite having duly paid their contributions to the State , never received any dwellings in exchange . As disclosed by various legal acts contained in the case file , and notably by a Resolution of DATE of the Government of GPE , CARDINAL of the major reasons for that civil liability of the ORG was a sudden and drastic depreciation of the NORP rouble and a consequent rise in the prices of the relevant services and goods , which rendered the monetary contributions of the individual members of various housing cooperatives , such as the applicants , insufficient even for partial funding of house construction work .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG withdrew the collapsed NORP rouble from circulation , introducing instead a provisional currency , the socalled coupons , which then also suffered from hyper - inflation . In DATE , the provisional currency was finally replaced by the NORP lari , the current national legal tender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought an action against ORG , requesting that the ORG fulfil its obligations under section QUANTITY ( g ) of the Act of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the LAW on State Debt \u201d ) by paying them compensation for the undelivered apartments in an amount of MONEY . They explained that the amount claimed corresponded to the overall total value of similar apartments according to the current prices on the NORP real property market .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 action as manifestly ill - founded . At the outset , the court acknowledged that the ORG \u2019s liability vis - \u00e0 - vis the individual members of housing construction cooperatives constituted domestic public debt under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( g ) of the LAW . The court also noted that the ORG had failed to develop a scheme for the settlement of that debt within the time - limit set by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG then recalled that on DATE the Government of GPE had established , on the basis of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , an ad hoc ministerial Commission for the purpose of studying and drawing up recommendations for the problems related to the settlement of various forms of domestic public debt , including that owed to the individual members of housing construction cooperatives . However , that ORG was still in the process of working on the problems , without having submitted any specific recommendations to the ORG and President of GPE as yet . Consequently , in the absence of a clear legislative mechanism whereby the ORG should settle the debt , the court was not able to rule on the matter . Without such a mechanism it was not even possible , ORG emphasised , to calculate amounts which were currently payable to the applicants as compensation for their old deposits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fully upheld the first instance court \u2019s judgment of DATE . The appellate court reiterated that , in the absence of a legislative mechanism regulating the settlement of the relevant domestic public debt , there was no legal basis for the courts to entertain the applicants\u2019 action for the time being . Since the repayment of that debt was intrinsically connected to its indexation and other complex financial calculations , the judiciary could not overstep the competence of the relevant ministerial Commission specifically created for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE rejected the ORG cassation appeal as inadmissible , finally terminating the dispute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Act on State Debt was enacted . Pursuant to its section CARDINAL ( b ) , domestic debt , which resulted from various types of Government liabilities , was represented by sums in fiat currency .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( g ) of GPE , the contractual obligations undertaken but not fulfilled by the ORG vis\u00e0vis individual members of housing construction cooperatives were recognised , amongst other Government liabilities , as a form of domestic public debt . According to paragraph CARDINAL of the same section , ORG was supposed to devise a mechanism for the repayment of that particular debt by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prime Minister of GPE issued ORG no . CARDINAL , establishing an ad hoc Commission to address the problem of the settlement of the various forms of domestic public debt under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . The ORG was composed of different Ministers and was initially supposed to submit specific recommendations for the resolution of the problem by DATE . Subsequently , that deadline was postponed several times . Pursuant to the ORG as it currently stands , after having been amended for the last time on DATE , the ORG is expected to submit such recommendations by DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
