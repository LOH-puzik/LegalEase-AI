The first applicant , who is a journalist and writer , is the author of a book entitled PERSON , Lyon DATE which was published in DATE by PERSON ( the third applicant ) , a company chaired by the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . In his book , the first applicant reconstructed the chronology of events involving the Resistance movements in PERSON in DATE and took stock of the various archive materials that were available on that period . CARDINAL of the principal mysteries surrounding this period is the PERSON meeting , an event of particular significance to the history of the French Resistance and a major episode of the Second World War . On DATE PERSON , the regional head of the NORP , arrested the main Resistance leaders at a meeting in GPE in the PERSON suburbs . Among those arrested were PERSON , General PERSON representative in GPE and the leader of the internal Resistance , and PERSON , a member of the Resistance movement who managed to escape in DATE . The truth about how the Resistance leaders came to be arrested in PERSON has still not been established . A member of the Resistance , PERSON , who is now dead , was accused of being the \u201c traitor \u201d and put on trial . However , he was not convicted after CARDINAL separate trials . A majority of the court voted in favour of a conviction in CARDINAL of the trials , but the rules of criminal procedure in force at the time required a majority of CARDINAL votes for a guilty verdict to be returned .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant recounted this major event \u201c using the Aubracs as a prism \u201d . He claimed that his book put to the test \u201c the official truth as related at length in the media , notably by the Aubracs , and in a film that sings their praises \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The book sparked off a fierce public debate in GPE and the newspaper ORG organised a round - table conference at which historians were invited to discuss the issue in the presence of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . An unabridged version of the written submissions DATE known as the \u201c PERSON testament \u201d \u2013 which were signed by PERSON and lodged by Mr PERSON , his lawyer , on DATE with the judge investigating PERSON \u2019s treatment of members of ORG was appended to the book . Many of the questions raised by the first applicant were based on a comparison of that document with the \u201c official \u201d version of history . In the conclusion to his book , he said that there was no evidence in the archives to substantiate the accusation of treachery made by PERSON against PERSON , but that their examination had shown that \u201c unreliable accounts [ had ] been given at times \u201d . He followed this up with CARDINAL pages of questions that cast doubt on PERSON innocence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr and PERSON brought a private prosecution by direct summons in the DATE ORG the GPE tribunal de grande instance . The summons contained CARDINAL extracts from the book ( CARDINAL from PERSON \u2019s written submissions and CARDINAL from the first applicant \u2019s own text ) . The CARDINAL applicants were summoned in their capacities as author , accomplice and a party liable for defamation under the civil law . PERSON and PERSON relied on DATE of ORG of DATE and ORG judgment of DATE in PERSON . The relevant parts of the summons read as follows :", "\u201c When ... PERSON was brought to GPE in DATE he chose to defend himself by seeking to discredit those of his victims who had survived and were still able to make accusations against him by accusing them of treachery . He suggested that PERSON and PERSON might be among their number . However , when PERSON attended PERSON \u2019s trial after being called as a witness by him , neither PERSON , nor his counsel PERSON , asked him the slightest question , made the least remark or produced any document capable of supporting this vile accusation which remained extremely vague .", "At the same time , by a judgment of DATE followed by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE which has become final , PERSON secured Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction for defamation after Mr PERSON had chosen to relay and even to back up his client \u2019s insinuations in a film by Mr PERSON . ...", "The [ first applicant \u2019s ] book was published in DATE with the title \u2018 PERSON , GPE CARDINAL\u2019 . A banner wrapped around the cover proclaimed : \u2018 A legend put to the test of history.\u2019", "There can not , therefore , be any doubt that this book is aimed almost exclusively at the Aubracs and purports to use rigorous historical method to destroy their so - called \u2018 legend\u2019 as members of the Resistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON then set out those of the ORG allegations which they considered defamatory and their reasons for so considering them :", "\u201c A. The circumstances of PERSON arrest in DATE", "The first falsehood of which the Aubracs are accused is that PERSON was arrested on DATE and not on DATE ; this enables PERSON to assert on the basis of this \u2018 established fact\u2019 that the only way PERSON , who had been arrested on DATE , was able to attend the meeting on DATE in FAC in GPE was under the control of the NORP police . ...", "B. The allegations relating to PERSON release in DATE", "An order for PERSON release was made on DATE . However , in an autobiographical account published in DATE , his wife puts the date of his release at CARDINAL May while PERSON himself hesitates DATE in a deposition made on DATE in connection with the second PERSON trial .", "... For [ the first applicant ] , there can be but one explanation for this discrepancy between the dates : PERSON spent DATE collaborating with the divine PERSON who compelled the NORP judicial authorities to release him . This was confirmed by PERSON assertion that she had warned the public prosecutor not to oppose release , while [ the first applicant ] feigns surprise at the lack of concrete evidence of the application . ...", "C. Escape from ORG", "... this entire chapter returns to the alleged statement by PERSON that she secured her husband PERSON \u2019s inclusion not only among the CARDINAL members of the Resistance who were arrested on DATE , but also among those who were freed on CARDINAL May , with the sole aim of challenging the account of those who took part in that escape and branding them liars . ...", "... [ The first applicant \u2019s ] inability to rank the documents he cites in order of importance is a cause for consternation here . He considers it a near certainty that PERSON \u2019s wife \u2018 hid\u2019 her husband following his release by PERSON , but chooses to ignore the fact that [ the circumstances of ] his release [ were ] immediately examined by PERSON , head of the \u2018 Combat\u2019 movement and subsequently , as was to be expected , subjected to close scrutiny at General PERSON headquarters in GPE , and , in particular , the remark made by Frenay \u2013 despite its inclusion in the record of his interview in GPE on DATE that \u2018 there is no doubt that PERSON is a fellow who is beyond all suspicion\u2019 . ...", "D. The defamatory allegations about PERSON", "...", "Although the debate still rages over the extent to which PERSON was a willing collaborator and the unnecessary risks taken by the leaders of the \u2018 Combat\u2019 movement in sending PERSON to PERSON to defend the prerogatives of their leader , prior to PERSON in DATE no one had ever suggested that PERSON and PERSON had played the slightest role in PERSON arrest on DATE , or his identification by PERSON on DATE after DATE of torture , it again being stressed that PERSON did not know PERSON .", "... [ The first applicant ] had no hesitation in asserting ( page CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 It is certain that PERSON appears no longer to recollect the meeting with PERSON and PERSON at Lonjaret \u2019s home on DATE , although in DATE he fully admitted that such a meeting had taken ORG", "In so doing , [ the first applicant ] lends credence to the notion that on DATE PERSON knew all about the proposed meeting in GPE ...", "PERSON The deliberate confusion between PERSON and PERSON", "In CARDINAL transitional chapters ( Chapters ORG and ORG ) , [ the first applicant ] , without citing a single piece of documentary evidence , seeks to cause deliberate confusion by recounting the misfortunes of PERSON ( who , once again , no one doubts helped the NORP although it is not known to what extent he did so voluntarily ) and PERSON and PERSON , whom no one has ever accused of such collaboration , for good reason . ...", "... [ The first applicant \u2019s ] aim is still the same : to lead people to believe that PERSON is lying and that what he clearly stated at the material time no longer matters , as he does not repeat it in identical terms DATE on . ...", "F. The offences of defamation are made out", "Both the publication of the \u2018 PERSON testament\u2019 and the comments of [ the first applicant ] in support of that document render [ the applicants ] liable for defamatory statements in the form of precise allegations , although sometimes in the form of innuendo , against CARDINAL specific persons , PERSON and PERSON , whose honour and reputation have been considerably tarnished by the said allegations .", "The most harmful allegations in a book whose entire content is defamatory are as follows :", "A. Allegations against PERSON", "CARDINAL . PERSON was the NORP officer whom the NORP used to infiltrate the leaders of ORG upon its formation .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was a member of the Resistance whom PERSON turned into CARDINAL of his department \u2019s agents on his arrest in DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON lied about the date of his first arrest : it took place on CARDINAL , not DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , who was controlled by the NORP police , was not in fact arrested on DATE , when the NORP police went to one of his homes .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was responsible for the \u2018 mousetraps\u2019 that were set for members of the Resistance movement in PERSON DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was not released on DATE pursuant to a freely made decision of the investigating judge ... , but because the NORP authorities had compelled the NORP judicial authorities to release him .", "CARDINAL . PERSON lied about the date of his release following his first arrest in order to hide the fact that for DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , he had remained at the disposal of PERSON , the head of the NORP .", "CARDINAL . After being informed on DATE of the time and venue of the meeting due to take place in GPE of various Resistance leaders including PERSON , PERSON had informed his wife , who was thus able to inform the head of the Gestapo .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was released voluntarily by the NORP on DATE , when NORP agents took part in an operation to free one of their agents , PERSON , and PERSON , who had been informed of the operation , seized the opportunity to allow his agent PERSON to escape .", "CARDINAL . In general , PERSON conduct with regard to the NORP authorities in ORG in DATE was similar to that of PERSON , whom the NORP were using at that time .", "B. Allegations against PERSON", "CARDINAL . PERSON had concealed the fact that her husband was released on DATE , not as a result of action she had taken , but by virtue of an order of the investigating judge ... acting on the instructions of PERSON , the head of the NORP .", "CARDINAL . It was not PERSON who had arranged the operation that had enabled CARDINAL members of the Resistance , who had been arrested at the same time as PERSON , to escape from ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After being informed by her husband of the time and place of the meeting at Dr PERSON \u2019s home in PERSON on DATE , PERSON had communicated the information to PERSON , the regional head of the NORP , on DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , whose controlling officer was GPE , PERSON \u2019s deputy , had agreed to act as liaison officer between her husband and ... PERSON to avoid \u2018 giving her husband NORP .", "CARDINAL . PERSON could only have gained access to the LOC used by the Gestapo if she was a Gestapo agent .", "CARDINAL . It was with the full agreement of the NORP , and more specifically PERSON , that PERSON was able to arrange her husband \u2019s \u2018 ORG in an operation that was organised not by her , but by ORG , on DATE .", "Each of these defamatory statements ... must give rise to liability under LAW of DATE .", "These defamatory statements , which accuse [ the ORG ] of treachery and of concealing treachery , constitute a direct attack on their status as founding members and organisers of ORG network and , in PERSON case , as the military commander of ORG .", "This reference to LAW DATE is inescapable since , as ORG reiterated in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( in PERSON ) : \u2018 ... By virtue of a combination of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG and LAW of LAW of DATE , the protection against defamation afforded to certain recognised Resistance movements which are likened to the ORG and ORG extends to the members of these movements if the defamatory statement concerns their status or actions as members.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the tribunal de grande instance began by examining the various alleged defamatory statements in the chronological order of the underlying events and by comparing PERSON signed written submissions with the first applicant \u2019s text , as it considered that the very purpose of the first applicant \u2019s book was to", "\u201c compare the allegations of these \u2018 written PERSON with the account of events given by PERSON and PERSON on various occasions and the other oral and documentary evidence relating to that period . ... The entire book thereafter focuses on this ( major ) charge of treachery \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The tribunal de grande instance thus examined the circumstances of PERSON initial arrest in DATE , his release in DATE , the escape from ORG , the PERSON episode , events post - PERSON and the escape from boulevard des Hirondelles , and concluded :", "\u201c Thus ... , without formally corroborating the direct accusations made in \u2018 PERSON \u2019s written PERSON , the [ first applicant ] sets about sowing confusion by combining a series of facts , witness statements and documents of different types and varying degrees of importance which together serve to discredit the accounts given by the civil parties ; he also questions the motives for their deception and lies , and DATE despite the reservations expressed by the author DATE surreptitiously renders plausible the accusation of treachery and manipulation made in \u2018 PERSON \u2019s written PERSON that constitutes the underlying theme of the entire book . ...", "The civil parties are therefore right to consider that the entire book , and particularly the passages [ reproduced in the judgment ] , tarnish their honour and reputation .", "The publication of the written submissions signed by PERSON and the quotation in various parts of the text of extracts from them constitutes defamation by reproduction of libellous accusations or allegations , an offence expressly provided for by section DATE , first paragraph , of the Freedom of the Press Act .", "As for the author \u2019s comments , they constitute defamation by innuendo in that they encourage the reader to believe that very grave questions exist over PERSON and PERSON conduct in DATE that outweigh the certainties that have been hitherto accepted ; they thus lend credence to PERSON \u2019s accusations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The tribunal de grande instance then considered which section of the Freedom of the Press Act was applicable in the case and , referring to LAW of DATE and ORG case - law , stated that the likening of recognised Resistance movements to the ORG and ORG also applied to members of those movements . It noted that for ORG purposes \u201c law \u201d included both legislation passed by ORG and judicial interpretation of that legislation , provided it was sufficiently settled and accessible . It accordingly found that LAW DATE was applicable .", "CARDINAL . It went on to explain that the defamatory statements were deemed to have been made in bad faith and that the burden of proof was on the accused to provide sufficient justification to establish that they had acted in good faith . They had to show that there had been a legitimate interest in publication unaccompanied by personal animosity , that a proper investigation had been carried out and that the tone was measured :", "\u201c While the work of historians , who must be permitted to go about their work with total liberty if the historical truth is to be established , may on occasion lead them to make critical assessments containing defamatory accusations against the actors \u2013 both living and dead \u2013 of the events they are studying , it can only be justified if the historian proves that he has complied with his scientific obligations . ...", "As soon as they came into the hands of the investigating judge and even though only the specialists knew what they contained , \u2018 PERSON \u2019s written PERSON received a degree of publicity that encouraged rumours to spread . There was , therefore , an argument for full publication , provided it was accompanied by an explanation of the historical background and a critical analysis that would enable the reader to form a considered opinion on the weight to be attached to the last statements of the former NORP officer . \u201d", "With that requirement in mind , the tribunal de grande instance found that the characteristic features of the applicant \u2019s book were the excessive importance given to \u2018 PERSON \u2019s written PERSON , a manifest lack of adequate documentation on the circumstances of PERSON first arrest on DATE and his release , a failure to rank the sources of information on the escape from ORG in order of importance , insufficient qualification of his remarks on PERSON and the escape of DATE , a lack of critical analysis of the NORP sources and documents as such and its neglect of the statements of those who took part in the events .", "The tribunal de grande instance set out in detail and gave reasons for each of these assertions and concluded :", "\u201c ... judges are required by the nature of their task not to abdicate when confronted with the scholar ( or someone claiming to be such ) and to decide the case in law , thereby contributing in their own way to the regulation of relations in society .", "Thus , judges can not , in the name of some higher imperative of historical truth , abandon their duty to protect the right to honour and reputation of those who were thrust into the torment of war and were the unwilling but courageous participants therein .", "ORG by their contemporaries as illustrious myths , these men and women have not for all that become mere subjects of research , shorn of their personality , deprived of sensibility or divested of their own destinies in the interests of science .", "Because he has forgotten this and has failed to comply with the essential rules of historical method , the accused \u2019s [ the author of the book \u2019s ] plea of good faith must fail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The tribunal de grande instance therefore found the first CARDINAL applicants guilty , as principal and accomplice respectively , of the offence under sections CARDINAL , first paragraph , and DATE , first paragraph , of the LAW of DATE of public defamation of PERSON and PERSON in their capacity as members of a recognised Resistance movement .", "It sentenced the first applicant , as the principal , to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) and the second , as an accomplice , to a fine of ORG CARDINAL . It also found them jointly and severally liable with the third applicant to pay PERSON and PERSON damages of ORG CARDINAL each . It dismissed an application for an order for the book \u2019s destruction , but made an order for publication of a statement in CARDINAL DATE newspapers and for each copy of the book to carry a warning in like terms . Lastly , it found the third applicant liable under the civil law .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed objections of nullity that had been made by the applicants and , on the merits , examined the following questions in turn : whether the prosecution was lawful , legitimate and necessary , whether the remarks were defamatory , whether the defendants had acted in good faith and whether LAW of DATE was applicable .", "CARDINAL . As to whether the remarks were defamatory , ORG endorsed the reasoning of the court below and added that there were a number of factors which indicated that the author and publisher had decided to make the ORG alleged betrayal the subject of their publication ; these included the editorial presentation , the general structure of the book , the wraparound banner that juxtaposed \u2018 legend\u2019 and \u2018 ORG , and the conclusion to the book which was on the same theme .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the question of defamation by innuendo , ORG rejected the criticism of the tribunal de grande instance \u2019s reasoning :", "\u201c Having thus decided how the book would be balanced : systematic doubt where the ORG are concerned and the use of PERSON \u2019s document as a reference \u2013 albeit one to be treated with caution DATE [ the first applicant ] proceeds , in circumstances that are accurately described in the judgment , systematically to refuse to accord any credit to PERSON and PERSON account .", "To take the CARDINAL episodes to which the defence refer : as regards the escape from L\u2019Antiquaille , the author is not merely being irreverent but clearly makes accusations of inaccuracy , contradiction ( page CARDINAL ) and of misrepresenting the truth ( page CARDINAL ) : there is no better way of insinuating that someone is lying . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then examined the applicants\u2019 plea that they had acted in good faith and rejected it .", "It did not deny that there could be an interest in analysing major events in the history of the Resistance and found that although some of the expressions used in the book were unpleasant they did not suffice to establish the existence of personal animosity . However , it concluded that the first applicant had failed to act with the necessary rigour for the following reasons :", "\u201c Anyone who alleges a specific fact must first seek to verify its accuracy . Although this requirement is general , it is especially justified when the accusation is particularly serious \u2013 such as of an act of treachery leading to the death of the main Resistance leader DATE and when , as a historian , its maker is accustomed to questioning sources . \u201d", "ORG then proceeded to identify the factors from which it had concluded that that requirement had not been complied with : the first applicant \u2019s failure to consult the file on the investigation that was conducted after the arrests in DATE , even though it would have enabled him to establish the date of PERSON arrest and whether he was already in custody when his home was searched ; his lack of interest in the testimony of direct witnesses from that period who were still alive when the book was written ; and his failure to investigate certain documents . Noting repeated failures by the first applicant to exercise sufficient caution ( he had published the PERSON document without subjecting it to genuine critical analysis , had directly accused the civil party of lying and had dismissed the boulevard des Hirondelles operation by members of the Resistance led by PERSON as a sham ) , ORG rejected his plea of good faith .", "CARDINAL . As regards the decision to apply section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , ORG referred to CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE and to CARDINAL judgments of ORG and found that the civil parties had been defamed exclusively with regard to their activities as members of the Resistance \u201c since [ the first applicant \u2019s ] entire thesis conveyed to the reader the notion that they were guilty of treachery \u201d . It rejected an argument regarding the quality of the statute that had been applied in the case before it , noting that it was DATE and had been the subject matter of \u201c settled and unambiguous case - law of the highest court for DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finding that the sentences that had been handed down were just and proportionate , ORG upheld all the provisions of the judgment of the court below .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG , pleading , inter alia , ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention on the basis that the statutory provision that had been applied was neither clear nor precise and that its interpretation by the courts was inaccessible , unforeseeable and too wide . In their final CARDINAL grounds of appeal , they alleged that ORG had failed to give reasons for its decision to hold the applicants civilly and criminally liable for public defamation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , holding , inter alia , that the court below had properly justified its decision . It found that ORG had applied the law correctly :", "\u201c By virtue of a combination of LAW of LAW of DATE and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , firstly , these provisions afford protection against defamation to certain recognised Resistance movements which are likened to the regular ORG and , secondly , this protection extends to members of these movements if the defamatory statement concerns their status or actions as members . \u201d", "It examined the final CARDINAL grounds of appeal together and dismissed them , holding :", "\u201c ORG is satisfied from the wording of the judgment and its examination of the procedural documents that ORG has , for reasons which are neither insufficient nor self - contradictory , firstly , correctly analysed the meaning and scope of the impugned statements and thus identified all the constitutive elements of fact and intent of the offence of which it found the accused guilty and , secondly , used its unfettered discretion to analyse the special circumstances and concluded that the accused \u2019s plea of historical criticism in good faith had to be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
