There was an inconsistency between their written statements later given to the public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE when they stated that some pushing and pulling might have occurred and their evidence to ORG . In their oral evidence to the Commission delegates , PERSON and PERSON were adamant that they had to lead PERSON by the arms to the car but this did not involve the use of force and he did not receive any knocks or marks in the process . PERSON heard from the taxi drivers at the taxi rank that his father had not resisted arrest , nor had CARDINAL taxi drivers who were asked to give statements by the public prosecutor heard that PERSON had resisted arrest .", "CARDINAL .

No records existed of the movements of detainees to and from their cells , for example , noting the times of interrogations . The police officers concerned in the events denied in their statements to the public prosecutor taken CARDINAL DATE that PERSON had been interrogated during his detention , in particular , as no interrogations would take place before the operation was completed . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON gave oral evidence to the same effect to the ORG 's delegates . The ORG found that their assertion that PERSON had not been questioned during TIME following his apprehension to be implausible , inconsistent and lacking in credibility ( see the ORG 's analysis of the evidence , ORG 's report of DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Taking into account also the other evidence , it found that PERSON had been questioned by the interrogation team during his period of detention .", "CARDINAL .

It repeated the physical findings of the examination record , this time describing the ecchymosis on the front of the chest as purple . The internal examination disclosed that the lungs weighed CARDINAL g each and were oedematic and that the heart , weighing QUANTITY , was larger than the norm . The brain was oedematic . There was some indication of arteriosclerosis in certain vessels and the parietal layer of the myocard adhered tightly to the heart . The sternum was fractured and the surrounding soft tissues revealed fresh haemorrhage which could have been caused by attempted resuscitation .", "Reference was made also to the histopathological report of CARDINAL DATE , which found chronic bronchitis in the lungs , arteriosclerotic changes narrowing the lumen in the coronary arteries and chronic constructive pericarditis , chronic myocarditis , myocardial hyperplasy and hypertrophy in the heart .

On DATE ORG issued its opinion , which was signed by CARDINAL members of ORG , including PERSON . This report recalled that PERSON had been pushed and shoved during his arrest , that he had become unwell before his interrogation or , as was claimed , that he had died during interrogation . It deduced from the witness statements that he had been in his cell until he complained that his heart was giving him trouble , at which point he was taken immediately to hospital .", "The report took up the findings of the internal and external examination conducted at the autopsy . It concluded that , apart from small , fresh , traumatic abrasions on the ankle and the old purple ecchymosis on the front of the chest , no other traumatic injuries were identified . The fresh haemorrhage around the sternum could be attributed to a resuscitation attempt . There was no evidence to suggest that he had died from any direct trauma . The superficial traumas on his body could be attributed to his resistance and struggle on arrest or his being put in the police vehicle , although they could have been inflicted directly . They were not independently fatal . The relatively large size of the heart , the sclerosis in the heart arteries and the signs of an old infectious disease on the membrane and muscles of the heart , pointed to a long - standing heart disease . The report concluded that , although the deceased had lived and worked actively prior to his arrest , his death within TIME of being apprehended could have been caused by cardiac arrest connected with neurohumoral changes brought about by the pressure of the incident in addition to his existing heart disease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute . He stated that at TIME on DATE PERSON had informed officers that his heart was giving him trouble and he had been taken to ORG , where he died . According to the forensic report , PERSON had had a long - standing heart disease , any superficial injuries could have occurred during his arrest and death was the result of a heart attack brought on by the pressure of the incident and his heart problem .

In an indictment dated DATE , QUANTITY police officers ( PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON ) were charged with homicide in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Hearings took place before ORG on , inter alia , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . The defendants pleaded not guilty . Oral statements were given by CARDINAL of the QUANTITY police officers ( PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) maintaining their written statements and denying any ill - treatment of PERSON . The court also heard PERSON , the father of PERSON , the applicant and Dr PERSON , the doctor on duty in the emergency ward at ORG . A written statement was obtained from ORG .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG found that it could not be established that the defendants had exerted force or used violence on PERSON or threatened him or tortured him in order to force him to confess . The superficial traumas on his body could have derived from other causes , for example , when he was arrested . The forensic reports indicated that PERSON had died from his previous heart condition being compounded by superficial traumas . However , there was no evidence proving that the traumas were caused by the accused . It acquitted the defendants on the ground of inadequate evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who had been a party to the proceedings as a complainant , did not appeal against the acquittal which became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found , in light of the written and oral evidence , the photographs and the medical opinions given by Professor PERSON and Professor PERSON , that PERSON had died rapidly , without a prolonged period of breathlessness . There were marks and abrasions on his left ankle for which there was no explanation and there was bruising and swelling on the sole of the left foot , which could not have been caused accidentally . These were consistent with the application of falaka ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The bruise in the centre of the chest had not been dated with any accuracy by histopathological means and had not been shown to be dissociated from the broken sternum . These injuries together could not have been caused by cardiac massage . ORG also disbelieved the oral evidence of officers PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that cardiac massage had been applied , noting that this had first been mentioned as having occurred when evidence was given before its delegates in DATE , DATE after the events . ORG concluded that PERSON had been subjected to torture during interrogation , which had provoked cardiac arrest and thereby caused his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to the anti - terrorism branch of ORG . A statement was taken by officers , on which her thumbprint was placed . It was headed \u201c Concerning her application for help to ORG [ institutions ] \u201d and began , \u201c The witness was asked : You are asked to explain whether you applied to ORG , if you asked for help and whether you filled in the application form . Who mediated in your application ? \u201d The statement purported to set out her explanations as to how she came to submit her application to the Commission . She confirmed that the legal aid documents had been filled in by her . In her oral evidence , which the ORG found credible and substantiated , the applicant claimed that she had been blindfolded , kicked and struck at the ORG and that the officers had told her to drop the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned a second time . A report dated DATE , signed by police officers , listed details of the applicant 's income and expenditure and confirmed her declaration of means . On this or another date , she was taken before the public prosecutor and again asked about her statement of means . No threats were made during that interview .", "CARDINAL . The Government referred to the evidence given by the police officers , the autopsy report and the report of ORG , and the oral evidence of PERSON before the ORG 's delegates .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had suffered from a pre - existing heart disease . When he was arrested , he sustained minor injuries . The bruise on his chest , which was purple and therefore old , predated his arrest . During his detention in the custody area at ORG , he was not interrogated as the operation had not yet been completed . At TIME , he called for assistance and told the custody officer that his heart was giving him trouble . The custody officer sought help from the officers of the interrogating team who were waiting nearby for the next stage of the operation . These officers put PERSON , who was having difficulty breathing , in a police van and drove him to the hospital . On the way , they stopped the van and PERSON briefly applied mouth - to - mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage . They took PERSON to the emergency ward , where they were told that he had died .", "CARDINAL . The autopsy and the report of ORG established that PERSON had not suffered any major trauma , that the broken sternum was caused by cardiac massage and that he had died of natural causes , despite all possible assistance being given .", "CARDINAL . In her evidence before the Commission delegates , PERSON had expressed the opinion that the bruise on the chest was DATE and unrelated to the broken sternum and that the oedema in the brain was indicative of a prolonged period of breathlessness prior to death . No findings could be drawn from the photographs , which were amateur and of poor quality . She did not consider the lack of proper forensic photographs to be a major deficiency . There had been no findings of ill - treatment in the ORG 's report since there was no evidence of such . Cardiac arrest as in this case could be triggered by hormonal or environmental factors , such as extremes of temperature . If a direct blow had caused the bruise and fractured the sternum , she would have expected to see contusion and ecchymosis on the back surface of the sternum and bruising on the front and back surface of the right ventricle of the heart . While the lungs of an individual who had been breathless for TIME could generally be expected to increase to a weight of QUANTITY , this was not necessarily the case but depended on the individual ( see the summary of PERSON evidence , ORG 's report , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Professor PERSON was Professor of ORG at ORG , and was , inter alia , a Fellow of ORG Overseas Fellow of ORG Pathologists , a Fellow of ORG and a Fellow of ORG . The report was drafted , inter alia , on the basis of the domestic autopsy documents and statements and testimony of witnesses . It may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The autopsy findings indicated that PERSON suffered from pre - existing natural heart disease , namely , chronic inflammation involving pericardial adhesions , which was old and inactive . In the distant past , he might have suffered from rheumatic heart disease , which would have manifested itself at that time as an acute febrile illness , without necessarily any symptoms of heart involvement . The heart was enlarged , weighing CARDINAL g , showing that the heart muscle had increased to compensate .", "CARDINAL . A heart with a weight greater than CARDINAL g might give rise to sudden unexpected death at any time as a consequence of an abnormality of heart rhythm . This might be precipitated by physical or emotional stress or occur apparently spontaneously without any precipitating event .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the heart disease , there were CARDINAL injuries .", "At the front of the right armpit , there were CARDINAL abrasions , each QUANTITY by QUANTITY and described as dried and parchmented . It was not apparent whether they had been dissected to discover if there was any associated bruising but , given the description , it was reasonable to accept they were post - mortem changes .", "There were CARDINAL grazes measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY on the front of the left ankle and described as fresh and bloody . It appeared that these must have been caused during the period of police detention , but their location and size did not point to any specific cause .", "There was a QUANTITY by QUANTITY bruise in the centre of the chest , which was described as old and purple in colour .", "The sternum was fractured , with fresh bleeding in adjacent soft tissues .", "CARDINAL . The bruise to the chest directly overlay the fracture to the sternum . The haemorrhage around the fracture suggested that the fracture was produced before and not after death . The production of such a fracture would be sufficient to induce an abnormality in the rhythm of the underlying heart and thus cause a sudden death . Consequently , the fracture of the sternum represented a possible cause of death . While , theoretically , a fracture could be produced by DATE , it would be unusual , requiring impact on a raised object or edge and it would be associated with injuries to other parts of the body . Cardiac massage could also produce a fracture if very considerable force was applied . The fracture could also have been produced by a blow . In that case , bruising of the skin would be expected , even if the death which followed was rapid . Although Dr PERSON characterised the bruise on the chest as old and by implication as resulting from a different event , his own view was that , given that the bruise directly overlay the fracture , it would require compelling medical evidence to conclude that they were unrelated . PERSON opinion on the age of the bruise was based on the subjective , naked - eye assessment of the colour . However , the bruise was described as purple , which was entirely consistent with a fresh bruise . A bruise DATE would have been expected to have developed a yellowish tinge . A simple histopathological test would have clearly established whether it was a fresh bruise or an old bruise . Such a bruise would not have occurred as a result of the hand pressure applied during cardiac massage . His opinion was that , given the contiguity of the bruise and fracture and the absence of any clear evidence that the bruise occurred on a separate occasion , the bruise and fracture occurred at the same time as a result of a blow , which precipitated an abnormality of heart rhythm .", "CARDINAL . The autopsy findings , in particular the weight of the lungs ( CARDINAL g each , that is , close to the minimum ) indicated that the death was very rapid rather than prolonged . In individuals dying slowly with gradual heart failure , a lung weight of CARDINAL g was common and CARDINAL g could occur . This was the result of accumulation of fluid in the lungs consequent on the failure of the pumping action of the heart and was expressed clinically by breathlessness and difficulty in breathing . Deaths involving instantaneous collapse were associated with light lung weight as in this case . A relatively slow death would also be associated with a congested liver . Thus , the autopsy findings and histopathological examination weighed heavily against the possibility of a prolonged dying period with symptoms of breathlessness and pointed rather towards a rapid death .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the autopsy procedures , these were seriously deficient . Although the CARDINAL theoretical possibilities for the fracture were external heart massage or a blow , no steps were taken to establish conclusively whether or not massage had been performed . The statement in the autopsy report that it could have been caused by massage did not represent a full and frank statement and could be misread to imply that PERSON had knowledge that such resuscitation was attempted whereas he did not . He should have distinguished fact from speculation . There was also a need to include as much descriptive detail as possible concerning the bruise , fracture and heart disease and in this respect the detail was manifestly insufficient .", "CARDINAL . In the addendum of CARDINAL DATE , there was an analysis of the CARDINAL photographs , which were described as being of poor quality . However , the photograph of the soles of the feet nonetheless showed a distinctive purple - red discolouration of the sole of the left foot , with mild swelling . The right little toe had a white glistening band at its base . The discolouration of the instep and sole of the left foot was strongly suggestive of bruising with associated minor swelling and was not consistent with post - mortem gravitational pooling of blood . Bruising of this extent could not be produced as a result of post - mortem injury and injury in such a location was unlikely to be caused by a fall sustained while the victim was alive . Therefore the injury was strongly suggestive of CARDINAL or more blows to the foot . The mark to the right little toe was strongly suggestive of a ligature mark , although there was no congestion such as to suggest tight application of a ligature while the victim was alive ; nor was the appearance suggestive of the passage of electricity . Neither possibility could be excluded and the mark was unusual .", "CARDINAL . The red injuries to the front of the left ankle , taken with the injuries to the sole of the left foot , suggested that the ankles were restrained by a mechanism across the front of both ankles and that , so restrained , the person was struck on the sole of his left foot .", "CARDINAL . The marks in the right armpit were not clearly shown . Their position , alignment and colouration were not what would normally be expected of post - mortem artefactual injury and raised the possibility of an electrical contact mark produced while the victim was alive . Combined with the unusual marking to the right little toe , it raised the suspicion of the use of electricity with CARDINAL terminal tied round the little toe and the other terminal applied to the right armpit . Whether or not the marks were electrical burns could have been established by histopathological examination .", "CARDINAL . The photograph of the back showed post - mortem artefactual staining , with white areas of contact pallor . There were distinct marks , including a bright red abrasion at the spine at waist level and above this CARDINAL dark reddish marks . Above these was a horizontal line of pink bruising or abrasion . All these could be post - mortem injuries , caused by the manipulation of the body over a rough or cutting surface . They could also have been caused before death . To distinguish the CARDINAL would have required dissection .", "CARDINAL . The photographs indicated that the autopsy dissection was inadequate in that the back was not dissected , nor were the sole of the left foot or the injuries to the ankle . It was not clear whether the injury to the armpit was dissected . They also indicated that the description of the body in the autopsy was incomplete .", "CARDINAL . This report was drawn up by Professor PERSON , instructed by the ORG 's delegates ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on the basis of the domestic medical evidence , the witness testimonies , the reports of Professor PERSON and the photographs supplied by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the photographs , the variation in colour or mottling on the foot represented bruising . He considered that the photograph was too blurred to conclude that the white glistening band on the right little toe was associated with a ligature nor could he reach any conclusion that the marks in the right armpit were the result of the application of electrical devices . On the legs , he noted , in addition to the marks which could correspond to the abrasions on the left ankle , small areas of reddening on the front and inner side of the right ankle . He agreed with Professor PERSON 's findings on the back and noted in addition other areas of redness . Without the benefit of a dissection and/or histology of the dissection , the nature of the marks was uncertain . They could have been caused before death or be a post - mortem phenomenon . Bruising of the soles of the feet was relatively unusual and represented at least moderately severe force . Beating on the sole of the foot could cause such bruising . A person with such an injury would not be able to walk without at least an obvious limp .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the ageing of the chest bruise , recent authors in forensic medicine agreed that caution should be exercised . It was not practicable to construct an accurate calendar of colour changes as was done in earlier textbooks as there were too many variables . If the purple colour of the chest bruise was relied on to distinguish its age from the \u201c fresh \u201d haemorrhage around the sternal fracture , this was an invalid conclusion . The materials did not permit a distinction in age to be drawn between the CARDINAL . A recent study issued to show the level of disagreement amongst authors concluded that the only point of agreement was that a bruise with identifiable yellowing was TIME . Thus , the purple bruise could be fresh ( that is , TIME ) but could be older .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the broken sternum , there had been no complaint of chest pain so one could infer that it occurred shortly before or around the time of death . His view was that there was a coincidence of CARDINAL injuries ( the bruise and the fracture ) which could not be distinguished in age , or there was just one injury . If there was no chest bruise when PERSON was taken into custody , the issue was relatively easily resolved . Most pathologists would tend to regard them , prima facie , as one injury or state that there was a rebuttable presumption that they were one injury . As regarded the possibility of the bruising and fractured sternum being caused by an attempt at resuscitation , significant chest bruising was rare in this context . Sternal fractures caused by cardiopulmonary resuscitation were usually associated with fractured ribs and not with surrounding haemorrhage or overlying bruising . If the chest bruise and fracture with accompanying haemorrhage were the result of CARDINAL trauma , it was not CARDINAL associated with a resuscitation attempt . A fracture from a fall onto a flat surface would be unusual . A heavy direct fall onto a relatively smooth broad protrusion could cause such an injury but he had no recollection of having seen this as an isolated accidental injury ( that is , without injuries to other parts of the body occurring at the same time ) . A blow from a fist , knee or foot could also cause such an injury .", "CARDINAL . Lungs with oedema sufficient to be regarded as a sign of heart failure and to cause breathlessness of TIME weighed QUANTITY g. The lung weights in this case fitted with a substantially more rapid death . The oedema found in the brain was not significant , the weight of the victim 's brain being slightly under the average brain weight for a man of his age .", "CARDINAL . The finding of underlying heart disease was undisputed . In his view , the best explanation for the death was as follows . Before he died , PERSON sustained significant traumas to the sole of his left foot and to the front of his chest , causing bruising and prima facie fracturing the sternum and causing a surrounding haemorrhage . Fear and pain associated with these events resulted in a surge of adrenalin increasing the heart rate and raising blood pressure . This put a severe strain on an already compromised heart , which caused cardiac arrest and a rapid death . Alternatively , the compression of the chest associated with the fracturing of the sternum fatally disturbed the rhythm of the heart without leaving observable damage . The weakness of this opinion lay in the conclusion that the chest injuries represented CARDINAL trauma rather than CARDINAL , and this depended partly on circumstantial factors and could not be completely resolved . However , even allowing for the possibility that they were separate injuries , the chest bruise could still be regarded as fresh and as having occurred while in custody , in which case the formal cause of death would be the same , namely , cardiac arrest in a man with heart disease following the occurrence of injuries to the left foot and chest . If the fractured sternum was regarded as due to an attempt at resuscitation , the cause of death would only change if it was concluded that the bruise occurred prior to being taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . The critical task of an autopsy in this case was to evaluate the circumstances in which it was proposed that this man died , in particular , whether it was a natural death in custody or not . In this evaluation , the age of the chest bruise was critical . Even allowing for PERSON view of the age based on colour , the autopsy should have been conducted in a way which allowed another pathologist at another time to come to his or her own view . Important observations had to be justified objectively . In the absence of photographs , histology was the obvious way for PERSON to establish the truth of his view . The lack of proper photographs had also seriously impeded the investigation and evaluation of this case . Deficiencies also appeared in the insufficient subcutaneous dissection to seek out bruises not visible externally and the absence of a histological examination of the lesions critical to the proper evaluation of the circumstances of the death .", "CARDINAL . Professor PERSON had met Professor PERSON professionally . He had not met either PERSON or PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a ORG employee to subject anyone to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) .
