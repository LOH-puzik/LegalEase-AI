He is a practising lawyer by profession and presents his own case before the ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the car , of which the applicant is the registered owner , was parked illegally in a street in the nineteenth district of GPE . CARDINAL sets of proceedings ensued .", "On DATE ORG ( NORP der PERSON ) ordered the applicant pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) to disclose the full name and address of the person who had driven the car on DATE .", "The applicant replied that he had not left the car to anybody on that date .", "On DATE ORG issued a penal order ( PERSON ) in which it sentenced the applicant under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) with TIME imprisonment in default . It found that he had failed to give the requested information .", "The applicant appealed on DATE , submitting in particular that any obligation to give more detailed information than he had given would be incompatible with his right not to incriminate himself as well as with the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by LAW . In submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant added that meanwhile on DATE ORG had issued a penal order for illegal parking against him ( see below ) . He argued that the information he had actually given had , thus , had the effect of incriminating him .", "On DATE ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . Referring to the wording of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , it found that the applicant , by stating that he had not left the car to anyone at the material time , had failed to give the information requested . As to the applicant 's argument that the obligation to disclose who had been driving his car at a certain time violated his right not to incriminate himself , the Panel observed that the relevant sentence in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL had constitutional rank . In this connection it also referred to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see below \u2013 relevant domestic law and practice ) .", "Subsequently , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) . He argued that if ORG view was correct he would be obliged to incriminate himself by stating that he had driven the car .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant 's complaint . Having regard to its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , it considered that the applicant 's complaint did not offer sufficient prospects of success . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "The applicant did not lodge a complaint with ORG .", "On DATE ORG issued a provisional penal order against the applicant , finding that he had parked his car contrary to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of FAC ( Strassenverkehrsordnung ) on DATE and imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL with TIME imprisonment on him .", "The applicant filed an objection . Subsequently , on DATE ORG ordered him pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to disclose the full name and address of the person who had driven the car on DATE ( see above ) .", "On DATE ORG issued a penal order against the applicant , finding that he had illegally parked his car on DATE . He had thereby violated sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) and QUANTITY ( a ) of FAC and was liable to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL with TIME imprisonment in default .", "The applicant appealed on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It noted , inter alia , that the applicant had not contested that he had parked the car . It found that the imposition of a fine for failure to disclose the driver of the car did not in all circumstances prevent the authority from imposing a fine for the traffic offence in respect of which the request to disclose the driver had been made .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant 's complaint for lack of sufficient prospects of success . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "Again , the applicant did not lodge a complaint with ORG .", "By virtue of LAW ( Bundesverfassungsgesetz ) , ORG has jurisdiction to hear , inter alia , applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful . Pursuant to LAW the application may be brought by any person claiming a violation of his or her rights by the administrative decision , provided that all other remedies have been exhausted .", "Pursuant to section DATE of LAW ( Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz ) , in the version in force at the material time , ORG could decline to deal with an application against a decision of ORG , if the fine imposed did not exceed ATS CARDINAL and if no important legal problem was at stake . An important legal problem arises in particular , if ORG deviated from ORG case - law , if case - law on the issue does not exist , or if ORG case - law on the issue is not uniform .", "Section CARDINAL of the same LAW provides that , save as otherwise provided , ORG must either dismiss an application as ill - founded or quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful , by reason of its contents , because of a lack of jurisdiction by the authority which gave it , or on account of a breach of procedural rules .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the same LAW provides that , if ORG quashed the impugned decision the administrative authorities are bound by its legal view .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW as amended in DATE ( ORG ) provides as follows :", "The ultimate sentence of this provision was enacted as a provision of constitutional rank after ORG had , in its judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE quashed previous similar provisions on the ground that they were contrary to LAW which prohibits inter alia that a suspect be obliged on pain of a fine to incriminate himself .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE . CARDINAL ) ORG found that the first to third sentences of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW as amended in DATE were , like the previous provisions , contrary to the right not to incriminate oneself which flowed from LAW and from LAW but were saved by the ultimate sentence of that provision which had constitutional rank . In reaching that conclusion ORG had examined whether the ultimate sentence of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL was contrary to the guiding principles of the constitution , but had found that this was not the case .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , provided that a fine of up to ORG CARDINAL with DATE imprisonment in default could be imposed on a person who violates the regulations of this Act .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of FAC ( Strassenverkehrsordnung ) provides that it is prohibited to stop or park a vehicle within any area delimited by the traffic sign \u201c stopping and parking prohibited \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW in the version in force at the material time , provided that anyone who , as driver of a vehicle , violated the regulations of this LAW committed an administrative offence and was liable to a fine of up to ATS CARDINAL,CARDINAL with DATE imprisonment in default ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
