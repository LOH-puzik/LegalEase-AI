Neither the prison authorities nor the prosecutors responded to their calls .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , members of the security forces arrived at the prison in large numbers . Using the furniture in their dormitories the inmates unsuccessfully tried to block the doors to stop the soldiers from coming in . The soldiers locked the windows to the prison cells , set fire to the cell doors and tried to confine the inmates in CARDINAL part of the prison , measuring QUANTITY . The applicants PERSON and PERSON suffered burns in the fire . When the inmates were confined in the same QUANTITY the soldiers used tear gas and various other chemical gases on them .", "CARDINAL . A hole was opened in the walls of this room with a digger . When the digger went through the hole and into the room the applicant Mr PERSON waved his arm at the operator of the machinery , trying to tell him to withdraw the digger . The operator saw Mr PERSON but proceeded , tearing off Mr Sa\u00e7\u0131l\u0131k \u2019s left arm from above his elbow . The severed arm was not collected by the authorities with a view to preserving and reattaching it , but was left there in the rubble .

Furthermore , a gas bomb detonated nearby seriously damaged the applicant PERSON right hand and eardrum .", "CARDINAL . The soldiers then started beating the inmates , dragging them on the floor , sexually assaulting female detainees and threatening them with rape . The detainees were then handcuffed , with their hands behind their backs , and were kept in that position for DATE TIME . The beatings continued even after the detainees were handcuffed . The soldiers attempted to insert a truncheon and a fluorescent light stick into the anuses and vaginas of the applicants PERSON and PERSON and started raiding the detainees\u2019 personal belongings .", "CARDINAL . The injured detainees , some with life - threatening injuries , were subsequently taken to hospital . However , it was too late for PERSON arm to be stitched back on , so he permanently lost his arm . The health of a number of other applicants also worsened because of the delays .

They warned the prisoners and asked them to stop rioting . CARDINAL prisoners complied with the soldiers\u2019 instructions , but the remaining ones , including the applicants , continued to riot . They barricaded themselves in , opened fire , set fire to the dormitories and corridors , attacked members of the security forces with hand - made harpoons and iron bars and threw various explosive and corrosive chemicals at them . CARDINAL gendarmes were injured as a result of the attacks .", "CARDINAL . As soon as members of the security forces managed to pass the barricades , the prisoners moved to the next dormitory after setting fire to the one they had been in . At that point the soldiers opened holes in the ceilings of the dormitory where the prisoners had gathered , and threw in tear gas canisters with a view to stopping the riots and minimising further damage .", "CARDINAL . A total of CARDINAL holes were opened . The applicant PERSON was injured when a machine was opening the holes .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the operation a search was carried out . A number of documents belonging to an illegal organisation , CARDINAL iron bars , CARDINAL wooden bars , CARDINAL hand - made objects used for cutting and digging holes , CARDINAL saws , CARDINAL pairs of scissors and CARDINAL hammers were found during the search .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the severe damage caused to the prison building , CARDINAL security force personnel , CARDINAL prison guards , CARDINAL civilian and QUANTITY prisoners were wounded during the operation . The QUANTITY wounded prisoners were taken to hospitals . When CARDINAL other prisoners refused to go to hospital for medical checks , CARDINAL doctors were taken to the prison to provide medical assistance to them .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant PERSON alleged that she had been raped with a truncheon , the medical reports pertaining to her examination revealed that her hymen was intact .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In his letter of CARDINAL DATE the governor of ORG informed the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office about ORG president \u2019s letter .

On DATE the ORG public prosecutor asked ORG to ensure the attendance of the CARDINAL detainees at the hearing , if necessary by forceful means . The same day ORG asked a number of other military headquarters , including the special forces at the GPE and ORG , to assist them in an operation to be carried out in FAC DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to incident reports drawn up by soldiers on DATE , the soldiers went to the prison in TIME and asked the QUANTITY detainees to leave the prison and go to the hearing . When this request met with the ORG refusal , the soldiers entered the prison and saw that the inmates had barricaded themselves in their dormitories using their bunk - beds , tables , lockers and other furniture . When the inmates were all confined in CARDINAL room , the walls of the room were demolished and the soldiers threw in gas canisters . However , the inmates covered their heads with wet fabrics to protect themselves from the effects of the gas , before proceeding to throw the gas canisters back at the soldiers .

On DATE a colonel at ORG in GPE wrote to the ORG public prosecutor informing him that exorbitant sums of compensation were being awarded to the inmates by administrative courts despite the absence of a court decision placing criminal responsibility on the administration and despite the fact that the operation in question had been conducted with a view to protecting the right to life and quelling riots staged by prisoners acting under orders from illegal organisations . The colonel added that there was a need for the investigation to be concluded as soon as possible so that it could be established whether or not the administration was at fault . He asked the prosecutor to provide him with information about the investigation .", "CARDINAL . In his decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON public prosecutor decided not to prosecute any members of the security forces . The prosecutor noted that the driver of the digger which had severed ORG arm had subsequently been tried for , and acquitted of , the offence of causing bodily injury by recklessness . The prosecutor also noted that a number of doctors and nurses working at the hospital where PERSON had been treated had also been tried for neglecting their duties , but had been acquitted . Criminal proceedings brought against the inmates for causing a riot , on the other hand , were still pending .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor considered that the soldiers\u2019 intervention had become unavoidable as a result of the actions of inmates who had refused to surrender but had instead gone on to set fire to the objects in their dormitories and to attack the soldiers with wooden sticks and iron bars . PERSON arm had been severed when he had tried to throw bricks at the soldiers through the hole in the prison wall opened by the digger .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor observed that , according to the medical reports , all applicants had suffered various injuries , preventing them from working for different periods . Although PERSON had alleged that she had been raped with a truncheon , the medical reports showed that her hymen was intact . There was no medical evidence of any sexual assault of the other female detainees and , as such , their allegations of sexual abuse were unfounded .", "CARDINAL . In the prosecutor \u2019s opinion , the soldiers had had to resort to the use of force in order to quell the ORG riot , and the amount of force used had been \u201c no more than absolutely necessary \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . An objection lodged against the prosecutor \u2019s decision was rejected on CARDINAL DATE by ORG , which considered that the prosecutor \u2019s decision was in accordance with the applicable legislation and procedure .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on DATE ORG terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicants for causing a riot , as the statutory time - limit for such proceedings had been reached .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr PERSON brought proceedings against ORG and ORG , claiming TRL CARDINAL for pecuniary damage and TRL CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded that the use of heavy machinery in a prison had been unusual . Even assuming that its use had been necessary , PERSON had at that time been intoxicated by the gases used by the soldiers and had been trying to get fresh air through the hole opened by the digger . It had not been alleged that he was posing any threat to the soldiers or to the driver of the digger ; indeed that would have been most improbable given his state of health at the time . It was also clear that the driver of the digger had seen Mr PERSON but had carried on regardless . The ORG were therefore responsible for his injury caused by the use of disproportionate force . It thus awarded PERSON the sums claimed by him in full , plus statutory interest .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed . According to the applicable procedure , appeal proceedings do not affect the execution of first - instance court decisions . Thus , the total sum of ORG was paid to ORG before the appeal was decided .", "CARDINAL . The appeal lodged by ORG was upheld by ORG on DATE and the decision awarding Mr Sa\u00e7\u0131l\u0131k the compensation was quashed . The applicant \u2019s request for a rectification of that decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings were restarted before ORG , which decided on DATE to reject the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation . According to ORG , the applicant had contributed to the incidents in the prison and members of the security forces had had to restore discipline in the prison . The applicant \u2019s actions had thus severed the link of causation between the actions of the security forces and the ensuing damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment was served on the applicant , who lodged an appeal through ORG . The latter failed to transfer the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG within the statutory time - limit . Following the applicant \u2019s challenge and , having noted this administrative error , ORG granted the appeal on DATE . In the meantime , in his observations ORG at ORG opined that the applicant \u2019s appeal should be dismissed . The proceedings are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
