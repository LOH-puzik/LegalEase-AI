The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . In DATE the applicant married ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant became involved in the activities of ORG , a NORP branch of a new religious movement called PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , she divorced her husband . The permanent place of residence of the applicant 's CARDINAL daughters , ORG , born in DATE and DATE respectively , was not determined and they stayed with the applicant and her former husband in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant 's former husband brought an action requesting that his home be fixed as the place of residence of his daughters . He alleged , inter alia , that the applicant 's involvement in the PERSON religious movement could have a negative influence on the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON District Child Rights Protection Agency , having visited the father 's place of residence , concluded that the living conditions were suitable and , taking into consideration the wishes of ORG and ORG , suggested fixing their place of residence with the father . On DATE the same ORG proposed to ORG of GPE that it hear the views of the children .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG decided that , pending the proceedings , ORG should reside with the applicant , and ORG should stay with her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG moved to GPE , settling in an apartment situated in the same building as the GPE headquarters . The applicant was allowed to use that apartment free of charge . ORG stayed with her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employees of ORG ( PERSON teisi\u0173 apsaugos tarnyba ) visited the applicant 's residence . They noted the applicant 's explanation that she had CARDINAL rooms for her use , CARDINAL of them being reserved for ORG . When the applicant was absent , a nanny would take care of her . The living conditions seemed suitable for a child . However , during the interview ORG explained that she wanted to stay with her father , who took better care of her and did not leave her alone . She elaborated that her mother left her alone during DATE and that she often felt scared . The ORG then suggested fixing ORG 's place of residence with her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employees of ORG , having visited the applicant 's place of residence in GPE , concluded that it was unsafe for ORG to live there and that the applicant was not caring enough about ORG 's upbringing and education . They noted that the applicant 's living space consisted of CARDINAL room and that the kitchen was shared with other residents of the house . ORG lived in that room with her mother , both of them sleeping in the same bed . The other room , which was supposed to be part of the applicant 's living space , was apparently also used by other persons . At the time of the interview with ORG , CARDINAL teenage boys entered the room without asking for permission . According to ORG , her mother did not take care of her ; she did not have any friends and , during DATE , was left alone . The girl had to cook for herself ; she was not allowed to go to the adjoining yard and the building next to it , where her mother was meditating . The nanny would only come to take care of ORG when the applicant left for DATE . ORG expressed her wish to live in GPE with her father and sister ORG . The ORG 's workers also interviewed ORG 's kindergarten teachers . According to them , ORG was often sad about not seeing her sister and father . ORG would also be picked up from the kindergarten by DATE girl , but at the time of the interview she was going home on her own . The ORG 's workers suggested to the applicant that she find another place to live where ORG would feel safer . However , the applicant refused because she did not have to pay rent for the current flat , and it was close to her meditation centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employees of ORG again interviewed ORG , who repeated her wish to live with her father . The ORG also noted that ORG had stressed that she had made the same statement before the court of first instance and to the psychologists .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE , ORG was examined by a psychologist . Again , she expressed her wish to stay with her father and older sister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the action in part , ruling that ORG should live with the applicant 's former husband , and ORG should live with the applicant . The court noted that both parents were well educated and had sufficient salaries to provide for their daughters . In the course of the proceedings , both girls had been heard by the court as well as by a psychologist . They had both expressed their wish to stay with their father . However , the court agreed with CARDINAL of the experts that ORG ( then DATE ) was not mature enough to take a reasonable decision about her parental preferences . With respect to the applicant 's affiliation to the meditation centre , the court noted :", "\u201c ORG has refused to register [ GPE ] as a religious community , suggesting that it should be registered as [ a non governmental organisation ] . There is no indication in the case file that the meditation centre has a negative influence on children or that it propagates certain intolerable views ; nor is there any evidence that the [ applicant 's ] children are involved in the activities of the centre .", "The court concludes that [ the applicant 's ] active participation in the activities of the meditation centre does not have any negative impact on her children . In accordance with LAW , everyone is free to choose a religion or belief and ... to profess his religion , to perform religious practices , and to practise and teach his beliefs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG amended the decision , ruling that both daughters should live with their father . The court considered that too little weight had been afforded by the lower court to the express wish of ORG to live with her father . According to the appellate court , this had not complied with LAW on the Rights of the LAW or the relevant provisions of national law , which obliged the court to take into account a child 's wishes irrespective of its age . The appellate court had regard to the expert 's conclusion of DATE that the environment in which the applicant lived was unsafe , whereas the applicant 's husband was able to provide good living conditions for ORG . The recommendation by ORG to fix the place of residence of both daughters with the father was taken into account . The court also observed the girls ' wish to stay together , and to be close to other family members ( grandparents ) and friends living in GPE . Certain instances of inadequate care were noted , namely , the applicant 's failure on CARDINAL occasion to arrange for ORG 's medical assistance or to ensure her attendance at school . Finally , the appellate court observed that the first - instance court had not assessed ( nevertino ) the material submitted to ORG characterising the PERSON movement as controversial . Neither did the first - instance court give any credit to the fact that the movement had been unable to obtain registration as a religious community .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a cassation appeal , alleging , inter alia , that the court 's decision was discriminatory , and that it had failed to respect her family life . She requested that her youngest daughter , ORG , live with her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's cassation appeal . It emphasised that the rights of both parents in the education of their children were equal , regardless of their beliefs , convictions or views . The custody dispute was to be resolved taking into account the best interests of the children , in which context their wishes should be considered , regardless of their age . In assessing the significance of such wishes , the most important factor would be the children 's ability to formulate , express and substantiate their views .", "CARDINAL . ORG established that ORG had amply explained her preference to stay with her father during the entire proceedings , both in her submissions to the courts and during the interviews with the experts . She had stressed , in particular , that her mother had not taken adequate care of her , often leaving her alone and neglecting to cook meals . The girl had also expressed a preference for living in GPE , together with her sister and close to other relatives and friends . She had noted that her father spent more time with her and took better care of her . ORG emphasised that the experts had considered that the living conditions of the applicant were unsafe for children .", "CARDINAL . ORG further assessed the material conditions of accommodation offered by both parents . It was established that the applicant 's husband was able to provide his daughters with a separate room in a private cottage in the countryside near GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised the importance for the CARDINAL sisters to be brought up together , and underlined that close ties existed between them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's allegations of discrimination were dismissed as unsubstantiated . In this respect , ORG noted :", "\u201c The applicant 's claim in her cassation appeal that the appellate court had breached the principle of non - discrimination , enshrined in LAW as well as in [ NORP law ] , by wrongly assessing the evidence on ORG and taking into account that the applicant belonged to it , is unfounded . When determining the place of residence of the CARDINAL children , whose parents live separately , ORG gave priority to the interests of the children , took into account their wishes , the ability and efforts of each parent to guarantee the basic rights of the children , and each parent 's living conditions , that is to say , those conditions in which the children would have to live once their place of residence was decided . The decision of the appellate court did not contain any indication that the resolution of the dispute was influenced by the fact that the applicant was a member of [ PERSON / GPE ] ... The appellate court only noted that the first - instance court had not assessed all the evidence regarding the meditation centre . However , that does not presuppose that the appellate court considered the applicant 's membership of the centre important in the resolution of the dispute . Had that been so , such a consideration would require an assessment of whether the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion was observed . In its judgments in the cases of PERSON v. GPE and GPE - GPE v. GPE , ORG ruled that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion , enshrined in Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , had not been respected in cases where the courts had attached decisive importance to the [ applicant 's ] religious affiliation . However , when determining [ the custody dispute ] , the appellate court did not attach significance to the fact that the applicant was a member of [ PERSON / GPE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In an unrelated set of proceedings , ORG requested a court order obliging ORG to register it as a religious community . The action was granted by ORG on DATE . The court found no evidence that ORG propagated any controversial practices amongst its members . GPE was registered as a religious community on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Law on ORG ( PERSON teisi\u0173 apsaugos pagrind\u0173 \u012fstatymas ) , in force at the material time , provided that disputes arising over a child 's place of residence , in cases where the parents live separately , were to be resolved in court . It further stipulated that priority consideration had to be accorded to the interests and wishes of a child capable of expressing its own opinion as to which one of its parents it would wish to live with .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW stipulates that , in the case of a dispute over a child 's place of residence , the court is to take into consideration the wishes and interests of the child . The child 's choice in the matter may be only disregarded if it is contrary to its best interests . Under LAW , when adjudicating disputes over children , the court must hear the child capable of expressing its views and ascertain its wishes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of the Judges of ORG adopted a ruling \u201c On the application of laws in the case - law of the courts in determining the place of residence of minors when the parents are separated \u201d . The ruling reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In deciding the dispute between separated parents over a child 's place of residence , the court hearing the case must clarify and establish the following facts of legal importance :", "CARDINAL ) the opportunities and efforts of each parent to ensure the implementation of the fundamental rights and duties of the child enshrined in legal provisions ... ;", "CARDINAL ) the conditions of the environment of each parent , namely , those conditions in which a child would live once its place of residence with CARDINAL of the parents had been decided ;", "CARDINAL ) the wishes and views of the child . ...", "CARDINAL . ( ... ) The court must also find out whether a child , over whose place of residence the dispute arose , has brothers or sisters .... The separation of brothers and sisters , especially in cases where the children have strong emotional attachments to each other and where they are fond of communicating and being together , would violate the interests of the children . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
