NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is the parish priest and chairman of the board of the catholic PERSON parish ( \u201c the parish \u201d ) in GPE . The parish has CARDINAL church , with CARDINAL church bell . Since DATE the church bell has been used in order to call parishioners to the services of worship .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to call the parishioners to attend the TIME service , the applicant used to ring the church bell at TIME for TIME . On an unspecified date and following complaints of neighbouring residents that the ringing of the church bell disturbed their TIME \u2019s rest , the applicant reduced the ringing of the church bell at TIME to TIME .", "CARDINAL . As neighbouring residents had also lodged repeated complaints with the GPE municipal authorities , requesting the latter to intervene in respect of the excessive ringing of the parish church bell at TIME , the municipality carried out measurements of the sound levels involved . By letters of QUANTITY DATE and CARDINAL DATE the GPE Mayor and Aldermen ( College van Burgemeester en Wethouders ) issued warnings to the parish board , stating that the volume of the church bell ringing at TIME amounted to intolerable noise nuisance . The volume therefore had to be reduced and if the parish board failed to do so , an order for incremental penalty payments ( last onder dwangsom ) would be imposed , namely MONEY ( ORG ) for each violation to a maximum amount of LAW . The matter had further been discussed in a meeting between the applicant and representatives of the municipality on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the parish board failed to reduce the volume of the ringing of the bell in the mornings \u2013 also after a further warning by the Mayor and Aldermen on CARDINAL DATE \u2013 the GPE Mayor and Aldermen notified the parish board on DATE of their intention to impose an order for incremental penalty payments if the volume of the ringing of the bell before TIME was not reduced . According to the Mayor and Aldermen , this order was based on section QUANTITY of the DATE general municipal bye - law ( PERSON ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL of GPE ( GPE ; \u201c WOM \u201d ) . As set out in the letter accompanying the notice , the right to freedom of religion had been weighed against the interests of others in the community . It had been decided that the ringing of the church bell in TIME at the volumes measured constituted intolerable noise nuisance . Failure by the parish board to reduce the sound level in TIME would contravene section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the APV . A formal decision to this effect , having noted and taken into account the applicant \u2019s written comments on the notice of intention ( zienswijze ) , was taken on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The objection ( bezwaar ) filed by the parish against this decision was rejected by the Mayor and Aldermen on DATE . The parish filed an appeal with ORG ( rechtbank ) .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG accepted this appeal . It stated at the outset that it assumed that the appeal had been filed solely by the parish and that all legal acts undertaken by the applicant in the proceedings on the objection and appeal were done in his capacity as representative of the parish board . It found that calls to worship by ringing church bells fell within the scope of the right to freedom of religion within the meaning of LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) and that restrictions imposed on the ringing of church bells constituted an interference with that right . The municipality was nevertheless DATE on the basis of section CARDINAL ORG and for the purposes of avoiding noise nuisance \u2013 authorised to lay down rules and regulations as regards the duration and volume of the ringing of church bells provided that these did not render illusory the use of church bells or restricted it unnecessarily . ORG nonetheless quashed the impugned decision to impose penalty payments on the parish board since the legal provision on which it was based ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL APV ) could not be applied to the ringing of ( a ) church bell(s ) . ORG judgment became final since no further appeal was lodged against it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE municipality decided to amend the ORG in order to fix rules for ringing ( a ) church bell(s ) and other means of calls to worship . On DATE , section CARDINALa of the ORG entered into force . This provision reads as follows :", "\u201c TIME it is prohibited to issue a call to worship within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL of the Act on Public Manifestations by ringing ( a ) church bell(s ) or by other means if the volume exceeds the standards laid down in ORG Decree ( Besluit algemene regels voor inrichtingen milieubeheer ; \u201c Environmental Management Decree \u201d ) by CARDINAL dB(A ) and exceeds the reference volume of the surroundings by CARDINAL dB(A ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After new volume measurements had been taken on DATE in DATE , the Mayor and Aldermen again issued official warnings to the parish board as regards the sound level of the ringing of the church bell in TIME . Since the parish board was found to have failed to comply with the standards set out in section CARDINALa of the APV , the GPE Mayor and Aldermen notified the parish board on DATE of their intention to impose an order for incremental penalty payments on the parish board if it did not respect section CARDINALa of the ORG . Although invited to do so , the parish board did not file any written comments on the intention . A formal decision by the Mayor and Aldermen followed on DATE by which an incremental penalty payment of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( not exceeding a total amount of LAW ) would be imposed for each time the parish disrespected section CARDINALa of the APV after DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the parish board and the applicant failed to respect the applicable volume standards when ringing the church bell , the Mayor and Aldermen imposed an order for incremental penalty payments on DATE . An objection DATE with the parties\u2019 consent converted into a direct appeal to ORG \u2013 against this decision was lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP By judgment of DATE ORG rejected this appeal . It again found that the municipal authorities were entitled DATE on the basis of section CARDINAL of the WOM \u2013 to fix rules for the duration and volume of calls to worship . Noting , inter alia , that no restrictions applied for ringing the church bell at issue TIME and TIME and finding that it had not been demonstrated that it would be impossible to moderate the volume by making adjustments to the clapper , ORG rejected the argument that the rules at issue rendered illusory the use of church bells for calls to worship .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , was rejected on DATE . In so far as relevant , this ruling reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , everyone has the right to manifest freely his religion or belief , either individually or in community with others , without prejudice to his responsibility under the law . Under the second paragraph of this provision , rules concerning the exercise of this right outside of buildings and enclosed places may be laid down by law for the protection of health , in the interest of traffic and to combat or prevent disorders .", "Under section CARDINAL of the ORG , ringing church bells in the context of religious ... ceremonies ... as well as for calls to worship ... is permitted . In this matter , the municipal council is competent to determine rules as regards duration and volume .", "Pursuant to section CARDINALa of the ORG it is prohibited TIME to issue calls to worship within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL of the Act on Public Manifestations by means of ringing ( a ) church bell(s ) or by other means if the volume exceeds the standards laid down in LAW by CARDINAL dB(A ) and exceeds the reference volume of the surroundings by CARDINAL dB(A ) .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW , the sound for the purposes of calls to worship ... is not taken into consideration in the determination of sound levels , referred to in sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL NORP The parish priest argues that ORG has wrongfully found that section CARDINALa of the ORG is binding . According to the priest , the court has failed to appreciate that the GPE municipal council , in violation of section CARDINAL of the ORG , has not given reasons for the necessity of determining a volume restriction for the period lasting from TIME This is even more cogent since the duration of this period renders the call to worship illusory or at least restricts this unnecessarily as the morning service starts at TIME and PERCENT of the parishioners can be reached if the ringing of the church bell is muffled . In this connection , the priest further submits that muffling DATE in so far as possible in practice \u2013 requires a disproportionate effort on his part .", "The parish priest further argues that the fixed period is contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW because it is stipulated therein that the period of TIME lasts from TIME In his opinion , the manner in which section CARDINALa of the ORG has been drafted furthermore results in legal uncertainty , because it can not be deduced from this to what concrete sound volume standard of LAW the ringing of ( a ) church bell(s ) is bound .", "The parish priest claims that the only reason why the municipal council has chosen to have the period subjected to the restriction last until TIME is to oppose the church bell ringing in this concrete case . He therefore claims that section CARDINALa of the ORG does not serve the municipal interest but only the special interests of complaining neighbouring residents , thus rendering the provision also for this reason non - binding .", "CARDINAL . The second sentence of section CARDINAL of the WOM confirms that ... the municipal council may determine rules for the duration and volume of ringing church bells for the purpose of issuing calls to worship . As appears from the drafting history of this provision , this form of church bell ringing forms part of the liturgy and can be regarded as a manifestation of religious beliefs which is protected by LAW . ... A reasonable interpretation of [ this provision ] entails that this right does not imply the freedom to ring church bells without any limits as regards duration and volume . The power described in the second sentence of section CARDINAL of the ORG is aimed at the prevention of excesses where it concerns duration and volume . Legal rules determined for this purpose at a municipal level can , depending on local circumstances and needs , be adjusted to the occasions and times when the bells are to be rung . This kind of regulation of duration and volume within reasonable limits , without leading to a situation where a meaningful use of the ringing of the bell(s ) no longer remains , must be considered as not restricting the freedom of religion . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has ... rightly considered that the municipal council did not act contrary to section CARDINAL , second sentence of the ORG by limiting the volume of the church bell ringing for part of the daily TIME period . It appears from the explanatory notice on section CARDINALa of the ORG that the municipal council chose to apply the prohibition contained in that provision between TIME and TIME , because this is the time when most people enjoy their TIME \u2019s rest . TIME rest can be disturbed when calls to worship are made in a loud manner . Because a call to worship is a manifestation of everyone \u2019s right to practise freely his or her religion , some noise nuisance must , according to the municipal council , be tolerated and the prohibition only applies to excessive forms of noise nuisance with a sound level that exceeds by CARDINAL dB(A ) the standard laid down in ORG and by CARDINAL dB(A ) the sound level of the surroundings . ORG finds that the municipal council has thus sufficiently reasoned why the TIME at issue have been chosen and , after having weighed the interests involved , can be considered to have reasonably decided upon that time frame . The fact that church bell ringing at a lesser volume may reach a smaller number of parishioners to call them to attend the TIME mass than without such a restriction and that muffling the church bells meets with practical objections can not lead to a finding that no use of any significance could be made of the bells . In this connection , ORG has rightly considered that section CARDINALa of the ORG does not render illusory the possibility to practice religion as this provision does not make it impossible to ring the bells before TIME and no restrictions apply for the sound level of church bell ringing TIME and TIME", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , ORG subscribes to the finding of ORG that section CARDINALa of the ORG does not go beyond the competence set out in section CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the ORG .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . There is also no ground for holding that the choice of the period at issue violates LAW . ORG has rightly considered that it is not necessary to examine the compatibility of section CARDINALa of the ORG with LAW as this provision finds its basis in the ORG and section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW stipulates that sound for the purpose of issuing calls to worship is not taken into consideration in the determination of sound levels within the meaning of that Decree . It appears from the explanatory memorandum to that provision that this choice has been made , because the system of the LAW in conjunction with the ORG was considered to be the appropriate framework for regulating the ringing of church bells , rather than regulation in ORG .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Although LAW is not directly applicable in respect of the permissible noise levels , ORG finds that the municipal council was entitled to link it to the noise standards laid down in LAW , as this indicates in an objective sense when one can speak about noise nuisance . Contrary to what has been argued by the parish priest , it appears sufficiently clearly from the text of section CARDINALa of the APV , in which explicit reference is made to the norms set out in LAW , what volume of church bell ringing is allowed during what part of DATE . ...", "DATE . ORG also does not share the parish priest \u2019s opinion that section CARDINALa of the ORG does not serve the municipal interest . That the regulation of the duration and volume of church bell ringing can be regarded as [ pursuing ] a municipal interest already follows from the second sentence of LAW ORG in which the competence of the municipal council on this point is confirmed . In this case , the municipal interest lies concretely in the protection of the inhabitants of the municipality against disturbance of their ORG rest . The ORG provision at issue applies to all religious and other bodies who are issuing calls DATE by the ringing of bells DATE to manifest a religion or belief . Although , as correctly pointed out by him , it was the church bell ringing by the parish priest which has led to the insertion into the ORG of the provision at issue , this does not entail that no municipal interest was at stake .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above considerations , ORG has correctly found that section CARDINALa of the ORG is not non - binding . ORG has also rightly held that the municipal council \u2013 in view the noise measurements made \u2013 was correct in its finding that the parish priest had breached that provision , so that the municipal council was competent to act in a manner aimed at securing compliance with the rules . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
