The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company , which is wholly owned and administered by the second applicant , bought shares in a housing corporation on DATE . Later the applicants found out that the same shares had been given as security by company X. which had been declared bankrupt . They also found out that the whole of the real estate had been placed under an interdiction against sale or dispersal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company initiated an action for damages in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) against the bank and the bank director responsible for selling the shares , claiming compensation for the loss of the shares . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim as premature without considering the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company initiated , together with the other share holders , a new action for damages against the bank as the rules on civil procedure had changed in the meantime . The company claimed that the damage had been caused by a bank manager and that the bank as employer was liable for its employees . Allegedly , the bank manager had given incorrect information , had not acted diligently but in breach of good banking practice and was guilty of criminal conduct . The company claimed that the bank was obliged to compensate , inter alia , by reimbursing the purchase price of the shares , the condominium charges paid to the housing corporation and the company \u2019s legal expenses incurred in the criminal case .", "CARDINAL . The case was postponed pending the outcome of other civil proceedings related to the present case . The final judgment in those proceedings was rendered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the conclusion of the above - mentioned civil proceedings , the present case was postponed once more pending the outcome of criminal proceedings which had been brought against the representatives of the bank and which concerned the same sale of shares . The ORG judgment in the criminal proceedings was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In letters dated DATE and DATE and addressed to ORG , the applicant company requested that , despite the pending appeal against the judgment in the criminal case , the consideration of the present case be resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company also informed ORG that the shares in the housing corporation had been declared part of the bankruptcy estate of company X. pursuant to the above - mentioned final judgment of DATE . The shares were thus worthless since the housing company was de facto bankrupt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant bank requested that the proceedings remain adjourned pending the outcome of criminal proceedings since the proceedings were still pending on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a preparatory meeting . On DATE it decided to adjourn the proceedings pending the final outcome of the criminal proceedings . According to the court , it was important to await that outcome as the question of criminal liability formed the basis of the civil proceedings and the cases partly overlapped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal with ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the ORG decision of DATE be annulled and that the civil proceedings be immediately resumed . It claimed that , due to the adjournment , the proceedings would necessarily last over DATE and that , as a result , the excessive length of the proceedings would violate its rights under LAW . It requested that the proceedings in ORG be examined urgently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant company \u2019s appeal did not give reason to take any action .", "CARDINAL . By an appeal dated DATE the applicant company appealed against this decision to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , which refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company filed a written statement dated DATE informing ORG that the criminal proceedings had been terminated by a final judgment given on DATE and requesting the resumption of the civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged a request to intervene in his own name in the proceedings before ORG and claimed compensation . The applicants presented as written evidence a deed of sale with which the second applicant had purchased the said shares of the housing corporation from the applicant company on DATE and with which the claim for compensation had been transferred to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court held an oral hearing in the case on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG first rejected the second applicant \u2019s request to intervene and found that the first applicant was the correct plaintiff . The court rejected the remainder of the complaints and considered that the circumstances of the sale of the shares and the documents relating to it were so obscure that the risk involved in the purchase had been apparent . Moreover , the court found no causal link between the acts of the defendant bank and the damage suffered by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . By an appeal dated DATE , the applicants appealed to ORG , requesting that ORG judgment be quashed . By a letter dated DATE , the applicants asked the appellate court to accelerate the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the rightful owner of the shares was the second applicant and that , consequently , only the second applicant could claim damages . The court noted , however , that the defendant bank had already paid compensation and interest due from DATE onwards . Since the second applicant had claimed damages in his own name only on DATE , he no longer had any claims against the bank . ORG thus rejected the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant bank appealed to ORG , complaining about the partial rejection by ORG of its claim for costs and expenses . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
