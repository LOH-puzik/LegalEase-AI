The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order , likewise his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent , numerous applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful .

They attached importance to the complexity of the case , the significant number of persons involved and the voluminous documentation . They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , especially the need to verify evidence from suspects and witnesses justified holding him in custody and that the applicant , if released , could obstruct the proper course of the proceedings . The courts found no special grounds that would justify lifting the detention and imposing a less severe measure .
