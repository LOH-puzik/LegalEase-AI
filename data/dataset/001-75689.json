CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( decision of DATE ) , concerning proceedings in the social courts .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL PBvU CARDINAL ) , adopted by a majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , ORG , sitting as a full court , called upon the legislature to create a remedy in respect of infringements of the right to be heard by a court . The final part of the decision contains the following passage :", "\u201c To redress certain deficiencies in the system of judicial protection , the courts have allowed the creation of special remedies partly outside the scope of written law . These remedies do not satisfy the requirements of constitutional law regarding the transparency of legal remedies [ PERSON ] . Remedies must be provided for in the written legal order and the conditions for their use must be visible to citizens . \u201d", "In ORG view , the principle of the transparency of legal remedies resulted from the principle of legal certainty ( PERSON ) , which was an integral part of the rule of law . ORG had to be in a position to assess whether a remedy could be used and , if so , under what conditions .", "\u201c The current system of special remedies in respect of violations of the right to be heard by a court does not comply with this principle of transparency . Doubts thus exist as to whether a special remedy has to be used first or whether a complaint should be lodged immediately with ORG . To avoid forfeiting their rights of appeal , litigants often avail themselves of both remedies at the same time . Such constraints provide a clear illustration of the shortcomings of special remedies in terms of the rule of law . At the same time they create an unnecessary burden for citizens and the courts .", "The shortcomings referred to above preclude ORG from making the admissibility of a constitutional complaint contingent on the use of such special remedies . They are not among the remedies that must be used for the purposes of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . In so far as such an approach has hitherto been adopted by ORG , it can no longer be pursued . ... \u201d", "In a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG nevertheless declined to examine a constitutional complaint by a prisoner concerning the length of proceedings before a court responsible for the execution of sentences , holding that the complainant should first have lodged a complaint alleging inaction . After observing that some courts accepted such a remedy only where the lack of activity could be deemed to amount to a final rejection of the initial application , ORG pointed out that other courts applied less stringent criteria . It concluded :", "\u201c This remedy was not bound to fail in advance . The complainant could have been expected to attempt it . He should first have sought judicial protection from the appropriate courts , even if the admissibility of a remedy was the subject of dispute in the case - law and among legal writers and there was consequently some doubt as to whether the court in question would accept it or not . \u201d", "In case no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( decision of DATE ) , the division of ORG responsible for supervising the execution of sentences had remained inactive despite several requests to expedite the proceedings and despite a decision in which ORG had held that their length was unlawful . ORG declared the constitutional complaint admissible in so far as it concerned the court \u2019s inaction but dismissed it in so far as it concerned the impossibility for ORG to give a ruling in place of ORG in order to put an end to the lack of activity . ORG persistent inaction did not show that the legislative framework failed to satisfy the requirements of LAW . Besides the possibility of a finding by the appellate court that such inaction was unlawful , there were other remedies for restoring the proper administration of justice , namely an appeal to a higher authority and an action for damages against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The special remedy of a complaint alleging inaction ( ausserordentliche Unt\u00e4tigkeitsbeschwerde ) has been recognised according to varying criteria by a number of courts of appeal . While some have accepted it where there have been significant delays , others have limited its application to cases in which the court \u2019s inactivity can not be objectively justified and amounts to a denial of justice . Decisions falling into the latter category include those delivered by ORG on CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in which the remedy was found to be admissible only if the court \u2019s decision amounted to a denial of justice ) and CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in which the remedy was found to be admissible in respect of an unjustified delay by the lower court in dealing with an application for legal aid ) . ORG , for its part , has to date left open the question whether , in exceptional cases and with due regard to constitutional law , a special complaint may be allowed in respect of arbitrary inaction that could be construed as a denial of justice on the part of a lower court ( see the decisions of CARDINAL DATE ( no . AnwZ ( B ) CARDINAL ) and DATE ( no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government have cited several decisions in which a court of appeal has allowed a special complaint alleging inaction and has called on the lower court to continue its examination of the case ( decisions of ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL WF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG ( CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL UF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL WF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) or has referred the case back to it ( ORG decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) . More recent decisions have clarified the consequences of a complaint alleging inaction . For example , in CARDINAL decisions of DATE ( nos . CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG allowed such a remedy not only where there had been unjustifiable inactivity amounting to a denial of justice , but also where the delay complained of was likely to be prejudicial to a parent claiming parental responsibility , or to the child \u2019s well - being . It observed that it could not take the place of the family court , even if this was the most efficient manner of proceeding . Nor could it impose a procedural timetable on the lower court , since unforeseen circumstances might arise . The action it could take was limited to calling on the court to expedite the proceedings as much as possible . However , to give more substance to its order , it set the court deadlines for dealing with an objection to an expert , for giving the expert DATE in which to produce his report or , otherwise , appointing a new one , for interviewing the parents and child and for arranging a hearing . ORG delivered a similar decision on the same subject on DATE ( no . CARDINAL WF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In other cases courts of appeal have given decisions in place of the lower courts on account of the delays observed and in so far as the case was ready for decision ( decisions of ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL WF CARDINAL ) and ORG ( DATE , no . CARDINAL Ta CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG refused to examine a constitutional complaint on the following grounds , inter alia :", "\u201c ... The constitutional complaint is inadmissible in so far as the complainant is asking ORG to award him damages for the excessive length of the proceedings in issue . If a complainant seeks compensation for pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage sustained by him as a result of an infringement of his fundamental rights , he must first exhaust the remedies available in the civil courts . It is for those courts to assess , where appropriate , the extent to which the provisions on the ORG \u2019s liability ( LAW and those deriving from LAW as incorporated in domestic law form a basis for awarding compensation for the excessive length of proceedings ... \u201d", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , unreported ) , ORG confirmed that position :", "\u201c In so far as the constitutional complaint concerns ORG decision of DATE and that court \u2019s alleged inaction , it has become inadmissible because ORG has in the meantime given judgment .", "The complainant is not entitled to seek an ex post facto finding of a violation of LAW on account of the excessive length of the proceedings . There is no statutory basis in constitutional law for applying to have a court decision set aside because of the excessive length of the proceedings , or for seeking damages on that account . Setting aside ORG judgment of DATE would not remedy the violation of LAW resulting from the excessive length of the proceedings but would simply delay them further ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government cited a judgment delivered by the GPE ORG on DATE ( no . CARDINAL O CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The case concerned an action for damages in which the claimant alleged that ORG had remained inactive for DATE . He had lodged a special complaint with ORG alleging inaction on that account . Shortly afterwards , ORG made an interlocutory order in the proceedings , with the result that the complainant informed ORG that his complaint alleging inaction had lost its purpose and that his claim now related solely to the reimbursement of his legal fees . The president of a division of ORG replied that as no official proceedings had been instituted before it \u2013 the complaint alleging inaction being a special remedy \u2013 it was unnecessary to rule on the question of costs . ORG granted the claimant approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damages for the legal fees incurred within the limits of the applicable rates . The court further noted that the claimant had satisfied the conditions in LAW by having appealed to a higher authority before bringing his action before it .", "ORG , however , awarded compensation in a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL O CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) for damage sustained as a result of the length of proceedings in ORG after ORG had found their length to be unlawful ( decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It pointed out that State liability was not precluded by the \u201c judicial privilege \u201d enshrined in the first sentence of LAW , since that rule did not apply in the event of inaction on the court \u2019s part .
