It also noted that the article dealt with the issue of the Prince having fathered the child over CARDINAL pages inside the magazine , by means of an interview in which the questions led Ms Coste to discuss her relationship with the Prince , the couple \u2019s feelings , the Prince \u2019s private life and reactions and the child \u2019s recognition before a notary . It emphasised that the magazine had deliberately chosen numerous photographs , taken in the context of the intimacy of the protagonists\u2019 private life , to illustrate and lend support to the disclosure , and that these photographs were accompanied by the magazine \u2019s own captions , which also referred to the Prince \u2019s love life and the circumstances in which he met the interviewee , analysing his conduct and his reactions to the young woman and the child , and speculating as to his feelings with regard to this secret child .", "CARDINAL . The TGI held that the entire article , including the accompanying photographs , fell within the most intimate sphere of love and family life and that it did not concern any debate of general interest .

The applicants appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a press release of DATE the Prince publicly acknowledged that he was the father of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the immediate enforcement of the DATE \u2019s judgment with regard to the order to publish the court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment . It noted that , through the interview with PERSON , the impugned article focused on disclosing the birth of the child , who was presented as having been born from the intimate relationship between the interviewee and the Prince from DATE onwards . It also noted that although the latter might already have made a statement recognising the child in a notary \u2019s office \u2013 that is , in deliberately chosen conditions of confidentiality \u2013 by the time that the article was published , this statement had not given rise to a note in the margin of the child \u2019s birth certificate , with the result that his birth and his father \u2019s identity remained unknown to the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG also stated that a person \u2019s affections , love life or family life and issues of paternity and maternity came within the sphere of private life and were protected by LAW and LAW , and that those provisions made no distinction between anonymous persons and public figures , whatever their civil , political or religious functions . It noted , however , that this principle allowed for an exception whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their potential impact or consequences given the status or function of the persons concerned , in which case the duty to provide information took precedence over respect for private life .", "CARDINAL . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c Given that the fact of PERSON fatherhood had never been publicly recognised , that LAW makes it impossible for a child born out of wedlock to accede to the throne and that PERSON had not consented to the disclosure of his possible paternity of ORG child , since on DATE he had indicated to ORG PERSON his opposition to the publication of those facts , it follows that PERSON deliberately breached the provisions of LAW and of LAW , without being able to justify this offence on the inexistent requirements of current - affairs reporting , the legitimacy of the information or its readers\u2019 right to information , which did not include PERSON secret paternity , even if he had become the reigning Prince of the Principality on his father \u2019s death in DATE ;", "This interference in his private sphere , in that the article did not merely disclose the existence of a \u201c secret \u201d child but also contained numerous digressions derived from ORG confessions concerning the circumstances of their meeting , the respondent \u2019s feelings , his most intimate reactions in response to the news of ORG pregnancy and his attitude towards the child during private encounters in her flat , could not be justified by the concomitant publication of these facts in the magazine PERSON , or by the media impact caused by the content of the article , or by the fact that other publications had subsequently repeated these reports ( which had become common knowledge through the fault of the publishing company ) , or by the alleged legitimacy of such a disclosure , given that the child had no official status which would have rendered his birth and the disclosure of the father \u2019s identity a subject which the media and specifically the company ORG , were required as part of their duty to provide information , to bring to the public \u2019s attention , or by the fact that PERSON , faced DATE against his will \u2013 with the media impact of the disclosure of information about his private life that he had intended to keep secret if not confidential , has been obliged to provide a public explanation , or by the tone of the article , which , as LOC irrelevantly specifies , was intended to show the respondent in a particularly positive light ;", "Although the photographs showing the child with the respondent which accompany the article were taken by PERSON with PERSON consent , and although PERSON , the only person having parental responsibility for the child , handed them over to ORG for publication , it remains the case that PERSON did not consent to their being published in support of an article which constitutes an invasion of his privacy , with the result that their publication is wrongful ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the publication in question had caused the Prince irreversible damage in that the fact of his paternity , which he had wished to keep secret and which had remained so from the child \u2019s birth until publication of the impugned article , had suddenly , and against his will , become public knowledge . It considered that the non - pecuniary damage thus caused justified an order for publication of the court ruling as supplementary compensation , and that , in view of the nature of the breach and the seriousness of its consequences , such a measure was not conditions of publication of the court ruling , which was no longer to appear under a headline and was to take up CARDINAL of the front cover . Thus , ORG ordered that the lower third of the front cover of the first issue of ORG to be published in DATE following service of the judgment was to display a white box containing the following text , printed in red letters , failing which the applicant company would be fined ORG CARDINAL per issue after expiry of that deadline :", "\u201c By a judgment of ORG upholding the judgment delivered by ORG , the company PERSON has been held liable for infringing the privacy and the right to his own image of PERSON of GPE in issue no . CARDINAL of the ORG newspaper , dated CARDINAL DATE , in an article entitled \u2018 PERSON of GPE : PERSON . The secret child\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This statement was published on the front cover of edition no . CARDINAL of the magazine , dated DATE , under a photograph of the Prince . The cover bore the headline \u201c PERSON of GPE . The truth has been punished \u201d , which was accompanied by the following commentary :", "\u201c ORG disclosed the existence of his son , PERSON . The courts have punished freedom to impart information . We have received support from the international press in reaction to this . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment . In their grounds of appeal , they developed the following arguments : the disclosure of a ruling sovereign prince \u2019s paternity was a news event relating to public life , given the functions held by the individual in question and the hereditary nature of the transmission of power in LOC ; divulgation of this information was necessary in order to inform the public ; the publication of observations and digressions alongside the announcement of a news event such as the fact of a sovereign prince \u2019s fatherhood was lawful , provided that these were innocuous and merely served to put the information into perspective ; and the publication of photographs taken within the family , illustrating the news event described in the article , was not such as to interfere with respect for privacy and private life .", "CARDINAL . Relying on LAW and citing the ORG \u2019s case - law , the applicants also argued that the public had the right to be informed , and that this right extended to information concerning the private life of certain public figures . They considered , in particular , that the ORG \u2019s decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) would have been the reverse had the relevant member of the royal family been , as in the present case , the Prince himself , Head of the ORG of GPE . In support of this argument , they cited the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , which , they submitted , showed that the fact of being a politician brought an individual exercising that role into the sphere of public life , with the attendant consequences . They further argued that ORG also recognised the public \u2019s right to information , including with regard to facts concerning private life , even where the individual concerned held no public office . Lastly , they submitted that the primacy of the right to inform and the right to be informed had been established in similar circumstances , even where a person \u2019s right to their own image was in issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued , in particular , that in a hereditary monarchy the PERSON \u2019s lack of known issue was already a matter of discussion , and that the existence of a child was such as to contribute to that discussion . They also submitted that the child was a potential heir to the Monegasque throne , since his father could legitimise him at any time . They considered that , even if improbable , this scenario remained legally possible , and could therefore become the subject of a general debate regarding the future of the Monegasque monarchy , and that , in addition , the fact that the child was of NORP origin could contribute to a debate of general interest which had the potential to change the image of a particularly conservative principality .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also pleaded the very strong ties which , they alleged , bound the Principality of GPE to GPE . They further submitted that the worldwide impact of the contested material , including in the most serious and most prestigious newspapers , proved that the information disclosed by ORG was such as to contribute to a debate of general interest , and that this was not simply an article written to provide entertainment .", "CARDINAL . They further argued that the photographs accompanying the article , showing the Prince with the child or with PERSON , illustrated a news event , and that they entailed no breach of respect for human dignity , since the Prince was presented in a positive light . They asserted that these photographs had not been taken without the Prince \u2019s knowledge , but by Ms GPE herself , and specified that she had handed them over to ORG for publication , voluntarily and without charge .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , they emphasised that the magazine PERSON had published an almost identical article in GPE on DATE , prior to publication of the impugned article , and that the NORP courts had dismissed the PERSON \u2019s action against that newspaper .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law on , inter alia , the following grounds :", "\u201c ... every person , whatever his rank , birth , fortune or present or future functions , is entitled to respect for his private life ; ... the judgment notes firstly that , on the date on which the article was published , the child \u2019s existence and his descent were unknown to the public , and secondly that the ORG \u2019s LAW rules out the possibility of his accession to the throne , since he was born out of wedlock , a situation that , moreover , the company \u2019s pleadings did not claim to be a subject of debate in LANGUAGE or Monegasque society or of examination in the impugned publication , and , lastly , [ that ] the article contained multiple digressions on the circumstances in which PERSON and PERSON met and about their relationship , the Prince \u2019s reactions to the news of the pregnancy and his subsequent attitude towards the child ; ... in the light of these findings and considerations , ORG correctly noted the lack of any topical news item or any debate on a matter of public interest which would have justified its being reported at the time of the impugned publication on the grounds of legitimate imparting of information to the public ; ... moreover , the publication of photographs of a person to illustrate subsequent content which amounts to an invasion of his privacy necessarily infringes his right to control of his own image ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after publication of the initial article on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the DATE magazine ORG published another article about the disclosure of the Prince \u2019s paternity , this time accompanied by several photographs showing the Prince and the child .", "CARDINAL . The Prince brought urgent proceedings against the magazine in order to prevent any further publication , but his case was dismissed on DATE by a judgment of ORG ( ORG ) , upheld on DATE by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , in particular , that , as a figure of contemporary society par excellence , the Prince had to tolerate the impugned encroachment on his private life , given the information value of the report . It noted that the veracity of the information published by the magazine with regard to the statements by the child \u2019s mother and to the claimant \u2019s paternity had not been disputed on any specific point . It considered that the publication was not unacceptable in terms of the protection of a person \u2019s intimate sphere , since the disclosures did not relate to that sphere but to the sphere of private life , which was less protected . It held that the public \u2019s right to information resulted from the claimant \u2019s position in society , and that the pressure that he might have experienced as a result of those disclosures , aimed at obliging him to recognise his child , did not prohibit publication but was merely an inevitable consequence of it , which he was required to tolerate . It noted that the published photographs had been taken with the claimant \u2019s agreement , in his private sphere , and had been made available to the press by a person who had just as much right to do so as the claimant . It held that the protection of the claimant \u2019s private sphere and his right to his own image had to yield to the freedom of the press , on account of the importance of communicating to the public information concerning the claimant \u2019s son born out of wedlock and about the child \u2019s mother . Lastly , it considered that it was for the mother rather than for the Prince , who had not recognised the child , to decide whether the disclosure of the latter \u2019s existence fell within the protected private sphere .", "CARDINAL . Following the appeal by the Prince , ORG ordered the magazine not to republish or allow to be published a photograph which had appeared in DATE issue of PERSON , showing the claimant in a moment of intimacy with PERSON . However , it considered that the issue of a male heir to the prince of GPE \u2013 a constitutional hereditary monarchy DATE was of decisive importance , and that the interest taken in this question not only by the citizens of GPE but also by many persons who lived outside the ORG deserved protection and ought not to be superseded by the claimant \u2019s interest in securing protection of his private sphere , on the ground that the current legal situation allowed only legitimate children to accede to the throne ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
