On DATE PERSON GPE , the then Minister of State brought a civil action for compensation against the applicant , before ORG . He claimed that the alleged defamatory remarks in the applicant \u2019s book constituted an attack on his reputation and requested that the court award him compensation of MONEY ( GPE ) for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the court evaluated the following passages :", "\u201c In an interview I gave in GPE I commented on the \u201c CARDINAL DATE \u201d massacre and the possibility of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat during that period . It seems that a magazine carried out research following these assertions and reached some interesting conclusions .", "According to the magazine , the Minister of ORG , PERSON , had established contacts with ORG ( \u00d6zel Harp Dairesi ) . He had been involved in the coup that was co - ordinated by General PERSON together with Generals PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . The names of these generals had appeared in several foreign and domestic newspapers where they were presented as the authors of the massacre carried out on DATE and of other provocative acts . The magazine interviewed Mr PERSON . He said the following :", "\u2013 Some newspapers and magazines have been presenting you as the author or even the perpetrator of DATE of LOC massacre until DATE . You have never commented on those allegations for DATE .", "Kilercio\u011flu : I never thought of replying . The ORG has everything . It has mechanisms .

Under such conditions , would they have kept silent until now ? Everything has been done .", "\u2013 Did you exercise your right to reply ?", "Kilercio\u011flu : I do not remember .", "As one can easily see , Mr GPE is disregarding the questions and making a big fuss . By not having exercised his right to reply and not having lodged a complaint with the judicial organs , he must have been aware of the fact that he was implicitly acknowledging these allegations against him . Especially , someone like him : an ex - general and a Minister of State .", "Mr ORG answered another question :", "\u201c I am the purest and the most innocent person that you could ever meet in life , \u201d he says . If a person is identifying himself like this , let \u2019s just leave the verdict to a doctor !", "In an interview he gave after his retirement in DATE he said : \u201c As you know , there are groups in the army . They fight among themselves . We fought and lost . \u201d He is probably admitting to having belonged to the junta by identifying himself as a member of the \u201c group \u201d .", "One can conclude from his statement that he had been a member of the junta . CARDINAL can also presume that the junta of General PERSON had had plans to overthrow PERSON \u2019s government . Then the question arises : How could PERSON appoint a minister who was involved in a junta against him ? Maybe PERSON ORG is CARDINAL of Mr PERSON \u2019s sins ?", "...", "Let \u2019s go back to ORG . Although he admitted to having belonged to a \u201c group of fighters \u201d , a number of newspapers , some business circles and ORG ) stood as protectors of ORG after his retirement . Undoubtedly , this was not due to his \u201c pure \u201d personality . It was more due to his presence in the fascist wing , which dedicated itself to protecting the interests of business circles . After his retirement he was ready to serve those business circles . I wonder : how will he be able to fight against corruption and illegal trade after having flown from ORG to the ministerial chair ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant argued before the court that the passages concerning Mr GPE were quoted from an interview published by a magazine . He drew the court \u2019s attention to the fact that Mr GPE had never exercised his right of reply ; nor had he contested the publication of his statements in that magazine . The applicant claimed that he was exercising his right to freedom of expression in making those remarks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first instance court rejected PERSON ORG \u2019s claims .

Mr GPE appealed . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of the first instance court . It considered that the following extracts from the book went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism . It held that they were based on hearsay alone and they therefore amounted to an attack on the reputation of the plaintiff :", "\u201c ... he is admitting to having belonged to the junta ... \u201d , \u201c ... his presence in the fascist wing , which dedicated itself to protecting the interests of business circles . \u201d , \u201c After his retirement he was ready to serve those business circles .
