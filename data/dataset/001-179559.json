The applicant was born in DATE and was serving a prison sentence at the time in question . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE and sentenced by the first - instance court on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for murder . His conviction was upheld on appeal by ORG of GPE of Adjara on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the available medical file ( covering the periods DATE , DATE , and DATE ) , the first time the applicant was transferred to the prison hospital after his arrest was on DATE . At that time he was diagnosed with viral hepatitis C , chronic cholecystitis , and radiculitis . The applicant complained of suffering from sleeping disorders and anxiety and was placed in the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital . On DATE he was transferred to the infectious ward , where he was treated for his viral hepatitis C. The applicant was discharged from the prison hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in DATE he had an operation for an ingrowing toenail on his right foot . After the operation the scar became infected and the applicant was sent to the prison hospital on DATE on account of his deteriorating health . At that time the applicant \u2019s diagnosis was as follows : chronic arterial insufficiency of the lower limbs , arterial occlusion and obliterating arteritis , and subungual panaritium .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had his toenail removed . He spent the post - surgery period under permanent medical supervision in the prison hospital . Although he was provided with painkillers and treated with antibiotics , the applicant , according to the case file , complained DATE about severe pain in his right foot . On DATE he was seen by an angiosurgeon , who recommended that he undergo a dopplerography of the legs and that his transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( \u201c Tc POCARDINAL \u201d ) be measured . The surgeon would decide on the need to amputate the big toe on the applicant \u2019s right foot on the basis of these tests .", "CARDINAL . According to a note made by a prison hospital doctor in the applicant \u2019s medical file on DATE , the dopplerography and Tc POCARDINAL test could not be organised in the prison hospital for technical reasons . The doctor noted an improvement in the applicant \u2019s general condition and concluded that in any event , and notwithstanding the specialist \u2019s recommendation , there was no need for those examinations , given that there were no \u201c absolute indications \u201d that surgery was called for . On DATE the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital and sent back to FAC no . CARDINAL with a recommendation that he continue palliative treatment on an outpatient basis .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE the board of forensic experts of ORG having examined him \u2013 drew up a medical report ( \u201c the CARDINAL DATE medical report \u201d ) , which diagnosed the applicant as suffering from the following : arteritis , occlusion of the arteries in the right shin , stenosis of the arteries in the left shin , artery deficiency in the right lower limb ( at stage IV of the disease ) , necrosis of tissue in the right big toe , cardiac ischaemia , second - degree angina pectoris , seconddegree arterial hypertension , second - degree cardiac insufficiency , and lowactivity chronic hepatitis C. The experts concluded that from a cardiological point of view the applicant \u2019s condition was potentially serious . As for his vascular condition , the main blood vessels in both of his legs were damaged and his condition was serious . They recommended that he be placed in a specialist cardiology clinic and have his toe amputated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers complained to the Director of ORG ( \u201c the Prisons Department \u201d ) that their client , who had been in the prison hospital since DATE , had been sent to FAC No . CARDINAL , despite the seriousness of his state of health , and that the treatment in that hospital had not produced any results . They complained that the applicant \u2019s condition had deteriorated there . The lawyers requested that the applicant be taken to hospital on the grounds that his life was in danger . On DATE they sent the same request to the director and the head doctor at the medical unit of FAC No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the welfare unit of ORG referred the ORG request to the prison governor and a group of qualified medical experts \u201c for an opinion \u201d . He observed that , in accordance with ministerial order no . CARDINAL , patients were hospitalised on the orders of the prison governor , following a report by the head doctor of the prison \u2019s medical unit .", "CARDINAL . Following that letter , on DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers contacted the prison governor reminding him of the terms of ministerial order no . CARDINAL and asking him what the response of the head doctor had been and enquiring as to when the applicant would be hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the lawyers that the applicant had been placed in the prison hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE notes made in his medical file , the applicant continued to suffer from pain in the right foot . It can be seen from the contents of the medical file that his right foot was treated with antiseptic products and bandaged DATE . During that period the applicant was examined by a vascular specialist twice : on DATE and on DATE . On DATE the vascular specialist recommended that the bandage be changed regularly and the toe treated with antiseptic products . He also prescribed ORG infusions . On DATE the vascular specialist recommended a Tc POCARDINAL test in order to assess the possibility of amputating the toe , and prescribed continuing palliative treatment . It appears from the case file that the relevant drugs were administered to the applicant by his wife and other family members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant underwent a Tc POCARDINAL test at a specialist hospital . On the basis of the results of the test the examining doctor concluded that the microcirculation in the lower limbs of the applicant ( particularly in the right foot ) was very low . In his view , surgical intervention was not appropriate because the particularly low level of oxygen in the right foot would have hampered the healing of the resulting wound .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital because of the appeal court \u2019s decision to suspend his prison sentence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the CARDINAL DATE medical report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and in view of the fact that his treatment at the prison hospital was producing no results , on DATE the applicant applied to ORG for his sentence to be suspended on health grounds ( under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . A representative of ORG opposed the application on the grounds that the prison hospital had \u201c a medical service capable of treating the applicant \u201d and that \u201c if necessary he [ would ] be transferred to a specialist clinic \u201d . CARDINAL of the experts who had produced the above - mentioned report confirmed to the court judge that the applicant was seriously ill . However , as he had no knowledge of the medical facilities at the prison hospital , he said he could not judge whether it was appropriate to keep the applicant there . He also confirmed that the applicant \u2019s right big toe had to be amputated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , on the grounds that the prison hospital had a medical service capable of providing the necessary treatment and that the applicant , who was being looked after by specialist doctors , would be transferred to a specialist clinic if necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted to the court his comments on the record of the hearing of DATE . The record of the hearing , according to those comments , did not refer to the expert \u2019s opinion in respect of the risk to the applicant \u2019s life . The expert had said that the applicant \u2019s gangrene , which was now at the fourth ( and last ) stage , could cause septicemia and death if not properly treated . Regarding the applicant \u2019s heart condition , the expert had said that the applicant needed treatment in a specialist clinic to prevent sudden death . On DATE the court granted that request and ordered that the record of hearing be amended by adding the expert \u2019s comments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE , pointing out that , according to the medical experts who had examined him , the treatment at the prison hospital had produced no results and that , if he was not properly treated , the question of the amputation of various parts of his right lower limb could arise . The applicant \u2019s lawyers pointed out that prisoners frequently died as a result of a lack of treatment at the prison hospital . They also complained about ORG having joined the trial as a party to the proceedings , which was in breach of LAW ORG . In their view , a representative of ORG was not in a position to assess the danger that detention might pose to the life of the applicant . Subsequently , the lawyers requested that the applicant \u2019s doctor and the doctor from the specialist hospital who had treated the applicant on DATE be heard as witnesses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . At the examination in the specialist hospital in question , apart from the findings of the above - mentioned expert report , GPE \u2019s disease of the lower limbs had also been diagnosed .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers requested that the representative of ORG be debarred from joining the proceedings as a party , in accordance with LAW ORG . ORG allowed that request but authorised the representative in question to attend the hearing in order to reply to any questions . It also decided to call the prison hospital surgeon , the vascular specialist ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and the forensic expert ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing on DATE the forensic expert repeated that the applicant \u2019s state of health was serious , and that LAW of order no . CARDINAL/N ( issued by the ORG Minister ) concerning the early termination of prison sentences on health grounds was indisputably applicable . He added that necrosis of the tissue of the lower limb had set in and was progressively affecting the limb from the bottom up . If that were to continue , the applicant might develop septicemia and die . In his view , it was impossible to cure the applicant completely .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s doctor \u2013 a surgeon who was a member of the prison hospital \u2019s permanent staff \u2013 also gave evidence before ORG , explaining the diagnosis and confirming that his patient was seriously ill , with the arterial disease having reached the fourth and final stage . He said that he had seen the applicant in DATE and also in DATE and that no serious necrosis had been observed at that time . He further explained that at that stage of the disease the treatment usually prescribed was either palliative or surgical . The applicant was being given palliative treatment with medicines ( antioxidants , protective drugs , sedatives ) . An operation was not recommended because it might make his condition worse . The likelihood of the scar healing was nil . The doctor was gradually removing the necrosed tissue in the right foot . The doctor also confirmed that the applicant \u2019s illness was chronic , progressive and that he needed constant medical treatment . He added that he could not be cured at the prison hospital but that there was a clinic outside the prison that could treat this kind of patient . In answer to a question from the judge , the doctor said that the applicant had been hospitalised twice after his operation and that at the relevant time the necrosis had not reached such an advanced stage . At that time the prison hospital doctors had done all they could to halt the development of the necrosis but without much success . If the situation continued , the applicant might have to have his entire right leg amputated .", "CARDINAL . The vascular specialist \u2013 a doctor at the prison hospital DATE said that he had examined the applicant in DATE and found that the gangrene had already affected the big toe of the right foot . This had then quickly spread , despite the treatment administered . Shortly before the hearing the applicant had been prevented from lying down and had been made to stay in a sitting position . His state of health was worsening DATE . The results of the Tc POCARDINAL test had shown that the oxygen tension in the right foot stood at level QUANTITY in the lying - down position and at level CARDINAL in the sitting position ( the normal level being CARDINAL ; an indicator of CARDINAL was necessary if the wound could be expected to heal properly ) . Accordingly , amputation was impossible . The vascular specialist said that the prison hospital was complying with his orders but that there was no specialist unit . In his view , the applicant \u2019s lower left limb was also damaged , but not yet affected by gangrene . At the time it was a question of saving the applicant \u2019s life and subsequently considering whether to amputate the right leg .", "CARDINAL . In his final address the applicant \u2019s lawyer drew ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that , despite the presence of gangrene DATE , the applicant had been sent to Prison No . CARDINAL and left there untreated . Given that , according to the doctors , the applicant could not be cured , the lawyer requested that her client be dispensed from having to serve the remainder of his prison sentence ( under LAW of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s prison sentence be suspended pending a substantial improvement in his state of health , provided that he undergo a medical examination DATE and provide the court with the results thereof . The applicant was immediately released .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical report of DATE , the applicant suffered from cardiac ischaemia , second - degree angina pectoris , thirddegree hypertension and second - degree heart failure . From a cardiological point of view , his heart condition remained serious . With regard to his arteries , the applicant suffered from GPE \u2019s disease , occlusion of the arteries in the right tibia , stenosis of the arteries in the left tibia , chronic arterial deficiency in the right lower limb at the fourth stage of the disease and gangrene of the tissue in the right big toe . The gangrene was still described as progressive . The experts concluded that the applicant required cardiological and angiological treatment in a specialist institution .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE and DATE the applicant underwent another forensic examination . It appeared from the report of DATE that on DATE the applicant had had the lower part of his right leg amputated . At the same time he was diagnosed with gangrene on the big toe of the left foot . While confirming his diagnosis from a cardiological point of view as potentially serious the CARDINAL experts involved in the examination also concluded that the applicant \u2019s angiological condition had deteriorated as a result of ischemia . Thus , from the angiological point of view he was categorised as a seriously ill patient ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
