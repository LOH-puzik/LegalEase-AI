NORP In DATE , which was a time of mass disorders and interethnic clashes in the region , the applicant had been the head of the territorial board of a municipal authority in which most residents were ethnic NORP . He was , according to him , considered as a leader of the local NORP community .", "CARDINAL . After the clashes , the applicant had repeatedly been invited by the NORP investigative bodies for questioning as a witness .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant learned that criminal proceedings had been opened against him ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

The risk need not be highly probable , but it must be personal and present . In this regard the ORG has determined , in previous decisions , that the risk of torture must be foreseeable , real and personal .", "The evidential material submitted by ORG \u2013 on the basis of which the decision to extradite [ the applicant ] was taken \u2013 does not contain any information demonstrating that [ the latter ] personally would be at risk of torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the event of his extradition .", "[ A long passage on the guarantees provided by the NORP authorities ] .", "Neither [ the applicant ] nor his lawyers provided any substantial evidence showing that [ the former ] was at risk of being subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by the NORP authorities , or that he might be persecuted on grounds [ such as ] race , religion , national or social origin , or political opinion .", "...
