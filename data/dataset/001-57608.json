THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 11;No separate issue under Art. 9 and 10;No violation of Art. 13;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON are former employees of ORG ( \" British Rail \" ) . In DATE , a \" closed shop \" agreement was concluded between ORG and CARDINAL trade unions , providing that thenceforth membership of CARDINAL of those unions was a condition of employment . The applicants failed to satisfy this condition and were dismissed in DATE . They alleged that the treatment to which they had been subjected gave rise to violations of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "In general", "CARDINAL . In essence , a closed shop is an undertaking or workplace in which , as a result of an agreement or arrangement between CARDINAL or more trade unions and CARDINAL or more employers or ORG associations , employees of a certain class are in practice required to be or become members of a specified union . The employer is not under any legal obligation to consult or obtain the consent of individual employees directly before such an agreement or arrangement is put into effect . Closed shop agreements and arrangements vary considerably in both their form and their content ; one distinction that is often drawn is that between the \" pre - entry \" shop ( the employee must join the union before engaged ) and the \" post - entry \" shop ( he must join within a reasonable time after being engaged ) , the latter being more common .", "In GPE , the institution of the closed shop is of very long standing . In DATE , closed shop arrangements have become more formalised and the number of employees covered thereby has increased ( CARDINAL in the DATE \u2019s and CARDINAL in DATE , approximately ) . Recent surveys suggest that in many cases the obligation to join a specified union does not extend to existing non - union employees .", "The law in force until DATE", "CARDINAL . There was no legislation explicitly directed to the practice of the closed shop until DATE . Nevertheless , the courts had since the DATE \u2019s recognised the legitimacy of the trade union object of advancing the union \u2019s interests even to the point of enforcing the dismissal , or a ban on the hiring , of non - union employees . However , it was an unlawful conspiracy at common law to pursue a closed shop against individuals beyond the point which the courts regarded as the defence of genuine trade union interests ( GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ; ORG v. Fry [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "ORG and ORG , which reported in DATE , whilst rejecting the possibility of prohibiting the closed shop , considered the question of safeguards for individuals in a closed shop situation . In particular , a majority of that Commission took the view that an existing employee who was dismissed for refusal to join a union following the introduction of a closed shop should be able to succeed against his employer in a complaint of unfair dismissal so long as he could show that he had reasonable grounds for that refusal .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract of employment were for the most part governed by common law . Leaving aside cases of justified summary dismissal , it was lawful to dismiss an employee , even without cause , provided that he was given due notice . The remedy open to an employee dismissed without due notice was merely to sue for the balance of wages he would have earned during the appropriate notice period ; the courts would not order his employer to re - engage him . These principles applied , for example , to dismissals motivated by an employee \u2019s joining , or refusing to join , a trade union .", "LAW DATE", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , there has been increased Parliamentary intervention in the areas under consideration , and changes of Government have led to changes in the scope and content of the legislation in force . The first major enactment was LAW DATE which radically altered the common law position in CARDINAL respects .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , the DATE Act conferred on employees ( with certain exceptions ) the right not to be unfairly dismissed . Dismissal of an employee without cause became unlawful , even if he had been given due notice . An individual who considered that he had been unfairly dismissed could present a complaint to an industrial tribunal ; unless the dismissal had been motivated by CARDINAL or more reasons specified in the LAW ( for example , qualifications , conduct , redundancy ) or some other substantial reason and unless the employer was found to have acted reasonably in treating that or those reasons as a sufficient reason for dismissal , the tribunal could award compensation to the employee or recommend that he be re - engaged . The employee \u2019s common law rights were unaffected by the LAW , although after DATE little reliance was placed on them in practice by those entitled to the new right .", "CARDINAL . In the second place , the DATE Act introduced specific provisions which were designed to make the operation of the majority of closed shops unlawful . In addition to stipulating that pre - entry closed shop agreements were void , the LAW , subject to certain exceptions , gave every worker the right to be a member of no trade union or to refuse to be a member of any particular union . In the context of the rules on unfair dismissal and in contrast to the position at common law ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) , the Act laid down that dismissal motivated by the employee \u2019s exercise of , or intention to exercise , that right was be to regarded as unfair .", "CARDINAL . A ORG , published by ORG in DATE , states that LAW \" met considerable resistance from trade unions and in practice its closed shop provisions were circumvented by many employers and unions . The closed shop continued much as before \" .", "The law in force at the time of the events giving rise to the applicants\u2019 complaints", "CARDINAL . The industrial Relations Act DATE was repealed by ORG DATE ( \" TULRA \" ) . The provisions of TULRA relevant to the present case came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The repeal of LAW DATE removed from the statute book both the prohibition on closed shops and the employee \u2019s right not to belong to a union . However , the law did not fully return to its DATE condition . This was because ORG maintained the protection against unfair dismissal ; since CARDINAL result of a closed shop is that an individual who declines to join a specified union may have his employment terminated , it was necessary to spell out the precise conditions in which dismissal for this reason was to be regarded as fair . Accordingly , TULRA :", "( a ) set out - by reference to the concept of \" union membership agreement \" , which it defined - the circumstances in which a closed shop situation was to be regarded as existing ;", "( b ) laid down the basic rule that , if such a situation existed , the dismissal of an employee for refusal to join a specified union was to be regarded as fair for the purposes of the law on unfair dismissal ;", "( c ) provided that , by way of exceptions , such a dismissal was to be regarded as unfair if the employee genuinely objected", "( i ) on grounds of religious belief to being a member of any union whatsoever ; or", "( ii ) on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular union .", "CARDINAL . The powers of an industrial tribunal under LAW to award compensation to an unfairly dismissed employee were also re - enacted by ORG . However , the power to recommend his re - engagement was later replaced , by LAW DATE , by a discretionary power to order reinstatement or re - engagement in certain circumstances ( notably , where this was considered \" practicable \" ) . It was provided that , if the order were not complied with , the employee should be awarded the normal compensation for unfair dismissal and , in specified cases , an additional sum .", "CARDINAL . TULRA was modified in various respects by ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) which came into force on DATE . In particular , the second of the exceptions mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) above was abolished , so that the action for unfair dismissal remained available only to genuine religious objectors . With the object of achieving greater flexibility , LAW also modified the concept of \" union membership agreement \" .", "Subsequent legislative developments", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE repealed and re - enacted the then existing provisions concerning unfair dismissal .", "LAW was in turn amended , without retroactive effect , by LAW . It remains the basic rule that the dismissal of an employee for refusal to join a specified union in a closed shop situation is to be regarded as fair for the purposes of the law on unfair dismissal . However , with effect from DATE , this rule became subject to CARDINAL exceptions whereby such dismissal is to be regarded as unfair if :", "( a ) the employee objects on grounds of conscience or other deeply - held personal conviction to being a member of any or a particular union ; or", "( b ) the employee belonged , before the closed shop agreement or arrangement came into effect , to the class of employees covered thereby and has not been a member of a union in accordance therewith ; or", "( c ) in the case of a closed shop agreement or arrangement taking effect after DATE , either it has not been approved by the vote in a ballot of not PERCENT of the employees affected or , although it is so approved , the employee has not since the balloting been a member of a union in accordance therewith .", "A Code of Practice , issued with the authority of ORG and coming into effect on CARDINAL DATE , recommended , inter alia , that closed shop agreements should protect basic individual rights and be applied flexibly and tolerantly and with due regard to the interests of individuals as well as unions and employers . The LAW is admissible in evidence , but imposes no legal obligations .", "CARDINAL . The green Paper on Trade Union Immunities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) rehearsed arguments for and against various proposals and indicated that the Government would welcome views on whether further changes in legislation affecting the closed shop were desirable and would be likely to prove effective .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , there has been statutory protection of the right to belong to a trade union . The exact content of the provisions has varied over DATE , but their essence is that an employee is entitled to compensation if he is dismissed or penalised for , or deterred or prevented from , being or seeking to become a member or taking part in the activities of a trade union ( Industrial Relations Act DATE , section CARDINAL ; ORG , Schedule CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ; Employment Protection Act DATE , section CARDINAL ; ORG DATE , sections CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , there were CARDINAL trade unions in GPE , with CARDINAL members ; in DATE , CARDINAL unions with CARDINAL members , were affiliated to ORG .", "The ORG adopted in DATE a series of morally binding recommendations ( \" the Bridlington Principles \" ) designed to minimise , and laying down procedures for dealing with , disputes between affiliated unions over membership questions . The current version of the NORP states , inter alia , that dual membership is valid only if the CARDINAL unions concerned have jointly agreed to it .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE , as amended , attaches certain conditions to the application by a union of its funds for a number of political objects specified in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , without prejudice to the furtherance of any other political objects . In particular , payments for the specified object must be made out of a separate \" political fund \" and any member of the union has the right to exemption from contributing thereto . A person so exempted may not be placed at any disadvantage as compared with other members , and contribution to the said fund may not be made a condition for admission to the union .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG had concluded a closed shop agreement with ORG ( \" NUR \" ) , ORG ( \" TSSA \" ) and ORG and Firemen ( \" ORG \" ) , but , with the enactment of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was not put into effect .", "The matter was , however , revived in DATE when ORG concluded a further agreement with the same unions . It was provided that as from DATE membership of CARDINAL of those unions was to be a condition of employment for certain categories of staff - including the applicants - and that the terms of the agreement were \" incorporated in and form[ed ] part of \" each contract of employment . Like other staff of ORG , Mr. PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr. PERSON had , it appears , been supplied when engaged with a written statement containing a provision to the effect that they were subject to such terms and conditions of employment as might from time to time be settled for employees of their category under the machinery of negotiation established between their employer and any trade union or other organisation .", "The membership requirement did not apply to \" an existing employee who genuinely objects on grounds of religious belief to being a member of ORG whatsoever or on any reasonable grounds to being a member of a particular ORG \" . The agreement also set out the procedure for applying for exemption on these grounds and provided for applications to be heard by representatives of the employer and the unions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , notices were posted at the LOC of ORG , including those where the applicants were then working , drawing the attention of staff to the agreement with the unions and the change in conditions of employment .", "A further notice of DATE stated that it had been agreed that the exemption on religious grounds would be available only where a denomination specifically proscribed its members from joining unions . The notice added that \" confining exemption only to religious grounds depends upon the passing through ORG ) Bill \" and that staff would be advised further on this point . As recorded in paragraph CARDINAL above , LAW came into force on DATE .", "On DATE , a further agreement between ORG and the railway unions came into effect . It was in identical terms to the DATE agreement , except that the words \" or on any reasonable grounds to being a member of PERCENT \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were omitted .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the representative of ORG informed the ORG that ORG , ORG and ORG were the only unions actually operating in DATE in those sectors of the railway industry in which Mr. PERSON , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON worked . According to the Government , other unions did have members in , although they were not recruiting amongst , the relevant grades .", "It appears that , prior to the conclusion of the DATE closed shop agreement , CARDINAL ORG employees , out of a total staff of CARDINAL , were not already members of CARDINAL of the specified unions . In the final event , CARDINAL individuals were dismissed for refusal to comply with the membership requirement .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were not eligible for membership of ORG . As regards ORG and ORG , intending members were required to sign an application form which , at the relevant time , embodied an undertaking to abide by the Rules of the union and \" loyally to promote \" its objects ( ORG ) , or to use their \" best endeavours to promote its objects and interests \" ( ORG ) .", "The stated objects of ORG included the following :", "\" ... to secure the complete organisation of all workers employed by any ORG in connection with railways and other transport and ancillary undertakings thereto in GPE ; to improve the conditions and protect the interests of its members ; ...

His reasons for not wanting to join ORG , which he said also applied to ORG , may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) he did not subscribe to the political views of ORG ;", "( b ) money from the main union fund was used to produce a DATE newspaper biased in favour of ORG and he had not received sufficient assurances that that fund was not utilised for other political purposes ;", "( c ) he disapproved of ORG \u2019s support for nationalisation of industry and its forcing of inflationary pay awards ; he also objected to being obliged to participate in strikes , this being action which in the case of a key service industry he saw as collective blackmail of the country as a whole ;", "( d ) ORG showed itself intolerant of the expression of individual freedom by seeking to enforce a closed shop and it acquired by that means an unacceptably extensive control over the hiring and firing of employees .", "CARDINAL .
