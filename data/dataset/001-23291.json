THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr J.H. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s ex - wife requested ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE to establish a maintenance arrangement ( alimentatievoorziening ) for herself and the CARDINAL children born of their marriage . ORG acceded to this request and ordered the applicant to pay DATE amounts of maintenance both to his children and his ex - wife . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE , which quashed the decision of ORG and reduced the amount of the applicant \u2019s maintenance obligations . As the applicant considered that the reasoning and calculations applied by ORG were both incorrect and incomprehensible , he lodged an appeal on points of law ( beroep in cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON Raad ) .", "In his advisory opinion of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL of the advocates - general ( advocaten - generaal ) of ORG recommended that the appeal be dismissed . A reply to this opinion was sent to ORG by counsel for the applicant on DATE . According to a stamp placed on the reply , it was received on DATE .", "ORG ( civil - law division , PERSON ) rejected the appeal on DATE . The decision ( beschikking ) stated that the applicant \u2019s ex - wife had requested ORG to reject the appeal and that the advisory opinion of the advocate - general had also proposed that the appeal be dismissed . The decision did not mention that the applicant , or counsel on his behalf , had replied to that opinion or that account had been taken of that reply . In dismissing the appeal , ORG referred to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) according to which ORG , if it considered that a complaint did not provide grounds for overturning the impugned decision and did not require answers to questions of law in the interests of the unity or development of the law , could , when giving reasons for its decision , limit itself to that finding .", "At the time relevant to the present case , LAW , \u201c ORG \u201d ) provided that neither the parties nor their representatives were allowed to address the court after the public prosecution service had presented its opinion ( LAW in conjunction with LAW . However , pursuant to LAW , simple notes ( eenvoudige aantekeningen ) contesting facts , which the parties believed had been presented incorrectly by the public prosecution service , could be submitted to the President of the court by the parties or their representatives .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG held that it was free to take cognisance of comments submitted in response to the opinion issued by the public prosecution service by one of the parties unless this ran counter to the requirements of due process , seen also in the light of the interests of the other party ( PERSON ( GPE ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "A similar reasoning was adopted by ORG in a judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , in which it held , with reference to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I ) , as follows :", "\u201c ... where LAW [ of LAW ] prevents parties from responding to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service as they see fit , [ this provision ] should be deemed inapplicable as being incompatible with the provisions of LAW , as interpreted in the case - law of ORG ... ) . No restrictions other than those arising from due process , for instance in connection with the interests of the other party , apply to this document [ i.e. the reply to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service ] . \u201d", "In order to observe the principle of due process , ORG allowed a period of DATE for the submission of the response to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service .", "On DATE an amended LAW ORG entered into force , paragraph CARDINAL of which gives parties the right to submit written comments in reply to the advisory opinion issued by PERSON of ORG within DATE of the transmission of the advisory opinion to them .", "At the time of the decision in the present case , DATE , the general practice of ORG was to mention in its judgment or decision that a reply to the advisory opinion had been submitted . This was established as general practice in an internal decision ( intern besluit ) of the civil - law division of ORG of DATE , but the practice existed even before that time . The internal decision was not published ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
