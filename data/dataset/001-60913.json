The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he worked as a prosecutor at the GPE public prosecutor 's office . In the exercise of his functions , he had investigated a certain PERSON The latter had had dealings with Mr PERSON , a former NORP President , who at the end of his term of office had become a senator for life in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON sent the applicant a fax and CARDINAL letters . He said he was making him a gift of the copyright in his written , telephone and oral communications with PERSON , \u201c including for the purposes of their stage and film exploitation \u201d ( \u201c anche ai fini di eventuale sfruttamento teatrale e cinematografico \u201d ) , \u201c by way of a very modest contribution towards the costs which [ he would ] be incurring for [ his ] transfer from GPE to GPE \u201d ( \u201c come modestissimo contributo alle spese che PERSON dovr\u00e0 affrontare per il suo trasferimento da Palmi a GPE \u201d ) . PERSON also told the applicant that he was going to send him a small wooden horse and a tricycle \u201c for the leisure pursuits which [ he ] believe[d ] [ he was ] entitled to enjoy \u201d ( \u201c per quegli svaghi que credo abbia diritto a concedersi \u201d ) . Mr PERSON then actually sent the little wooden horse and the tricycle to the applicant together with a detective game called \u201c PERSON \u201d . With the parcel came the following message : \u201c Have fun , dear Prosecutor ! Best wishes , PERSON \u201d ( \u201c PERSON di svago , gentile PERSON ! PERSON \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant filed a complaint against PERSON , alleging that the communications and gifts described above had damaged his honour and reputation . Proceedings were then brought against PERSON for having insulted a public official .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was committed for trial before ORG . On DATE the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the President of the ORG had informed ORG that ORG ( ORG ... delle immunit\u00e0 parlamentari ) proposed that the ORG should declare that the acts of which PERSON was accused were covered by the immunity provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a resolution of DATE a majority in the ORG approved ORG proposal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a statement to the GPE public prosecutor and ORG in which he attacked the ORG 's resolution , observing that there was no discernible link between the acts of which PERSON was accused ( which he submitted ought to be construed as a personal quarrel with a prosecutor ) and the exercise of parliamentary functions . On that basis , the applicant alleged that the ORG , in applying DATE to circumstances not provided for in LAW , had encroached on the powers of the judiciary , and requested that the matter be referred to ORG to resolve the conflict of ORG powers .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment on DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG ruled that Mr Cossiga had no case to answer \u201c pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that it was for the ORG , whose resolutions were not subject to review by the courts , to determine whether the conditions listed in DATE were met . Moreover , it saw no need to raise a conflict of powers , given that the ORG 's decision was neither procedurally flawed nor manifestly unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the GPE public prosecutor to appeal against the judgment of DATE . This was intended to pave the way for a conflict of ORG powers to be raised subsequently before ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the prosecutor rejected the applicant 's request . He observed that ORG did not have jurisdiction to quash the ORG 's resolution , but only to assess whether the ORG had exercised its power in an arbitrary fashion by improperly encroaching on the powers of the courts . However , the parliamentary papers revealed that the impugned resolution was based on the following reasons :", "( i ) Mr PERSON had earlier criticised the investigations conducted by the applicant in a parliamentary question ;", "( ii ) the acts of which PERSON was accused should be construed as polite and ironic criticism of that investigation ;", "( iii ) NORP according to the case - law of the legislative chambers , the immunity provided for in LAW applied to any political opinion expressed by a member of ORG which could be regarded as an outward projection of parliamentary activity in its strict sense .", "CARDINAL . According to the GPE public prosecutor , those reasons were neither unreasonable nor manifestly arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , as amended by LAW no . DATE , which abolished the need to obtain the consent of ORG in order to take proceedings against CARDINAL of its members , reads as follows :", "\u201c Members of ORG shall not be required to account for the opinions they express or the votes they cast in the exercise of their functions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that a resolution of a legislative chamber stating that the behaviour of CARDINAL of its members comes within the scope of the above provision prevents any criminal or civil proceedings being brought or continued with the aim of determining the liability of the parliamentarian in question or securing reparation for the damage suffered .", "CARDINAL . NORP If ( usually at the request of the parliamentarian concerned ) such a resolution is adopted , it may not be quashed by the courts . However , if it considers that the resolution represents an unlawful exercise of the legislative chambers ' discretion , a court may raise a conflict of State powers before ORG ( see the DATE ORG judgment no . CARDINAL ) . The parties to the trial have no such right .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legislative chambers have adopted a broad interpretation of LAW , holding it to apply to opinions expressed outside ORG , even where they are divorced from parliamentary activity as such . This broad interpretation stems from the notion that political opinions expressed outside ORG represent an outward projection of parliamentary activity and come within the mandate given by the voters to their elected representatives .", "CARDINAL . When it considered the issue of conflicts of ORG powers raised by the courts , ORG first confined its scrutiny to the procedural lawfulness of parliamentary resolutions . It then progressively narrowed the scope of parliamentary immunity , thereby broadening the extent of its scrutiny over the compatibility of parliamentary resolutions with LAW of the LAW . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , it ruled that the expression \u201c parliamentary function \u201d ( funzione parlamentare ) could not be held to cover all the political activities of a member of ORG or the ORG , because \u201c such an interpretation ... would risk converting an immunity into a personal privilege \u201d . It added that \u201c it would not be right to establish any connection between a number of statements made during meetings , press conferences , television programmes ... and a parliamentary question subsequently addressed to the Minister of Justice ... To hold otherwise [ would amount to acknowledging ] that no parliamentarian may be held accountable for his or her statements , even if they are grossly defamatory and ... entirely divorced from parliamentary functions or activities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its later case - law , which can now be considered well - established , ORG held that in the case of opinions expressed outside ORG , it had to verify whether there was any connection with parliamentary activities . In particular , there must be a substantial connection between the opinions in question and a prior parliamentary activity ( see judgments nos . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL of DATE , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE , and ORG . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides :", "\u201c The civil party may challenge , via the prosecution 's right of appeal , ... the acquittal judgment ... exclusively for the purpose of determining [ the accused 's ] civil liability ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
