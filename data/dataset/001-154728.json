A hearing was held on DATE . The applicant requested that ORG be questioned further .", "DATE . On DATE the court held the twelfth and last hearing in the case . At the hearing the applicant and ORG questioned ORG , who stated , inter alia , that X could only use his left arm to assist the right arm in carrying out specific tasks , and that he had practically no strength in his left arm . In the expert \u2019s opinion , X would not have been able to spread the applicant \u2019s legs with his left arm , and neither would he have been able to take off his trousers as alleged by her . After being asked by the prosecutor whether his assessment was based on the assumption that the applicant had used all her strength to resist X , ORG stated : \u201c I did not base my conclusion on that assumption , as I did not know whether she had resisted or whether she had willingly submitted . \u201d After being asked whether the applicant , who was DATE at the time , could have resisted PERSON , who had allegedly been lying on top of her , he said he believed so .

After the examination of ORG , the applicant , who had sought and obtained an opinion from another orthopaedist outside the court proceedings which indicated that X might still have limited use of his left arm , asked for another orthopaedics expert to be appointed , on the grounds that there was doubt about N. \u2019s conclusions . This request was rejected by the court as unnecessary , as was the applicant \u2019s request for the court also to call as witnesses her sister and her mother \u2019s former husband , who had allegedly seen X rowing with both arms . A request by the prosecutor for the applicant to be examined again was also rejected .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing the court pronounced judgment , acquitting X of all charges .

On DATE the applicant lodged a new supervisory appeal under LAW . On DATE she received a reply from the court informing her that the reasoning of the judgment had been sent to her that day .", "CARDINAL . In the written grounds the court explained that the expert orthopaedics report contested ORG \u2019s ability to carry out certain acts described by the applicant , for which he would have had to use both arms . As explained by the expert , PERSON was not capable of even moving his left hand in a position which would have allowed him to take his trousers off or spread the applicant \u2019s legs . According to the court , the fact that some of the applicant \u2019s allegations were disproved by the expert raised some doubts as to her entire version of the events . On the basis of the principle that any reasonable doubt should benefit the accused ( in dubio pro reo ) , the court had acquitted X. As regards the report by the expert in psychology PERSON , which found that the applicant had suffered sexual abuse , the court noted that it could not ignore the judgment delivered in another set of proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s estranged husband , in which the competent court had accepted that he had engaged in sexual activity in front of the applicant and her sister and had also behaved inappropriately towards the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , she pointed out that X had operated manual transmission vehicles , which required him to use both his arms . The prosecutor further argued that the criminal offence in question did not require the sexual act to have been committed by force ; it was sufficient that the applicant opposed it . She also stressed that the proceedings had already been pending for DATE , which had aggravated the trauma suffered by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , which found that the reasoning of the first - instance court \u2019s judgment was clear and precise regarding the doubt that X had committed the alleged criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently asked ORG to lodge a request for the protection of legality ( an extraordinary remedy ) . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the aforementioned request could only concern points of law and not the facts , which the applicant had called into question .", "CARDINAL .
