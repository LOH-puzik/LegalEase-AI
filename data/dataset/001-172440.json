On DATE the prosecutor of GPE initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and illegally handling firearms ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and assigned the case to an investigator .", "CARDINAL . A forensic expert examined the deceased \u2019s body and extracted the objects that had killed him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the investigator commissioned a ballistics report from ORG of ORG of the ORG to determine the type of the grenade , the type of rifle used to fire it and whether the grenade had striae that could be used to identify that rifle .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ballistics expert issued a report and concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The forensic expert was given the following CARDINAL objects for examination : a grenade with a special charge ; and an obturator with a special charge ( a CARDINAL PERSON cartridge used with a carbine type KS-CARDINAL ( KS-CARDINAL M ) ) .

In DATE and DATE the investigating authority commissioned ballistics reports from ORG of ORG of the ORG and another local expert institution .

On DATE ORG of ORG was asked to prepare a ballistics report in order to determine which rifle had been fired at the victim . The investigating authority submitted the objects extracted from the victim \u2019s body , as well as CARDINAL carbines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities took the decision to open another criminal case concerning the charge of abuse of power by a public official causing death ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . It appears from the decision that it concerned persons other than the applicant \u2019s son . The decision read as follows :", "\u201c It was established that police officers had had recourse to firearms ... Officers from the special mobile unit fired gunshots , using QUANTITY , and teargas grenades , acting in violation of a directive dated DATE and in excess of their powers ... It is prohibited to fire these tear - gas canisters at a person . As a result , Mr N. and Mr A. sustained injuries . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

As the relevant QUANTITY had not been submitted for test shots , a request for CARDINAL PERSON cartridges was made to the relevant department of ORG of GPE ... [ Footnote : PERSON cartridges are used for training purposes relating to the use of KS-CARDINAL and KS-CARDINAL M carbines . These cartridges are similar to those normally used with these carbines . The only difference is that they do not contain the irritating chemical substance . ] ...", "The research part", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... I note that the tear - gas grenade has no striae left by the carbine used to fire it . This may be explained by the fact that the grenade could not have had contact with the interior of the carbine as it had been loaded into it with the aid of CARDINAL obturators ...", "CARDINAL . Test shots have been carried out in respect of the KS-CARDINAL and KSCARDINAL M carbines that were submitted for the examination . The purpose of the test shots was to observe the striae left on the obturators of the grenades fired from these carbines , and to compare the striae with the striae left on the obturator of the grenade used against the victim . I have used CARDINAL PERSON cartridges for the test shots . These cartridges are similar to those that were submitted for the examination ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... In view of the variance of the results of the test shots , it was impracticable to identify the relevant carbine on the basis of the striae left on the obturators ... in particular , on account of the elasticity and low thermo - resistance of the material used in the obturators ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE another ballistics report was requested from ORG ( \u201c the Institute \u201d ) . ORG was likewise provided with CARDINAL carbines and the objects extracted from the victim \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert from the ORG issued a report stating that it was not practicable to determine which of the examined carbines had been used to shoot the cartridge . The forensic expert explained that she had been provided with PERSON cartridges for the purpose of her research and for test shots , whereas the elements extracted from the victim \u2019s body were parts of a grenade . The forensic expert specified that PERSON cartridges and tear - gas grenades had \u201c different geometric parameters and are made of materials with different characteristics \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The necessary ( medical , ballistics , criminological ) examinations were carried out ... All carbines which had been used by the officers were seized ... All relevant officers were identified ... The logbooks concerning distribution of weapons and ammunition were examined ... On CARDINAL occasions CARDINAL different expert institutions were asked to submit ballistics reports . The requests were not complied with on account of the absence of the necessary equipment ... Attempts were made to identify the relevant rifle in other expert institutions ... Those were not equipped for this kind of forensic examination ... In consequence , ORG was not able to identify the weapon ... Another request is pending before ORG ... Thus , the investigating authority has carried out all the investigative measures that were possible in the absence of an identified suspect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son , Mr PERSON , also sought judicial review of the suspension decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG held that the suspension of the investigation was justified . However , on DATE the appeal court quashed the judgment and ordered a re - examination of the complaint .

In particular , the request for a ballistics report to ORG was submitted with PERSON cartridges instead of the type of cartridges used for causing the victim \u2019s death . The different geometric parameters of these cartridges prevented the experts from identifying the carbine used against the victim ...", "Following the resumption of the investigation in DATE the investigator merely made an enquiry instead of actually submitting grenades for comparative research ...", "It does not follow from the expert report of CARDINAL DATE that it would have been impossible to identify the rifle , provided that cartridges of the relevant type were provided .", "The evidence extracted from the victim \u2019s body was examined for the purposes of the above expert report .
