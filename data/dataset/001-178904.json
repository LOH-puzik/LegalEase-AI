The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG - matemati\u010dki fakultet ) , at a session of the School \u2019s council , informed the professors teaching there , including the applicants , that \u201c video surveillance has been introduced \u201d ( da je uveden video nadzor ) and that it was in the auditoriums where classes were held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON issued a decision introducing video surveillance in CARDINAL amphitheatres and in front of ORG ( ispred dekanata ) . The decision specified that the aim of the measure was to ensure the safety of property and people , including students , and the surveillance of teaching ( pra\u0107enje izvr\u0161avanja nastavnih aktivnosti ) . The decision stated that access to the data that was collected was protected by codes which were known only to the PERSON . The data were to be stored for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to ORG ( PERSON za za\u0161titu li\u010dnih podataka , \u201c the NORP \u201d ) about the video surveillance and the collection of data on them without their consent . They relied on ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below).The applicants submitted , in particular , that the amphitheatre where they taught was locked both before and after the classes , that the only property there was fixed desks and chairs and a blackboard , that they knew of no reason to fear for anybody \u2019s safety and that , in any event , there were other methods for protecting people and property and monitoring classes . They requested that the cameras be removed and the data erased .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL Agency inspectors issued a report ( zapisnik ) after visiting ORG , stating that the video surveillance was in accordance with ORG . According to them , there had been cases of destruction of university property , the bringing in of animals , drink and tobacco , and the presence of people who were not students . They also noted that the cameras provided \u201c a picture from a distance without clear resolution , that is people \u2019s features [ could not ] be easily recognised \u201d , that they could not zoom in and out and did not record any audio ( ne reprodukuju audio zapis ) . While the decision on introducing video surveillance had provided that data would be stored for DATE , the servers\u2019 capacity was such that the data was stored for DATE and then automatically erased by new recordings . The inspectors also noted that information on a \u201c plan to introduce video surveillance \u201d ( planiranje uvo\u0111enja video nadzora ) had been given at a session of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an objection to the report , submitting , inter alia , that they were not aware of any of the alleged incidents and that , in any event , it was unclear how such cameras could ensure the safety of people and property . They agreed that cameras over the entrances and exits from the university building might perhaps be an adequate form of ensuring such security . They also submitted that employees had not been \u201c notified in writing on the introduction of video surveillance before it started \u201d ( nijesu bili obavje\u0161teni o uvo\u0111enju video nadzora u pisanom obliku prije po\u010detka vr\u0161enja istog ) . Notably , the decision had been issued on CARDINAL DATE whereas surveillance had commenced DATE before . They did not specify when exactly but referred to TIME of the session of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicants\u2019 objection to the report , ORG ( PERSON za\u0161titu li\u010dnih podataka ) issued a decision ( rje\u0161enje ) ordering ORG to remove the cameras from the auditoriums within DATE as the video surveillance was not in accordance with ORG , notably sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE , and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . In particular , the ORG held that the reasons for the introduction of video surveillance provided for by section CARDINAL had not been met , given that there was no evidence that there was any danger to the safety of people and property in the auditoriums , still less to confidential data , and that the surveillance of teaching was not among the legitimate grounds for video surveillance . None of the parties initiated an administrative dispute in court against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was served with ORG decision of DATE . The cameras were removed by DATE at the latest . It appears that the data that had been collected was also erased on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a compensation claim against ORG , ORG and GPE , for a violation of their right to a private life , notably by the unauthorised collection and processing of data on them . They submitted in particular that such an interference with their private lives , without any possibility to control that process , was not provided for by any piece of legislation and that therefore it had not been in accordance with the law , within the meaning of LAW . They also maintained that it had not pursued any legitimate aim and had not been necessary in a NORP society . They relied on the relevant provisions of ORG , LAW and the relevant case - law of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE ruled against the applicants . The court found that the notion of private life certainly included activities in the business and professional spheres . It also held , however , that the university was a public institution performing activities of public interest , teaching being CARDINAL of them ( poziv redovnog profesora [ je ] tako\u0111e javan ) , and that it was thus not possible for video surveillance of the auditoriums as public places to violate the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private life . It was a working area , just like a courtroom or parliament , where professors were never alone , and therefore they could not invoke any right to privacy that could be violated . The data that had been collected could thereby also not be considered as personal data . The university \u2019s failure to remove the cameras immediately had been unauthorised , but it could not be classed as an interference with the applicants\u2019 private life and was therefore irrelevant . The court further held that such a conclusion was in accordance with the ORG \u2019s case - law given that the monitoring of actions taking place in public was not an interference with a person \u2019s private life when those means just recorded ( bilje\u017ei ) what others could see if they happened to be in the same place at the same time . The court also held that the monitoring of the actions of an individual in a public place by the use of photographic equipment which just instantaneously recorded visual data did not give rise to an interference with that individual \u2019s private life , which could arise once any footage of such material became publicly available . It concluded that the installation and use of video surveillance and the collection of data thereby had not violated the applicants\u2019 right to privacy ( pravo na privatnost ) and had therefore not caused them any mental anguish . During the proceedings CARDINAL of the witnesses stated that there had been cases of theft and of damage to the interior of the building and that on CARDINAL occasion CARDINAL laptops had disappeared from a laboratory . Those events had led to the hiring of a private security agency DATE . According to the witness , the police had suggested installing video surveillance equipment on the ORG \u2019s premises . The court , for its part , did not deal with those issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed . They relied , inter alia , on LAW . They maintained , in particular , that the interference with their right to respect for their private lives had not been in accordance with any law and had therefore been contrary to LAW . It had also not been necessary in a NORP society . Furthermore , ORG had not relied on any legal provision in ruling against them and had failed to assess their arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE upheld the first - instance judgment , endorsing its reasons in substance . ORG held in particular that the applicants had not proved that their right to privacy had been violated and found that the first - instance court had \u201c sufficiently related the ORG \u2019s case - law to the case at issue ( dao jasan osvrt na odnos prakse PERSON za ljudska prava i konkretnog slu\u010daja ) ... The court considered the [ applicants\u2019 ] other arguments and found that they did not justify ruling otherwise in the present case ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
