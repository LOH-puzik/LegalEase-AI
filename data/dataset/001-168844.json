The third applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The first and second applicants are husband and wife , and the third applicant is their daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) acknowledged PERSON \u2019s right to restoration of title in respect of CARDINAL hectares of land in the PERSON estate in LOC . That land had belonged to ORG \u2019s father and had been nationalised by the NORP regime .", "CARDINAL . The following day PERSON sold his right to restoration of title in respect of that plot of land in equal parts to CARDINAL buyers : the CARDINAL applicants and PERSON ( the first and second applicants\u2019 son , and the third applicant \u2019s brother ) . The sale agreement was signed by PERSON , acting as the ORG representative . The CARDINAL buyers paid , in equal parts , a total of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) to G.O.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued documents confirming the applicants\u2019 and PERSON \u2019s right to receive QUANTITY of land each from the State for free . As the second applicant had been a deportee of the NORP regime , in line with the domestic law she and her family had priority rights to have their property rights restored . The applicants and V.M. were provided with CARDINAL plots of land ( CARDINAL plot each ) in the city of GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicants , represented by V.M. , sold their plots to third parties for the price of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for each plot . The sale agreements indicated that the indexed value of each plot , estimated by ORG of ORG ( \u017dem\u0117s ir kito nekilnojamojo turto kadastro ir registro valstyb\u0117s \u012fmon\u0117s ORG filialas ) , was LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG opened a pretrial investigation concerning allegations of fraud in connection with the restoration of property rights in LOC . It was suspected that an organised criminal group was forging documents showing deportee status in order to obtain priority rights in the property restoration process . It was also suspected that some officials of regional authorities had unlawfully restored property rights to individuals who did not have such rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.M. was interviewed as a witness in the investigation and asked to explain how he and his family ( the applicants ) had obtained land in GPE . PERSON stated that in DATE he had befriended ORG who was his wife \u2019s stepbrother . PERSON knew that ORG \u2019s job was related to land measurement . Sometime in DATE mentioned to ORG that his mother ( the second applicant ) had been a deportee . Then ORG told him that it was possible to acquire restoration rights from other persons and get certain privileges available to former deportees . After DATE PERSON informed PERSON that he had found a person who was willing to sell his restoration rights . ORG advised V.M. that it was better if the contract with that person ( ORG ) was signed by CARDINAL family members and not just one , because that way they could obtain CARDINAL separate plots of land . GPE dealt with all the related paperwork and contacted public officials , while PERSON only signed the sale agreements with G.O. After V.M. and his family had received plots of land , ORG suggested selling them , and found buyers for all the CARDINAL plots . V.M. submitted that he had not known the buyers previously and had only met them when signing the agreements . He received LTL CARDINAL from each buyer . In all their dealings related to the land V.M. and his family trusted ORG and assumed that he knew all the relevant legal acts , as his work was related to land . Neither PERSON nor the applicants paid any money to ORG at any point .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.M. was again interviewed as a witness in the investigation . He retracted his previous statement in part and stated that he had not received payment for the CARDINAL plots of land ( LTL CARDINAL for each plot ) and did not know if the buyers had paid that money to ORG or to anyone else , or if they had paid anything at all . PERSON also stated that in the autumn of DATE ORG had informed him about the pending pre - trial investigation and advised him to tell the authorities , if questioned , that he ( V.M. ) had received the payment . ORG had assured PERSON that everything had been done lawfully , but now PERSON considered that he had been misled and deceived by GPE", "CARDINAL . It appears that none of the applicants were interviewed or had any procedural status in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that \u201c the facts of the case confirmed that suspects PERSON , GPE and GPE had acted unlawfully \u201d and that \u201c during the investigation it was indisputably established ( negin\u010dytinai nustatyta ) that suspect PERSON had unlawfully included relatives of friends or acquaintances of hers on the list of those who had priority right to have their property rights restored \u201d . That same ruling discontinued the investigation as time - barred .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the prosecutor of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) lodged a claim before LAW , asking for the administrative decisions which had acknowledged ORG \u2019s right to restoration of title , the sale of ORG \u2019s restoration rights to the applicants ( and V.M. ) , and all the administrative decisions which had allocated land to them , to be overturned . That claim was amended in DATE and DATE and DATE . The prosecutor submitted that ORG , in force at the material time , entitled ORG to receive CARDINAL plot of CARDINAL ha , with the remainder of his land being compensated for in other ways ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , so the applicants were not entitled to be allocated a plot of land of that size each . The prosecutor also submitted that the ORG had unlawfully restored the applicants\u2019 rights to property in the order of priority : even though the second applicant had been a deportee , ORG had not , and thus he did not have the right to transfer to the applicants priority rights which he himself did not have .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s claim in part . The court found that the authorities had lawfully decided to restore ORG \u2019s property rights and that the latter had lawfully sold those rights to the applicants . However , the court upheld the prosecutor \u2019s argument that ORG did not have the right to sell more rights than he had himself , and that the applicants\u2019 property rights could only have been restored under the same conditions as would have been applied had they been restored to ORG The court observed that although such a rule had not been explicitly stipulated in ORG at the time when ORG sold his rights to the applicants , that rule stemmed from a systemic and logical interpretation of that PERSON , as well as from legal acts of lower rank ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , the court held that the applicants had the right to receive CARDINAL plot of land of up to CARDINAL.CARDINAL ha , but not CARDINAL separate plots of that size , and they were not entitled to restoration in the order of priority . It overturned the administrative decisions which had allocated the land to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the Vilnius City First District Court ordered the applicants to return to the ORG the plots of land which they had received from it for free . Since they had sold the land to third parties and restitution in integrum was not possible , the court decided that they had to pay the ORG the market value of that land . In line with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , when property subject to restitution is transferred and the person who transferred it has acted in good faith , he or she has to compensate in the amount of the market value of the property at the time when it was received or transferred , or at the time of restitution , whichever is lowest . The court noted that the prosecutor had not alleged that the unlawful transaction had occurred because of the applicants\u2019 fault or that they had acted in bad faith ; nor had it been determined , at the time of the proceedings , that any crime had been committed . Accordingly , the court ordered the applicants to return to the ORG an amount corresponding to the market value of the land at the time they sold it , as that value was the lowest . On the basis of an estimate by ORG , each applicant was ordered to pay LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment ; on DATE ORG dismissed their appeal . The court considered that obliging the applicants to pay compensation in the amount of the market value of the land was not disproportionate , because they still retained the right to have property rights restored and to obtain new plots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicants . It held that ignorance of the law could not absolve anyone of responsibility , and thus the applicants should have known that property rights had been restored to them in breach of peremptory legal norms , especially as there was information that they had been advised by ORG , who worked in a municipal land reform department ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted a claim against the ORG for pecuniary damages before ORG . They contended that each of them had received LTL CARDINAL for selling the land but had been ordered to pay LTL CARDINAL to the ORG each , and thus had suffered pecuniary losses of LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) each . They also asked for pecuniary damages of LTL MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) for the court fees each of them had had to pay in the previous proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . After submitting their claim , the applicants applied for suspension of the execution of the Vilnius City First District Court \u2019s judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , submitting that they did not have sufficient funds to comply with it . On DATE ORG rejected their application on the grounds that the execution of the judgment had not been started yet , and that , in any event , if the applicants did not have sufficient funds nothing would be seized from them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim for damages . The court acknowledged that the ORG had acted unlawfully when allocating land to the applicants ; however , it considered that the applicants had not proven that they had suffered any pecuniary damage . The court noted that the applicants still had the right to restoration of title to ORG \u2019s land , because their agreement had not been cancelled , and that they were on the list of candidates to be given new plots of land . Accordingly , until such plots were given to them it was not possible to assess whether the applicants had suffered pecuniary damage or not .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that there had been a criminal investigation concerning the ORG \u2019s unlawful decisions restoring property rights . Although the investigation was eventually discontinued , it had nonetheless \u201c indisputably established \u201d that certain employees of the ORG had unlawfully issued documents recognising restoration rights ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court noted that CARDINAL of those employees was ORG , whom the applicants had consulted . Accordingly , the court held that the applicants should have known that they had received the land unlawfully and that they had themselves contributed to the pecuniary damage \u201c by acting carelessly and negligently \u201d ( veikdami ner\u016bpestingai ir neatsargiai ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment . They submitted , inter alia , that even if they had contributed to the pecuniary damage , the main agent who had caused those damages had been the ORG . Therefore , they argued that , in line with the provisions of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the liability should have been distributed proportionately between the ORG and the applicants and not placed solely on them . The applicants also submitted that the fact that V.M. had consulted ORG did not prove that the applicants had conspired with ORG or other unlawfully acting officials , or that the applicants had pressured any officials to act unlawfully to their benefit . The applicants contended that after their restoration rights had been cancelled the original state of affairs should have been restored , and they should not have been obliged to pay more than they had received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the judgment of the lower court . It underlined that the applicants had received the land from the ORG for free , and that they had immediately sold it to third parties who had to be considered bona fide acquirers . The court held that by selling their plots for a price that was significantly lower than their market value the applicants had acted at their own risk , and thus the difference between what they had received ( LTL CARDINAL each ) and what they were obliged to pay to the ORG ( LTL CARDINAL each ) could not be regarded as pecuniary damage . ORG further held that even if the applicants had suffered pecuniary damage , they could not be awarded damages because they themselves had acted unlawfully . Relying on ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG considered that the applicants had abused their rights by attempting to get from the ORG more land than ORG had been entitled to receive . Accordingly , having concluded that both the applicants and the ORG had acted unlawfully , the court relied on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and held that there were no grounds to award them pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicants applied for reopening of the proceedings , but on DATE ORG dismissed their application .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a bailiff began executing the Vilnius City ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the documents in the ORG \u2019s possession , from DATE until DATE the first and second applicants each paid LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in DATE payments ranging from LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) to LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The third applicant paid LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in DATE payments ranging from LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) to LTL CARDINAL ( ORG DATE ) . At the time of the parties\u2019 observations to the ORG , the execution was ongoing . The ORG submitted that in the future , when the applicants were provided with new plots of land ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the remaining amount could be recovered from those plots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG included the applicants ( and V.M. ) on the list of individuals who had the right to have title to property restored in the area around GPE . Their number in the list was PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ( and V.M. ) were informed by ORG that they were CARDINAL in the above - mentioned list . They were invited to a meeting of candidates during which they would be able to choose CARDINAL plot of land of QUANTITY in joint ownership .", "CARDINAL . As submitted by the Government , that meeting took place on CARDINAL DATE and the first and second applicants , as well as V.M. , were present but the third applicant was not . Since the CARDINAL of them were entitled to receive CARDINAL plot of land in joint ownership , the first and second applicants ( and V.M. ) were not allowed to choose a plot in the absence of the third applicant . The Government further submitted that there was still land available in the area around GPE and that the applicants would be invited to another meeting , planned to take place in the DATE of DATE . At the time of the parties\u2019 observations to the ORG , the applicants\u2019 property rights had not yet been restored ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
