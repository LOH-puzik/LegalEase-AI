THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 13+8;No violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant , DATE , is a female NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . The second applicant , PERSON , is the first applicant 's son . He is a NORP national who was born in DATE and currently resides with the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was delivered by caesarian section at DATE because of his failure to grow in the womb . He weighed QUANTITY . He was not diagnosed with any particular condition . He was initially fed via feeding tube .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was concerned about PERSON 's small size and his failure to pick up weight . On DATE she asked her general practitioner to refer him to a paediatrician . She was referred to PERSON , the paediatrician who had seen PERSON after his birth . Following a consultation in DATE the first applicant was told that the situation would be reviewed on DATE . As PERSON 's weight and length had fallen below the third centile chart , tests were carried out on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the consultant radiologist informed PERSON that X - rays revealed evidence of CARDINAL , possibly CARDINAL , healing fractures to the right ribs . The first applicant and her partner were informed DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was admitted to hospital as a patient and a full skeletal survey was carried out , which confirmed CARDINAL fractures . The local authority were informed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant took legal advice and also undertook some research , herself noting that PERSON had CARDINAL of the CARDINAL indicators for the condition of ORG ( brittle bone disease ) , including the genetic factor of her own joint laxity or double - jointedness . She states that she raised this possibility with PERSON who dismissed it without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a report by PERSON concluded that the injuries were sustained \u201c non - accidentally \u201d in view of the nature of the fractures and the lack of any other explanation for them . He noted , however , that PERSON 's parents had appeared very caring and concerned for his welfare at their CARDINAL meetings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority held a case conference and placed FAC on the \u201c At Risk Register \u201d . At the meeting PERSON mentioned that she had looked at PERSON 's bones to see if they appeared thin but considered that they were normal .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , the social worker assigned to the case , conducted CARDINAL sessions with the family . When the first applicant raised the possibility of Osteogenesis Imperfecta with her , she was told that she was in denial over the injuries to her son . The first applicant and her partner were very distraught over PERSON 's feeding problems and injuries and by the accusations of child abuse .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant attended assessment meetings held at FAC , the purpose of which she was told was to assess the risk she and her partner posed to PERSON She and her partner fully co - operated and attended all meetings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was admitted to hospital following further weight loss and a nasogastric tube was inserted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and her partner removed PERSON from the ward , against medical advice , as he had contracted a viral infection which caused vomiting and diarrhoea and was negating any advantages of feeding by tube . They took him to see a consultant paediatric gastroenterologist concerning his slow weight gain , but did not attend all appointments and cancelled a stomach biopsy as they felt he was well and gaining weight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority received a report from Professor C. , a professor of paediatric radiology , which confirmed the fractures to the ribs . She considered that the fractures had been inflicted on CARDINAL separate occasions . She also concurred with PERSON that \u201c the rib fractures have occurred from squeezing \u201d and that \u201c rib fractures in children are extraordinarily rare except in non - accidental injury ... \u201d . She found that PERSON 's bone texture was normal and there was nothing to indicate any underlying bone disease . She stated that there was no other medical test that would help to identify anything further about the rib fractures . Finally , she noted that the ultrasound of PERSON 's head revealed a bright area in the brain cortex . A small bleed could not be excluded , which caused her some concern as to shaking , but on balance she thought the results were normal .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the local authority applied to ORG for an interim care order . At the same time a guardian ad litem was appointed on behalf of PERSON , who was of the opinion that the family should stay together .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the statutory review meeting , it was noted that Dr S. had undertaken a test due to concerns about bone disease and that the result was used by Professor C. The local authority was informed that a police investigation was not considered appropriate as there was nothing to suggest that the injuries flowed from a criminal assault . It was hoped that the family would be placed in a protective unit where ORG could be monitored by professionals . The first applicant and her partner were present at this meeting . The applicants disputed , however , that Dr S. had in fact carried out a test for Osteogenesis Imperfecta .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an interim care order . It was proposed in court that the family relocate to ORG in GPE , QUANTITY away . The first applicant claimed that neither she nor her partner had been consulted or even warned about this possibility . They had to go directly to FAC from the court room , leaving their own comfortable well - equipped home and their network of extended family and friends . The first applicant consented to the care order but submitted that she had no real choice , because if she had resisted the measure PERSON could have been placed in foster care straight away . She had been advised that if she did not oppose the assessment procedure , it would be less likely that they would be separated . While her solicitors had obtained an expert report by PERSON suggesting that PERSON suffered from ORG , she had been advised not to rely on it in the proceedings because PERSON had been discredited as a medical expert acceptable to the courts due to violations of professional ethics in the course of previous legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant stated that she was horrified by the conditions at the FAC , which was located in a crime - ridden , rough area of GPE . The family had to live in CARDINAL room with a small kitchenette and were not allowed to cook any meals after TIME The house was dirty and occupied by problem families ( crime , drugs and alcohol ) . Initially they were only allowed to leave FAC TIME per day . The latter restriction was lifted on DATE against the wishes of PERSON and the local authority . During their stay , the first applicant and her partner had to claim benefits which they had not done previously . The family was not permitted to leave FAC DATE to attend the wedding of the first applicant 's sister ; they were only allowed to attend the actual ceremony and not the reception . According to the Government , however , the first applicant 's evidence in the domestic care proceedings was at odds with this description : she stated on DATE that the physical surroundings were better than they had feared and that the other residents were friendly and helpful . There had also been no restriction on the first applicant leaving the centre alone ; the only requirement had been that if she left with FAC they had to be accompanied by a member of staff . From CARDINAL May she was allowed to take FAC out unaccompanied for TIME a day , and after DATE all restrictions were lifted . They also had overnight stays away from the hostel and a day long visit to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The family remained at ORG . The first applicant was under the impression , as had been stated in court , that the assessment to be made was of the risk posed to PERSON by her and her partner . The keyworker at the ORG understood that a parenting assessment was to be carried out . When the letter of instruction was at last sent to the ORG , it asked , somewhat ambiguously , for their opinion on the standard of care provided to FAC and the first applicant and her partner 's ability to care for him .", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's report compiled by Miss PERSON on DATE stated that its aims were to assess the future risk posed to PERSON by his parents , to assess their handling and interaction with the child and to assess their parenting skills . The report noted that the couple presented as being very capable of caring for PERSON and that both appeared to be committed , with a willingness to accept the advice of professionals , although their level of anxiety had been high . Concerns remained , however , about PERSON 's feeding difficulties and limited weight gain , as he remained substantially below the third centile weight for a child of his age . In a further report on DATE , Miss PERSON confirmed that until there was clarity about the cause of the injuries the risk remained high .", "CARDINAL . While in GPE O.D. had been seen by a consultant clinical geneticist who reported that Osteogenesis Imperfecta or some other collagen abnormality was no more than one possible explanation for PERSON 's medical history ; in particular as it was rare to have this degree of growth retardation in the absence of multiple long fractures , other causes for the failure to thrive should be sought . He also commented that continuing emotional stress in the family should be seriously considered as a possible aggravating factor . He noted that further investigation might include a skin biopsy to assess collagen profiles but that it would be inappropriate to pursue these in GPE . In any case , he indicated that the diagnostic value of the test had been previously shown to have a detection rate of PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . On return to GPE , after a DATE stay in GPE , the family had to live in a Family Assessment Centre for DATE while the local authority applied to renew the interim care order .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's solicitor instructed an expert radiologist , Dr L. , to report on FAC 's injuries , asking him specifically to comment on whether the injuries were more likely to have been caused by non - accidental means or a form of Osteogenesis Imperfecta . As an acknowledged expert in bone disease , PERSON stated in the report that there was no evidence of abnormal bone morphology or density to suggest bone fragility . In the absence of abnormal bone fragility , he considered that non - accidental injury was the likely cause of the fractures . He was sceptical about taking a skin biopsy , considering the test to be equivocal . He also confirmed that the previous suggestion of a brain injury on the initial scan was unfounded as the scan merely showed reflective echoes .", "CARDINAL . At a statutory review on DATE , the local authority concluded that PERSON could not safely be placed with his parents and proposed to place him with foster carers , with DATE parental contact , while a psychological assessment of the first applicant and her partner was undertaken and a risk assessment was carried out by ORG ( ORG ) . The question of placing LAW with a relative had been discussed with the maternal grandparents . PERSON and another social worker paid them a visit on DATE . The matter was not pursued as it was noted that the maternal grandparents considered that not enough consideration had been given to Osteogenesis Imperfecta and that decisions were being taken by persons who did not know the parents . In a statement of evidence submitted on DATE , the applicant 's partner listed family members who would either stay with the applicants or have the applicants stay with them ; he did not specify that any relative was prepared to look after PERSON by themselves .", "CARDINAL . The interim care proceedings began on DATE . At the hearing , PERSON , the consultant paediatrician who had overseen PERSON 's care at GPE stated her opposition to the care plan ; she considered that PERSON had a close relationship with his family and removal would cause emotional trauma equivalent to bereavement . The social worker supervisor also opposed the care plan , as O.D. had suffered no further injuries and she believed it to be highly likely to exacerbate his eating problems . While she gave evidence for the applicants , PERSON had nonetheless stated in her report of DATE that the rib fractures were unexplained and characteristic of non - accidental injury ; that there was no definitive test for ORG ; and that she felt it unlikely that PERSON had this condition , referring to the further opinion of an orthopaedic surgeon , PERSON , who had been unable to confirm a diagnosis of Osteogenesis Imperfecta .", "CARDINAL . The interim care order was granted . In a judgment handed down on DATE , the judge considered that the consultant paediatrician and supervisor seemed to deal with a much more permanent separation than was envisaged . He stated that it was unfortunate that proper communications had not existed permitting the risk assessment to be carried out at GPE but that it still remained to be discovered how PERSON had sustained his injuries . With regard to the proposal to place FAC outside the family , the judge noted that there had been no proper assessment of any other family member but considered that the local authority could not be blamed for this : \" Clearly there had been discussions , considerable discussions and disagreement about the care plan . ... as things stand at the moment I am not satisfied that any family member would accept the sort of risk that I think at present exists . \"", "CARDINAL . He went on to say : \u201c So far as the capability of the parents is concerned , this will probably be of little comfort to them but nevertheless ... I have no doubt that they are very capable , that they are splendid parents in every possible way except with regard to these CARDINAL matters , this most important fact that the injury has still not been sorted out and there is also the possible problems with feeding . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that he had to make an order to provide FAC with the protection that he required .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was placed with local authority approved foster parents . The first applicant was allowed contact for DATE for DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was concerned as to the care which PERSON was receiving in the foster home . New clothes which she had given him were not being used ; she found a plastic pellet in his play pen ; on CARDINAL occasion he was crawling on the floor near to broken glass ; and when the first applicant noticed a bruise on FAC 's face , the foster mother showed no concern and it was the link worker who had to recommend that he saw a doctor . The Government stated that the foster parents , selected for expertise with feeding problems , reported to , and were visited by , the local authority regularly , who found their care to be satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE or DATE , PERSON was admitted to hospital due to feeding problems . The first applicant claimed that she was not informed and only found out on arrival for a contact session . She was not allowed to stay with him in hospital TIME . The Government stated that the first applicant had been aware in advance , due to a previous visit to a doctor , that LAW might be admitted to hospital and that she was informed when this happened as soon as was possible . Her normal contact continued with him during his DATE stay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the local authority that PERSON should be returned without delay to his parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON . , a consultant paediatrician instructed by the guardian ad litem , noted that the lack of further injury despite increased mobility was further evidence against Osteogenesis Imperfecta . He emphasised that the feeding and growth problem was not a child protection matter per se but that the impact of these problems on the parents needed to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while still in foster care , PERSON fell and was taken to hospital . The radiologist diagnosed a possible fracture of the shinbone . The X - rays were analysed as showing the bones to be thin and osteopenic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted their risk assessment . They recommended that PERSON be returned quickly to his parents ' care , with a short period of prior increased contact . The applicants submitted that the report was issued DATE than estimated ; the Government submitted that the judge had in fact indicated that only the initial report should be available at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority , at a statutory review meeting , agreed that PERSON should return home DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was examined by PERSON , a senior clinical research associate and honorary consultant paediatrician at ORG . He reported in his final report of CARDINAL DATE that there had been insufficient radiological evidence to substantiate the diagnosis of Osteogenesis Imperfecta or other bone disease in DATE but that the taking of additional X - ray views of particular bones might have provided further clarifications . Tests now indicated that PERSON had type PERSON , with a significant growth retardant component , a condition which had been active from the time of the tests . The force necessary to fracture his ribs might well have fallen within the range of normal handling . He recommended regular follow - up in a specialist paediatric clinic .", "CARDINAL . The X - rays and draft report of PERSON were submitted to Professor PERSON , who in her report of CARDINAL DATE found the special bone density tests inconclusive , although she noted that she was not an expert . She agreed that ORG now showed abnormalities but did not find this conclusive of Osteogenesis Imperfecta . She stated that in her experience if children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta had sustained rib fractures such as these from normal handling then they went on to sustain fractures in other areas ; she was therefore surprised that PERSON had not had further fractures other than the CARDINAL sustained in foster care if he in fact had had Osteogenesis Imperfecta .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , Professor C , PERSON and PERSON . held a meeting on DATE and issued a joint report , in which they concurred that there was no evidence at the time of the first fractures to indicate Osteogenesis Imperfecta or the desirability of any further investigations and that FAC had suffered from birth from Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type IV . They also agreed that in the absence of an account of trauma in a baby , rib fractures such as those observed would be highly suggestive of non - accidental injury inflicted by a forceful squeezing . However , while the latter CARDINAL doctors considered that the degree of force required to cause these fractures fell outwith the normal handling of a small baby although not within the category of abusive handling , PERSON took the view that it might not be completely outside the normal range of handling ( for example , catching a child who was slipping ) . The cause of the serious growth retardation was not known .", "CARDINAL . In light of that report , the local authority made an urgent application for an abridged procedure to withdraw care proceedings , which were scheduled for further hearing in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The interim care order was discharged in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted that the care proceedings had a devastating effect on her relationship with her partner and they have since separated . PERSON , meanwhile , was suffering from sleeping and behavioural problems , was reluctant to leave the first applicant , would not play with other children and screamed and threw food at strangers .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant complained to the local authority which appointed an independent person , PERSON , to investigate the complaint . After interviewing the key people involved , she found various defects in the handling of the case . She held that the local authority had failed to consider fostering PERSON with family members as required by statute , noted the confusion in communication with the FAC concerning the risk assessment and stated that once it had been decided to accept the ORG recommendation the rehabilitation should have taken DATE , not DATE ; she also stated that there had been a steady deterioration in relations between the first applicant and the assigned social worker and that a more productive working relationship with the family might have been achieved by changing the caseworker as requested by the family . She did not uphold other specific complaints , finding , inter alia , that it had been necessary for the family to travel to FAC on DATE as the hearing , that the local authority was justified in imposing restrictive travel arrangements on the family while at FAC , that the stance of the judge and local authority when considering whether PERSON should be taken into care was understandable in light of the potential risks , that there was no reason to consider that the care received by PERSON from his foster carers was not entirely appropriate , that the parents were invited to review meetings and to give their views , and that the case involved the considered opinions of several eminent experts , who discounted bone disease and confirmed a diagnosis of non - accidental injury . She stated , inter alia , that with the weight of the medical evidence so firmly establishing non - accidental injury the local authority had no option but to apply for care proceedings . She made no recommendation for monetary compensation .", "DATE . On DATE the local authority 's complaints officer wrote to the first applicant and recommended that she receive a full apology and that certain aspects of the local authority 's systems be reviewed and revised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in light of the above negative findings , ORG sent the first applicant a letter of apology in respect of the criticised practices .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant instituted proceedings against the local authority on behalf of herself and LAW , claiming damages for negligence and personal injury .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his Honour Judge PERSON held that the local authority owed no duty of care to a parent in the context of care proceedings based on allegations of abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge rejected the claims of PERSON on the ground that he had not been shown to have suffered any recognisable psychiatric damage , or alternatively , that any injury was transient and not compensatable by damages .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants were granted permission to appeal but the proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of NORP v. ORG and others [ DATE ] AC CARDINAL ( see description of domestic proceedings in GPE and PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . These cases concluded in ORG , which held that no duty was owed by medical or social work professionals to parents in the exercise of their duties , in the best interests of the children , when deciding whether there had been any abuse and what measures were necessary .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing of the applicants ' appeals on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG on DATE dismissed the first applicant 's appeal as at no stage was she owed a duty of care by the local authority . The court also rejected PERSON 's appeal on the ground that there was no evidence that he had suffered harm other than transient distress . In the alternative , the court held that any harm suffered by PERSON did not amount to a recognised psychiatric disorder and was therefore not of the kind giving rise to an action for damages ( \u201c non - justiciable harm \u201d ) . LAW DATE and LAW were irrelevant as the case concerned events prior to the LAW 's implementation .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c Subject to any regulations made by the Secretary of ORG for the purposes of this subsection , any local authority looking after a child shall make arrangements to enable him to live with\u2014", "( a ) a person falling within subsection ( CARDINAL ) ; or", "( b ) a relative , friend or other person connected with him ,", "unless that would not be reasonably practicable or consistent with his welfare . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
