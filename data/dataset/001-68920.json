On DATE ORG , in a decision addressed to PERSON , dismissed the appeal of DATE . It considered that the appeal against the search warrant was inadmissible as it was devoid of purpose ( prozessual \u00fcberholt ) , the search having been effected in the meantime . The relevance of the few documents seized could be established without the need for a further procedure . The appeal against the seizure order was ill - founded , as the documents seized were relevant for the assessment of the evidence because they could show whether , as asserted by the appellant , CARDINAL of the company 's employees had committed the traffic offence in question . Moreover , the seizure had not been disproportionate because copies of the originals had been filed and the originals handed back .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon a complaint by the applicant 's representative , re - examined the applicant 's appeal , declaring it inadmissible as far as the search warrant was concerned and unfounded as to the seizure order .

On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to admit the complaint . ORG disagreed with ORG finding that the appeal against the search warrant was inadmissible for the sole reason that the search had already been carried out . According to ORG , that finding disregarded the principle of effective legal protection as guaranteed by LAW . In support of its view , ORG referred to its decision of DATE , which had reversed its former case - law on the point . Nonetheless , ORG considered it inappropriate to admit the constitutional complaint . Indeed , when examining the lawfulness of the seizure order , ORG had also , incidentally , addressed the question of the lawfulness of the search order . In any event , the impugned search warrant was obviously lawful . This decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the resumed trial proceedings , ORG rendered its judgment against GPE It found him guilty of having negligently exceeded a speed limit , imposed a fine of LAW ( MONEY ) on him in accordance with the uniform scale of fines ( PERSON ) for the various road - traffic regulatory offences , and ordered him to bear the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , having compared the photographs taken on the occasion of the radar check , in particular the enlargement prepared by the expert , and PERSON 's passport photograph taken in DATE , which had been retained in the administrative files of the ORG municipal authorities , the court reached the conclusion that it was PERSON who had been driving the car . In this respect , the court compared the form of the face , the nose , the position of the eyes and the eyebrows . Furthermore , although PERSON had meanwhile grown a beard , the lower part of the face on the radar photos and of PERSON 's face on the passport photo , showing him without a beard , clearly matched . There were no indications that any other person with the same characteristics had been driving the car at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL .
