NORP The present case concerns the applicant \u2019s trial and conviction before a judge and jury at ORG for the murder of a Mr Jon Bartlett . A co - defendant , Mr PERSON , was tried and acquitted of assisting an offender .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was shot dead at CARDINAL pm on DATE . According to witnesses the gunman was wearing a baseball cap and drove off in a silver ORG . In TIME of DATE a silver ORG was set alight a short distance from the scene of the shooting .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the murder the applicant fled to the GPE . He was subsequently extradited from the GPE to GPE to stand trial for PERSON murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant formally served a Defence Statement in which he alleged that Mr PERSON had been murdered by PERSON , a man who had previously been convicted of serious drug and firearms offences and who was at that time serving a prison sentence for murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was that he had been involved in a drug deal with Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . On TIME Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had asked him to provide a car so they could collect a shipment of drugs . DATE he purchased the ORG in the presence of PERSON and PERSON , but Mr PERSON had driven off in it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met PERSON again at TIME to give him his share of money for the drugs . Mr PERSON was driving the Vectra . The applicant left the meeting with PERSON , who was driving a white van .", "CARDINAL . After this meeting the applicant went to his GPE home . During TIME he went to a petrol station and while he was there he called a friend whose mother lived near the road where the burning ORG was discovered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police interviewed Mr PERSON about the applicant \u2019s allegations . He answered \u201c no comment \u201d to the questions asked . That evening he telephoned his son and told him he had never heard of the applicant and knew nothing of the murder . On DATE he telephoned his wife and again denied any involvement in the murder . Both of these conversations were recorded as PERSON , a category A prisoner , would have known .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s trial for the murder of PERSON started on DATE . At the trial it was accepted by the applicant that the real issue for the jury was whether he or PERSON was the murderer . Mr PERSON was asked to make a statement or give evidence at the trial but refused to do so . This was made known to the court through a statement from an officer at the prison where he was being detained .", "CARDINAL . To disprove the applicant \u2019s defence the prosecution sought to adduce the recordings of PERSON telephone calls pursuant to section MONEY ) of MONEY DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The defence objected to their admission in evidence but the judge ruled that they should be admitted . In his ruling , the judge stated that Mr PERSON had indicated , in the clearest terms , that he was not prepared to make a statement to the police or give evidence at the trial .", "CARDINAL . In determining whether the recordings should be admitted , the judge considered the matters listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . First , he stated that he was satisfied the evidence had extremely strong probative value as Mr PERSON \u201c appeared to be expressing genuine outrage at being implicated in a murder in which he was in no way involved \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , he indicated that Mr PERSON could not be called because he refused to give evidence , but noted that all the enquiries carried out by the police to date had confirmed his lack of involvement in the killing .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , he said that he was satisfied the evidence in question was \u201c extremely important \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , the judge referred to the submissions of counsel for the applicant and for his co - defendant , who submitted that Mr PERSON would have known that his calls were being recorded by the prison authorities , and argued that his statements were self - serving . The judge said that these were all valid comments which the jury should consider in assessing the weight to be attached to Mr PERSON \u2019s denials , but were not , in his view , grounds for excluding evidence .", "CARDINAL . Fifthly , he pointed out that as the conversations were taped the evidence was clearly reliable .", "CARDINAL . Sixthly , the trial judge said that the defence had already crossexamined the officer in the case as to Mr PERSON \u2019s previous convictions and the details of the murder for which he was serving his sentence of life imprisonment . Moreover , he had already noted that the jury should consider the fact that Mr PERSON \u2019s comments were self - serving and that he would have known that his telephone conversations were being recorded .", "CARDINAL . Finally , he said that he did not consider that there would be any real prejudice to the applicant from the tapes being played .", "CARDINAL . At trial , in addition to playing the tapes , the prosecution led evidence that the applicant and victim were known to each other and were both involved in drug dealing on a substantial scale . Items connected to drug dealing were recovered from Mr PERSON \u2019s home , CARDINAL of which was a list of debts . The applicant \u2019s name appeared on this list and he was shown as owing the victim GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution also relied on the applicant \u2019s previous arrest when he was found to be in possession of a firearm . In his evidence the applicant admitted that when arrested on that occasion he had been dealing in drugs , but denied possession of the firearm .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s mobile telephone records were also introduced to show that he had been in contact with the applicant on DATE of the murder . The last telephone call between them was recorded at TIME , shortly before the murder . There had also been significant telephone contact between the applicant and PERSON in DATE prior to the murder .", "CARDINAL . The seller of the silver ORG gave evidence that on TIME of the murder he had been contacted by the applicant , who had arranged to meet at his house at TIME The seller \u2019s mother testified that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL men who collected the car was named PERSON and was wearing a baseball cap . The men came for the car in a white van that had been hired by the father of PERSON that day from PERSON , a hire company , and passed to PERSON at TIME . The van had distinctive orange writing on the side .", "CARDINAL . Witnesses also saw a white van in the vicinity of the shooting at the relevant time . The van had orange writing on the side , and was similar , if not identical , to the van that had been hired from PERSON on the same date .", "CARDINAL . GPE telephone cell site evidence was led by the prosecution with the intention of showing that the applicant \u2019s mobile telephone was in the vicinity of the murder at the relevant time , although it was switched off QUANTITY and TIME Cell site evidence also demonstrated that the applicant and his co - accused were in the vicinity of the road where the ORG was found TIME and TIME", "CARDINAL . Residents of the streets near the shooting gave evidence . CARDINAL stated that she had heard CARDINAL bangs and a man running to a car and driving off very quickly . Another , Ms Rita Willott , gave a description of the gunman as being between twenty and DATE , of average build and height and wearing a baseball cap . She saw a car matching the ORG \u2019s description leaving the scene . PERSON evidence was not challenged and was read to the jury . A third eye - witness , a DATE boy , also gave evidence that the gunman had been in DATE and had been wearing a baseball cap . A fourth eye - witness , Mr PERSON , also gave a description matching the applicant . A fifth witness , PERSON , gave evidence that she had seen both the car and the van near the shooting . The driver of the car was in his late teens or DATE , had short brown hair and wore a baseball cap . Several other witnesses gave descriptions to the effect that the man driving the ORG was white and was wearing a baseball cap .", "CARDINAL . NORP CCTV footage from a petrol station showed the applicant arriving in the white PERSON , wearing a baseball cap and making telephone calls to an associate at TIME The number dialled by the applicant was in the vicinity of the cell site covering the road where the ORG was found and the inference sought by the prosecution was that the applicant was in discussions about the destruction of the car .", "CARDINAL . A police superintendent also gave evidence of the enquiries into Mr PERSON . The police had found no connection between Mr PERSON and either Mr PERSON or the applicant ( there was , for instance , no reference to PERSON PERSON in Mr PERSON \u2019s telephones ) and it was the superintendent \u2019s conclusion that there was absolutely no evidence that he had been involved in Mr PERSON \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . A photograph of Mr PERSON was also adduced in evidence . The prosecution \u2019s case was that Mr PERSON , a man in his DATE , did not match the description of the gunman given by the eye - witnesses .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s previous convictions for drug offences , firearm offences , and murder committed on CARDINAL May CARDINAL were also adduced .", "CARDINAL . On Mr PERSON \u2019s telephone calls , the trial judge directed the jury as follows :", "\u201c It is for you to decide what weight , if any , you attach to this evidence ; but it does have certain limitations which I must draw to your attention : ( a ) you had not had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses in the witness box and sometimes when you do see and hear a witness you get a much clearer idea of whether his evidence is honest and accurate ; ( b ) their evidence has not been tested under crossexamination and you have not had the opportunity of seeing how their evidence survived this form of challenge ; ( c ) in the case of PERSON these were self - serving statements , that is he was saying he was not involved in the murder of PERSON . In addition calls made by high risk category A prisoners , such as PERSON , from prison would be known by him to be recorded and he was speaking in those calls to members of his own family . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On Mr PERSON \u2019s previous convictions , the trial judge directed the jury :", "\u201c You have heard this evidence because it may help you to resolve CARDINAL issues in the case , namely : ( a ) whether the convictions show that on CARDINALst May CARDINAL he had a tendency to be a drug dealer , carry a firearm and commit murder , and whether this makes it more likely that he was the gunman in this case ; and ( b ) whether he was being truthful and reliable in denying his involvement in the present case in his telephone calls to his son and wife . A person of bad character may be less likely to tell the truth , but it does not follow that he is incapable of doing so .", "You may use the evidence of his bad character for the particular purposes I have just indicated , if you find it helpful to do so . It is for you to decide the extent to which the evidence of bad character helps you , if at all . The prosecution submit that the only reason PERSON chose to name PERSON as the murderer in his defence statement on DATE was because he knew he had an extremely bad character for drugs offences , firearm offences and murder , and therefore was an ideal person for him to blame for the murder in this case . The defendant ORG says he named him because he believed PERSON killed PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the course of their deliberations , the jury asked and were allowed to hear the tapes of Mr PERSON \u2019s telephone calls again . On DATE , by a majority , the jury convicted the applicant of murder . He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of DATE . He appealed against conviction to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The application for leave to appeal was initially considered and rejected by a single judge in DATE . The application was renewed before the full court on DATE and leave to appeal was granted . In doing so , the court found it to be arguable that the trial judge did not make sufficient investigations with regard to the production of PERSON . The court also observed :", "\u201c It seems to us that it is a long standing principle that unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary , the best available evidence should be put before the jury . In this instance , rather than the jury hearing from Mr PERSON himself , they heard the recording of his CARDINAL conversations . It is also of note that shortly after the jury had retired they asked if they might hear the recordings again and , after some discussion , the recordings were played to them . It is perhaps pertinent to observe that had PERSON himself given evidence , what would have happened if there had been a request by the jury to be reminded of his evidence is that the judge would have summarised it to them from his notebook . Playing the recordings a second time to the jury , that , submits Miss PERSON [ counsel for the applicant ] , is something that elevates the importance of the hearsay evidence there contained . There is no doubt that the recordings were important evidence in the context of the case as a whole ( at least so far as we are thus persuaded ) and we have come to the conclusion that permission to appeal should be granted on all grounds advanced and the hearing will proceed in due course accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the full court heard the case and dismissed the appeal , reserving its judgment . The judgment was delivered on CARDINAL DATE . In relation to the tapes of PERSON telephone calls , the court observed :", "\u201c It is contended on behalf of the Appellant [ the present applicant ] that the tapes of the calls should not have been admitted without calling , or trying to call , PERSON to give evidence .", "...", "The difficulty with this submission is the judge \u2019s finding of fact that PERSON would not give evidence . It is true that he could have been compelled to come to Court . However , on the basis of the judge \u2019s finding , the grounds for which have not been impugned , that would have been a fruitless exercise . Moreover , he would have had to be warned of the right to exercise the privilege against self - incrimination . The prospect of any sensible evidence being given by him was , on any realistic view , nil . All that the defence could have obtained was the advantage of having him brought up before the jury , who would presumably have seen his obduracy .", "The judge considered this evidence to be important and to have strong probative value . We do not know whether the jury shared this view . The defence were able to say , as they did , that the statements were self - serving , made by a serious criminal who knew that they were being recorded . What is central to this appeal is that the judge addressed the matters required to be addressed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ of LAW DATE ] . The allegation against PERSON had been made late , and given that on the Appellant \u2019s case he had known of PERSON \u2019s responsibility for the murder within DATE of its being committed , it is to be inferred that it was deliberately made late so as to make it more difficult for the ORG to investigate it . As it was , because of the lateness of the allegation , the telephone records for telephones used in the murder for which PERSON had been convicted only went back to DATE .", "In ORG said :", "\u2018 CARDINAL . ORG will not readily interfere with a trial judge \u2019s decision to admit evidence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) [ of MONEY DATE ] . It will do so , in general , only if his decision is marred by legal error , or by a failure to take relevant matters into account or it is such that the judge could not sensibly have made.\u2019", "The judge \u2019s decision was not marred by legal error ; he took all relevant matters into account ; and the decision to admit the recordings in evidence was not one that no judge could sensibly have made .", "...", "For these reasons , we reject this ground of appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then added :", "\u201c The safety of the conviction", "However , we would in any event have upheld the safety of the conviction . The evidence against the Appellant may have been circumstantial , but it was overwhelming . In summary :", "( i ) The only evidence of PERSON \u2019s involvement was that of the Appellant .", "( ii ) PERSON and PERSON were involved in drugs together ; there was evidence that PERSON was in debt to PERSON and that PERSON was pressing for payment . PERSON had a motive to kill PERSON .", "( iii ) There was no good reason for the allegation of PERSON \u2019s involvement to have been made so late .", "( iv ) It is difficult to see why the Appellant fled the country if he was innocent .", "( v ) The police uncovered no evidence of any link between PERSON and either the Appellant or PERSON , despite exhaustive enquiries . Miss PERSON contends that those enquiries were imperfect . The fact remains that there was no such evidence .", "( vi ) The Appellant himself accepted that he made no direct calls to PERSON ; contact was , he said , made via PERSON . If all CARDINAL were involved in a drugs deal , it is curious indeed that the Appellant did not have PERSON \u2019s telephone number and could not and did not telephone him direct .", "( vii ) There was no evidence of PERSON \u2019s telephones having been used to telephone any telephone number associated with PERSON .", "( viii ) PERSON was born in DATE . He was DATE at the date of PERSON \u2019s murder . The evidence of PERSON ( described by the judge as an extremely important witness ) was not challenged and was read at the trial . She said that the man who fired the gun was aged DATE , of average build and height , and he was wearing a baseball cap . PERSON , a boy aged DATE , said that the gunman was wearing a baseball cap and was in his DATE . PERSON described the gunman as white , in his CARDINALs , athletic and QUANTITY , of slim build . All these descriptions fitted the Appellant and not Pearman . Against these , CARDINAL witness described the gunman as not appearing to be young . Miss PERSON suggested that the evidence of the age of the gunman should be discounted because of the uncertainties of ascribing an age to a man wearing a baseball cap . However , the weight of the evidence points clearly to a young man such as the Appellant rather than PERSON . If the Appellant seriously wished to challenge Miss PERSON \u2019s evidence , she should have been required to give evidence orally and should have been cross examined .", "( ix ) Similarly , PERSON described the driver of the Vectra car , seen by her together with the PERSON , as in his late teens or DATE , with short brown hair and wearing a baseball cap . Her account of what she saw was inconsistent with the Appellant \u2019s .", "( x ) The evidence relating to the purchase of the ORG and the hire of the PERSON on DATE of the murder supports the prosecution case .", "( xi ) The cell phone evidence showed PERSON to be in the vicinity of the murder when it was committed ; the timing of his last telephone connection with PERSON , just before the murder , and the switching off of his telephone at the time of the murder , and his call to a telephone in the vicinity of the location where the ORG was set on fire , all powerfully supported his guilt .", "( xii ) Lastly , evidence was given that on a previous occasion ORG had had a connection with a firearm .", "Thus , quite apart from the evidence of PERSON \u2019s telephone calls , we had no doubt as to the safety of the conviction of the Appellant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that ORG had refused to certify questions of general public importance for the consideration of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
