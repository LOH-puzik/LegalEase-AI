They are represented before the ORG by Miss M Dyker , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants met in DATE and started a relationship . They were married in DATE and have been living as a married couple since , jointly owning their home and having a joint mortgage .", "The second applicant , PERSON , was born male , but underwent gender reassignment surgery ( funded by ORG ) in DATE , after a consultation process which began in DATE . The first applicant , NORP , was involved in this process throughout , attending appointments with the relevant medical professionals , and providing both practical and emotional support . The applicants contend that PERSON \u2019s treatment and surgery have not affected either the emotional or physical aspects of their relationship , and they have left open the possibility of having children in the future .", "F wishes to have her new gender recognised . In particular , she wishes to have a birth certificate upon which her gender is recognised as female . By the provisions of LAW ( \u2018 ORG ) , provision is made for those who have acquired a new gender to apply for a full ORG ( \u2018 GRC\u2019 ) . This in turn entitles the holder to obtain what is , to all outward intents and purposes , a new birth certificate recognising their new gender .", "However , it is a condition of the issue of a full ORG that the recipient not be married . As she is married , PERSON is entitled to apply for an interim gender recognition certificate ( \u2018 GRC\u2019 ) to allow her female status to be officially recognised , but she would only be able to obtain a full ORG if she and NORP divorce , something to which they are deeply opposed .", "ORG would necessarily incur costs of ORG together with solicitors\u2019 costs of QUANTITY . Their representative before this ORG also notes that , in the event that NORP and PERSON were required to divorce , she would have to advise them to take independent legal advice with a view to coming to an agreement as to how they should divide their matrimonial property to protect their financial positions . The applicants contend that a failure to take such advice and divide the property accordingly would lead to NORP , in particular , losing rights . Taking independent legal advice and drawing up a minute of agreement ( even if it were not contentious ) would cost in the region of GBP CARDINAL for each party . There would also be costs associated with any resulting transfers of property for purposes of division : a sale of their property would incur legal costs of CARDINAL .", "As of DATE , when the relevant sections of LAW entered into force , the applicants are entitled to enter a civil partnership . However , they do not consider such a partnership a full substitute for marriage . They highlight both what they contend is the different social standing attached to such civil partnerships and also the fact that they do not provide identical legal protection to that enshrined in statutes governing marriage . Entry into a civil partnership would also necessarily incur costs of in the region of GBP CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "LAW ( \u2018 ORG ) provides a mechanism whereby transsexuals may have their new genders recognised . LAW provides that ORG must grant an application if it is satisfied that the applicant : ( CARDINAL ) has , or has had , gender dysphoria ; ( CARDINAL ) has lived in the acquired gender throughout DATE ; and ( CARDINAL ) intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death .", "By section CARDINAL , an application must include a report from a registered medical practitioner , or a chartered psychologist , either of whom must be practising in the field of gender dysphoria . This report must include details of diagnosis . A second report must also be included , which need not be from a medical professional practising in the field of gender dysphoria , but could be from any registered medical practitioner .

These include , for instance , section CARDINAL , which provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where a full gender recognition certificate is issued to a person , the person \u2019s gender becomes for all purposes the acquired gender ( so that , if the acquired gender is the male gender , the person \u2019s sex becomes that of a man and , if it is the female gender , the person \u2019s sex becomes that of a woman ) . \u201d", "By Paragraph CARDINAL of Part CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the GRA CARDINAL , the issue of a full gender recognition certificate obliges the Registrar General for GPE to make an entry in the ( new ) ORG for GPE and to mark the original entry in the register of births referring to the birth ( or adoption ) of the transsexual person to show that the original entry has been superseded . Paragraph CARDINAL makes provision for an extract to be made of any entry in the ORG . An abbreviated certificate of birth compiled from the ORG must , by LAW , not disclose that it is compiled from the ORG . Both copies of and abbreviated certificates therefore look the same as any other birth certificates ; they therefore act , to all outward intents and purposes , as new birth certificates .", "Not all provisions of the ORG require status or situations existing prior to gender recognition to be changed or dissolved . For instance , provisions as to parenthood ( section CARDINAL ) , succession ( section CARDINAL ) and peerages ( section CARDINAL ) explicitly provide that the person \u2019s gender has become the acquired gender does not effect their status or rights flowing therefrom .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the Marriage ( GPE ) Act DATE provides that there is a legal impediment to a marriage in NORP law where the parties \u201c are of the same sex . \u201d The NORP position is considered to be broadly similar to that in GPE , where the relevant provision is contained in section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW DATE , which provides that a marriage is void unless the parties are \u201c respectively male and female . \u201d", "In the NORP case of PERSON v PERSON [ DATE ] Probate Reports CARDINAL it was held that marriage could only be between a woman and a man , determined on genital , gonadal and chromosomal factors , and should not take into account the party \u2019s psychological beliefs , however genuine and profound .", "Section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW DATE and PERSON v PERSON have recently been reconsidered by ORG in PERSON v PERSON [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL . Their Lordships considered that the words \u201c male \u201d and \u201c female \u201d were to be given their ordinary meaning and referred to a person \u2019s biological gender as determined at birth so that , for purposes of marriage , a person born with CARDINAL sex could not later become a person of the opposite sex . They therefore held that it was not possible under LANGUAGE ( and by analogy LANGUAGE ) law for a person to marry another person who was of the same gender at birth , even if one of them had undergone gender reassignment surgery . They did , however , issue a declaration that Section CARDINAL(c ) of the DATE Act represented a continuing obstacle to the ability of the ( male to female ) transsexual petitioner to enter into a valid marriage with a man , and that it was therefore incompatible with her rights under LAW .", "The ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE , as amended by LAW , reads in relevant part as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) In an action for divorce the court may grant decree of divorce if , but only if , it is established in accordance with the following provisions of the LAW that \u2013", "...", "( b ) an interim gender recognition certificate under LAW has , after the date of the marriage , been issued to either party to the marriage . \u201d", "The ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE does not provide for any defence to divorce where it is sought on the basis of the issue of an interim gender recognition certificate . The LAW is to be amended by a PERSON currently before ORG , but it does not appear that any amendments that may be made by the PERSON are material to this section .", "The financial consequences of divorce are set out in the ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE and LAW DATE . The rights on divorce are broadly speaking that the parties are DATE of the property referable to the period of the marriage , regardless of the name in which the property in question is formally held .
