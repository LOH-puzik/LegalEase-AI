NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . His nationality is in dispute . He maintains that he is a national of GPE ; the Government maintain that he is a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claims to have been born in GPE to a NORP mother and a NORP father , and thus to have NORP nationality . He claims that he returned as a young child with his father to GPE , where he lived until he re - entered GPE in DATE , travelling with both his expired child \u2019s NORP passport and his valid NORP passport . There is no evidence to support this account , as he claims that both passports were subsequently stolen from him .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant was convicted for persistently soliciting a woman for prostitution and fined . He was convicted in DATE of obtaining property by deception , for which he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He was convicted in DATE of soliciting persons for car hire without a licence and driving whilst uninsured , for which he received a fine . He was convicted in DATE of driving whilst uninsured , for which he was fined and disqualified from driving for DATE . On DATE , he was convicted of forgery . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and deportation proceedings against him were initiated . He was notified of his liability to deportation on DATE and did not make any representations in response . Nor did he appeal against deportation . On DATE , he was served with a signed deportation order . At the expiry of his sentence on DATE , the applicant was taken into immigration detention pending his deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst still in prison , the applicant refused to attend an interview with ORG for GPE in GPE to obtain a travel document . Following a warning , however , he attended an interview on DATE . The NORP authorities were not prepared to accept that the applicant was a national of GPE ; however , subsequent to the interview , further documentation was sent to ORG by the NORP authorities in evidence of the applicant \u2019s connection to GPE . Regular reminders have since been sent by the NORP authorities and , on DATE , a response was received from ORG , stating that the applicant \u2019s national status was required to be verified from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the legality of his detention . Permission was granted and a substantive hearing was held before ORG on DATE . The onus was on the applicant to prove his claimed NORP citizenship and the judge found that , on the evidence before him and having regard to the applicant \u2019s dishonesty and use of false identities in the past , he had not done so . He had not established that any of the identities he had claimed in the past were actually his , or that he had been born in GPE to a NORP mother , as he claimed . Having failed to prove that he was NORP , he must be treated as a foreign criminal , and was thus liable to detention pending his deportation . The judge was satisfied that the Secretary of ORG was genuinely using the power to detain for the purposes of effecting the applicant \u2019s deportation . While the DATE period of immigration detention was long , it was not unreasonable , given the applicant \u2019s insistence that he was NORP when he was not , and his failure to disclose sufficient details about his years in GPE to enable the NORP authorities to issue him with a travel document . The judge also accepted the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision that the applicant presented a high risk of absconding and of committing further offences if granted immigration bail ; the fact that the applicant was failing to cooperate in obtaining a travel document only reinforced this risk . The key point was that the obstacles to the applicant \u2019s deportation had been created by the applicant himself and his failure to give an honest account to either the NORP or NORP authorities . Given that his claim to be NORP had now been examined and rejected by a court , the judge found that the applicant might now be minded to disclose the necessary information to the authorities to enable a travel document to be issued . There was a sufficiently realistic prospect that the applicant \u2019s deportation would take place within a reasonable time to render his continued detention lawful .", "The applicant notified the ORG on DATE that he had been released from detention . He did not provide any information as to why he had been released .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same LAW provides that when any question arises as to whether a person is a NORP citizen or not , the onus shall be on the person asserting such citizenship to prove it .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL of the same LAW provides that , where a deportation order is in force against any person , he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of ORG pending his removal or departure from GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG recently reaffirmed principles that had been set down in the case of NORP v. Governor of ORG , ex parte ORG PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL regarding the Secretary of ORG \u2019s power to detain those whose deportation is pending , in GPE ( WL ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG . The principles are as follows : i ) the Secretary of ORG must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose ; ii ) the deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances ; iii ) if , before the expiry of the reasonable period , it becomes apparent that the Secretary of ORG will not be able to effect the deportation within a reasonable period , he should not seek to exercise the power of detention ; and iv ) the Secretary of ORG should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
