He acknowledged his paternity of the child DATE . As the child \u2019s parents did not make a joint custody declaration ( gemeinsame GPE ) , the child \u2019s mother obtained sole custody ( alleinige PERSON ) pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of the German Civil Code ( the \u201c Civil Code \u201d \u2013 see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "The applicant and the child \u2019s mother had been living together with the child in a joint household in GPE from DATE until DATE , when the parents separated and the mother moved to another flat in the neighbourhood . In the period from DATE each parent took care of the child on an equal alternating DATE basis .", "In DATE the mother and son moved from GPE to GPE , located QUANTITY ( km ) from GPE , without notifying the applicant . The mother alleged that she had moved since the applicant \u2019s behaviour in the past had been detrimental to the child \u2019s well - being .", "In written submissions to the Berlin - Pankow - Wei\u00dfensee District Court dated DATE and DATE the applicant requested that custody of the child or , alternatively , the right to determine where the child should reside ( ORG ) be transferred to him . The applicant further asked to be granted contact with his son on a DATE alternating basis and , in addition , requested an interim measure for the provisional regulation of his access to the child .", "By a letter of DATE the court informed the applicant that the matter had been referred to ORG , where CARDINAL separate proceedings were instituted , CARDINAL related to the transfer of the right of custody to the applicant ( file no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and the other dealing with the applicant \u2019s request to be granted contact with his son ( file no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Subsequently , the proceedings were to a large extent conducted simultaneously .", "On DATE the applicant brought criminal charges of , inter alia , child abduction against the mother . The preliminary proceedings ( ORG ) instituted against the mother as a consequence were discontinued by the public prosecution authorities . Following allegations by the mother that the applicant had sexually abused the child , preliminary criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant by ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( DATE ) informed ORG that owing to the mother \u2019s refusal to communicate it was not in a position to give an opinion on how contact between father and son should be arranged .", "During a hearing in the contact rights proceedings ( file no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on DATE , the applicant requested to be granted unsupervised access to his son .", "By a decision of DATE in the interim proceedings , ORG provisionally granted the applicant supervised access in cooperation with the PERSON branch of ORG ( PERSON ) , located in the vicinity of GPE . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s request for unrestricted contact , stating that such a decision could only be rendered in the main proceedings after the court had obtained an expert opinion on possible contact arrangements between the applicant and his son .", "The parents and the child were heard on CARDINAL and DATE respectively in the main proceedings ( files CARDINAL . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The child expressed his wish to stay with each of his parents on an alternating DATE basis .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ordered a psychological expert opinion on the question of what attribution of custody and contact rights would be in the child \u2019s best interests , and appointed an expert . Both parents objected to the court \u2019s decision and to the expert appointed . Thereafter , the mother refused to cooperate with the expert .", "DATE and DATE the applicant had supervised contact with his son on CARDINAL occasions at the LOC of the PERSON branch of ORG . He then discontinued the visits considering that the conditions under which access to his son took place were detrimental to the child \u2019s well - being .", "By a letter of DATE , the GPE public prosecution authorities informed the applicant that the preliminary criminal proceedings instituted against him in DATE on suspicion of sexual abuse of his son had been discontinued .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant renewed his interim request for unsupervised access , maintaining that following the discontinuation of the preliminary criminal proceedings there was no longer any reason to subject contact with his son to restrictions .", "In a decision of DATE confirming the dismissal of a complaint of bias lodged by the applicant against the acting judge at ORG , ORG indicated that an abusive obstruction of the applicant \u2019s contact with the child by the mother could trigger doubts regarding her capacity to raise the child and even entail the withdrawal of her right to determine where the child should reside .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ordered the parties to cooperate with the expert , failing which a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) could be imposed .", "On DATE the applicant spent TIME alone with his son with the consent of the mother .", "A first meeting between the expert and the mother took place in DATE .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE , holding that while parents were under no legal obligation to have their child examined by an expert and could therefore not be subject to a fine , persistent refusals by the mother to cooperate with the expert in the case at hand could nevertheless raise doubts as to her capacity to exercise parental authority .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to amend its decision of DATE with a view to granting him unsupervised contact with his son . The court found that in view of the mother \u2019s allegations of sexual abuse , unsupervised access could only be considered once the expert opinion had been rendered and provided clarifications on the veracity of such allegations .", "On DATE the expert met with the child .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant again made an interim request for unsupervised access to his son .", "By a decision of DATE , following a change of the acting judge , ORG appointed a guardian ad litem ( PERSON ) for the child .", "A further hearing of the parents and the child took place on DATE .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG appointed a new expert after doubts as to the competence and impartiality of the initially appointed expert had arisen .", "By a further decision of the same date ORG , after hearing the parents and the child and referring to a written statement obtained from the initially appointed expert on DATE , rejected the applicant \u2019s renewed interim request for a right to unsupervised contact pending the finalisation of an opinion by the newly appointed expert . After having heard the mother , the court was of the opinion that the allegations of sexual abuse were not entirely devoid of substance and therefore an expert opinion could not be dispensed with . The court further held that the applicant \u2019s explicit refusal to meet his son within the parameters of supervised visits or to accept alternative arrangements in the context of supervised visits raised doubts as to how important the child \u2019s well - being was to him .", "The expert opinion was rendered on DATE following examination of the parents and the child . The expert found that under the present circumstances , withdrawal of the right to custody from the mother and transfer of sole custody to the father would be contrary to the child \u2019s well - being . Joint custody would also not be in the child \u2019s interest since the relationship between the parents was still tense . The expert , however , recommended that regular contact should be established between the applicant and his son . At the beginning it could be envisaged that the father visit his son every second weekend at GPE , and following a trial period of DATE , longer stays by the child at the applicant \u2019s household could be considered .", "The guardian ad litem , having heard the parents and the child , in her written submissions dated DATE also opposed a transfer of the right to custody to the applicant , while recommending that the latter be granted immediate unrestricted access to his son . The guardian ad litem recalled that under the applicable law the transfer of sole custody to the father of a child born out of wedlock without the mother \u2019s consent was only possible under LAW in the event that the mother was unable to raise the child and thus the latter \u2019s well - being was jeopardised . While the mother could be reproached for having taken the son out of his familiar environment in GPE and having deprived him of his father \u2019s company without a convincing reason , there was nothing to support the applicant \u2019s allegations that she suffered from a mental disorder that made her unfit to raise her son . The guardian ad litem was further of the opinion that in view of the ongoing disputes and lack of any agreement between the parents as regards the child \u2019s upbringing , joint custody was also not an option .", "By a decision of DATE ORG accorded the applicant unsupervised contact with the child every other DATE , with the proviso that the meetings were to take place within a radius of QUANTITY from the mother \u2019s place of residence . Both parties appealed against the decision .", "By a decision of DATE ORG amended ORG decision of DATE and granted the applicant regular unsupervised contact with the child every third weekend and during CARDINAL the school holidays .", "It appears that the applicant was subsequently able to exercise his contact rights accordingly .", "In preparation for a hearing in the still pending custody proceedings during which the expert had been invited to further elaborate on his opinion dated DATE , the applicant asked ORG for a graduate pedagogue to be admitted to question the psychological expert on his behalf , since neither he nor his counsel had the necessary knowledge of psychology to put the relevant questions . By a decision of DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request , holding that the latter \u2019s counsel had already submitted a list of relevant questions to the expert in writing that did not support his allegations of a lack of knowledge . The court further was of the opinion that the pedagogue suggested by the applicant did not have the required qualifications . Pointing out that hearings in family law cases were as a rule held in camera and therefore the admission of additional advisers to the parties had to remain the exception , the court was of the opinion that there existed no exceptional circumstances in the case at hand that would justify deviating from this principle .", "A hearing took place on DATE during which the expert provided further explanations . The guardian ad litem reported that the child , following his last stay with his father earlier in DATE , had expressed his wish to now live with his father and to only visit his mother .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request that sole custody for the child or alternatively the right to determine where the child should reside be transferred to him under LAW . It also dismissed his further alternative request that he be granted joint custody together with the mother and that the latter \u2019s consent to joint custody as required by LAW be substituted by the courts in accordance with Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW to LAW , a transitory provision that had been introduced by the NORP legislature on DATE ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "As regards the transfer of sole custody the court found , firstly , that to the extent the applicant \u2019s request was based on LAW it had to be rejected as inadmissible . The ORG pointed out that the applicant and the mother of the child had never been married and had not made a joint custody declaration , and that therefore the mother had obtained sole custody of the child pursuant to LAW . LAW stipulated that in the event that the parents had not only temporarily separated and that the mother had sole custody of the child pursuant to LAW , the father could request the transfer of sole custody or partial custody only with the mother \u2019s consent . Since in the case at hand the mother had refused to give her consent , the father \u2019s related request could not be based on LAW . The court further specified that it was irrelevant on what grounds the mother had refused consent since the said provision , as a rule , did not provide for the possibility of replacing the mother \u2019s consent by a court decision . The court therefore held that , unfortunately , it had to be accepted that fathers of children born out of wedlock were still not on an equal footing with married fathers .", "Secondly , the court considered whether a transfer of custody by court decision without the mother \u2019s consent could be envisaged under the exceptional circumstances of DATE of LAW , which enabled the family court to order the necessary protective measures if the child \u2019s physical , psychological or mental well - being was threatened and the parents were unwilling to take measures themselves . However , the court , having regard in particular to the expert opinion of DATE as supplemented at the hearing dated DATE , was of the opinion that in the instant case the child \u2019s well - being was not jeopardised by the attribution of sole custody to the mother . The expert had found that it would be contrary to the child \u2019s interest to transfer custody to his father , in particular in view of the tense relationship between the parents which had its origin mainly in the father \u2019s attempts to undermine the mother \u2019s upbringing of their son . The mother \u2019s previous allegations of sexual abuse had not led to a different assessment since she had not maintained these allegations before the expert and it appeared from the child \u2019s examination that the trusting relationship between son and father had not been damaged as a consequence of the mother \u2019s assertions . The expert had further specified that there were no indications to support the father \u2019s argument that the mother was suffering from a pathological personality disorder that made her unfit to raise a child . The fact that following his last stay with the father in DATE the child had expressed his wish to now live with his father and to only visit his mother constituted a normal conflict reaction of a child whose parents were divorced . However , given that the son was DATE and therefore unable to assess the consequences of moving in with his father , the child \u2019s statements could not change the expert \u2019s conclusion that sole custody should remain with the mother .", "The expert \u2019s conclusions had been corroborated by the statements of the guardian ad litem during the hearing on DATE , who had met with the child not long before the hearing and who had confirmed that the child was emotionally stable . In view of these findings the court was of the opinion that a further hearing of the child was not necessary .", "Finally , the court held that the applicant \u2019s alternative request to be granted joint custody in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) ( a ) of LAW to LAW was admissible but ill - founded . While this transitory provision provided in principle for the possibility of ordering joint custody and replacing the mother \u2019s related consent in the event that the parents , as in the instant case , had separated before DATE and had lived together with the child for a period of DATE without interruption prior to their separation , it further required that joint custody would be in the child \u2019s best interests . Referring to its reasoning with respect to the conditions of the transfer of sole joint custody under LAW and relying on the expert \u2019s evaluation at the hearing of DATE as well as the opinions of the representative of ORG and the guardian ad litem , the court found it established that in view of the persisting tension between the parents , joint custody would lead to further disputes as regards their son \u2019s upbringing , care and the question where he should reside . These disputes could jeopardise the positive development of the relationship between father and son and would thus be contrary to the child \u2019s interest . The court further emphasised that there were no grounds to doubt the professional competence of the appointed expert or the accuracy of his findings .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment in written submissions of DATE . He maintained in particular that in view of the fact that the child had last been heard by the judge and the expert in DATE but had stated before the guardian ad litem in DATE that he now wished to live with his father , a further hearing of his son by the judge as well as a new expert opinion were indispensable with a view to determining what attribution of custody would be in the child \u2019s best interests .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG , endorsing ORG findings , reiterated that joint parental authority required a minimum of willingness on the part of the parents to cooperate , a condition that had not been met in the case at hand where the irreconcilable conflicts between the parents were likely to be aggravated in the event of joint custody . These conclusions could be drawn from the content of the files without having recourse to a further expert opinion . A further hearing of the child or the further parties to the proceedings could also be dispensed with since no further decisive information regarding the attribution of parental authority could be expected from such a hearing .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , alleging a violation of his right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) .", "On DATE he lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision of DATE and ORG decision of DATE , challenging the refusal to grant him sole or alternatively joint custody of his son in accordance with LAW and LAW ) ( a ) of LAW to LAW .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint that his right to be heard had been violated as illfounded . In addition to the reasoning in its decision of DATE ORG considered that ORG had thoroughly assessed the facts of the case and had based its judgment on the statements of the parties to the proceedings who , except for the child , had been heard shortly before the ORG \u2019s decision and it could therefore be excluded that a new hearing would lead to a different assessment of the case . There was nothing to indicate that the mother was incapable of raising her son or that she had jeopardised the well - being of the child to an extent that would justify the withdrawal of her right of custody in accordance with LAW . Furthermore , it was beyond doubt that the considerable conflict between the parents had made joint custody impossible , and therefore a further expert opinion or additional hearing of the child could not influence the decision on the attribution of custody rights .", "In written submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant extended his constitutional complaint to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving further reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a first application with ORG under LAW ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the custody and contact rights proceedings in relation to his son . Relying on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention , he complained about the length of the domestic proceedings and about the domestic court \u2019s refusal to grant him unsupervised contact with his son .", "In its related judgment of DATE , the ORG , while finding that the length of the contact rights proceedings was still in compliance with the requirements of the LAW , held that the length of the custody right proceedings had infringed the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement embodied in LAW and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible . The ORG nevertheless specified that the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW concerned exclusively the contact rights proceedings , and that the compliance of the custody proceedings with this provision was the subject of a distinct application ( the instant application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to LAW of LAW ) the care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The state oversees the performance of this duty .", "The statutory provisions on custody and contact are to be found in LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) . LAW provides that the father and the mother have the right and the duty to exercise parental authority ( elterliche PERSON ) over a child .", "Under LAW , the family court may order the necessary protective measures if the child \u2019s physical , psychological or mental well - being is threatened by negligence and if the parents are unwilling to take those measures themselves . Measures which result in the separation of the child from CARDINAL parent are acceptable only if the child would be at risk otherwise ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "As regards children born out of wedlock , custody was - pursuant to the former LAW - automatically obtained by the mother . That provision was however declared unconstitutional by ORG in DATE . On DATE the amended LAW of DATE ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) , entered into force to implement ORG judgment of DATE . The relevant law in LAW was changed as follows : under LAW , the parents of a minor child born out of wedlock may exercise joint custody if they make a declaration to that effect ( joint custody declaration ) or if they marry . Otherwise Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the mother obtains sole custody .", "If the parents have not merely temporarily separated , and if the mother has obtained sole custody in accordance with LAW , LAW provides that the family court may transfer sole custody to the father if CARDINAL parent lodges the relevant application with the consent of the other parent . The application is to be granted if the transfer serves the child \u2019s interest .", "By contrast , parents exercising joint parental authority before their separation either because the child was born in wedlock , the parents have married following the child \u2019s birth or they have made a joint custody declaration , retain joint custody following their separation unless the court at the request of CARDINAL parent awards sole custody to the latter in accordance with the child \u2019s best interest pursuant to LAW .", "On DATE ORG found that LAW of LAW was unconstitutional because it lacked a transitional period for unmarried couples with children who were living together in DATE but who had separated before the amended LAW entered into force on DATE ( that is , those who were unable to make a joint custody declaration ) . In order to resolve the above - mentioned constitutional flaws , the NORP legislature introduced LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz in ORG ) on DATE , according to which a court may substitute the mother \u2019s consent to joint custody at the father \u2019s request if an unmarried couple have a child born out of wedlock , have lived together with the child for DATE without interruption and separated before DATE , provided that joint custody would serve the best interests of the child ( PERSON ) .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG also held that LAW , apart from the lack of a transition period , did not breach the right to respect for the family life of fathers whose children had been born out of wedlock .", "However , in a subsequent judgment of DATE referring , inter alia , to the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG found that to generally exclude a father of a child born out of wedlock from parental authority in the event that the child \u2019s mother had refused to give her consent , without providing the possibility of the father obtaining a judicial review of whether joint custody or the transfer of sole custody would be in the child \u2019s interests , had violated the father \u2019s parental rights guaranteed under LAW of LAW . ORG consequently decided that ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG Civil Code were unconstitutional and \u2013 pending the entry into force of the necessary statutory amendments \u2013 had to be applied with the proviso that the family courts transfer joint or sole custody at the request of a parent if such a transfer was considered to be in the child \u2019s interest ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
