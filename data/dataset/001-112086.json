Within the confines of the LAW , the legislator enjoys great freedom in regulating public service relationships . ... In DATE in the public sector \u2013 where the legal positions of both the employers and the employees are determined by their dependence on the ORG budget \u2013 public - law regulations , basically corresponding to the characteristics of the closed public service system , were introduced . The legal status of the individuals who perform work in the service of the ORG was DATE according to the specific features of the activities performed DATE governed by the legislature in separate Acts of ORG . ... The basic feature of the closed public service system is that the content of the public service relationship and the rights and duties of the subjects of the legal relationship are governed not by the parties\u2019 agreement but by statutes , by law . ... The content of the public service relationship is regulated under the law , regard being had to the fact that public servants carry out the tasks of the ORG , and , in performing their tasks , they exercise public powers , consequently DATE compared to other employees \u2013 additional statutory requirements must be imposed on them . The activity of public servants must serve the interest of the public , it must be professional , impartial , devoid of influence and bias , therefore public servants must meet up - to - date and high - standard professional requirements , must bear particular responsibility for their work and are subject to strict conflict - of - interest rules ; however , the incomes earned in the public service remain below the wages that can be obtained in the private sector , since the source of public PERSON remuneration is the ORG budget . The starting point for the closed public service system ... is that \u00ab additional requirements \u2013 compliance with which may and must be demanded from persons engaged in public service \u2013 may only be imposed in return for additional entitlements ORG . Such additional entitlements include the career system regulated and the salary guaranteed in an ORG , the predictable and safe \u2018 public service life career\u2019 system and the additional allowances . A basic characteristic of the closed public service system is the stability of public service relationship , namely that a public servant may be removed from office only where the conditions specified in an ORG are met . While until DATE the public service systems of various GPE were characterised by the gradual extension of the closed public service system , since then a strongly critical approach to the closed systems has become more and more dominant . As a consequence , in almost all GPE , public service reform processes have been launched in order to enhance the efficiency , performance and standards of the public administration . The direction of the reforms is to loosen the rigidity of the closed system , and to bring it closer to the regulation of private sector labour relations . The method generally applied for the loosening of the rigidity of the closed system is the loosening of the previously strictly interpreted concept of \u2018 non - dismissibility\u2019 and the widening of the grounds of dismissal .", "LAW on the Legal Status of Public Servants ( \u201c Ktv . \u201d ) has never been based on the principle of \u2018 non - dismissibility\u2019 , as it has widely recognised the possibility of dismissing public servants from office and the grounds and conditions of dismissal have even been widened in the period having elapsed since DATE . ...", "CARDINAL . ...

The employer \u2019s right freely to dismiss an employee can only be interpreted in the context of employment relationships based on contract , not in the context of civil service relationship based on the ORG . In public service relationships the right of dismissal from office is based not on the freedoms of contract but an ORG ; in case of dismissal from office by the employer the duty to give reasons can not be regarded as a \u201c preference rule \u201d ; on the contrary , it is a guarantee flowing from the nature of the legal relationship . ... In public service relationships , the statutory regulations concerning the grounds of dismissal from office constitute an issue of constitutionality , it being a guarantee corresponding to the specific features of public service relationships .

The constitutional protection flowing from the right to hold a public office does not mean that the holder of a public office can not be dismissed from office . ...

As to government officials\u2019 dismissal from office , the absence of grounds for dismissal and the lack of any statutory rules concerning the employer \u2019s obligation to give reasons endangers the \u2018 party - neutrality\u2019 , the independence from political influence , the impartiality and , therefore , the lawfulness of decisions of the public administration . Officials working in the organisation of public administration perform their tasks in a strictly hierarchical organisation . [ If ] government officials are not granted protection from dismissal from office , the person exercising the employer \u2019s rights may , at any time and without giving reasons , discontinue their employment , [ and ] they can not be expected openly to stand up for their professional and legal position , if they risk losing their jobs . ...", "CARDINAL . ...
