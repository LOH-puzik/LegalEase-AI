Experts concluded that [ the applicant ] did not have a psychiatric illness , but [ that ] he was a psychopath . However , the stream of complaints and motions subsequently intensified ; the circle of people against whom he asked [ for a ] criminal investigation to be opened due to their alleged failure to carry out their duties broadened .
