The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with trafficking in dangerous drugs . On DATE , while he was in pre - trial detention , a fresh charge of complicity in attempted wilful homicide was brought against him . The applicant was accused of having tried , by means of an instruction issued to third parties , to kill PERSON PERSON , the personal assistant to the Prime Minister , on account of Mr PERSON 's role in the separate proceedings on the charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs . The events in issue allegedly occurred before and on DATE . Expert forensic reports were submitted in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently placed in detention on remand in connection with this new criminal charge also .", "CARDINAL . From the date of the applicant 's arraignment ( DATE ) until CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL hearings took place before ORG , acting as a court of criminal inquiry . A number of police officers , experts and witnesses , including Mr PERSON , an accomplice who had made a confession and had been granted a pardon , were cross NORP examined by the parties . A number of objections were raised by the prosecution and the defence about the questions put by the other party . The court issued a ban on the publication of reports and articles about the proceedings before it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a graphologist and concluded that there were sufficient grounds for the filing of a bill of indictment against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the Attorney General asked ORG to re - open the proceedings in order to hear CARDINAL witnesses , namely CARDINAL other accomplices of the applicant , a doctor who had been on duty on DATE the victim was admitted to hospital , and the graphologist appointed on DATE . On DATE the court heard the first CARDINAL witnesses . The CARDINAL accomplices refused to give evidence in order not to incriminate themselves . The court revoked the appointment of the expert and asked the registrar to provide it with a new list of experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General again asked the court to reopen the proceedings and to explain the reasons for revoking the appointment of the expert ; to identify handwriting experts , including foreign ones ; and to hear all the evidence the police could adduce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a new graphologist , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General requested once again that the inquiry be re - opened . He asked that Mr PERSON and PERSON be heard , the latter being requested to give explanations about the record of his interrogation by the police . Moreover , he asked that some documents previously exhibited be listed in detail , while other documents not already exhibited should be produced by the registrar . A hearing , during which PERSON PERSON was examined , took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General requested that the inquiry be re - opened for the following matters : to correct a mistake in the records ; to hear PERSON ; to produce various newspapers ; to complete the appointment of another expert and have him produce some photographs ; and to hear CARDINAL new witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the examination of CARDINAL witnesses , the hearing was adjourned as PERSON was not in GPE . He gave evidence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the registrar informed the court that the evidence produced on DATE had not been properly recorded and that the witnesses heard during that sitting should be summoned again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General requested the re - opening of the inquiry in order to hear PERSON and other witnesses , as well as the witnesses examined on DATE . With the exception of PERSON PERSON , who was abroad , the witnesses concerned were examined by the prosecution on DATE . Counsel for the defence , who was attending another trial , was not present and reserved his right to crossexamine the witnesses . At the Attorney General 's request , on DATE PERSON was examined . At the end of the sitting , the court returned the documents relating to the proceedings to the Attorney General .", "CARDINAL . The bill of indictment against the applicant for the charge of complicity in attempted wilful homicide was filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was provisionally released on bail in relation to the charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs . However , the applicant could not leave the prison as he was still required to remain in pretrial detention on the charge of complicity in attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate notes of DATE the applicant filed several preliminary pleas , challenging the validity of the bill of indictment and the admissibility of a number of documents and prosecution witnesses . The applicant also requested that CARDINAL witnesses be heard on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General contested the admissibility of certain documents and witnesses referred to by the defence .", "CARDINAL . A number of hearings on the preliminary pleas took place before ORG . In particular , the applicant 's case was discussed on CARDINAL and DATE . On DATE , the case was adjourned until DATE because counsel for the applicant failed to appear . The case was further discussed on DATE and DATE , then postponed until DATE , on which date the applicant informed the court that his counsel had fallen ill . The case was adjourned first until DATE , then until DATE . On DATE and on CARDINAL DATE ORG heard oral submissions from the parties .", "CARDINAL . The following hearing , initially scheduled for DATE , was postponed until DATE on the ground that the court needed more time to deliberate . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment on all the preliminary pleas . Both the defence and the prosecution declared that they intended to appeal . The case was adjourned pending the decision on the parties ' appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment of DATE . The prosecution did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set the appeal down for hearing on DATE . The hearing was then adjourned until DATE on the ground that one of the sitting judges was ill . On DATE the parties made their oral submissions . The next hearing , initially scheduled for DATE , was postponed first until DATE , then until DATE , and finally until DATE at the request of the defence , on the ground that the accused had appeared in court unassisted . ORG heard further oral submissions by the parties on DATE and CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly quashed ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The case concerning the charge of complicity in attempted wilful homicide was resumed before ORG . A hearing was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE in order to agree on a date for the trial . However , the proceedings were adjourned at the defence 's request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant 's counsel withdrew from the defence team . ORG observed that all that needed to be done was to appoint a date for the trial by jury . However , the applicant 's remaining lawyer requested an adjournment in order to check his other professional commitments and to consult with his client . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL July CARDINAL the proceedings were postponed on the ground that the applicant 's counsel was ill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence challenged the President of ORG \u2013 Mr Justice PERSON \u2013 on the ground that he had participated in the trial of PERSON , one of the applicant 's coaccused . The parties made oral submissions on this plea , and the court ordered the applicant to submit , before DATE , a note indicating the legal provisions on which he was relying and the decisions taken by the judge in question during the trial of Mr GPE . The court proposed to adjourn the case until DATE , on which date a decision on the challenge should have been taken . However , the applicant 's counsel objected that he would be away from GPE during DATE . The proceedings were therefore postponed until DATE , on which date ORG rejected the challenge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant declared his intention to appeal . Observing that there was no right to appeal against its ruling , ORG provisionally fixed the date of the trial by jury for DATE . The applicant 's counsel observed that in view of the declaration made by the defence , the date of the trial should not have been fixed and the proceedings should rather have been adjourned sine die .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The hearing , initially scheduled for DATE , was held on DATE , on which date ORG adjourned the proceedings until DATE in view of the absence of the applicant 's counsel . The latter subsequently informed the court that he had not been notified of the new date of the hearing . ORG also observed that the Attorney General had not submitted a reply in writing to the applicant 's appeal . The Government , with whom the applicant disagreed , emphasised that submissions were normally made orally and that the Attorney General was in no way obliged to file a written reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the accused , who had fallen ill , did not appear . In the presence of his legal counsel , the court heard evidence from a doctor as to the applicant 's state of health . A medical certificate was exhibited .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It observed that the accused 's allegations were based only on suppositions and unproven gratuitous assertions which were devoid of legal value .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment and to a fine of MONEY ( MONEY ) in respect of the charge of trafficking in dangerous drugs . He then started to serve his sentence for that offence . The earliest date of the applicant 's release was fixed at DATE . This calculation was made by deducting from the final sentence the period that the accused had spent in pre - trail detention .", "CARDINAL . After having heard in camera the views of the defence and the prosecution , on DATE ORG decided to adjourn the trial by jury on the charge of complicity in attempted murder until DATE . It considered , in particular , that it was not wise to commence the new trial at a date too close to the termination of the other proceedings against the same accused . The witnesses to be heard on behalf of the prosecution were summoned to appear on DATE .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG exercising its constitutional jurisdiction , relying on a violation of LAW CARDINAL of LAW . He submitted , in particular , that he could not be judged by the same magistrate \u2013 Mr Justice Degaetano \u2013 who had participated in his previous trial for trafficking in dangerous drugs and in the trial of CARDINAL persons accused of complicity in the offence with which he was charged . He also complained about the extensive media coverage of his trial and about the negative opinions expressed about him and his innocence by the Prime Minister , by the Attorney General and by certain police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to stay the proceedings pending the decision on his constitutional application . The Attorney General replied that that request should be rejected as constituting an abuse of process .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that DATE of the jury trial had been known to the applicant by DATE . However , it was DATE before the trial was scheduled to commence that the accused had filed his constitutional application . ORG noted , moreover , that the fact that the constitutional application was pending did not stricto jure oblige it to adjourn the trial . However , if the trial were to be continued , ORG and , in the event of an appeal , ORG might have felt in some way pressed to give a ruling on the applicant 's complaint in an unreasonably short time ( that is , before the end of the trial ) . Such a situation should , if possible , be avoided and it would have been unnecessarily costly to have the trial by jury held more than once . ORG therefore decided to adjourn the hearing until DATE . Further sittings were held before ORG on DATE and DATE and on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ; they were all adjourned pending the outcome of the applicant 's constitutional application . The next hearing was fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The date of the first hearing before FAC was fixed for DATE , on which date the applicant produced several documents . The proceedings were adjourned in order to examine those documents . In a note of CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated that CARDINAL of his counsels had been required to go abroad on a university assignment and would not be present at the hearing on DATE . ORG reserved its decision on this matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared , assisted by his other counsel . He declared that he needed to produce in evidence copies of articles which had appeared in local newspapers . The case was adjourned until DATE , on which date the court requested further information from the applicant . The hearing of DATE was postponed at the Attorney General 's request . On DATE the court adjourned the case in order that the applicant could conduct inquiries to verify the facts concerning a video recording exhibited by him .", "CARDINAL . In a note of DATE the applicant pointed out that the recording in issue did not concern a political debate , as he had initially stated , but a press conference . On DATE he exhibited an audio recording of the political debate in question and declared that he had no further evidence to produce . The Attorney General requested the authentication of the document exhibited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a witness on behalf of the applicant appeared in order to authenticate the relevant documents . The case was adjourned first until DATE , then until DATE for final oral submissions by the parties . The hearings of DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE were adjourned as the court required more time for deliberation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Hall of ORG dismissed the applicant 's application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date of the first hearing , Mr Justice Degaetano , who presided over ORG , withdrew from the case . A substitute judge was appointed and the case was adjourned until DATE for oral submissions by the parties .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set DATE as the date for the trial on the merits of the charge of complicity in attempted murder . The applicant declared that he intended to bring before ORG the issues raised in his constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty with respect to the charge of complicity in attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings against him , the applicant applied for provisional release on bail on several occasions ( DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE ) . His requests were rejected by ORG and by ORG on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , after having held hearings at which the parties were able to make their oral submissions .", "CARDINAL . ORG was not persuaded that there was no danger that , once released , the applicant would not try to interfere with evidence or in any other way try to obstruct the course of justice with regard to his case . It referred , in particular , to the extraordinary gravity of the charges , which showed the manifest social danger posed by the applicant , who might commit further offences against the person , including offences of bodily harm . In this connection , it was observed that the identity of the witnesses had become known to the applicant . There was , moreover , a danger that the latter might try to abscond , making use of the contacts he had abroad , in order to avoid the heavy punishment which was likely to be inflicted on him in the event of his conviction .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant 's situation had not significantly changed and that no new element justifying a departure from the previous findings had been submitted . In particular , it considered that the time that had elapsed since the beginning of the applicant 's detention was not substantial enough to conclude that the length of the deprivation of liberty in issue was unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant , alleging that his lengthy detention and the continued refusal of bail had infringed his rights under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , introduced a constitutional complaint before ORG . He observed , in particular , that his deprivation of liberty was based , inter alia , on the risk of his tampering with evidence , a risk which , in the Attorney General 's submission , had become even more serious because his accomplices were free and the identity and nature of the prosecution evidence and witnesses had become known to the accused . In the applicant 's opinion , however , those fears were unfounded and the danger referred to by the authorities could in any case have been avoided by adopting the necessary precautionary measures , such as adequate surveillance by the police , with the possibility of house arrest . Moreover , the evidence of the prosecution had become known to the applicant by right in order to enable him to prepare his defence ; that fact could therefore not be used against him to justify a violation of his other fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Police filed a memorandum in which they applied for the applicant 's complaints to be dismissed . They pointed out that the offence attributed to the applicant was punishable by DATE imprisonment , and that this element created an incentive for the accused to try to tamper with evidence and also to abscond , possibly making use of the foreign contacts which he manifestly had . Moreover , the nature of the offence showed that the applicant was a danger to society and that there was a risk that he might commit other offences . Finally , the danger of his interfering with evidence was real , as was shown by the fact that after he had given evidence , a witness in his case had been attacked by CARDINAL unknown persons .", "CARDINAL . Four hearings took place before FAC on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . On the last - mentioned date , ORG authorised the applicant to file submissions concerning a non NORP exhaustion plea raised by the respondents . This note was filed on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Hall of ORG dismissed the applicant 's application . With reference to the case - law of ORG , ORG noted that the prolonged detention of a person who was presumed innocent but was suspected of having committed an offence should be justified in the public interest and that an accused deprived of his liberty had the right to have the investigations and trial conducted within a reasonable time . In the applicant 's case , ORG had taken into account the period of time spent by the applicant in detention in view of all the relevant circumstances , notably the nature and gravity of the charges , the danger of his tampering with evidence and the risk of his absconding . Moreover , the applicant 's case was particularly complex , regard being had to the number of witnesses and experts involved in the investigations and to the pleas submitted by the parties , and it could not be said that the prosecution had failed to show diligence in the conduct of the investigations . The time that had elapsed from the beginning of the investigations could not , therefore , be considered unreasonable . Finally , the fact that the applicant had been denied bail was not prejudicial to the presumption of innocence , as the decisions in this regard did not reflect an opinion as to his guilt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL June DATE before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . On DATE the applicant challenged CARDINAL of the QUANTITY sitting judges . A judgment on this issue was given on DATE . The CARDINAL judges in question withdrew from hearing the case , which was adjourned until DATE , on which date the parties made oral submissions . On DATE the applicant requested leave to produce a decision given by ORG on his application for bail . This request was subsequently served on the respondents , who on DATE declared that they did not oppose bail . The hearings of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and of DATE and DATE were adjourned because ORG needed more time for deliberation . On DATE the court observed that the members of the family of CARDINAL of the sitting judges had fallen seriously ill and that this fact prevented it from taking a decision immediately ; however , the case had been given the priority that it deserved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at ORG request , the parties made submissions on the point as to whether a decision on the issue under LAW was required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of FAC in so far as it concerned the length of the criminal proceedings against the applicant ( LAW ) . However , ORG pointed out that the applicant had also complained under LAW , alleging that the grounds for his detention had weakened with the passing of time . Even if the accused had not explicitly quoted this latter Article in his final submissions , thus misleading the first - instance court , his complaint constituted a separate grievance on which ORG should have made a specific ruling . Therefore , ORG remitted the facts of the case to ORG , instructing the latter to examine this complaint .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings were resumed before FAC , and a hearing was scheduled for DATE . On DATE CARDINAL witnesses appeared on behalf of the respondents . They testified about incidents experienced by a witness who had testified against the applicant in the pretrial investigation proceedings and by the daughter of that witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG withdrew from the case . A substitute judge was appointed on DATE , but he also had to withdraw as he was one of the judges who had denied CARDINAL of the applicant 's applications for bail . Another substitute judge was appointed on CARDINAL DATE , and a new hearing was set down for DATE . Other witnesses were heard on CARDINAL and DATE . On DATE the applicant waived the right to cross - examine those witnesses , but requested leave to file written observations . The latter were filed on DATE , DATE after the expiry of the time allowed by ORG . The respondents filed their written reply at the hearing of DATE . On DATE the case was adjourned for judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Hall of ORG declared that the overall duration of the applicant 's pre - trial detention had infringed LAW and that the applicant was entitled provisionally to be released under conditions guaranteeing his appearance at the trial . The determination of these conditions was left to the discretion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG first underlined that a period of time held to be reasonable under LAW could be considered excessive under LAW , as the criteria laid down in the latter provision , which concerned personal liberty , were more rigorous . Moreover , it was clear that the passing of time could not but aggravate the prejudicial effects that the pre - trial detention had had on the applicant 's situation .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the proceedings had not been conducted in a vacuum . In fact , the inquiry had been closed , the bill of indictment had been issued and the preliminary pleas had been decided . On the other hand , it should be kept in mind that the applicant had a right to institute all the proceedings and to lodge all the complaints he deemed necessary for the defence of his interests , even if this might prolong the criminal proceedings .", "DATE . As to the grounds justifying the applicant 's continuing detention , ORG observed that the risk of his tampering with evidence appeared to subsist regardless of whether or not he remained under arrest . In fact , the Attorney General himself had mentioned that certain witnesses had already started to alter the evidence which they had given during the inquiry . Moreover , all the evidence against the applicant had already been gathered and heard on various occasions by the national courts , and the danger of interference with the course of justice was likely to be reduced as the investigations progressed .", "CARDINAL . As to the risk of committing new offences , ORG noted that the prosecution had not proved that the applicant was responsible for certain incidents in which a witness and his relatives had been involved . Furthermore , as the crimes of which the applicant was accused had been allegedly committed on the basis of instructions , it could be argued that the applicant constituted a threat to society even if he remained in prison . In any case , it appeared that the prosecution was inferring the applicant 's dangerousness more from the gravity of the case than from any other evidence .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it was true that the applicant risked a heavy sentence and that he had been abroad several times in DATE . However , it had not been proved that the applicant had tangible connections outside GPE which might facilitate his escape . He had , on the contrary , strong family ties in GPE . Keeping in mind that the applicant had already spent DATE in detention , and that this period would in any case have been deducted from his final sentence , ORG concluded that the risk of his absconding could be counterbalanced by adequate guarantees ensuring the appearance of the accused at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General of GPE and the Commissioner of Police appealed to ORG against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE . On that date all CARDINAL judges composing the court withdrew from the case on account of their involvement in prior proceedings concerning the question of the applicant 's release on bail . On DATE new judges were appointed . The applicant then requested that the next hearing , scheduled for DATE , be fixed for an earlier date . A hearing was scheduled for DATE , on which date the parties made their oral submissions on the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court quashed the impugned judgment . It observed that the applicant 's prolonged detention had been based on CARDINAL grounds , notably the risk of contamination of evidence , the danger of his committing a new offence , the fact that he was a threat to society , and the danger that he might abscond or hide . In ORG view , each of these reasons was serious enough potentially to create an obstacle to the applicant 's release .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the prosecution had produced evidence demonstrating that the applicant had put pressure on individuals for the purpose of committing homicide on the basis of instructions . The risk of tampering with evidence was therefore a concrete one , especially at a stage where the applicant was aware of the content of the evidence and of the names of the witnesses . As to the risk of committing a new offence , the prosecution relied mainly on CARDINAL incidents concerning a witness and his daughter . However , there was nothing to show that the applicant was responsible for those acts . On the other hand , evidence had been produced against the applicant in a separate set of criminal proceedings concerning a serious accusation of drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . As to the possibility that the applicant might abscond , it was true that the longer his detention lasted , the more remote this possibility was . The fact that the applicant 's family lived in GPE equally militated against the danger of flight . However , the seriousness of the charges brought against the applicant and the fact that he was about to face a trial by jury on charges of drug trafficking militated in the opposite direction .", "DATE . It remained to be considered whether the time that had elapsed since the date of the arrest could neutralise all the other relevant factors justifying the applicant 's deprivation of liberty . In this connection , it was noted that far from trying to speed up the proceedings , the applicant had caused a number of delays . For instance , when ORG had been ready to fix the date of the trial by jury , the applicant had challenged the judge , and from DATE until DATE his lawyers had demanded CARDINAL adjournments of the hearings , thus unnecessarily lengthening the proceedings . In particular , on DATE ORG had provisionally scheduled DATE of the trial by jury for DATE . Instead of objecting to this lengthy delay , counsel for the defence had asked why ORG was setting a provisional date for the trial instead of adjourning it sine die . In ORG opinion , this behaviour was difficult to reconcile with the applicant 's declared wish to have his case heard within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . Even if it was preoccupied about the length of time that the applicant'Constitutional Court underlined that an accused person had every right to choose the best line of defence , but he did not have the right to lengthen the proceedings , under CARDINAL pretext or another , or to employ such grounds in favour of his provisional release pending trial .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , ORG found that the period of time spent by the applicant in pre - trial detention had not yet violated LAW . It considered , however , that the applicant 's application for bail should be allowed if a definitive date for the hearing of the trial was not fixed in due time after ORG had ruled on the challenge to the judge presiding over ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
