The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant began a relationship with X , a married woman who continued to live with her husband , with whom she had CARDINAL children . In DATE , X became pregnant and disclosed this to the applicant . In DATE , she gave birth to a girl . Shortly after , the relationship with the applicant ended .", "CARDINAL . X and her husband , the girl \u2019s legal father , refused the applicant \u2019s subsequent initiatives to have contact with the child . They disputed that the applicant was the biological father but refused to consent to paternity testing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initiated various proceedings to establish his legal paternity , to have biological paternity testing conducted and to obtain joint custody . His requests were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to obtain regular contact with the child , referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) delivered on DATE . He claimed to be the child \u2019s biological father and offered to prove this claim by means of an expert \u2019s report . In addition , he made a sworn declaration that he had had sexual intercourse with X around the time of conception .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It held that the applicant \u2019s paternity had not been established and that , consequently , he could not be granted contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . On DATE he supplemented his appeal , mainly relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) and requested contact with the child at least once a month , initially under supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG orally heard the applicant and the child \u2019s legal father . The latter declared that he knew about the relationship between his wife and the applicant and also assumed that there had been sexual contact . In DATE the mother had told him and the children that her relationship with the applicant was terminated although he could not rule out , and indeed considered it likely , that she had continued the relationship without his knowledge . He had learned of his wife \u2019s pregnancy in DATE and concluded that he was the father . In DATE the applicant had told him on the telephone that he was the child \u2019s father . At that moment , the mother had felt relieved that the time of secrets was over . This moment had been a breakthrough for them as a couple and their relationship had improved subsequently . The child had been desired by both . Even assuming that the applicant were the child \u2019s father , he would not agree to any contact because the applicant had caused them much suffering and had to bear the consequences of his behaviour . The proceedings the applicant had instituted were a burden for the couple but did not have a negative impact on the relationship with his wife , but had rather consolidated it . Everyone in the family but the child knew that the applicant believed that he was the child \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG orally heard the child \u2019s mother . At the end of the hearing it informed the parties that it considered contact with the applicant not to be in the child \u2019s best interest for the time being and suggested that the applicant withdraw his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child \u2019s appointed guardian ad litem ( Verfahrenspfleger ) , a psychologist , furnished a detailed written statement concluding that contact with the applicant would be detrimental to the child \u2019s wellbeing at this age .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to mandate an expert opinion on the question of whether contact would be detrimental to the child or would at least serve her best interest ; to hold an oral hearing where the guardian ad litem should explain her written statement ; to conduct a paternity test and to hear the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed the parties that it considered it necessary to hear the child . The child \u2019s guardian ad litem opposed this . She submitted , inter alia , that the child had no knowledge of the applicant \u2019s claims , that the latter could not prove his fatherhood in the absence of a legal basis and that the child \u2019s legal parents had not submitted any proof of their allegations that the mother \u2019s husband was also the child \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the sixyearold child in the presence of her guardian ad litem only . According to the TIME , the child was aware - without knowing the real reasons - that her parents were in dispute with the applicant , who wanted to visit her or wanted her to visit him , but that neither her parents nor herself agreed to this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardian ad litem submitted that the child \u2019s hearing confirmed her written statement of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commented on the child \u2019s hearing , submitted a private expert opinion and requested ORG to mandate an expert opinion regarding contact rights and to appoint a new guardian ad litem . He further asked ORG to inform the child about his application during a new hearing . He added that in the event that his appeal were to be denied , he should receive a written report on the child \u2019s development and CARDINAL recent photographs DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests . It observed , at the outset , that the applicant could not rely on LAW as he was not the child \u2019s legal father . He could not rely on LAW either , because he had never borne any actual responsibility for the child . ORG then addressed the question of whether LAW of LAW could be interpreted , in the light of the ORG \u2019s judgments ORG and PERSON ( cited above ) , as assuming that a father who was able to prove that he had seriously tried to bear actual responsibility but failed to do so because of the mother \u2019s or legal parent \u2019s resistance , could be considered as having borne actual responsibility within the meaning of this Article .", "CARDINAL . NORP This question could , however , be left open because contact had in any event to serve the child \u2019s best interest . In this respect ORG held that it was already contrary to the child \u2019s best interest to address the preliminary question of whether the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father . The child was living in a well - organised and emotionally stable family unit consisting of a father , a mother and other children . ORG pointed out that it was convinced that this family union would be destroyed if the applicant \u2019s paternity were established and contact rights ordered . The hearing of the child and the legal parents had shown that in the child \u2019s perception of the world , there was only one father , the mother \u2019s husband . There were no indications that the latter did not assume his role as a father towards the child or assumed it differently than towards his other children . The child was well - integrated in the family , where she felt protected and secure . This assessment was also consistent with the conclusions of the child \u2019s curator ad litem .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal feared that clarifying the question of paternity bore the risk that the family unit would break up , which would have considerable negative consequences on the child because she would lose her essential attachment figures . As it had indicated after the hearing , it held it to be more likely that the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father . This question could , however , ultimately only be determined by a paternity test , to which the child \u2019s legal parents were opposed . The mother affirmed that her husband was the biological father of her daughter and both stood firm against the applicant . According to ORG it resulted from the hearing that the legal father trusted , in principle , his wife \u2019s assertions but at the same time had doubts as to his paternity , although he had not explicitly expressed them . In spite of these doubts , and the long - lasting court proceedings , he did not put in question his wife \u2019s statements . ORG received the impression that the spouses had barricaded themselves against the applicant as if they were in a corral , as had shown the legal father \u2019s declaration that the legal proceedings did not have a negative impact on the relationship with his wife but had rather consolidated it . ORG concluded that the legal father could live with this uncertainty , and that his attitude had no consequences for the child . If , however , the applicant \u2019s biological paternity were to be established , the legal father would realise that his long - standing trust in his wife was not justified . It was not possible to predict the legal father \u2019s reaction , but the manifest risk that the spouses\u2019 marriage would break up could not be dismissed in view of the couple \u2019s past difficulties . The couple \u2019s separation would amount to the breaking - up of the child \u2019s family unit and the loss of her relationships , which would endanger her well - being .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that it was aware that , in view of the importance of the child \u2019s well - being , it could be a long time before the preliminary question of paternity could be clarified and DATE before contact rights could be granted . This might evolve once the child started to ask questions , but for now it was not in her best interest to be confronted with the paternity issue . It was therefore not advisable to tell her about the applicant \u2019s allegations or to substitute the child \u2019s guardian ad litem .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to say that , even assuming that the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father , contact with the applicant was not in the child \u2019s best interest . Due to the highly emotional conflicts between the legal parents and the applicant , and the fact that the applicant had not ruled out that he might tell the child that he was her biological father if he saw her , contact would jeopardise the child \u2019s well - being . Therefore it was not advisable to order an expert opinion regarding the question of whether and how the child would deal with CARDINAL fathers or whether it was in general advisable to grant children contact with their biological fathers at an early stage . These issues had to be assessed in the light of the extremely tense relations between the applicant and the child \u2019s legal parents , and in view of the predictable consequences for the child if contact were granted . ORG added that it could decide on these questions on its own after having orally heard the persons involved , and based on the written statements of the guardian ad litem , an experienced psychologist well - known from other proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s request for information ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s request for information , claimed in the alternative in his lawyer \u2019s submissions of DATE , does not exist . Such claim can not be based on LAW , DATE sentence , of LAW because the applicant is not , as required by this provision , the child \u2019s legal father . Whether the provision can be interpreted in the light of the above mentioned decisions of ORG , as assuming that a biological father can also claim a right for information , can be left open : that would require addressing the preliminary issue of whether the applicant was the child \u2019s biological father . It has already been shown that clarifying this question by ordering a paternity test would be contrary to the child \u2019s well - being . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection alleging a violation of the right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . Previously , on DATE , the applicant had lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that on DATE , the PERSON for the strengthening of the rights of biological but not legal fathers had entered into force which , pursuant to LAW , provided a new possibility for biological fathers to be granted contact and information rights even if they had no social and family relationship with the child ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It added that in court proceedings concerning the enforcement of such rights , the determination of the preliminary question of paternity could be necessary , pursuant to Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It enquired of the applicant whether , under these circumstances , he would withdraw his constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant replied that he would maintain his complaint because , even under the new law , he would not have obtained a more favourable decision . He pointed out that ORG had rejected his request for contact rights , even assuming that he was the child \u2019s biological father , since contact did not serve the child \u2019s well - being . ORG had thus already decided in the light of the new DATE of LAW . The applicant added that the same reasoning applied to his request for information . Given that , in its view , the determination of paternity would endanger the family unit , ORG would refrain from ordering a measure of examination because the legal parents could not reasonably be expected to undergo any examination , under ORG CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
