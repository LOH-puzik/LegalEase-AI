THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "", "The applicant \u2019s grand - daughter , H , was born in DATE .", "In DATE , H \u2019s mother ( the applicant \u2019s daughter , P ) , who lived in GPE , north - east GPE , contacted the local authorities because she was suffering from mental health problems and could not , at that time , care for H. In DATE , H was placed with foster parents in GPE on a temporary basis . In DATE , at a meeting of the local authority permanency panel attended by P , the decision was taken that , since P was still unable to care for H , a permanent placement should be found for her . In DATE , H \u2019s name was added to ORG under the category \u201c emotional abuse \u201d . In DATE , H moved to the south of GPE to live with her maternal aunt and uncle , who had applied to have H placed permanently with them . P initially opposed this plan but eventually , to avoid a care order , she agreed and , on DATE , a residence order was made in favour of P \u2019s sister . However , this arrangement broke down and in DATE H went to live with the applicant and his wife on a temporary basis . In DATE , H was placed with short - term foster parents in GPE . This was either her fifth or her seventh change of home in DATE . She had contact with the applicant and his wife DATE , and staying contact with P in GPE .", "In DATE H visited P , who was getting married . DATE after the wedding , H and P had a disagreement about H \u2019s sleeping arrangements . H wanted to stay with P , but P had arranged for H to stay with a friend . In the course of this argument , P telephoned the police and social services and asked that an emergency placement be found for PERSON The following day H returned to her foster parents . P declined to have contact with H until DATE , when they had supervised contact , repeated in DATE .", "The local authority commenced care proceedings and on DATE an interim care order was made . In her statement dated CARDINAL DATE , P did not oppose the local authority \u2019s plan to find a long - term permanent placement for H in the south of GPE , although she did oppose adoption . The applicant and his wife did not support the idea of a long - term placement , and initially decided to apply for H to live with them . When they were refused legal aid to apply for a residence order , they decided to apply instead for a contact order . In DATE the local authority advanced a care plan in which it was proposed , for the first time , that H be placed with PERSON and PERSON , with a view to adoption . PERSON and PERSON indicated that they would be willing to allow post - adoption contact between H and her biological family .", "The case came before His Honour Judge PERSON on DATE . At the hearing , counsel informed the judge that the parties had agreed to the making of the care order and an order for specified contact in favour of the applicant and his wife . No agreement was reached in respect of contact between H and her mother , since it was not certain whether it would be possible for P to have contact with H in the area where H would be living or at the applicant and his wife \u2019s home .", "However , since DATE or DATE the applicant and his wife have had no contact with H , or news as to her well - being , with the exception of what was said in court on DATE ( see below ) . The local authority applied to vary the order of DATE , since H was extremely reluctant to have contact with her mother or grandparents . There was a further hearing before Judge PERSON in DATE . He ordered that there should be no contact until further order of the court and referred the matter to ORG .", "On DATE , ORG considered a number of applications by the parties . P , who was represented by counsel , applied for the discharge of the order of DATE and for a residence order in her favour or , in the alternative , a defined contact order . The applicant and his wife , acting in person , applied in support of P \u2019s application or , in the alternative , if the court were unwilling to commit H to her mother \u2019s care , for a residence order in their favour and , if H were not to live with them , for a defined contact order . The prospective adopters , PERSON and PERSON , applied to adopt H and opposed the attachment of any condition to the adoption order .", "In giving judgment , the judge , who had spoken privately to H , stated :", "\u201c The principle of the paramountcy of H \u2019s welfare must be applied ... . H is DATE and her wishes , which I accept have been accurately and genuinely stated by her , do deserve to be given great weight , even if they are not , of course , conclusive . She has suffered significant harm in the past and in my judgment there is a risk , indeed the virtual certainty , of a traumatically adverse effect upon her if she is moved from her present home , where she has settled so well . ...", "... I am satisfied that [ H ] wants very much indeed to be adopted so as to complete the process of integration into PERSON and PERSON family . For her , an explanation that she is to remain in their care in their capacity as long - term foster parents is to stop short of cementing the bond between her and them and of providing the total security which understandably , in the light of the past history , she craves .", "She has a strong conviction that her natural family does not approve of her present placement , and she is right : the [ applicant and his wife ] are vehemently opposed to it ... .", "In this case an order for direct contact is not viable at all . The child is resolute in her opposition to contact and the making of an order ... . [ H ] perceives any sort of nexus between herself and her natural family at this point of time to be threatening to the stability of her placement and she even fears that in some way the provision of a report might enable the natural family to discover her location or in some other way ( as she puts it ) hassle her . ... \u201d", "He therefore granted PERSON and PERSON application for an unconditional adoption order .", "On DATE , after hearing the applicant and his wife in person , ORG refused P and the applicant leave to appeal against the adoption order , and on DATE ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "Relevant domestic law", "The Children Act DATE states , in section CARDINAL ( as relevant ) :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) When a court determines any question with respect to \u2013", "( a ) the upbringing of a child ; ...", "the child \u2019s welfare shall be the court \u2019s paramount consideration . ...", "( CARDINAL ) In the circumstances mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) , a court shall have regard in particular to \u2013", "( a ) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned ( considered in the light of his age and understanding ) ;", "( b ) his physical , emotional and educational needs ;", "( c ) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances ;", "( d ) his age , sex , background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant ;", "( e ) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering ;", "( f ) how capable each of his parents , and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant , is of meeting his needs ;", "( g ) the range of powers available under LAW in the proceedings in question .", "( CARDINAL ) The circumstances are that - ...", "( a ) the court is considering whether to make , vary or discharge [ a care and supervision order ] . \u201d", "LAW provides , in section CARDINAL ( as relevant ) :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) an adoption order shall not be made unless - ...", "( b ) in the case of each parent or guardian of the child the court is satisfied that \u2013 ...", "( ii ) his agreement to the making of the adoption order should be dispensed with on a ground specified in subsection ( CARDINAL )", "( CARDINAL ) The grounds mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL)(b)(ii ) are that the parent or guardian - ...", "( b ) is withholding his consent unreasonably ... . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
