The aim of the applicant association is the protection of animals , with particular emphasis on animal experiments and industrial animal production .", "CARDINAL . As a reaction to various television commercials of the meat industry , the applicant association prepared a television commercial lasting TIME and consisting of CARDINAL scenes .", "CARDINAL . The first scene of the film showed a sow building a shelter for her piglets in the forest . Soft orchestrated music was played in the background , and the accompanying voice referred , inter alia , to the sense of family which sows had . The second scene showed a noisy hall with pigs in small pens , gnawing nervously at the iron bars . The accompanying voice stated , inter alia , that the rearing of pigs in such circumstances resembled concentration camps , and that the animals were pumped full of medicaments . The film concluded with the exhortation : \u201c Eat less meat , for the sake of your health , the animals and the environment ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association , wishing this film to be broadcast in the programmes of ORG ( Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft ) , sent a videocassette to ORG f\u00fcr das Werbefernsehen , now called GPE ) responsible for television advertising .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant association that it would not broadcast the commercial in view of its \u201c clear political character \u201d . The company pointed out that an alternative solution would be a film showing the merits of a decent rearing of animals and informing viewers that they were free to enquire into the origin of the meat which they were buying .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the applicant association requested a decision against which it could file an appeal . On DATE ORG replied that it was not an official authority giving decisions which could be contested . Nevertheless , it would be willing to convene a meeting to discuss other possibilities in the presence of a legal adviser .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the applicant association stated that it was not prepared to accept changes to its commercial . It requested a statement of the reasons for the decision and information as to the supervisory authority with which an appeal could be filed .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG declined the applicant association \u2019s requests as follows :", "\u201c As you have refused the discussion which we have proposed , we see no reason to enter into your propositions as set out in your letters of CARDINAL and DATE . We regret this development as it serves neither you nor us . We confirm that we can not broadcast your commercial in the proposed form as it breaches section CARDINAL of ORG [ Radio- und ORG ] as well as our general conditions of business [ PERSON ] . In addition , ORG can not be obliged to broadcast commercials which damage its business interests and involve its editorial rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association filed a complaint with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr ORG ) , complaining of the refusal to broadcast the commercial . The latter informed the applicant association on DATE that it could only deal with appeals complaining about programmes which had already been broadcast , but that it would transmit the complaint to ORG ( GPE f\u00fcr GPE ) . ORG informed the applicant association on DATE that within the framework of the broadcasting provisions ORG was free to purchase commercials and choose its contractual partners as it wished . It further stated that it considered the complaint to be a disciplinary report , and that it saw no reason to take proceedings against ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association filed a complaint with ORG and ORG ( Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Verkehrs- und Energiewirtschaftsdepartement ) , which was dismissed on DATE . In its decision , it found , inter alia , that ORG was the sole institution to provide information in respect of home news ( Inlandsberichterstattung ) . In respect of commercial broadcasts , however , the company was in competition with local , regional and foreign broadcasters , and the applicant association was not obliged to have its commercial broadcast over the channels of the company . Moreover , the company acted in matters of advertising as a private entity and did not fulfil a duty of public law when it broadcast commercials . ORG concluded that ORG could not be ordered to broadcast the commercial at issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association \u2019s administrative - law appeal ( PERSON ) , filed by a lawyer and dated DATE , was dismissed by ORG ( Bundesgericht ) on DATE . The court noted , with reference to LAW , that ORG should have formally afforded the applicant association the opportunity to institute complaints proceedings which , if necessary , could have remedied the matter . As the case was ready for decision , ORG undertook the decision itself . It then balanced the various issues at stake .", "CARDINAL . The judgment proceeded to explain the position of ORG in NORP law . The company no longer enjoyed a monopoly and was increasingly subject to foreign competition . However , this did not alter the fact that , according to the applicable law , ORG continued to operate in the area of programming within the framework of public - law duties with which it was entrusted . The law itself granted it a licence for the broadcasting of national and linguistic regional programmes .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that LAW ) ; in the version applicable at the relevant time , ensured the independence of radio and television broadcasting as well as autonomy in programming . However , advertising fell outside the programming obligations of ORG , the programming activity presupposing an assessment of the informative content by an editor . Only programming activities were covered by LAW bis of LAW and section CARDINAL of ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber ORG ) . Viewers should not be influenced in their opinions by CARDINAL - sided , unobjective or insufficiently varied contributions which disregarded journalistic obligations . Commercials , on the other hand , were by their very nature CARDINAL - sided as they were in the interest of the advertiser , and were by definition excluded from a critical assessment . For this reason , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of ORG , they had to be clearly separated from programmes and recognisable as such . Indeed , ORG dealt with advertising and financing , rather than with programming . Furthermore , no right to broadcast a commercial could be derived from the principle of the diversity of programmes or the fact that a competitor \u2019s commercial had already been authorised . The judgment continued :", "\u201c Until DATE [ advertising ] was completely prohibited on radio and television . Subsequently , it was allowed on television , although it was subject to restrictions in the interests of an optimal implementation of programming duties and to protect other important public interests ( youth , health , diversity of the press ) . Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE assumes in principle that advertising is admissible but subject to certain limitations . Thus , section PERSON ) of ORG prohibits religious and political advertising as well as advertising for alcoholic beverages , tobacco and medicaments . ORG may enact further advertising prohibitions for the protection of juveniles and the environment ... On this basis , section CARDINAL of ORG was given a more concrete form in sections CARDINAL et seq . of ORG . These provisions contain no obligation whatsoever to broadcast commercials , and do not declare that advertising is a public - law duty of the broadcaster . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant association \u2019s complaint under LAW , ORG found that the prohibition of political advertising laid down in section PERSON ) of ORG served various purposes :", "\u201c It should prevent financially powerful groups from obtaining a competitive political advantage . In the interest of the democratic process it is designed to protect the formation of public opinion from undue commercial influence and to bring about a certain equality of opportunity among the different forces of society . The prohibition contributes towards the independence of the radio and television broadcasters in editorial matters , which could be endangered by powerful political advertising sponsors . According to the NORP law on communication the press remains the most important means for paid political advertising . Already , financially powerful groups are in a position to secure themselves more space ; admitting political advertising on radio and television would reinforce this tendency and substantially influence the democratic process of opinion - forming \u2013 all the more so as it is established that with its dissemination and its immediacy television will have a stronger effect on the public than the other means of communication ... Reserving political advertising to the print media secures for them a certain part of the advertising market and thereby contributes to their financing ; this in turn counteracts an undesirable concentration of the press and thus indirectly contributes to the pluralistic system of media required under LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant association had other means of disseminating its political ideas , for instance in foreign programmes which were broadcast in GPE , or in the cinema and the press . ORG had offered the applicant association other possibilities and was also willing to convene a meeting to discuss them with it in the presence of a legal adviser .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant association \u2019s complaint about discrimination , ORG found that it was complaining of CARDINAL situations which were not comparable with each other . Promotions by the meat industry were economic in nature in that they aimed at increasing turnover and were not related to animal protection . On the other hand , the applicant association \u2019s commercial , exhorting reduced meat consumption and containing shocking pictures , was directed against industrial animal production . The applicant association was frequently active in the media in order to pursue its aims . In DATE it had filed a disciplinary complaint in this respect with ORG . The matter became a political issue early in DATE when ORG commented on the matter .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL bis of LAW , in the version applicable at the relevant time , provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Legislation on radio and television ... comes within the jurisdiction of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Radio and television shall contribute to cultural development and the free expression of opinions as well as to the entertainment of the audience . They shall consider the particularities of the country and the requirements of the cantons . They shall describe facts objectively and fairly reflect the variety of views .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of paragraph CARDINAL , the impartiality of radio and television as well as autonomy in the creation of programmes shall be guaranteed . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . These provisions have been enshrined in LAW currently in force .", "CARDINAL . ORG , referring to LAW , in principle requires a licence to broadcast radio and television programmes . LAW grants the licence for national and linguistic regional programmes to ORG . LAW stipulates that the programmes shall be objective and fairly reflect the plurality of events and opinions .", "CARDINAL . ORG has transferred all aspects of the acquisition and organisation of television advertising to ORG ( now called GPE ) , which is a company established under private law whose activities do not depend on a licence .", "CARDINAL . Commercials are broadcast between programmes at various times of DATE . In respect of advertising , ORG provides as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL Advertising", "CARDINAL .
