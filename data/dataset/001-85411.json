SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicants bought a property , PERSON , in the municipality of PERSON , in GPE , for recreational purposes . They have their permanent residence , where they are formally registered , in GPE .", "In DATE and DATE the municipality of ORG granted building permits to erect CARDINAL wind turbines on a property , PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL , neighbouring the applicants\u2019 property . These wind turbines measured QUANTITY to the hub of the rotor blades , which had a diameter of QUANTITY . The first wind turbine had a delivery of QUANTITY ( kilowatts ) and was built QUANTITY from the applicants\u2019 property while the second wind turbine had a delivery of QUANTITY and was situated at a distance of QUANTITY from the applicants\u2019 property . Apparently , these CARDINAL wind turbines did not cause any nuisance to the applicants .", "In DATE a third wind turbine was erected on PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL , at a distance of QUANTITY from the applicants\u2019 property . This wind turbine measured QUANTITY to the hub of the rotor blades , which had a diameter of QUANTITY . Moreover , it had a delivery of QUANTITY and was capable of producing MONEY per year ( which roughly corresponds to the energy needed to heat CARDINAL private households over a DATE period ) . The wind turbine was owned by the \u201c H\u00e4stholmen Joint Wind Association \u201d ( PERSON ) , which consisted of CARDINAL shares , of which the municipality owned CARDINAL shares and several property owners in the area also owned some of the shares .", "According to the applicants , the wind turbine emitted a constant , pulsating noise and , sometimes , light effects which they found very disturbing and intrusive . For these reasons and because they considered that the new wind turbine had been erected much too close to their property , and without them having been consulted in advance , they complained about it in a letter to the municipality .", "It turned out that the municipality \u2019s ORG ( milj\u00f6tekniska n\u00e4mnd ) had already granted a building permit for the wind turbine , in DATE . Before that decision , a geotechnical evaluation of the ground had been carried out and ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG ( F\u00f6rsvarsmakten ) and ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ; hereinafter referred to as \u201c the Board \u201d ) of ORG had been heard , as well as the owners of the CARDINAL closest neighbouring properties ( situated within QUANTITY of the planned location of the wind turbine ) . None of those consulted had had any objections to a wind turbine being constructed on the property of NORP CARDINAL:CARDINAL . However , in its decision , ORG had stipulated that the exact location of the wind turbine should be agreed upon in consultation with the municipality \u2019s building unit and ORG began .", "On DATE ORG received a leasehold contract between the property owners of PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL and ORG from which it appeared that the wind turbine had been constructed QUANTITY north - west of the location which had been agreed upon and thus also closer to the inhabited area .", "On DATE ORG held a meeting , attended by the chairman of ORG , to discuss the situation relating to the wind turbine . It was agreed that ORG should submit a request to ORG for a change to the building permit so that it was valid for the wind turbine in its present location . The ORG would have to make a completely new assessment , where all property owners within a radius of QUANTITY of the wind turbine should be heard , as should , again , ORG , ORG and the ORG .", "Consequently , the applicants and all other property owners , tenants and residents within a QUANTITY radius of the wind turbine were invited to submit their comments on it .", "Moreover , on DATE , ORG company ( the builder of the wind turbine ) carried out noise tests of the CARDINAL wind turbines , together and separately , which were submitted to ORG but also presented to those , including the applicants , who attended a general meeting on DATE . According to the results of these tests , the noise levels in respect of the applicants\u2019 property were calculated at PERCENT ( decibels ) from the new wind turbine alone and at PERCENT from all CARDINAL wind turbines together . The tests were carried out in the evening when the wind speed was measured at QUANTITY per second .", "On DATE ORG granted a change to the building permit for the wind turbine so that it applied to the present location of the wind turbine . ORG had observed that several of those heard on the matter had complained about the noise made by the wind turbine . However , it had also noted that , according to the noise tests carried out by the builder of the wind turbine , the noise levels did not exceed PERCENT , which was the recommended maximum level , at any house , except the CARDINAL closest , where the owners had stated that they were not disturbed by the noise . Still , in order to try to minimise the nuisance perceived by a number of neighbours of the wind turbine , the ORG ordered that certain temporary measures be taken . Hence , the wind turbine should automatically stop if the wind did not exceed a speed of QUANTITY per second and , during DATE ( DATE and DATE ) , the wind turbine \u2019s rotor blades should be adjusted to a \u201c less aggressive \u201d angle to reduce the sound level . Moreover , all mechanical sound created by the wind turbine should be eliminated completely and an evaluation of these measures should be carried out no later than CARDINAL DATE by ORG together with the neighbours concerned . Following this evaluation , which might include an impartial noise investigation of , inter alia , the applicants\u2019 property , final advice and measures to be taken would be decided .", "In its protocol from the deliberation , ORG noted that the final assessment of protective and precautionary measures and advice , according to environmental protection legislation , in relation to the wind turbine would be decided upon when the matter had been sufficiently examined . This decision could then be appealed against by any of the persons concerned .", "On DATE the evaluation meeting took place . The applicants were present as were several other neighbours and representatives for ORG and ORG . It turned out that the \u201c mechanical noise \u201d that some had complained of came from one of the smaller wind turbines , which had since been repaired so that such noise was no longer emitted . Moreover , the other measures had been implemented during DATE but the neighbours , including the applicants , claimed that this had had no effect on the noise level .", "The applicants appealed against the decision of DATE to ORG and demanded that \u201c all the building permits \u201d be revoked and that the wind turbine be dismantled . They claimed that the wind turbine caused serious nuisance to them and that no real noise investigation had been carried out to establish the true level of the noise . They further submitted that they had not been given the opportunity to voice their opinion about the wind turbine before it had been constructed and that the municipality had not dealt with the case impartially since it owned a part of the wind turbine .", "ORG submitted in reply that ORG had some shares in the wind turbine but that those who were members of both ORG and ORG had not participated in the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . It further stated that the decision had been taken in accordance with relevant legislation .", "ORG , for its part , stated that it had kept the general public in the municipality informed about the planned construction of the wind turbine through brochures and advertisements in the local press . It further claimed that it was prepared to continue with the measures imposed the following summer too .", "On DATE , after having visited the applicants\u2019 property , ORG rejected their appeal . It first noted that ORG decision of DATE had replaced that of CARDINAL November CARDINAL . Thus , in so far as the ORG appeal could be interpreted as being directed also against the decision of DATE , it had ceased to exist and therefore did not require further measures from the ORG . Turning to the substance of the ORG appeal , it found from its visit to the applicants\u2019 property that the wind turbine created certain sound effects which could be considered disturbing but which were not serious enough to justify dismantling the turbine . In this respect , it noted that the measured noise levels did not reach the maximum recommended level of CARDINAL dB. Moreover , the ORG observed that the running of the wind turbine was subject to the regulations in LAW ( ORG ; CARDINAL ) . Thus , if the applicants , or others , considered that the measures in force to minimise the noise from the wind turbine were insufficient , they could request that the ORG impose further measures . Were the ORG to reject such a request , those who had made the demand could appeal against it to the environmental courts . In these circumstances , the ORG found that there were no legal impediments to the wind turbine .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , maintaining their claims . In particular , they emphasised that the wind turbine was a serious nuisance and that ORG had made an incorrect evaluation of the matter and several formal errors in its handling of the case . Moreover , they stated that the municipality had refused to carry out an impartial noise investigation despite requests from several of the concerned parties .", "ORG disputed the ORG claims and insisted that its decision had been made in due order and was correct . It further observed that it still kept the question regarding a noise investigation open but that the concerned parties so far had agreed on certain specific measures to reduce the noise ( such as stopping the wind turbine at low wind speed ) , which were re - evaluated regularly . Thus , at the moment it considered that a noise investigation was not necessary .", "On DATE , after having visited the applicants\u2019 property and held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . It found that ORG decision had been lawful and that , although some sound effects from the wind turbine could be observed on the applicants\u2019 property , the disturbance had to be considered tolerable .", "Upon further appeal by the applicants both ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE and ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal on DATE and DATE respectively .", "Domestic provisions of relevance to the present case are to be found , primarily , in FAC ( Plan- och bygglagen , CARDINAL - hereafter \u201c the Act \u201d ) and in LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL - hereafter \u201c the Code \u201d ) .", "Thus , according to LAW , LAW consideration shall be given to both public and private interests when questions under LAW are examined , unless otherwise prescribed . It is the responsibility of each municipality to plan the use of land and water areas within their territory ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . ORG is the supervisory body of planning and building activities within its county and cooperates with the municipalities in their planning . Moreover , ORG , hereafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) has general responsibility for the supervision of planning and building activities throughout GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL) .", "Furthermore , buildings shall be located and designed in a suitable manner with regard to the townscape or the landscape and the natural and cultural values at the site ( LAW , section CARDINAL of the Act ) and so that neither the buildings themselves nor their intended use will cause any danger or significant impact ( betydande ol\u00e4genhet ) to the surroundings ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . According to LAW , section DATE , these requirements also apply to constructions other than buildings , such as wind power stations .", "It follows from LAW , LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the LAW that building permits are required for the construction of new buildings , including wind power stations , inter alia , if the wind turbine is QUANTITY in diameter . Moreover , LAW , section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , states that when a measure which requires a building permit has been taken without permission , the municipal committee responsible for deciding on building permits shall ensure that such a construction is removed or otherwise rectified , unless a building permit is granted retrospectively .", "Before an application for a building permit is decided upon , all known parties as well as known affected cooperative owners , tenants and residents , shall be informed and given the opportunity to state their opinions on the application ( LAW , section CARDINAL of the Act ) . Also , decisions concerning building permits may be appealed against to the competent county administrative board ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) and subsequently to the administrative courts ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "As concerns the LAW , LAW states , inter alia , that its purpose is to promote sustainable development which will ensure a healthy and sound environment for present and future generations . It shall ensure that human health and the environment are protected against damage and inconvenience , whether caused by pollutants or other sources , and that the use of land , water and the physical environment in general is such as to secure long - term good management in ecological , social , cultural and economic terms . It shall also encourage reuse and recycling as well as other management of materials , raw materials and energy with a view to establishing and maintaining natural cycles .", "According to LAW , LAW , those who pursue an activity or take a measure shall implement protective measures , comply with restrictions and take other precautions that are necessary in order to prevent , hinder or combat damage or detriment to human health or the environment as a result of the activity or measure . They are also obliged to plan and monitor the activity continuously in order to combat or prevent such effects ( LAW , Article CARDINAL ) . To ensure that these regulations are adhered to , ORG ( PERSON ) and the county administrative boards exercise general supervision and a committee appointed by the municipal council is responsible for local supervision ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Appeals against decisions by municipal committees concerning the LAW , including decisions to refuse a request for noise abatement measures or a noise investigation , may be lodged with the competent county administrative board unless otherwise provided ( LAW , LAW , and further appeal lies to ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW . Anyone who is adversely affected by a judgment or decision may appeal against it , provided that it is appealable ( LAW , PERSON ) . Thus , in a case from ORG ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) , the court set aside a judgment of the lower court and ORG decision and referred the case back to ORG for a new examination because the municipal committee had turned down a request , put forward by some people living close to a wind power station , that the committee should , inter alia , make arrangements for a noise investigation of the wind power station , whereupon ORG had dismissed their appeal .", "LAW of the Code contains provisions concerning compensation for certain kinds of environmental damage , inter alia , from noise . Hence , in accordance with LAW , it is possible to get compensation for pecuniary loss that is not caused by a criminal offence , where the loss is of some importance and even if it is not caused deliberately or through negligence . However , the disturbance that causes the damage must not be tolerable in view of local conditions or with regard to the extent to which such disturbance normally occurs in similar conditions . Among those liable to pay compensation are , inter alia , those who pursue a harmful activity or who cause it to be pursued in their capacity as property owners or land leaseholders , including those who use the property for business or public activities ( LAW .", "Anyone who wishes to claim compensation in accordance with LAW of the Code shall institute proceedings before an environmental court ( LAW , LAW , paragraph CARDINAL and LAW , LAW . Judgments and decisions by ORG may be appealed against to ORG and further to ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In CARDINAL case , ORG granted some property owners compensation from the municipality for a decrease in the value of their properties caused by environmental disturbance from traffic noise and \u201c aesthetic nuisance \u201d from a newly built road ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) .", "In GPE there are no binding rules regarding maximum noise levels in respect of wind turbines . However , according to the ORG \u2019s general recommendations CARDINAL ( \u201c The Establishment of Wind Power Stations on Land \u201d ( Boverkets allm\u00e4nna r\u00e5d CARDINAL:CARDINAL , Etablering av vindkraft p\u00e5 land , DATE ) , the recommended levels set by ORG are applicable to wind turbines on land . Thus , the recommended levels that should normally not be exceeded when the turbine is in operation are , at TIME , CARDINAL dB for housing areas and PERCENT for areas planned for recreational houses and active outdoor life . In CARDINAL case concerning the establishment of a wind power plant ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) , ORG found in its judgment that the recommended maximum level of PERCENT for housing areas should apply both during the daytime and at night . In another case ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) , ORG held that the fact that an area was used for recreational houses did not suffice to characterise it as an area with \u201c special qualities \u201d and that , therefore , a maximum noise level of PERCENT was sufficiently far - reaching and there was no need to lower it to CARDINAL dB as the complainants had requested .", "The general recommendations of the ORG further state that noise calculations should be performed in connection with an examination under LAW . Such a noise test should be carried out according to a set method where the calculations should relate to a wind speed of QUANTITY per second , with a following wind , and at a height of QUANTITY from the ground . The levels of noise calculated should be drawn on a map of the area and marking the distances where the noise level is at DATE and CARDINAL dB.", "A new handbook \u201c Planning and Processing of Permits for Wind Power Stations \u201d ( Planering och pr\u00f6vning av vindkraftsanl\u00e4ggningar ) was published in DATE by the ORG and replaced the recommendations from DATE . However , the recommendations concerning noise from wind turbines have not been altered .", "In DATE ORG adopted the first Government PERSON relating to wind power ( Government PERSON , PERSON med vindkraft DATE \u00e5tg\u00e4rder f\u00f6r ett livskraftigt vindbruk ( \u201c Environmentally friendly electricity using wind power \u2013 measures for a viable use of wind \u201d ) ) in which it was stated that wind power should be given greater priority and various specific measures should be taken to promote and increase the use of wind power . It was further stressed that energy production in a sustainable society should have the smallest possible impact on the environment and the climate .", "Most environmental noises can be approximately described by CARDINAL of several simple measures . The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing . Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels , they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels ( dB ) . If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called \u201c A - weighting \u201d ( abbreviated dBA ) whereas , if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span , this is called the \u201c equivalent continuous sound pressure level \u201d ( abbreviated GPE ) . Such average levels are usually based on integration of A - weighted levels . A simple PERSON type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise .", "ORG ) has published \u201c ORG \u201d ( DATE ) and \u201c Fact Sheet No . CARDINAL , on ORG \u201d ( revised DATE ) which give guideline values for various environments and situations . These guideline values are set at the level of the lowest adverse health effect , meaning any temporary or long - term deterioration in physical , psychological or social functioning that is associated with noise exposure , and represent the sound pressure level which affects the most exposed receiver in a given environment .", "The guideline levels for annoyance have been set at CARDINAL or CARDINAL dB PERSON ( measured for a period of QUANTITY hours in the daytime and TIME at TIME ) , representing TIME levels below which a majority of the adult population will be protected from becoming moderately or seriously annoyed . It can be noted here that , according to the guidelines , a casual voice level in both men and women at a distance of QUANTITY corresponds on average to CARDINAL dB. Moreover , for most people , a DATE \u2019s continuous exposure to an average environmental noise of PERCENT will not cause hearing impairment , whereas exposure for TIME a day to sound in excess of CARDINAL dB is potentially hazardous . Thus , in relation to noise levels in homes , the guidelines state that to protect the majority of people from being seriously annoyed during the daytime , the sound pressure level on balconies , terraces and in outdoor living areas should not exceed DATE PERSON for steady continuous noise and should not exceed CARDINAL dB PERSON to protect people from being moderately annoyed . These values are based on annoyance studies but most NORP countries have adopted a CARDINAL dB GPE as the maximum allowable for new developments .", "At TIME , sound pressure levels at the outside fa\u00e7ades of living spaces should not exceed CARDINAL dB GPE , so that people may sleep with bedroom windows open . This value has been obtained by assuming that the noise reduction from outside to inside with the window partly open is CARDINAL dB and , where noise is continuous , the equivalent sound pressure level should not exceed PERCENT indoors , if negative effects on sleep , such as a reduction in the proportion of ORG sleep , are to be avoided .", "According to the NORP Speech - Language - Hearing Association , noise levels above PERCENT are potentially hazardous . To illustrate various noise levels , it gives the following examples : PERCENT = alarm clock , busy street , MONEY = busy traffic , vacuum cleaner , PERCENT = conversation , dishwasher , CARDINAL dB = moderate rainfall , CARDINAL dB = quiet room , CARDINAL dB = whisper , quiet library ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
