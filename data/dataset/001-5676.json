The applicant was also obliged to pay a PERCENT tax increase on the amount . The decision was based on a tax audit in a company called AT . This company had paid ORG CARDINAL to the limited company ORG , which was owned by the limited partnership company ORG . The applicant was the only active partner of ORG , which owned PERCENT of the shares of F.", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON , complaining that the decision was wrong and that he had not been informed of the legal provisions on which the decision was based .

On DATE the court lowered the tax increase from PERCENT and upheld the remainder of the decision . The court stated that the payment of the amount of FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL was considered to be the applicant \u2019s personal income since he had received payment for his actions related to a sales contract concerning an airplane . The payment was considered to be the applicant \u2019s personal income , even though he had waived his right to the amount in favour of company F. Further the court noted that , as the applicant had not announced that amount in his tax returns , the tax office had a right to order the payment of a residual tax and impose a tax increase . Finally , the court rejected , for lack of a legal basis , the applicant \u2019s request that the taxes already paid by companies AT and F on the same ground be counted for his benefit .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) refused the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG collected from the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL as residual taxes , FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL as a payment of back taxes , additional taxes amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , default interest of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and FIM CARDINAL as execution fee , altogether ORG CARDINAL ( \u20ac MONEY ) .
