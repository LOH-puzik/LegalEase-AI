When introducing the application , the applicants were staff members of PERSON , a non - governmental , \u201c watchdog \u201d organisation voicing criticism of the Government . The subsequent employer of one of the applicants was subjected to financial control measures by the Government in DATE , which according to the applicants verged on vexation .", "CARDINAL . Act no . CXLVII of DATE defines combating terrorism as CARDINAL of the tasks of the police . Within the force , a specific Anti - Terrorism Task Force ( \u201c TEK \u201d ) was established as of CARDINAL DATE . Its competence is defined in section QUANTITY no . ORG of DATE on the Police , as amended by Act no . CCVII of DATE ( the \u201c Police Act \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under this legislation , ORG \u2019s prerogatives in the field of secret intelligence gathering include secret house search and surveillance with recording , opening of letters and parcels , as well as checking and recording the contents of electronic or computerised communications , all this without the consent of the persons concerned .", "CARDINAL . The authorisation process for these activities is dependent on the actual competence exercised by ORG , namely whether it is within the framework of secret surveillance linked to the investigation of certain specific crimes enumerated in the law ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) or to secret surveillance within the framework of intelligence gathering for national security ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Whereas the scenario under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) is as such subject to judicial authorisation , the CARDINAL under LAW ( CARDINAL ) is authorised by the Minister in charge of justice , ( i ) in order to prevent terrorist acts or in the interests of GPE \u2019s national security or ( ii ) in order to rescue NORP citizens from capture abroad in war zones or in the context of terrorist acts .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d takes place under the rules of LAW under the condition that the necessary intelligence can not be obtained in any other way . Otherwise , the law does not contain any particular rules on the circumstances in which this measure can be ordered , as opposed to \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d , which is conditional on the suspicion of certain serious crimes . The time - frame of \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d is DATE , which can be prolonged for another DATE period by the Minister ; however , the latter has no right to know about the results of the ongoing surveillance when called on to decide on its prolongation . Once the surveillance is terminated , the law imposes no specific obligation on the authorities to destroy any irrelevant intelligence obtained .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed a constitutional complaint on DATE , arguing in essence that the sweeping prerogatives under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) infringed their constitutional right to privacy . They emphasised that the legislation on secret surveillance measures for national security purposes provided fewer safeguards for the protection of the right to privacy than the provision on secret surveillance linked to the investigation of particular crimes . They pointed out that ( i ) \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d was always linked to a particular crime and could only be ordered for the purposes of identifying or locating suspects , whereas \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d was not linked to any particular crime ; ( ii ) \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d was always ordered by the court , whereas \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d was authorised by the government minister in charge of justice ; ( iii ) the decision on ordering \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d was subject to detailed reasoning , whereas no reasoning was included in the minister \u2019s decision on ordering \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d ; and ( iv ) under the legislation relating to \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d , all collected but irrelevant information had to be destroyed within DATE , unlike in the case of \u201c section QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the majority of the applicants\u2019 complaints . In CARDINAL aspect the ORG agreed with the applicants , namely , it held that the decision of the minister ordering secret intelligence gathering had to be supported by reasons . However , ORG held in essence that the scope of national security - related tasks was much broader that the scope of the tasks related to the investigation of particular crimes . For the purpose of national security , the events of real life were examined not for their criminal law relevance ; therefore they might not necessarily be linked to a particular crime . Furthermore , in the context of national security , the external control of any surveillance authorised by the minister was exercised by ORG \u2019s ORG ( which had the right to call the minister to give account both in general terms and in concrete cases ) and by the ORG , and that this scheme was sufficient to guarantee respect for the constitutional right to privacy of those concerned . Finally , ORG was of the opinion that LAW , which applies to \u201c section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) surveillance \u201d , contained general provisions on ex officio deletion of any data unnecessary for achieving the aim underlying the gathering of intelligence .", "CARDINAL .
