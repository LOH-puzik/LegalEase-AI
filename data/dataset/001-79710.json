NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and was resident in GPE . He was an adviser to the NORP Minister for ORG with the rank of secretary of state and the imam of ORG in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . He is currently detained in GPE . Before the ORG he was represented by PERSON , a former judge of ORG and lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG , and , subsequently , PERSON PERSON , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . A NORP citizen on an undercover mission for the GPE investigation and prosecution authorities in GPE convinced the applicant that he could put him in touch with a person abroad who was willing to make a major financial donation ( the purpose of which is a matter of dispute ) . Thereupon , the applicant decided to travel to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE authorities requested legal assistance ( PERSON ) from the NORP authorities in the criminal investigations into the applicant \u2019s activities . On DATE the GPE am ORG authorised the interception and recording of conversations in the hotel rooms in GPE in which the applicant was expected to stay .", "CARDINAL . The applicant travelled to GPE in DATE with his secretary . On DATE they were arrested in GPE by NORP police officers under an arrest warrant that had been issued on DATE by ORG for LOC of GPE supported by a motion dated DATE of ORG for the applicant to be taken into custody pending extradition . The GPE prosecution authorities charged the applicant with providing money , weapons and communications equipment to terrorist groups , in particular ORG and ORG , and with recruiting new members for these groups DATE and the date of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s provisional detention after hearing his representations . Pursuant to an order of the GPE am ORG dated DATE , the applicant was remanded in provisional custody pending extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transmitted a formal request to ORG for the applicant \u2019s extradition for criminal prosecution . The request was based on the extradition treaty between GPE and GPE of DATE read in conjunction with the supplementary treaty of CARDINAL DATE ( see below at paragraphs DATE ) . Enclosed with the request were the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE and a written affidavit by the Deputy GPE Attorney of LOC of GPE in which the latter expounded the state of the investigations in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon an application made by the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the GPE am ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s remand in formal custody pending extradition ( f\u00f6rmliche PERSON ) . It gave the GPE authorities until DATE to furnish additional particulars of the offences the applicant was charged with . Thereupon , additional extradition documents were submitted to that court , including an affidavit by an ORG investigator setting out the specific offences with which the applicant was charged under the GPE criminal law . It emerged from these documents that the GPE authorities had learned of the suspected offences from a NORP national who had also incited the applicant to meet another informant in GPE who allegedly wanted to donate money for the \u201c Jihad \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing before the GPE am ORG on DATE the applicant refused to consent to his extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG confirmed its order of formal detention pending extradition . Having received additional documents from the GPE authorities , it noted that the applicant was now charged with membership of CARDINAL terrorist associations , ORG and the extremist branch of the ORG . These activities corresponded to offences under NORP criminal law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL notes verbales ORG informed ORG that it considered that the applicant had been abducted from GPE to GPE contrary to public international law and to the prohibition in LAW on the extradition of its own citizens . It requested the federal government to repatriate the applicant to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a note verbal of CARDINAL DATE ORG gave an assurance ( LOC ) to the NORP authorities that the applicant would not be prosecuted by a military tribunal pursuant to ORG of DATE ( see below at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) or by any other extraordinary court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG declared the applicant \u2019s extradition admissible and ordered his further remand in custody , invoking the risk that he might abscond if released . It found that the offences which the applicant was charged with in GPE were punishable and extraditable , under the law of both GPE and GPE . There were no rules of domestic or public international law that required the discontinuance of the proceedings on account of the fact that the applicant had been incited to travel to GPE by an informant . Moreover , there was nothing to warrant the conclusion that the applicant might be subjected to unfair criminal proceedings or torture in GPE . The assurance given by GPE on CARDINAL DATE clearly stated that criminal proceedings for the offences listed in the extradition request would be instituted against the applicant in the ordinary criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the GPE am ORG of a violation of his right to be heard in court and applied for a new decision on the validity of the extradition request and a stay of execution . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as the reasons given by the applicant disclosed no new circumstances justifying a different decision on the validity of the extradition request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG dismissed a further application by the applicant for a fresh decision on the validity of the extradition request . It found that the evidence supporting the charges had exclusively been taken from the extradition documents submitted by the GPE authorities , which had been sent to the applicant \u2019s lawyers for inspection prior to the decision on the validity of the extradition request . Concerns that the applicant might be at risk of torture if extradited had been allayed by the assurance given by the GPE authorities , which was binding under public international law . It had to be assumed that the applicant would be brought before an ordinary criminal court in GPE . Worrying reports about inhuman treatment of prisoners suspected of terrorism concerned almost without exception prisoners in LOC ( GPE ) and GPE ( GPE ) and in some third countries . It could not be concluded from existing press reports on the treatment of these prisoners that ordinary criminal proceedings in GPE would not meet the minimum standards of due process of law or would infringe the prohibition on torture . Moreover , no other circumstances were known that would give cause for further inquiry into the facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions of the GPE am ORG of DATE , CARDINAL and DATE . He argued , in particular , that his surveillance by the ORG in GPE and his abduction from that country to GPE had been in breach of GPE \u2019s territorial sovereignty and therefore of public international law and that , accordingly , his detention pending extradition had no legal basis . He also claimed that he would be placed in preventive detention in GPE indefinitely without access to a court or a lawyer . He further alleged that , if he was extradited , the NORP authorities would expose him to interrogation methods that were contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) of ORG unanimously rejected the complaint as ill - founded and therefore refused to grant an interim injunction staying the applicant \u2019s extradition .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found that the GPE am ORG decision had not infringed LAW . The applicant \u2019s extradition was not in breach of public international law . There was no general rule of public international law , at any rate not in cases such as the present one , to prevent a person being lured by trickery from his ORG of origin to a ORG to which a request was then made for his extradition ( \u201c the requested ORG \u201d ) in order to circumvent a ban on extradition that was valid in his ORG of origin . Examining the ORG practice on this question , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The examination of ORG practice shows that the general rule of international law that is alleged by the complainant does not exist . The ORG case - law is heterogeneous as regards the question whether the fact that a prosecuted person has been lured out of his or her ORG of origin becomes an obstacle precluding extradition in the requested ORG of residence . The majority of decisions do not even regard the circumstances which preceded the arrest as an obstacle precluding criminal prosecution in the ORG of the forum .", "In this context , it need not be decided whether a national obstacle precluding criminal proceedings or extradition results from customary international law if the prosecuted person has been taken from his or her ORG of origin to the ORG of the forum or to the requested ORG by the use of force . Admittedly , more recent ORG practice , in particular as a consequence of dealing with the ORG decision in the ORG case ( ORG , DATE . CARDINAL [ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) indicates that the principle male captus , bene detentus is rejected at any rate if the ORG got hold of the prosecuted person by committing serious human rights violations , and if the ORG whose territorial sovereignty was violated protested against such procedure ( see ORG for the Former GPE , Prosecutor v. PERSON , Decision of DATE - IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-ARCARDINAL , ORG , ORG . CARDINAL et seq . with reference to the decision of ORG , GPE v. Toscanino , CARDINAL ORG , Second Series CARDINAL [ DATE ] ; see also PERSON , PERSON v\u00f6lkerrechtliche PERSON ihre Rechtsfolgen , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , at p. CARDINAL , with further references ) .", "The facts of the present case , however , differ from these cases in important details as the applicant \u2019s decision to leave GPE was voluntary . According to his secretary \u2019s statement , the applicant himself suggested GPE as the venue for a meeting that was supposed to serve fundraising activities on account of the favourable visa regulations for NORP citizens in GPE and in view of the good traffic connections . Admittedly , the applicant was deceived by trickery so that the motives for which he travelled to GPE were based on deception . However , he was not subjected to direct force aimed at bending his will , he was not threatened with the use of force , and the trickery did not facilitate his subsequent forceful abduction . The acts of deception were not performed by or are attributable to the NORP authorities . Finally , there are no indications that would permit the assumption that the NORP authorities cooperated with the GPE criminal prosecution and investigation authorities in a collusive manner in order to induce the applicant to travel specifically to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG examined a number of decisions of national and international courts and concluded that it could not be ascertained that a practice had been established under international law with respect to facts such as those in the present case which would have meant that the extradition was ostensibly in breach of customary international law . The fact that ORG had refused the extradition of a NORP citizen to GPE because the prosecuted person had been lured to GPE by the NORP authorities , infringing NORP sovereignty ( ORG , judgment of DATE , PERSON DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) could not be regarded as proof of the existence of a practice creating customary international law . ORG notably found :", "\u201c When assessing the existing judicial decisions it has to be borne in mind that doubts already exist as to the preconditions that must obtain before the luring of a suspect out of his or her ORG of residence by means of DATE as opposed to the use of force \u2013 can be regarded as an act that is contrary to international law at all ... To the extent that in the case of the use of trickery the suspect \u2019s decision to travel overseas is also motivated by his or her own interests and to the extent that the possibility remains for him or her to decide not to leave , the suspect will not , as a general rule , be the subject of State coercion .", "Admittedly , the boundary between luring someone out of a ORG by means of trickery and breaking someone \u2019s will by the use of force can be fluid in borderline cases , for instance if someone is deluded into believing something that has the effect of irresistible coercion on the person affected . Such circumstances , however , do not exist here . Instead , the complainant travelled to the federal territory on the basis of an independent decision in order to pursue his own specific interests there .", "Moreover , recent ORG practice also takes into account the seriousness of the crime with which the person is charged , which means that , in this respect , it takes proportionality into consideration . The protection of high - ranking legal interests , which has been intensified at the international level in DATE , can lend itself to justifying the violation of a ORG \u2019s personal sovereignty that may result from the use of trickery ( see ORG for the Former GPE , Prosecutor v. PERSON , loc . cit . , number CARDINAL ) . To the extent that the fight against the most serious crimes \u2013 such as supporting the international drugs trade or terrorism \u2013 is concerned , luring someone out of a ORG \u2019s territorial sovereignty by means of trickery is not , at any rate to the extent that would be required under existing ORG practice , regarded as an obstacle precluding criminal prosecution . No different rules can apply to the existence of an obstacle precluding extradition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaints about the interrogation methods in GPE ORG continued :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s rights under ... LAW ... have not been violated . ORG declared the extradition request valid in accordance with the constitutional requirements . This also applies to the extent that the applicant had applied for a further investigation into the facts of the case as regards the methods of interrogation used in GPE , which are allegedly contrary to the due process of law . ORG rejected this submission , citing a lack of indications to this effect in the United States\u2019 practice . This reasoning is constitutionally unobjectionable .", "On the one hand , it is consistent with ORG recent case - law , which provides that in mutual assistance concerning extradition , especially if rendered on the basis of international - law treaties , the requesting ORG is , in principle , to be shown trust as concerns its compliance with the principles of due process of law and of the protection of human rights . This principle can claim validity as long as it is not shaken by evidence to the contrary ( Decision of the Second Chamber of DATE BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL - Extradition to GPE ) . Such evidence did not exist at the time of ORG decision .", "On the other hand , decisive weight must be given to the fact that GPE precluded the possible application of ORG DATE by their assurance of CARDINAL DATE . Thus , GPE have assumed an obligation , which is binding under international law , not to bring the applicant before an extraordinary court after his extradition , apply the procedural law laid down in the LAW DATE or place the complainant in an internment camp . There is no indication that GPE will not comply with the assurance if the applicant is extradited .", "It is also relevant that the relations of mutual judicial assistance that exist between GPE and GPE on the basis of international law treaties have been reinforced still further by the signing of ORG on DATE . This circumstance confirms the assumption that , in principle , GPE will comply with their obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE ( the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE cited above ) . Moreover , it can be assumed that ORG itself will observe the further proceedings in GPE through its diplomatic missions . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , DATE the applicant and his secretary were extradited to GPE on board a ORG aircraft .", "CARDINAL . In a note dated CARDINAL DATE the Head of ORG informed the GPE am ORG that the federal government had authorised the extradition of the applicant and his secretary on DATE . The authorisation had been given on condition that they were not sentenced to death or committed to stand trial before a military tribunal ( thus excluding their detention in LOC ) .
