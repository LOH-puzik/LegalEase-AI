The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Krems a.d . ORG ( ORG a.d . GPE ) conducted criminal proceedings against the applicant , who was accused of both attempted and actual sexual abuse of minors and juveniles , and of offences under LAW .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , ORG appointed a neurological and psychiatric expert to examine the applicant , to establish , inter alia , whether the applicant fulfilled the conditions for referral to an institution for mentally ill offenders ( GPE f\u00fcr geistig abnorme PERSON ) pursuant to LAW ) . The applicant does not appear to have objected to the choice of expert or to the subject matter on which the report was to be obtained . On DATE the expert submitted his written opinion , establishing that the applicant was fully criminally responsible and diagnosing a disorder of sexual preferences , paedophilia and narcissistic personality disorder . The opinion was based on an examination of the applicant , the criminal files and the results of an ORG personality test . The expert found that the applicant \u2019s disordered conduct had progressed , in view of the decreasing age of his victims . The opinion concluded that there was a very high risk that the applicant would relapse , with severe consequences . Subsequently , the opinion was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel for comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel commented on the expert \u2019s opinion , submitted the opinion of a private expert , a psychiatrist and neurologist , and requested the court to have it read out to the court - appointed expert at the oral hearing and to appoint another expert in the event that the court - appointed expert did not concur with the private expert \u2019s opinion .", "CARDINAL . The opinion of the private expert , dated CARDINAL DATE , also found that the applicant suffered from homosexual paedophilia , a disorder of his sexual preferences and a sexual maturity crisis . He found , however , that there was no indication of a narcissistic disorder . As regards the prognosis , the expert concluded that there was a low to moderate risk of the applicant reoffending as regards non - violent sexual abuse of children . The private expert commented on the court - appointed expert \u2019s opinion and criticised his methods , considering in particular that the factual statements he had made were unclear and were not accompanied by sufficient explanation . Finally , he also questioned the court - appointed expert \u2019s interpretation of those factual statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court - appointed expert supplemented his opinion in writing and commented on every observation made by the private expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in which the court - appointed expert summarised and supplemented his opinion . During the hearing , the applicant \u2019s counsel questioned the court - appointed expert at length . The court did not , however , allow questions to be put by counsel which referred to the private expert opinion , or general questions regarding the court - appointed expert \u2019s education and competencies . Counsel also made applications for the admission of the private expert opinion to the proceedings and for the private expert to be allowed to testify as a witness . According to the record of the hearing , counsel requested , in particular ,", "\u201c ... that evidence be heard from PERSON , a psychiatric specialist at ORG , on the subject of the requirements of LAW of LAW in the context of a psychiatric assessment and case history carried out after the assessment by the court - appointed expert and at a time when the accused \u2019s detention for DATE in an individual cell , a situation which was new to him and to which he was wholly unaccustomed , had come to an end ...", "He requested that a further expert opinion be sought on the basis of the provisions of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which made express reference to the need to seek the opinion of CARDINAL psychiatric expert , and on the basis of LAW of the ORG , according to which CARDINAL expert had to be called in the proceedings , failing which they would be declared null and void . Even after the additional questioning of the court - appointed expert there were grounds to assert that the conditions laid down in CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG had not been met , with the result that no reliable prognosis could be made as to the dangerousness of the accused without a further expert report .", "He reiterated his request for PERSON expert report and additional observations , contained in the file , to be read out and for GPE , GPE and GPE to be called as witnesses to testify that the accused had no difficulty forming relationships , had sufficient empathy and had no pathological need to control others . The appearance of those witnesses was also sought in order to testify that the facts on which the court - appointed expert based his opinion were partly inaccurate and incomplete , and thus defective overall .", "The public prosecutor objected to the request . As far as the taking of evidence from PERSON was concerned , this was a means of introducing a private expert opinion into the proceedings and served no other apparent purpose . The other witnesses were to be asked to testify on medical matters that should be assessed by an expert , and were therefore unsuited to that purpose . Matters relating to the psychiatric assessment should also be determined by the expert ; an expert opinion was available which , even after several ORG questioning , still appeared consistent . The public prosecutor was therefore also opposed to a second expert opinion being sought . He repeatedly expressed his opposition to having the private expert opinion of PERSON read out in court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed counsel \u2019s requests at the hearing and reasoned the dismissal as follows :", "\u201c Decision refusing the requests", "( CARDINAL ) As regards the taking of evidence from PERSON concerning the requirements of LAW of LAW : it is not clear , first , in what capacity PERSON might be examined . The requirements of LAW of LAW are a legal issue , to be determined solely by the court with the assistance of a court - appointed psychiatric expert . Witnesses are individuals who have to give their own observations regarding facts relevant to the taking of evidence : their role is in no sense to make statements concerning legal or empirical evidence or to speculate , express opinions , make value judgments or draw conclusions . As to the possibility of examining PERSON as a witness on the subject of his psychiatric assessment , it must be pointed out that such assessments are not a matter for witnesses . Since PERSON has prepared a private expert opinion in the present case , he can not also be regarded as an expert for the purpose of the proceedings , and any statements he might make as a witness concerning the psychiatric assessment would not constitute valid evidence .", "( CARDINAL ) As far as obtaining a further expert opinion is concerned : neither provision can be interpreted as imposing a requirement to call a further expert in the proceedings concerning the accused \u2019s compulsory psychiatric admission . Here again , then , reference must be made to the provisions of LAW and LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , according to which the calling of a further expert is required only if the existing findings and opinion are incomplete and inconclusive . This may arise in the event of difficulties in observing the patient and making an assessment ; this in turn will arise only if the court - appointed expert is unable to reply with certainty , or at all , to the questions put to him , in which case the possibility of the questions being answered by another expert can not be ruled out . In the instant case PERSON answered the questions put to him with certainty from the outset . During DATE \u2019s hearing , and especially during questioning by the defence , no important points were left unanswered . It can not therefore be argued that the expert did not answer the questions conclusively and with certainty . As a result , the criteria laid down in LAW , in particular read together with LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , certainly do not apply and the request must be refused .", "( CARDINAL ) As regards PERSON private expert opinion and additional observations : the public prosecutor opposed the reading - out of the report . Hence , the conditions laid down in LAW ORG do not apply , nor , in any sense , do those of LAW ( CARDINAL ) .", "( CARDINAL ) As to the taking of evidence from witnesses GPE , GPE and GPE : the request does not explain why the witnesses in question might possess this knowledge . Furthermore , the assessment of whether an individual has difficulty forming relationships , is lacking in empathy and has a pathological need to control others can only be carried out by an expert , especially since witnesses may not draw conclusions from what they observe . It is not clear why these witnesses should know that the facts were inaccurately or incompletely conveyed by the expert in his opinion , nor has it been explained why they should have anything to contribute on the subject ; hence , their evidence is not valid in this regard . \u201c", "CARDINAL . Upon a repeated request by counsel to allow the private expert to testify as a witness , ORG decided", "\u201c ... to refuse the request for PERSON to testify as a witness on the subject of the psychiatric assessment conducted by him , since this was carried out after the assessment by the courtsworn expert . According to LAW ORG , where there are doubts as to an individual \u2019s mental incapacity or a mental disorder is suspected , an assessment of his mental or psychological state by CARDINAL or , if need be , CARDINAL doctors must be ordered . This clearly refers to court - appointed experts . This provision and , of course , the remaining provisions concerning the establishment of findings unambiguously provide that the examination or assessment is a matter exclusively for a court - appointed expert . It follows that PERSON , as a private expert , can not have made any findings within the meaning of the law or , more specifically , of the provisions concerning expert evidence , with the result that his observations as a witness concerning such findings do not constitute valid evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG . ORG , sitting as a panel composed of CARDINAL professional and CARDINAL lay judges ( ORG ) , convicted the applicant of both attempted and actual sexual abuse of minors and juveniles and of offences under LAW , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was also admitted to an institution for mentally ill offenders pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was found to have sexually abused a minor born in DATE by sustained touching of his sexual organs on CARDINAL occasions DATE , and to have enticed CARDINAL juveniles born in DATE to carry out sexual acts on CARDINAL occasions DATE by offering them money . He was further found to have provided CARDINAL juveniles with hashish CARDINAL times DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the psychological expert opinions , ORG found in its reasoning concerning the assessment of the evidence that", "\u201c ... at the hearing and even beforehand the accused gave the court and PERSON , an experienced expert in neurology and psychiatry , a relatively full account of his life ...", "On the basis of these extensive materials , PERSON first produced his written opinion , which he presented during the hearing and added to at length and in detail ...", "... at the hearing PERSON gave reasons for his opinion in comprehensible , logical and consistent fashion . It is clear even to a lay person that the accused \u2019s problems , which have been well established , are of such severity as to constitute a serious personality disorder , even though some of his problems ( such as masochistic masturbation ) do not necessarily result in criminal behaviour ...", "... The expert also confirmed that the accused does not have violent tendencies in the sense of using physical violence . However , it must be borne in mind that , particularly in the sphere of psychology and psychiatry , psychological violence plays an important role . The accused repeatedly abused young people as a result of his disposition , whether by giving them alcohol , showing them pornographic films , offering them money or using his position in society . The expert and , accordingly , the court therefore concluded that it was likely that the accused , on account of his mental disorder and in particular his paedophile tendencies , would commit further offences of the kind with which he has been charged .", "The accused and his counsel attempted at first to call the expert \u2019s qualifications into question . However , in view of his training and professional experience , these were beyond doubt .", "A request was then made for the private expert opinion of PERSON to be read out in court . This request was refused by the court because the parties did not agree on that point and none of the grounds provided for by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG applied . The defence then had the terms \u201c abnormal sexual preferences \u201d and \u201c perversion \u201d explained to them and the expert reiterated in this context too that the accused showed no signs of sadistic tendencies . The defence subsequently tried to undermine PERSON opinion by claiming that he had not used all the available methods , which had apparently been used by the private expert . After PERSON had answered all the questions asked by the defence in consistent , comprehensible and , above all , comprehensive terms , the request for the private expert \u2019s opinion to be read out was repeated . This request was rejected on the same grounds and also , in particular , on the grounds that it was for experts themselves to decide which methods they used to substantiate their opinion , based on the present state of scientific knowledge . Only shortcomings in the procedure described in LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG or circumstances indicating particular difficulties in making a diagnosis or preparing the opinion could justify calling in a further court - sworn expert .", "The request to circumvent these provisions by the taking of witness evidence from a private expert also had to be refused , since the latter did not and could not make observations concerning the alleged facts , and the findings are to be established exclusively by the courtappointed expert . For the same reason , the request for ORG , GPE and GPE to testify was also superfluous , especially since no specific subjects were even mentioned and , in particular , it was not made clear which of the facts ( findings ) presented by the expert had supposedly been incomplete or defective ...", "In sum , it was thus demonstrated that there was no call to question the statements of the expert PERSON regarding the severity of the accused \u2019s disorder and his dangerousness , with the result that the court was justified in basing its decision on those statements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a plea of nullity ( GPE ) and an appeal ( GPE ) against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected the plea of nullity and referred the appeal to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht Wien ) . As regards the expert opinions , that court found as follows :", "\u201c The refusal of the request for a \u2018 a further expert opinion [ to ] be sought on the basis of the provisions of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which made express reference to the need to seek the opinion of CARDINAL psychiatric expert , and on the basis of LAW of the ORG , according to which CARDINAL expert had to be called in the proceedings , failing which they would be declared null and DATE which was further based on the assertion that \u2018 [ e]ven after the additional questioning of the court - appointed expert there were grounds to assert that the conditions laid down in LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG had not been met , with the result that no reliable prognosis could be made as to the dangerousness of the accused without a further expert report\u2019 \u2013 did not adversely affect the rights of the defence . The panel of professional and lay judges correctly pointed out in its decision based on LAW ORG that there were no grounds for calling in a second expert either on account of difficulty in observing the patient or making an assessment , as referred to in LAW ORG ( which was also applicable to the committal proceedings ) , or on account of shortcomings in the findings or the opinion of the courtappointed expert ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG ) , as the latter had answered all the questions \u2018 conclusively and with ORG .", "For the same reason DATE and also because it was patently concerned only with an examination that was inadmissible during the hearing \u2013 the request for the private expert PERSON to testify as a witness \u2018 on the subject of the requirements of LAW of LAW in the context of a psychiatric assessment and case history carried out after the assessment by the court - appointed expert and at a time when the accused \u2019s detention for DATE in an individual cell , a situation which was new to him and to which he was wholly unaccustomed , had come to an end\u2019 and \u2018 on the subject of factual observations in connection with the psychiatric assessment of the accused , carried out after the assessment by the court - appointed PERSON was correctly rejected , with reference to the settled case - law concerning the content of witness statements and the inadmissibility of statements made by private individuals concerning the legal subject - matter of the proceedings .", "The same applies to the refusal of the request for the reading out of the private expert opinion of PERSON , which is of no significance in terms of the criminal proceedings .", "Lastly , the accused has not been adversely affected by the refusal of the request to hear evidence from witnesses ORG , GPE and GPE The request did not specify the \u201c facts \u201d on which these persons were supposed to give evidence ; hence , the subject to which it related could not be clearly identified . Furthermore , the request did not explain why the persons concerned should be expected to provide information concerning circumstances relevant to the accused \u2019s guilt or the legal characterisation ; this request therefore ( also ) related to inadmissible evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded . It stated that the expert \u2019s prognosis that there was a risk of the applicant relapsing was convincing and stated further :", "\u201c As regards the criticism and the repeated request for the private expert opinion of PERSON , obtained by the accused , to be admitted in the proceedings and for a further expert opinion to be sought , these must be rejected first of all on the basis of the findings of ORG in its decision on the plea of nullity . Even after an in - depth study of the opinion of PERSON , the expert appointed by the first - instance court DATE whose opinion , incidentally , addressed all the criticisms raised in PERSON opinion and countered convincingly and in detail all the defence \u2019s criticisms based on the private expert opinion \u2013 ORG could find no grounds for the appointment of another expert in accordance with the provisions of LAW ORG . Accordingly , the request for a further expert opinion must be rejected in the first place for lack of legal basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP That appeal judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ) provides as follows :", "\" CARDINAL . If a person commits an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year , and if he can not be punished for the sole reason that he committed the offence under the influence of a state of mind excluding responsibility ( LAW ) resulting from a serious mental or emotional abnormality , the court shall order him to be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders if , in view of his personality , his condition and the nature of the offence it is to be feared that he will otherwise , under the influence of his mental or emotional abnormality , commit a criminal offence with serious consequences .", "CARDINAL . NORP If such a fear exists , an order for placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders shall also be made in respect of a person who , while not lacking criminal responsibility , commits an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year under the influence of severe mental or emotional abnormality . In such a case the placement is to be ordered at the same time as the sentence is passed . \"", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) , as in force at the relevant time , provided that a court , during the proceedings and if the subject matter warranted it , should appoint an expert . The court had to appoint CARDINAL experts only if the subject matter to be examined was particularly difficult ( see LAW ) . Domestic case - law determined that an allegation that an expert opinion had reached the wrong conclusion was not to be considered to render the subject matter \u201c particularly difficult \u201d within the meaning of the provision ( EvBl CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Such difficulty could arise where an appointed expert was unable to answer a question put before him , if another expert would in all probability be able to answer it .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , an expert was appointed at the investigative stage by the investigative judge , or by the court . There was no right for the parties to formally object to the appointment of an expert . However , LAW provided that the parties should be informed of the planned appointment of an expert . If the parties brought forward objections regarding the appointment of the expert in a timely manner , the court could appoint another expert .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its FAC and CARDINAL , LAW provided for procedural steps to be taken in the event of a deficient expert opinion in criminal proceedings : the main principles deriving from those provisions were that in the event of an expert opinion being contradictory or inconclusive , or in the event that CARDINAL expert opinions clearly differed from each other and another oral examination of the experts could not eliminate the doubts with regard to the conclusions of their opinions , a new expert was to be appointed by the court .", "CARDINAL . A citation from the domestic jurisprudence summarises the general view of NORP domestic law on criminal procedure as regards private experts\u2019 opinions : in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( CARDINALOsCARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG , deciding on a plea of nullity , stated :", "\u201c As regards the procedural objection , it should be made clear from the outset that private expert opinions related to the case , of the kind commissioned by the applicant and submitted with a request for the taking of evidence , can properly serve only to provide the accused and his or her defence counsel with expert clarification on important aspects of the case and thereby enable them to put pertinent questions to the court - appointed experts ; where applicable , they may also serve as grounds for obtaining an additional expert opinion ( ordered by the court ) ... As evidence , however , they have ... by law no procedural significance , since they lack in particular the guarantees of impartiality and judicial supervision of their preparation . Accordingly , they are not to be read out during the trial either . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the material time LAW did not yet include an explicit provision allowing privately commissioned experts to be present at the oral hearing and to thereby assist defendants and their counsel in questioning the court - appointed experts during the hearing . Such a provision was introduced into LAW in DATE with its new LAW . However , also before the reform of LAW , ORG had stated in its case - law , with reference to a defendant \u2019s rights under LAW ( d ) of the LAW , that to ensure that the defendant could question an expert effectively during the hearing , he or she could make use of the professional support of a privately commissioned expert , and that expert could not be refused permission to sit next to counsel in the hearing room , albeit without having the right to question the court - appointed expert directly ( see judgment CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , and judgment ORG of ORG of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW at the material time , a witness testified before the court on his or her perception of the subject matter at issue ( see LAW ) . Again , the amended LAW codified the principles deriving from ORG jurisprudence in the matter and stated in its LAW that a witness was a person having directly or indirectly perceived relevant facts regarding the subject matter of the investigation or the proceedings and who should thus testify on those perceptions .", "CARDINAL . The referral of a defendant to an institution for mentally ill offenders under LAW of LAW had in principle to be ordered at the same time as the sentence was imposed ( see LAW ) . However , such a referral was null and void if the defendant had not been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings and if the order had been made without hearing CARDINAL psychiatric expert on the matter ( see Article CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "CARDINAL .
