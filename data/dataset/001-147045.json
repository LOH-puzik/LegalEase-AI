De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Sundborn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Kronofogdemyndigheten ) in GPE issued a writ of execution ( beslut om utm\u00e4tning ) attaching a mobile sawmill belonging to the applicant . It noted that the applicant \u2019s total enforceable tax debts amounted to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( roughly EUR CARDINAL ) and that the sawmill had an estimated value of SEK CARDINAL ( roughly EUR CARDINAL ) . The ORG decided to leave the sawmill in the applicant \u2019s possession but informed him that he was not allowed to sell or dispose of it or otherwise make use of it in a way that might negatively affect its value .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and also requested ORG to stay the sale of the sawmill while the court considered the case . The request for the interim measure was granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the writ of execution . The interim measure was consequently also lifted .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal by the applicant , both ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) and ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused leave to appeal , the latter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG contacted the applicant in order to plan the sale of the attached sawmill . In his reply DATE , the applicant stated that he had removed the sawmill from his property and hidden it . He also submitted a written statement specifying that he had removed and hidden the sawmill , alone when no one else was at home .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG visited the applicant \u2019s property and confirmed that the sawmill was no longer there . The ORG also handed the applicant a summons for questioning on CARDINAL DATE on its LOC , as well as an injunction in which he was ordered to provide the ORG with the necessary information to be able to recuperate the sawmill . The injunction also informed the applicant that , according to LAW , section DATE , of LAW ( ORG ) , he was duty - bound to give information about his assets and their location . It further informed him of the ORG \u2019s intention to ask ORG to detain him if he did not cooperate .", "CARDINAL . At the questioning , the applicant acknowledged that he knew that the sawmill was attached and that he was not allowed to dispose of it in any way . However , since he considered that the basis for the attachment was wrong , he had decided to hide it . He stated that he took full responsibility for his actions and that nobody but him had been involved or knew where the sawmill was . He refused to give any information about its whereabouts but admitted that he had driven some distance with it around mid - April CARDINAL . He further claimed that it could be only partly in his possession and that he was not sure that he could retrieve it if he wanted to . He stated that he had even considered setting fire to the sawmill . Meanwhile , the applicant \u2019s wife was also questioned . She informed ORG that she had no information about where the sawmill was hidden .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to detain the applicant because he had refused to cooperate and give the required information . It relied on LAW , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section DATE , of LAW . On DATE , ORG assigned a public defender for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant opposed the measure and claimed that it would be in violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW to detain him and that no extraordinary reasons for such a measure existed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected ORG request . It first considered that NORP legislation on this point did not contravene the said provisions in the LAW . The question was whether there were extraordinary reasons to detain the applicant . In this respect , the court noted that the writ of execution had gained legal force on DATE when ORG refused leave to appeal . Thus , the court held , only a short time had passed since the matter had been finally resolved . It further observed that ORG had not resorted to any other measures in order to convince the applicant to reveal the location of the property , such as imposing a conditional fine . Whilst recognising that the applicant so far had been reluctant to give any information about the location of the sawmill , the court found that it could not be ruled out that a less severe coercive measure would alter his attitude . Consequently , the court concluded that currently there did not exist such extraordinary reasons to detain the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to ORG , maintaining its claims and adding that , according to the preparatory works of LAW , it was only necessary that the debtor had received an injunction but refused to comply with it . It further submitted that having regard to the applicant \u2019s stance on the matter , the imposition of a conditional fine would most likely have no effect . Lastly , the ORG stated that it had reported the applicant to the police on the ground that he had committed a breach of an official order when he had removed and hidden the sawmill .", "CARDINAL . The applicant opposed the appeal , maintaining his claims and adding that he considered that , if he were detained , it would amount to imprisonment to obtain a confession . In his view , it would be clearly disproportionate to the aim pursued to detain him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision and granted ORG request . It stated that a debtor had to give necessary information about his assets and failure to do so could result in the debtor being detained , if there were extraordinary reasons for detention . Moreover , it was not necessary to impose a fine initially . Having regard to the size of the debts , the value of the hidden property and the fact that the applicant had maintained his refusal to reveal its location , ORG found that there were extraordinary reasons to detain the applicant and that detention was proportionate to the aim pursued . In reaching its decision , the court found that the measure did not breach the LAW . Lastly , it noted that it should be informed as soon as the applicant had been detained in order to hold a hearing as to the continued detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained DATE . Consequently , on DATE , ORG held an oral hearing and decided to maintain its earlier decision . At the hearing , the applicant stated that the taxes and the attachment had been imposed on him wrongly and that as long as these errors had not been corrected he would not cooperate to bring back the sawmill . The court reiterated its reasons as stated in its earlier decision and added that the applicant \u2019s detention should be reviewed DATE and that he should be released immediately if he revealed the location of the property . Moreover , under no circumstances could the applicant be kept in detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reviewed the applicant \u2019s detention and held a new hearing in the case as required by LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW . ORG maintained that the applicant should be kept in detention since he still had not given any information about the location of the sawmill . It stated that it had not been able to undertake any investigative measures , since the applicant had stated that he had taken the sawmill far away from his property by car and its whereabouts thus were unknown to the ORG . The applicant , who requested his immediate release , maintained his refusal to give any information about the location of the sawmill and claimed , inter alia , that he suffered from high blood pressure and panic anxiety attacks , causing him difficulties sleeping . Moreover , he stated that he had recently been treated for prostate cancer and that he was not allowed to take his normal medication against his panic attacks since it contained narcotic substances . In its decision , ORG noted that the applicant maintained his refusal to reveal the whereabouts of the sawmill and found , having regard to the proportionality of the measure , that there were extraordinary reasons for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . Hence , ORG decided that he should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , rejected the appeal . Upon further appeal , ORG dismissed the appeal since a new decision had already been taken by ORG at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again reviewed the detention and held a new hearing in the case . ORG maintained its earlier point of view and acknowledged that no investigative measure had been possible due to the applicant \u2019s continued refusal to cooperate . The applicant maintained his earlier position and added that he suffered from asthmatic symptoms due to the dry air in custody . Having regard to his age and health problems , he considered that it was clearly disproportionate to prolong his detention . ORG found that there were still extraordinary reasons for the applicant \u2019s continued detention and that it was not disproportionate to the aim pursued . It thus ordered that he should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG which , on DATE , rejected the appeal . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG once again reviewed the detention and held a hearing in the case . The parties maintained their earlier standpoints . ORG found that continued detention of the applicant would be disproportionate to the measures he had taken . Hence , ORG concluded that there were no extraordinary reasons for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . As a consequence , ORG ordered his immediate release and the order was implemented DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to ORG which , on DATE , rejected the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG further appeal and consequently , on DATE , ORG struck the case out of its list of cases as the case was closed .", "CARDINAL . As concerns ORG police report concerning the applicant \u2019s alleged breach of an official order pursuant to LAW , LAW , of LAW ( ORG ) , the preliminary investigation was discontinued with reference to provisions on waiver of prosecution ( \u00e5talsunderl\u00e5telse ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to revoke the writ of execution concerning the sawmill since it considered that no additional circumstances had emerged that could reveal its location . Furthermore , it was considered that there were no other measures which could produce results to that end .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a claim for damages to the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) , pursuant to LAW and Other Coercive Measures ( NORP om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vande och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , in the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the suffering he had endured during DATE he was deprived of his liberty . He further demanded to be reimbursed SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for costs which had been deducted from his pension during his time in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chancellor of ORG rejected the claim . The Chancellor noted that the decision to detain the applicant had been taken by a court of law , in accordance with relevant legal provisions . Moreover , the examination of the case showed no basis for finding that the decision had been taken on erroneous grounds and therefore was incorrect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-b"]}
