On an unspecified date ORG also issued a separate ruling noting that there was no record of the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation against his conviction . He alleged that his confessions given in DATE and DATE should have been excluded from the body of evidence for having been taken in breach of applicable procedural guarantees . In particular , those statements had been taken during the applicant \u2019s unlawful detention . He maintained that he had been held at the police station between DATE and DATE without any procedural records having been drawn up . On DATE the applicant had been released . However , almost immediately afterwards he had been arrested under the false pretext of breaching the public order and subsequently detained . This tactical move had enabled the police to question him at any time and , in the absence of a lawyer , apply pressure on him to obtain self - incriminating statements to best suit their purposes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant next stated that the above - mentioned confessions had been obtained in breach of his right to legal representation . In particular , while he had been brought to the police station specifically in connection with the suspicion that he had killed ORG , initially he had only been questioned as a witness . Furthermore , the applicant had been initially charged with simple murder under LAW , a charge which enabled a suspect to waive his right to a lawyer . In the meantime , the scope of the accusation had clearly been pointing to \u201c murder for profit \u201d . This charge fell within the ambit of LAW , which could result in a life sentence and so entailed mandatory legal representation of a defendant and allowed no waivers of this right . The investigation had purposefully delayed reclassifying the charges in order to exert unlawful pressure and extract confessions from the unrepresented applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also maintained that without his initial confessions the prosecution would have collapsed , as the other evidence had been contradictory and patchy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction and remitted the case for additional investigation . It noted , in particular , that the trial court should have verified more carefully whether the applicant \u2019s confessional statements had been admissible evidence . In particular , as appeared from the case file , these statements had been obtained during the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE . Part of this detention was covered by an administrative detention decision and part was not covered by any records . In these circumstances , the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the ulterior motives in detaining him should have been carefully investigated . ORG also found that the evidence of the applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime had been contradictory and needed to be reassessed , with various discrepancies being reconciled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ARC Court again found the applicant guilty of armed robbery and murder for profit under LAW . It relied on various pieces of physical , forensic , and witness evidence , as well as on the applicant \u2019s confessions given at the beginning of the investigation . The court concluded that there were no reasons to exclude these confessions from the body of evidence . In particular , according to the medical evidence , no injuries had been inflicted upon the applicant by the police and there was no other evidence of his ill - treatment . The court further found that on DATE the applicant had been taken to the police station in connection with the suspicion that he had committed a crime of violence and had duly been questioned first as a witness and then as a suspect . It also noted that the applicant , informed of his rights as a suspect , had voluntarily waived his right to legal representation . As at the material time the applicant had been suspected of simple murder , which could not lead to a life sentence , such a waiver had been compatible with applicable law . ORG then sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .
