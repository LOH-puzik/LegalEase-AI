The proceedings thus lasted DATE and DATE for CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance decision adopted after the last remittal allowed the customary PERCENT deduction from the value of the flat on account of the mother \u2019s statutory obligation to lodge her minor son in it , which would have reduced her debt to the ex - husband by MONEY ( ORG ) . However , the second - instance court annulled this advantage because it miscalculated the son \u2019s age , holding that he was no longer a minor . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to the latter ruling as the son in the meantime had become of age ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
