At the relevant time the applicant was a member of the teaching staff , as associate professor ( \u201c conferen\u0163iar universitar \u201d ) , of ORG ( hereafter \u201c the University \u201d ) , which is a ORG university .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant submitted many requests to the education authorities of ORG for the creation of a position of full professor in his department . He claimed that he met all the required professional criteria for occupying such a position . On DATE the rector informed the applicant that for financial and other objective reasons , a new professor position could not be created .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also a member of a non - profit organisation called ORG in GPE ( \u201c the Association \u201d ) . Its general aim was to stop the degradation of education and research standards by making known the abuses , unlawful acts and corruption in education .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a journalist , ORG , had an article published in the newspaper PERSON liber\u0103 entitled \u201c Corruption at university level \u201d . The article stated that intellectual theft and plagiarism had been noted at ORG . The journalist stated in this connection that O.A.A. had published a book , which was mostly ( PERCENT ) a copy of another book . She nonetheless enjoyed the status of university lecturer under the protection of the deputy rector , Professor N.C.I. , who was also the scientific referent of the book .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had another article published in the same newspaper , entitled \u201c University lecturer ostracised because he denounced university corruption \u201d . The article referred to the applicant , who , having noted that his disclosure about O.A.A. \u2019s plagiarism to the dean and the rector of ORG had not been followed up by any measures , had informed the press . Instead of benefiting from the protection provided by PERSON no . CARDINAL for employees who revealed infringements of the law within public authorities and institutions , the applicant had been invited to a meeting organised by the rector on DATE and asked why he had informed the press . On DATE another meeting was organised by the deputy rector and the dean of the applicant \u2019s faculty . On the pretext of redistribution of the faculty \u2019s space , they cleared the laboratory used by the applicant for research and practical activities with his students .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG organised a press conference the main topic of which was corruption at university level . CARDINAL cases of alleged corruption were presented . While other members of the ORG referred to the corruption existent in other universities , the applicant , in his capacity as secretary - general of the ORG , delivered a speech about corruption in his own university . He referred to the cases of O.A.A. , a colleague , and of the deputy rector , N.C.I. The former had published a book called ORG that according to him was mostly ( PERCENT ) a copy of another book , PERSON , published in DATE by another author . The applicant also mentioned that the book had been written under the direct supervision and guidance of GPE , who had written a eulogistic foreword to the book .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant criticised the way in which N.C.I. had managed the ORG programme concerning public funding of scientific research stations ; he alleged that N.C.I. had offered funding only to stations from which he could make personal gains .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also stated that N.C.I. was benefiting from a preferential regime because of his past as former secretary of ORG . According to the applicant , N.C.I. was occupying too many positions to be able to handle them properly : professor at several different universities ; deputy rector of ORG ; president of ORG and Vineyards ; and director of the ORG programme for public funding of research stations . He was also the head of ORG and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also stated that N.C.I. was involved in sabotaging scientific research and that in the department of LOC and PERSON led by N.C.I. there was a mafia - type organisation ( \u201c \u00eencreg\u0103tur\u0103 de tip mafiot \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Most of those statements were repeated in an article entitled \u201c Professor at ORG accused of corruption \u201d published in the DATE newspaper ORG of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE N.C.I. lodged a joint criminal and civil complaint against the applicant for defamation . He claimed that the newspaper ORG had published an article containing the applicant \u2019s views expressed at a press conference on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant adduced extensive documentary evidence before ORG . He submitted certificates from different universities at which N.C.I. had taught , the statute of the ORG , different documents concerning the ORG programme , including the composition of the management of the programme , and a few letters issued by the PERSON research station at which ORG had performed research activity . He also submitted several newspaper articles containing criticism of N.C.I. and O.A.A.", "CARDINAL . N.C.I. gave a statement before the court on DATE . He acknowledged that he was cumulatively occupying the positions of deputy rector of the University , president of ORG and ORG and director of the ORG programme for public funding of research stations . He also stated that even before the press conference the applicant had made defamatory statements about him in letters addressed to the rector of ORG , the dean of the Faculty of Oenology and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard as a witness on behalf of the applicant ORG , one of the journalists who had written articles about the alleged corruption in ORG ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . He stated that he had attended the press conference of DATE . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegation that ORG was responsible for the incorrect manner in which public money had been allocated for scientific research , the journalist pointed out that on the basis of the documents he had seen on that occasion , such as salary slips and reports , it was clear to him that discriminatory treatment had been applied to the researchers working for the research stations and ORG . The very high payments received by certain members of the ORG staff had convinced the applicant that only research stations which had accepted the teaching staff agreed by the plaintiff obtained public funding . The journalist also referred to the fact that the plaintiff was occupying several teaching positions at different universities . Lastly , the journalist stated that he had based his articles about the ORG not only on the material presented by the ORG but also on documents from other sources , which he could not reveal .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , GPE Court dismissed the criminal complaint . It held that even though the applicant could not prove the veracity of his statements , CARDINAL element of the crime of defamation was missing , namely an intent to damage the reputation of N.C.I. It also held that the applicant , convinced by the accuracy of his statements , had only intended to present a case of corruption at university level . The most relevant part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c In the instant case , the defendant did not prove the accuracy of his statements despite the fact that on DATE the court ( taking into account that the morality and legality of the education system at university level is obviously a topic of public interest , and the interest of informing the public opinion and the authorities is serious and legitimate in accordance with LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law \u2013 the case of PERSON v. GPE and the case of PERSON v. GPE ) had admitted all the evidence proposed on his behalf .", "...", "Moreover , the documents submitted by the defendant ( namely , the foreword of the book signed by the injured party ( N.C.I. ) , copies of the book covers of ORG and of the original PERSON , chapters from the CARDINAL books ) do not prove that the injured party encouraged plagiarism .", "Some resemblance in the form and contents of the CARDINAL works that could be noted by reading in parallel certain chapters can not lead to the conclusion that the injured party was liable for not denouncing plagiarism . Such a conclusion would mean that the injured party knew perfectly well the previously published book and that he had made a comparative analysis of both works , noting some inconsistencies which he ignored ...", "However , the role of that foreword ( and of any foreword in general ) is to express a point of view about a work ... and does not represent an objective and critical opinion . \u201d", "...", "\u201c Moreover , the defendant did not prove that the injured party had blackmailed the research stations ...", "The documents submitted by the defendant ( copies of the pay slips of DATE issued by the ORG research station , the records of the salaries paid by the same research station to several collaborators , and the report of an assessment performed at the research station by an authority of the Agriculture Minister on DATE ) could not lead to the conclusion that the injured party had blackmailed the ORG research station \u201d .", "...", "\u201c In addition , the defendant \u2019s allegations that the injured party obtained undeserved profit by unlawfully occupying several positions have not been proved to be true , as the injured party acknowledged that he had several sources of income by lawfully occupying several public offices .", "As regards the defendant \u2019s allegation about the sabotaging by the injured party of scientific research by damaging different types of hybrids and then selling the greenhouse in which the defendant carried out research was not proved by the adduced evidence .", "The minute ( \u201c proces - verbal \u201d ) signed by ORG and a private company proved that the latter rented a building and the adjacent greenhouse , in which no plants were cultivated ; moreover the minute was not signed by the injured party .", "Under these circumstances , after the examination of all evidence , it can not be concluded that the defendant has proved , beyond any reasonable doubt , that the aspects stated by him are true . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s intent to commit defamation , the firstinstance court stated the following :", "\u201c The court notes that the defendant \u2019s statements were made in the context of a press conference organised by ORG ( of which the defendant is secretary - general ) , the main topic of which was the corruption and unlawful acts committed at university level , it being well known that the main object of the ORG is the monitoring and disclosure of irregularities in the academic system .", "Even though the defendant \u2019s speech was shocking and exaggerated , it should be regarded as part of a topic of public interest \u2013 namely , corruption among university teaching staff \u2013 and the legislative and moral reform of the teaching system , an objective desired by the whole of society .", "It should be noted that before the press conference of DATE , the newspaper PERSON had published an article concerning the plagiarism of ORG , and the ORG had drafted a report concerning the situation of teaching in GPE . The report denounced the fact that university teachers were simultaneously teaching at several universities ( \u201c cu norm\u0103 \u00eentreag\u0103 \u201d ) and that teachers , guilty of plagiarism and scientific fraud , were maintained in their positions at universities ( a report that should have been known by the defendant in his capacity as secretary - general of the Association ) . These aspects prove that the topic had been previously published and debated in a public context .", "At the same time , another important aspect is the fact that at the conference the defendant submitted several documents , such as : time sheets ( \u201c fi\u015fe de pontaj \u201d ) , reports , the foreword written by the injured party for ORG and copies of the alleged plagiarised book ... , documents which the defendant considered as evidence of the alleged acts .", "Notwithstanding that these documents did not directly prove that the injured party had committed the acts of which he had been accused , they formed the basis of the defendant \u2019s intimate conviction that the former was guilty of committing certain irregularities .", "In this context , even though it is obvious that the honour and reputation of the injured party were objectively harmed , the court considers that this situation was the result of the speech and not an aim in itself , since the speaker had expressed his viewpoint in his capacity as a member of the ORG and not as a private person , with the intention of contributing to informing on a topic of extreme public interest , that of corruption at university level , which had already been known by the press .", "Consequently , the court considers that the defendant did not act with intent to gratuitously harm the injured party \u2019s reputation , but with the conviction that he was revealing a corruption case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court partially allowed the civil complaint , ordering the applicant to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage amounting to CARDINAL NORP lei ( PERSON ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . It held that under the applicable civil law the applicant could be held liable for even the slightest level of fault . Therefore , the applicant was ordered to pay compensation to N.C.I. for the way he had brought to the attention of journalists the information regarding his professional activity .", "The relevant passages of the decision read as follows :", "\u201c The way in which the defendant brought this information to the PERSON attention , without clear evidence , convinced them that the presented facts were plausible ( see in this respect the statements of witness ORG , as well as the articles published in the DATE newspapers ORG and ORG ) .", "Consequently , the presentation of superficial information , with a high degree of suggestibility , constitutes an illicit act .", "...", "As regards the defendant \u2019s liability , it must be emphasised that the court \u2019s finding concerning the defendant \u2019s good faith has relevance only in connection with the criminal complaint , given the fact that in order to establish civil liability it is enough for the court to find the slightest level of fault .", "It is true that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law , persons acting as whistleblowers can share information concerning topics of public interest , even if shocking and disturbing ; however , they should also take into account the protection of the reputation of others , as provided for by LAW ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Appeals on points of law lodged by the parties were allowed . By a decision delivered on DATE GPE dismissed the criminal complaint , as a direct consequence of an amendment made to LAW regarding the decriminalisation of defamation . The civil complaint was left unresolved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Professor N.C.I. , brought a separate civil action for compensation against the applicant before ORG . He claimed that certain remarks made by the applicant on DATE and other occasions had constituted an attack on his reputation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant produced extensive testimonial and documentary evidence before the court in order to demonstrate the accuracy of his statements . He adduced copies of the books ORG and Oenology , and underlined the paragraphs he said had been copied by O.A.A. He also proposed that the court hear statements from individuals working for a certain research station in order to prove that the author of the book ORG , a \u201c prot\u00e9g\u00e9e \u201d of N.C.I. , was registered as an employee and received a salary from the ORG research station , which benefited from funding granted by N.C.I. , without ever turning up to work there . He tried to prove that despite the fact that under the applicable law , a professor does not have the right to teach at CARDINAL universities , GPE was a professor at CARDINAL universities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of First Instance allowed the action and the sum of PERSON CARDINAL was awarded to N.C.I as compensation for non - pecuniary damage . It held that the applicant was liable for the way in which he had presented the above information concerning N.C.I. to journalists , who were convinced of the accuracy of his information and had published it in newspapers . The court endorsed the reasoning of ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE by copying most of the paragraphs from the latter judgment . Thus , it held among other things , that the applicant had not proved that N.C.I. had encouraged plagiarism by writing the foreword for the book The Chemistry of Wine as the role of any foreword is to express a point of view about a work and not to represent a critical opinion . The court also held that the applicant had not proved that N.C.I. had obtained undeserved profit by unlawfully occupying several positions .", "The applicant was also ordered to pay ORG \u2019s legal expenses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment . He claimed that he had submitted enough evidence to prove the accuracy of his statements about N.C.I. He pointed out that the court had turned his statement that \u201c in the department of oenology there is a mafiatype organisation ( \u201c \u00eencreg\u0103tur\u0103 de tip mafiot \u201d ) into the statement that N.C.I. \u201c is involved in a mafia - type organisation \u201d . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , upholding the judgment of the firstinstance court . The applicant was ordered to pay the N.C.I. \u2019s legal expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a decision by which it ordered the seizure of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s DATE salary up to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , representing compensation for non - pecuniary damage and the legal expenses awarded to N.C.I. by the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG lodged a criminal complaint against O.A.A. accusing her of plagiarism . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG decided not to institute criminal proceedings against O.A.A. on the grounds that the complaint had not been lodged by the aggrieved party . It noted , however , that a significant part of the CARDINAL books , ORG and PERSON , was similar .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG together with the author of the book PERSON lodged another criminal complaint against O.A.A. They also accused N.C.I. of being an accomplice to O.A.A. \u2019s plagiarism in his capacity as scientific coordinator of the book . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG discontinued the investigation on the grounds that the statutory time - limit for prosecuting the offence of plagiarism had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against the ORG \u2019s decision to decrease his salary of DATE on account of his unjustified absence from work . He claimed that the measure was illegal as timesheets for registering presence at work had not been introduced at ORG until DATE . Moreover , he adduced evidence according to which he had been at work on DATE in question . Among other aspects , he pointed out that the actual reason for sanctioning him was his conflict with the management of ORG because he had made public that the deputy rector had encouraged plagiarism .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE GPE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s complaint and ordered the ORG to pay him the amounts withdrawn from his salaries of DATE . The court held that under LAW the burden of proof lay with the applicant \u2019s employer but that it had been unable to produce any legal documents which could prove the applicant \u2019s unjustified absence from work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a decision by which it applied a disciplinary sanction to the applicant consisting in the suspension , for DATE , of his right to apply for a higher teaching position , to obtain a teaching degree or take up a management position . The reasons for the sanction were the following : ( i ) unjustified absences from several classes and teaching activities ; ( ii ) non - compliance with the teaching curriculum ; and ( iii ) contempt and ignorance of the decisions taken by the management of the faculty and of the department concerning the clearance of a space assigned for setting up a research laboratory .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision before GPE Court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the county court noted that the applicant \u2019s action remained without object as the University had decided to revoke its decision of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
