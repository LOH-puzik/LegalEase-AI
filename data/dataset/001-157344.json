However , referring to unspecified practice of the ordinary courts and to the nature of things , ORG held that it was a condition for the aggrieved party to benefit from the guarantees in question to have made the claim against a specific person and that that person could be identified no earlier than when charges were brought against him or her . ORG further referred to its previous case - law on the subject and held specifically that the aggrieved party claiming damages in the criminal proceedings only benefited from the right to a hearing within a reasonable time under LAW after a charge had been brought against a specific person . In that regard , ORG noted that the charges against A. of DATE had been quashed on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
