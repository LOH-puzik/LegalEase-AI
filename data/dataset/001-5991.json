THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in GPE in DATE . He is currently serving a life sentence in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was tried before a jury at ORG on a charge of murder . According to the prosecution case , on DATE the applicant deliberately mounted a pavement and drove his car at a pedestrian ( \u201c M. \u201d ) , striking him . PERSON died on DATE of his injuries .", "The applicant maintained that PERSON had without provocation attacked and beaten him shortly before the incident . TIME , still dazed by the attack , he was driving his car along a street and saw PERSON throw or appear to throw a brick or similar missile at his vehicle . The applicant was forced to duck down with the result that he lost control of the car . When he regained control of the car he realised that he had hit something and that the car had been damaged . The windscreen and roof pillar ( which PERSON had hit ) were badly broken . He did not stop and drove to a garage where he left the car to be repaired . He was planning to collect the car the same day . Instead , as it turned out , it was collected by the police .", "The applicant later informed his girlfriend that PERSON had gone to throw a brick at him and that he had ducked , swerved and hit PERSON telephoned the police and inquired about PERSON \u2019s condition and whether he would obtain bail . The prosecution made a formal admission that DATE after the incident the applicant \u2019s girlfriend had told a police officer that within a very short time after the incident the applicant had given her this account .", "On DATE the applicant went to a police station unaccompanied by a solicitor . He was arrested , charged with attempted murder and cautioned . He told the police that PERSON had beaten him for no reason and had thrown bricks at him . He stated repeatedly that he was sorry for what had happened and inquired about M. \u2019s condition . The prosecution accepted that the applicant made this statement to the police . The applicant did not say however that he had ducked and that the collision had been an accident . Shortly afterwards a representative of his solicitors arrived at the police station and advised the applicant to remain silent during the police interviews on the ground that there had been inadequate disclosure of the police case against the applicant . The applicant maintains that during the time he spent in custody at the police station on CARDINAL and DATE he wished to answer police questions but accepted the firm advice of his representative to remain silent .", "Before each interview the applicant was cautioned in the following terms :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court . Anything you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "On each occasion the applicant acknowledged that he understood the meaning of the caution . The applicant \u2019s solicitor was present throughout the interviews and had private consultations with him on a number of occasions .", "The applicant was asked numerous questions about the incident on CARDINAL DATE and his involvement , if any , in it . He was asked , inter alia , about the conversation he had earlier in DATE with the police officer ; his acquaintance with PERSON and the fight they had had ; the evidence of the QUANTITY eyewitnesses ; whether the collision was an accident and the applicant \u2019s earlier explanations to his girlfriend .", "The applicant refused to comment .", "On DATE the police again interviewed the applicant under caution and in the presence of his solicitor . On this occasion the applicant answered fully the questions put to him . His account of the incident was that he believed PERSON to be throwing an object at his car , he ducked , lost control of the vehicle and hit PERSON by accident . The applicant stated that he then panicked and did not stop at the scene . At CARDINAL point in the first interview the applicant said that he did not know that he had hit PERSON until told by the police in that very interview . The applicant was also asked why he had swerved towards , rather than away from , a person whom he said was threatening him with a missile .", "Since PERSON had died in the meantime the applicant \u2019s charge was changed to CARDINAL of murder .", "At the trial CARDINAL eyewitnesses gave evidence for the prosecution . Both witnesses testified that they saw the applicant \u2019s car hit PERSON and drive off without hesitating or attempting to stop . CARDINAL of the witnesses stated that he saw the car smoothly mount the pavement to the full extent possible so that it was more on the pavement than on the road . It drove straight at LOC and hit him from behind as he walking along the pavement away from it . The car \u2019s speed was a QUANTITY but it may have speeded up a little before hitting PERSON witness had seen PERSON throwing a missile at the car .", "A pathologist testified that the bruising to the deceased \u2019s calves indicated that he had been struck from behind . He also conceded that bruising was consistent with PERSON walking or \u201c turning in some way \u201d .", "In his evidence to the court , the applicant stated that he had not stopped at the scene of the incident because he had been afraid of PERSON and because he , therefore , panicked . After the collision he went to see his girlfriend and told her that he had \u201c hit \u201d PERSON after he received a telephone call there saying that PERSON was in hospital . The applicant strongly disagreed with the pathologist \u2019s evidence . He insisted that PERSON had been facing the car throwing or appearing to throw a missile . The applicant confirmed the accuracy of the conversation he had with the police officer on DATE before the interview .", "The applicant testified that he had not answered the questions put to him during the police interview on DATE because his solicitor had advised him not to .", "The applicant waived legal professional privilege and his solicitor gave evidence . The solicitor testified that in private early on DATE the applicant had given the same account of an accident as he had given to his girlfriend . The solicitor , however , advised the applicant not to answer any questions because he was not satisfied with the extent of disclosure by the police . After further disclosure , he changed this advice and the applicant answered police questions .", "The passenger who was in the applicant \u2019s car at the time of the incident testified on the applicant \u2019s behalf , supporting his account .", "Following a ruling by the trial judge on the voir dire the prosecution in their closing speech to the jury was allowed to invite the jury to draw inferences from the applicant \u2019s silence when interviewed by the police on DATE . Counsel for the prosecution indicated that :", "\u201c A proper inference to draw from his failure to say in the first formal interviews these things , is that this was not an accident at all , and that the idea of saying that it was an accident came to him later , and is designed to mislead you . \u201d", "In his summing up to the jury the trial judge directed the jury that the law permitted it to draw such inferences as appeared proper from the applicant \u2019s failure to mention at the police interview on CARDINAL and DATE the facts he subsequently relied on in his defence . He stressed however that it was not obliged to hold the applicant \u2019s failure to reply to police questions at that interview against him and that his silence could not alone amount to proof of guilt . The judge continued :", "\u201c Now , in deciding whether to draw inferences adverse to the accused ... you must have regard to a number of factors . For instance , the times of DATE when he was being interviewed ; his age and his experience of life ; his apparent mental capacity ; his state of health ... You have to bear in mind the legal advice he was given ...", "... You must , as best you can , judge the condition and capacity of this particular [ applicant ] on the particular occasion of these first formal interviews , and take into account any evidence that is before you as to his qualities , knowledge and fears , and whatever advice he was receiving at the time . \u201d", "The judge directed the jury that :", "\u201c The weight of any adverse inference which you are invited to draw in this case , may well be diminished by the evidence of things said by the [ applicant ] before the process of interviewing began and before he received his solicitor \u2019s representative \u2019s advice . Such things will be factors for you to consider in deciding what inferences , if any , should be drawn from his failure to mention these particular matters in the first round of formal interviews . \u201d", "The judge reminded the jury of what the applicant had related to his girlfriend on DATE of the incident and the similarity between that account and his subsequent account to the police on DATE . The jury was advised that this did not necessarily mean that that the account was true . The trial judge stressed that it was the same account which the applicant gave in due course to the police and at the trial . He explained that this factor undermined the prosecution \u2019s suggestion that the applicant had fabricated the account at a later stage and the invitation to the jury to draw an adverse inference from the applicant \u2019s silence during the first round of interviews .", "The judge also addressed the fact that the applicant remained silent on the advice of his legal representative . He stated :", "\u201c Now , you are entitled to draw inferences from his refusal to answer questions in the first CARDINAL interviews , but whether it is right to do so is for you to judge , and you may think ... that since the same account was apparently being given in detail before he was interviewed to [ the applicant \u2019s girlfriend ] and , it was being suggested ... before interview to [ a police officer ] and it was then given in detail on QUANTITY DATE to the police ... you may think ... that the reason why he did not say it to the police on DATE was that he was advised not to say anything by the solicitor . If that advice of the solicitor was bad advice ... you do not hold it against this [ applicant ] , and if you have any doubt about this question of whether it is right to hold the matter against the [ applicant ] , then if you have any doubt about it , you resolve any such doubt in his favour rather than against him . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant , by a unanimous verdict , was found guilty of murder . The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal against his conviction was refused by a Single Judge . The Single Judge stated :", "\u201c The [ trial judge \u2019s ] direction can not be faulted . The fact that you were advised not to say anything by your solicitor ( whether that advice was good or bad ) is not an automatic reason for forbidding a jury to draw any inference from your silence . It is merely one of the circumstances DATE a powerful one \u2013 for the jury to take into account . In fact when the [ trial judge ] came to direct the jury he practically told them not to hold your silence against you ; and in view of the fact that you had given your account of it being an accident to your solicitor and to [ your girlfriend ] before being interviewed , it is virtually inconceivable that they did . \u201d", "The applicant renewed his application for leave to appeal before ORG . In the grounds of appeal reference was made , inter alia , to the fact that the judge had erred in allowing the jury to draw inferences from the applicant \u2019s silence at the police interviews on DATE . However before ORG the applicant \u2019s counsel stated that he could not support either that ground of appeal or indeed the other grounds prepared by the applicant \u2019s trial solicitor . Mr Justice PERSON in the Court of Appeal observed that the grounds of appeal prepared by the applicant \u2019s trial solicitor would not have been sufficient to ground a successful appeal and that he was not surprised that the Single Judge had refused leave to appeal . The applicant \u2019s counsel pleaded the application for leave to appeal on the ground that the jury were not directed on the issue of provocation . On DATE , following argument on that ground alone , ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence , evidence is given that the accused \u2013", "( a ) at any time before he was charged with the offence , on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed , failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings ; or", "( b ) ... being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned , charged or informed , as the case may be , subsection ( CARDINAL ) below applies .", "CARDINAL . Where this subsection applies ...", "( c ) the court , in determining whether there is a case to answer ; and", "( d ) the court or jury , in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged , may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper .", "CARDINAL .

PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) . The relevance of these dicta to directions under section CARDINAL of the same Act was confirmed by ORG in NORP v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG guideline direction at the time of ORG consideration of the applicant \u2019s appeal provided that :", "\u201c If he failed to mention [ a fact ] ... when he was questioned , decide whether in the circumstances which existed at the time , it was a fact which he could reasonably have been expected then to mention .", "The law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to mention it at that time . You do not have to hold it against him . It is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so . Failure to mention such a fact at that time can not , on its own , prove guilt , but depending on the circumstances , you may hold that failure against him when deciding whether he is guilty , that is , take into account as some additional support for the prosecution \u2019s case . It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so . \u201d", "The dicta of Lord PERSON are as follows :", "\u201c We consider that the specimen direction is in general terms a sound guide . It may be necessary to adapt it to the particular circumstances of an individual case . But there are certain essentials which we would highlight :", "CARDINAL . The judge will have told the jury that the burden of proof remains upon the prosecution throughout and what the standard required is .", "CARDINAL . It is necessary for the judge to make clear to the jury that the defendant is entitled to remain silent . That is his right and his choice .", "CARDINAL . An inference from failure to give evidence can not on its own prove guilt . That is expressly stated in section CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , the jury must be satisfied that the prosecution have established a case to answer before drawing any inferences from silence . Of course , the judge must have thought so or the question whether the defendant was to give evidence would not have arisen . But the jury may not believe the witnesses whose evidence the judge considered sufficient to raise a prima facie case . It must therefore be made clear to them that they must find there to be a case to answer on the prosecution evidence before drawing an adverse inference from the defendant \u2019s silence .", "CARDINAL . NORP If despite any evidence relied upon to explain his silence or in the absence of any such evidence , the jury conclude the silence can only sensibly be attributed to the defendant \u2019s having no answer or none that would stand up to cross - examination , they may draw an adverse inference . \u201d", "The current specimen direction for DATE , up - dated in DATE in the light of the judgments of ORG in NORP v. ORG ( [ DATE ] Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) and in the instant case , provides :", "\u201c [ When arrested , and at the beginning of each interview ] this defendant was cautioned , he was told that he need not say anything , but that it may harm his defence if he did not mention something when questioned which he later relied on in court . Anything he did say may be given in evidence .", "The defendant as part of his defence has relied upon [ ... ] ( here specify precisely the fact(s ) to which this direction applies ) . But [ the prosecution case is ] [ he admits ] that he did not mention this [ when he was questioned before being charged with the offence ] [ when he was charged with the offence ] [ when he was officially informed that he might be prosecuted for the offence ] .", "The prosecution case is that in the circumstances , and having regard to the warning which he has been given , if this fact had been true , he could reasonably have been expected to mention it at that stage , and as he did not do so you may therefore conclude that [ it has since been invented / tailored to fit the prosecution case / he believed that it would not then stand up to scrutiny ] .", "If you are sure that he did fail to mention [ ... ] when he was [ charged ] [ questioned ] [ informed ] , it is for you decide whether in the circumstances it was something which he could reasonably have been expected to mention at that time .

It is to remind them that they must have evidence , which , in the sense of section CARDINAL inferences , may include defence evidence where called and which , when considered together with any such adverse inference as they think proper to draw , enables them to be sure both of the truth and accuracy of that evidence and , in consequence , guilt . \u201d", "The Government submitted in the ORG v. the GPE case ( judgment of DATE , no .
