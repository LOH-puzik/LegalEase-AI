SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , ORG of GPE convicted the applicant and his brother of arson and sentenced them to a term of imprisonment of DATE and DATE . The applicant lodged an appeal ( recurso de casaci\u00f3n ) to the ORG . On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . The amparo appeal to ORG was rejected on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant and his brother submitted an application to ORG complaining that their right to a fair trial had been breached by the NORP courts , namely ORG of GPE . Invoking several provisions of LAW , they complained of the judicial authorities\u2019 repeated refusal to grant bail before the trial , of the lack of competent interpreters during the interrogation by the police , that during the trial the legal aid lawyer had not defended them properly , and that his brother had been denied the right to defend himself in person .", "On DATE , ORG found GPE to be in breach of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) and CARDINAL of the LAW . In the subsequent response given to the Human Rights Committee\u2019 findings , ORG , on DATE , guaranteed the applicant the right to administrative and judicial redress by the way of domestic legal procedures and , if necessary , by means of supranational organisations .", "On DATE , the applicant instituted CARDINAL sets of proceedings . First , he claimed compensation from ORG for the defective operation of the machinery of justice under sections FAC and seq . , of FAC ( PERSON del Poder Judicial LOPJ ) . This appeal is still pending . Secondly , he lodged a judicial appeal with ORG of GPE asking for the annulment of the criminal proceedings . On DATE , ORG of GPE rejected the appeal on the ground that it had not been lodged within the specified time limit of DATE after the notification of the judgment of DATE . Invoking Article CARDINAL of LAW ( right to a fair trial ) , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the Constitutional Court rejected the amparo appeal . The ORG declared that granting compensation for the defective operation of the machinery of justice could be considered in certain circumstances as effective reparation in the case of a violation of LAW . However , when a person had been deprived of his liberty as in the present case , the grant of compensation was not the most appropriate way of remedying the infringement of fundamental rights . In these cases , the nullity appeal was not the only possibility and the applicant had at his disposal either an application for a retrial ( recurso de revisi\u00f3n ) or an application based on judicial error . The court came to the conclusion that the alleged violation could still be remedied . Consequently , it rejected the amparo appeal for non - exhaustion ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
