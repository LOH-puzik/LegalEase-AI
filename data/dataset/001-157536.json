When the applicant did not return to GPE , GPE went to GPE with a view to taking the children back to GPE . However , the applicant opposed that . The children therefore remained in GPE where the applicant enrolled the CARDINAL older children in school and the youngest child in kindergarten . ORG maintained contact with the children by talking to them over the phone and by visiting them occasionally . It would appear that the applicant and ORG eventually agreed that the children would remain in GPE but would spend holidays with their father in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after DATE , which the children spent with their father and paternal grandparents in GPE , the father refused to return them to the applicant , claiming that the children had refused to go back to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG interviewed GPE , talked to the children without his presence and carried out an on - site inspection of his home . On DATE it replied to the ORG \u2019s request . The relevant part of that reply reads as follows :", "\u201c GPE states that his actions were in accordance with the wishes of his children , who wanted to remain living with him in GPE . He justifies his current actions by the wish to afford his children a happy life . During the interview on the [ premises ] of ORG did not try to portray [ the applicant ] as a bad or irresponsible mother ... GPE verbalises the wish that in the divorce proceedings the custody of the children be awarded to him primarily because he wants the children to be happy . He states that the children wish to remain living with him . He does not want to restrict his wife \u2019s contacts with the children . ... During the conversation ORG leaves the impression of an emotionally warm person .

He has a permanent source of income ... as he has a bar on the ground floor of the house [ where he and the children live ] , where he works . [ Thus ] while working he stays [ physically ] very close to his family , which gives the children [ a sense of ] security .", "It was further established that GPE and GPE had frequently changed school and that they had started DATE by going to an elementary school in PERSON where , according to the father , they had adapted well . It is not in the children \u2019s interest to frequently change school , schoolmates and teachers . The children should have stability . Every removal of the children from their habitual environment ( family or school setting ) is stressful and leaves consequences on the children . It requires them to make additional efforts to adapt to the new environment and the school and to make new friends .", "Given that the children \u2019s mother had in the meantime lodged an application for the return of her wrongfully retained children from GPE , the ORG conducted an interview with the children on its LOC without the presence of the father . Their wish is that their parents live together , as most children in their situation do . They are aware that the parents are divorcing . They are not taking the side of [ either ] the father or the mother . PERSON and GPE understand the family situation whereas GPE is at an age when her GPE situation is still not clear to her . The children express the wish to live with their father . They see their relationship with the father as closer and [ consider that ] they are more emotionally attached [ to him ] . They like the life in the countryside , in PERSON . The life in GPE is very different from the life in PERSON . In PERSON they have more free time , and meet and play with other children of their age . The pace of life in GPE makes that impossible . Here they are very well accepted in school . They know their neighbours and other children of their age .", "In the light of the foregoing [ the ORG ] found that it would be in the children \u2019s interest to continue living with their father in PERSON . In accordance with that [ view ] the ORG has submitted the opinion of a psychologist and a social worker to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG - contentious proceedings for the return of the children were instituted on DATE , that is , on the date the ORG \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE forwarding the applicant \u2019s request under LAW to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was received at that court . ORG participated in those proceedings as an independent intervener sui generis with a view to protecting the children \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the report was received at the court .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held at TIME on DATE the applicant \u2019s representative argued that the retention of the CARDINAL children by their father in GPE had been wrongful and that they should be returned forthwith . She averred that the fact that the social welfare centre had submitted a report in the parallel civil proceedings for divorce and child custody should have no bearing in the present proceedings as LAW did not provide for exceptions from the obligation to promptly return the children . She also stated that the applicant \u2019s right to equality in the proceedings had been breached because , even though she was fluent in NORP as her parents were of NORP origin , she had not been invited by ORG to participate in the family assessment procedure leading to its report .", "CARDINAL . S.V. \u2019s representative invited the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request . She argued that the retention of the children had not been wrongful and that in any event GPE could not have forced the children to return to their mother against their wishes . In particular , the children had clearly communicated their wishes not to return to GPE to the employees of the social welfare centre and had even told their father that they would run away if returned , which suggested that the return would have caused them psychological trauma . Furthermore , while it was true that the report of the social welfare centre was prepared in the context of the parallel civil proceedings for the purposes of deciding on custody of the children , its findings , which had suggested that the children did not want to return to GPE , could not be ignored in the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The representative of ORG agreed with ORG \u2019s representative that the applicant \u2019s request should be dismissed and that the children \u2019s retention had not been wrongful . She submitted that the children had been interviewed by the employees of the centre first together and then individually , and that they had stated that they did not like the life in GPE and wanted to live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In her reply the applicant \u2019s representative stated as follows :", "\u201c ... especially the youngest child of the parties GPE , who is DATE , is very attached to her mother , and has expressed a wish to return with her to GPE . As regards the CARDINAL older children , what should primarily be taken into account , given their age , are their [ best ] interests and not just where they wish to live . In any event , this can not have an impact on the decision making in this case having regard to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing the court heard both parties . The applicant in her testimony stated that in DATE ORG had called her to tell her that he would not be returning the children to GPE because they did not want that . The applicant further testified that on that occasion she had spoken with the children over the phone and that the CARDINAL older children had told her that they indeed did not want to return to GPE , whereas the youngest child had expressed the wish to return . The applicant also stated that she had not seen her children from the time their father had retained them in GPE until DATE before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP From GPE \u2019s testimony it followed that the youngest child , GPE , was indecisive as to which parent she wanted to live with . In his own words :", "\u201c GPE is [ still ] small and at times she wants to live with her mother , and every now and then with me . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing , on DATE , ORG delivered a decision whereby it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . In so doing it relied on the report of ORG , which included the opinions of a social worker and a psychologist employed with the centre and which had been prepared for the purposes of deciding on the custody of the children in the parallel civil proceedings for divorce and child custody ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The relevant part of that decision read as follows :", "\u201c The petitioner ... maintains her request that her children be returned to GPE where they had the last domicile , that is , their habitual residence and where they went to school . The fact that the social welfare centre gave its opinion in the [ parallel ] civil proceedings for divorce [ and child custody ] is of no relevance for reaching a decision in these [ return ] proceedings because GPE , as a signatory of LAW , is bound to honour the provisions of that Convention .", "The counterparty ... in his reply opposes the [ petitioner \u2019s ] request , considering that the conditions prescribed in LAW had not been met in the present case . In particular , in order for LAW to apply , the children had to have been wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained and the right of custody had to have been breached . The law did not attribute the right of custody to the petitioner , nor had she been awarded that right by a judicial or administrative decision or an agreement equal to such decisions . Hence , the petitioner herself does not have the right of custody any more than the counterparty himself , given that the divorce proceedings , where [ the issue of ] custody is being examined , are still pending before this court .", "He also invokes LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) [ of LAW ] which provides that the court is not bound to order the return of a child if it establishes that the return would expose the child to , inter alia , psychological harm , and that it may also refuse to do so if the child objects to being returned .", "The representative of ORG in her observations considers that the present case does not concern wrongful retention of children because the ORG had , even before the petitioner submitted her request , been involved in the social anamnesis of the family [ i.e. family assessment ] . Namely , the children \u2019s father had addressed the LOC when in DATE , during a visit of the children to his parents in GPE , the spouses had separated , that is to say , when the petitioner had left [ him ] , gone to GPE , taken the children , retained them and enrolled them in a school in GPE . The father , in order to protect the interests of the children , had decided not to take certain steps [ to return them ] but had instead visited the children in GPE as much as he could . When the children DATE had come to GPE with his parents , they had not wanted to go back to GPE . The father had then sought advice from the LOC , which had advised him that he should not return the children to their mother by force . After that , he had filed for divorce , whereas the petitioner had lodged a request for the return of wrongfully retained children .", "In the proceedings conducted before ORG , the children were heard , all CARDINAL of them together and then individually , and they expressed the wish to live in GPE . Therefore , the representative of ORG considers that , in order to protect the children \u2019s interests and well - being , it is necessary to dismiss the petitioner \u2019s request as unfounded .", "...", "In these proceedings , instituted following the request of the petitioner for the return of the children , the court has to apply the Ratification of the Hague Convention ( Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ) Act .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that LAW provides that the court will refuse to order the return of a child if he or she is settled in the new environment .", "According to evidence taken , it was established that the parties married on DATE in GPE , in GPE . During the marriage , PERSON was born on DATE , GPE on DATE and GPE on DATE . The parties came with their CARDINAL children to live in GPE , in PERSON .", "In the acrimony during the [ DATE [ the petitioner ] verbalised the wish to end their life together . [ She ] left the common household and went to live in GPE . At that time the children were in GPE , visiting their paternal grandparents . Upon her arrival in GPE the petitioner immediately went to collect the children and did not allow the father to take them back to GPE , even though the children wanted to go to GPE and had to finish another school term [ there ] .", "[ In ] DATE [ DATE ] the children , together with their paternal grandparents , came to [ GPE to ] spend DATE of DATE at the seaside . After returning from the seaside , the children came to live in PERSON . According to the counterparty \u2019s statement , which the petitioner acknowledged , the CARDINAL older children had refused to return to GPE , expressing the wish to stay in PERSON .", "From the enclosed certificates of domicile issued by the [ police authorities ] it was established that all CARDINAL children have registered domicile on the territory of GPE , at the address ... in PERSON ... as of DATE . Therefore , the petitioner \u2019s arguments that the children have registered domicile only in GPE are incorrect .", "In the present case the court has not yet rendered a final decision in the [ parallel civil ] proceedings [ for divorce and child custody ] . However , that does not affect the adoption of the decision on the request for the return of the children on the basis of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction .", "It is the opinion of this court that the father did not , without the knowledge and approval of the mother , abduct the children from the living environment in which they were settled . It is to be noted that the children have previously lived in PERSON , that PERSON finished the second grade of the elementary school in PERSON where she went to school until DATE third grade , and that PERSON also attended the first grade in the school in PERSON . It therefore follows that the children were retained in the place where they previously used to live . This school year GPE and GPE are again attending the elementary school in PERSON .", "From the opinion of the psychologist at ORG it undoubtedly follows that it is not in the children \u2019s interests to change school again because they would have to re - adapt to [ new ] teachers , curriculum , schoolmates , etc . From the opinion submitted it is evident that the children have adapted to their current living environment and school setting , and that they have verbalised the wish to live with their father .", "Given all the aforementioned [ considerations ] , this court , relying on LAW paragraph CARDINAL and LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) and ( b ) of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction , refuses to order the return of the children , finding that the children have adapted without any problems to the environment in which they had previously lived and that , in the given circumstances , returning them to the mother in GPE would place them in an unfavourable position and expose them to psychological trauma , which certainly can not be to their benefit .", "It is also to be noted that the children themselves , especially the CARDINAL older children , object to being returned to GPE .", "Having regard to all the above , this court decides as [ indicated ] in the operative part . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the first - instance decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON u Vukovaru ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision , which thereby became final .
