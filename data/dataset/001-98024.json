Following the hearing , ORG , on the basis of the applicant 's confession , convicted him on DATE counts of unlawful importing and unlawful trafficking of narcotic substances , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted as mitigating factors the applicant 's confession and the fact that he had voluntarily returned from the GPE in order to stand trial . It considered that the oral hearing could probably not have taken place without his cooperation . The applicant having waived his right to appeal , the judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearing , the applicant returned to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Schleswig - Holstein Ministry of Justice for the institution of transfer proceedings under LAW . In his pleadings , the applicant 's counsel relied upon the agreement between the defence , the criminal chamber of ORG , and ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forwarded the application to the Head of ORG ( Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt ) in PERSON with a request for him to submit a report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors stated that , as a general rule , execution of sentence in the home country was not an option in such serious cases of drug trafficking . However , the special circumstances of this particular case justified lodging an application for execution assistance with the NORP ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the NORP ORG enquiring whether it would be possible for it to continue the execution of the NORP sentence directly under LAW ( a ) of the LAW between the Member GPE of ORG on ORG CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see International Treaties below ) . ORG expressed the opinion that LAW was not applicable , as the applicant was not in NORP custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG declared that in principle there was a willingness to allow the sentence to be executed in the GPE . However , in the GPE continued enforcement was allowed only in exceptional circumstances , which did not apply in the present case . ORG therefore requested its NORP counterpart to approve the conversion of the prison term imposed on the applicant , under LAW ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors to state his position . By a letter dated DATE the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors stated that he was opposed to a formal application for execution assistance because the GPE would make the execution dependent on a conversion of the sentence .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to consider a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant . According to ORG , the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies . With regard to domestic remedies , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The applicant has no right to a judicial review of the exercise of discretion in so far as the decision is based on general , in particular foreign policy , considerations ... , the evaluation of which belongs to the core area of Government . However , the judicial review of discretionary powers in respect of law enforcement remains unaffected thereby , in particular with regard to the statement made on DATE of the trial by ORG ... It can not be denied that uncertainties may remain for the person seeking justice in this connection in view of the previously disputed contestability of decisions by the authorising authority , as well as in regard to the possible legal remedies . Sufficient account is taken of the possible uncertainties with regard to the legal remedy on account of the possibility of a binding referral under section CARDINALa LAW . It is reasonable to expect the applicant to have recourse to a disputed legal remedy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , it was for the lower courts to decide which court was competent in the applicant 's case . These courts had further to consider whether the impugned act interfered with the applicant 's right to a fair trial or with the principle of protection of legitimate confidence . Notwithstanding the possibility of lodging a fresh request , the fact that the relevant time - limits for lodging appeals might in the meantime have expired did not lead to the constitutional complaint being admissible .", "CARDINAL .

The German Act on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters does not explicitly define the role of the enforcement authority in the transfer proceedings .
