It noted , inter alia , that the ORG was directly subordinate to the Minister , and that its assessments of a person \u2019s mental fitness for work at ORG were not subject to any form of review . There was therefore no guarantee that in carrying out those assessments the ORG \u2019s experts would not commit errors , abuse their powers or deprive those concerned of their rights . That was important because if the ORG \u2019s experts assessed a member of staff to be mentally unfit for work at ORG , the Minister had no discretion and was bound to dismiss him or her . Although the member of staff concerned could seek judicial review of the Minister \u2019s order , such a challenge would be futile because the assessment , which formed the basis of the Minister \u2019s order , was not amenable to judicial scrutiny . The court acknowledged that the employment of the ORG \u2019s staff touched upon national security . Nonetheless , it went on to hold that considerations relating to national security had to yield to a person \u2019s right under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to judicial review of all administrative decisions affecting his or her rights . The court said that the assessment of a person \u2019s mental fitness for work at ORG should be amenable to \u201c the same control for lawfulness , [ namely ] by several independent experts and by the court , as in the case of assessing health conditions [ for the purpose of granting disability benefits ] \u201d . Therefore , in as much as it provided that ORG was the only body authorised to assess mental fitness for work at ORG , regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ran counter to section DATE CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and LAW . It was in addition contrary to the purpose of the law .", "CARDINAL . Following the delivery of that judgment , a panel of ORG held that , as a result of the partial strikedown of regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , the ORG \u2019s assessments could , even if predating the strike - down , be subjected to judicial scrutiny in proceedings for judicial review of a dismissal order ( see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , V \u043e. ) .", "CARDINAL . However , other panels of the court abided by the old caselaw , holding that the lawfulness of dismissals which preceded the entry into force of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was to be judged by reference to the wording of regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) before its partial strikedown because the strikedown did not have retroactive effect ( see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 \u0421-CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432 ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 QUANTITY DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , V \u043e. ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0439 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ; \u2116 \u042fCARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , PERSON , V \u043e. ; and \u2116 \u042fCARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441\u0432 ) .
