The applicant appealed immediately to ORG , which , giving judgment on DATE in Mr ORG \u2019s presence , upheld the lower court \u2019s guilty verdict .

A registry official allegedly took down his address and the case references , so as to be able to send him CARDINAL in return for a MONEY fiscal stamp .", "The Government maintain that there were CARDINAL possibilities : either the applicant had not requested a copy and could not therefore be surprised at not receiving one ; or he had in fact asked for CARDINAL , in which case a copy had undoubtedly been sent to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal file reached the registry of ORG .
