During the proceedings , the applicant asked the court to examine GPE , who , according to official information from ORG , had left the respondent ORG in DATE . The court \u2019s attempts to secure his presence at the trial were to no avail since his whereabouts remained unknown despite PERSON \u2019s statements on DATE and DATE that he had been in contact with him and knew where he was living .

However , it found that none of the witnesses examined had corroborated the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal lodged by the applicant and remitted the case for fresh examination .

On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination , which , as noted in the judgment , was to be held before a different panel of first - instance court judges . The court found that the lower court had again not established the facts regarding the applicant \u2019s injuries . The available medical evidence confirmed that the injuries described in the medical reports issued soon after the alleged incident on DATE had not resulted from the car accident in DATE . The first - instance court had merely referred to the witness statements without assessing their probative value in connection with the medical evidence . It had given no weight to the medical evidence , which should have been analysed in relation to what time the applicant had sought medical assistance . The court instructed the lower court to reassess the evidence , organise a confrontation between the applicant and the defendant , and take other steps to establish the origin of the applicant \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings and at the request of ORG , on DATE PERSON supplemented the expert opinion regarding the applicant \u2019s broken nose , saying that it could not be ruled out that he had suffered it in the traffic accident in DATE . This was so since broken noses healed slowly and remained X - ray detectable for a long time . He further stated that with a nasal injury such as that described in the medical certificate issued by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , bruising should appear DATE TIME after being struck . The medical certificate did not indicate that there had been any bruising on the applicant \u2019s face when he had been examined at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Dr L.D.B. confirmed that she had indicated in the medical certificate everything she had considered relevant regarding the applicant \u2019s injury .

During the proceedings the court made attempts through ORG to secure GPE \u2019s attendance at the trial . However , his whereabouts remained unknown despite the fact that the applicant stated that he had been in contact with him and that he had agreed to testify in the GPE or PERSON courts due to fear . The court did not accept that GPE had given evidence in these courts .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court did not admit in evidence ORG written statement of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) finding that it had not been given in court and could not serve as the basis for a court judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted PERSON due to lack of evidence that he had committed the imputed crimes . The court confirmed that the police , including the accused , had been involved in the inspection at the bakery . The applicant , after being called by GPE , had arrived at the bakery at TIME on DATE . At Resen police station , the accused had joined police officers PERSON and PERSON , who had interviewed Z.C. Soon after , the applicant had arrived at the office even though he had not been officially summoned . The court also established that there had been a discussion between the accused and the applicant about the newspaper . After the discussion , the applicant had complained to police officer GPE that he had been hit by a police inspector , alleging that a stain on his shirt had been blood from his nose . The applicant had no visible facial injuries . ORG of First Instance further indicated that after the applicant had left the police station at TIME , he had taken part in a fight with unknown individuals at an unknown place , and at TIME he had asked for medical assistance at ORG . Dr GPE had examined him , noting in the medical certificate that the injuries had been sustained in a fight . The applicant had further convinced GPE to charge PERSON before the ORG . As to the latter \u2019s special report , the court stated :", "\u201c ... besides the statements of the complainants , accused and witnesses , it does not contain any indication that [ the ORG ] established anything relevant for these proceedings , [ including ] any responsibility on the part of the accused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relying on medical evidence and statements by PERSON and GPE , the court established that at TIME on DATE , when the applicant had first been examined at ORG , he had had swelling on his nose , but no bruising . As specified in the medical certificate issued by PERSON , the injuries had been sustained in a fight . Given the statements the witnesses and PERSON had given in the investigation , the court concluded that there had been no evidence to support the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . It concluded that the lower court , notwithstanding that it had admitted considerable evidence , \u201c had established incomplete and wrong facts \u201d and \u201c had drawn illogical and unreasonable conclusions \u201d . In this connection , the court stated :", "\u201c The court observes , as already noted in its judgment of DATE , that the first - instance court disregarded the medical [ records ] ... and adduced evidence as to whether there was any colouring to [ the applicant \u2019s ] injury . During the proceedings , an attempt was made to relate [ the applicant \u2019s ] injury to a traffic accident in DATE [ in which ] he had sustained injuries and worn a neck collar for longer . This is no longer argued in the impugned judgment , but it is alleged that [ the applicant \u2019s ] injury was sustained in a fight he had taken part in before asking PERSON for medical assistance . It is unclear on what basis the first - instance court had drawn this conclusion ...", "The first - instance court now also did not sufficiently assess GPE \u2019s statement ... in which he clearly said that he had noticed a blood stain on [ the applicant \u2019s ] shirt . In the impugned judgment , this witness \u2019s statement is changed so that justification was given for the conclusion that [ the applicant ] did not sustain such an injury ... the first - instance court , in principle , accepts that [ the applicant \u2019s ] injury was not a result of actions taken by the accused , but ... was sustained in a fight with unidentified persons at an unknown location immediately before the [ medical ] examination .", "...", "In such circumstances , the first - instance court finds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] injury was caused later than the interview that took place at GPE police station ...", "... there is no evidence that after the interview [ at the police station the applicant ] went somewhere , took part in a fight with unidentified individuals and sustained injuries before asking the doctor for a medical check - up . The reasons the first - instance court gives in support of its judgment are unclear and , to a considerable extent , contradictory and inconsistent with the evidence admitted ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In this latter connection , the court found that the prosecution had become time - barred . As regards the charges of ill - treatment the court found , for the same reasons as in the previous judgment , that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant \u2019s injury to his nose had been caused by PERSON On the contrary , all the available material suggested that it had been sustained in a fight that had taken place immediately before the applicant had asked for medical assistance at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and remitted the case to the first - instance court for fresh examination , which , as noted in the judgment , was to be held before a different panel of judges . The court stated that :", "\u201c ... the conclusion of the first - instance court was in serious doubt and the established facts were not supported by the evidence admitted ... the first - instance court again disregarded the instructions of ORG specified in the [ previous ] judgments .
