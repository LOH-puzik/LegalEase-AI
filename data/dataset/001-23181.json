{"ITEMID": "001-23181", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "PEREIRA v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in FAC GPE . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , solicitors practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , PERSON died as a result of severe burns sustained during an incident in a street on TIME DATE , when he was sprayed with a form of accelerant and the back of his clothing set alight .", "As a result of their investigation , the police arrested and charged in GPE CARDINAL men , the applicant , PERSON and PERSON . A fourth man implicated in the incident , PERSON , had gone to GPE . He was arrested and tried in GPE and convicted of manslaughter .", "The trial in GPE took place in DATE . The prosecution case was that the applicant and PERSON had set ORG on fire while GPE had assisted by acting , inter alia , as lookout and that PERSON had committed subsequent acts intended to pervert the course of justice ( namely , by covering up the evidence of the incident ) . In the case of the applicant , the prosecution relied on the evidence of witnesses who said that he confessed his involvement to them ; on covert tape recordings of conversations between him and his co - accused ; and on the lies which he had told the police . As regarded GPE , the prosecution relied on his own account that he had watched the applicant and PERSON carry out the attack , making no attempt to leave and doing nothing to prevent what happened . Afterwards he had taken ORG personal stereo . In his case too , the prosecution relied on the covert recordings and the lies he told .", "Before the trial , the applicant applied for severance of the trial so that he would not be tried with his CARDINAL co - defendants . He considered that a joint trial would prejudice his defence such that a fair trial would not be possible . This was because both his co - defendants had made statements implicating him in the attack . In particular , GPE in his statement to the police had stated that the applicant and PERSON were not only present but had set fire to the victim . According to the rules of evidence , this statement was evidence against GPE but not the applicant . However although the judge would be bound to direct the jury to that effect , the jury would still hear GPE \u2019s version of events . It was also unlikely that GPE , who had a history of mental disorder , would give evidence and be available to be cross - examined . At the same time , the applicant applied under section CARDINAL of ORG for the evidence from the covert tapes to be excluded as inadmissible and also relied on the prejudice to his defence from the taped conversations from GPE implicating him .", "The judge rejected the applicant \u2019s application for severance . He took the firm view that this was a case which called strongly for a single trial . He recognised that there was a danger of prejudice in that ruling but pointed out that there was a joint charge of murder and that it would be difficult to have a fair trial of all the accusations if done separately .", "\u201c In this case if tried separately , it is possible that PERSON could be acquitted of murder , and GPE , whose case is that PERSON had carried out the killing , could be convicted . It is also possible that there could be inconsistent verdicts on the individual counts of doing acts tending to and intended to pervert the course of justice .", "In the circumstances , although there is some prejudice to all CARDINAL defendants if each is tried with the others , in my judgment , there are no exceptional circumstances which make it necessary for me to order severance . Balancing all the factors for and against severance , I conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a joint trial of the defendants ... \u201d", "The judge also refused to exclude the covert tapes as evidence .", "During the trial , neither of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants chose to give evidence . The applicant did go into the witness box .", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced DATE to life imprisonment . Constantinou was convicted of manslaughter and a count of perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for manslaughter .", "The applicant applied for permission to appeal , on the grounds inter alia that the judge had wrongly refused to order a separate trial . Permission to appeal was refused by a single judge of ORG . He renewed his application . At a hearing held on DATE , ORG considered as regarded the judge \u2019s decision to try all the defendants together :", "\u201c That was a judgment", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] said to us that the exceptional circumstances were the absence of significant evidence against his client , in terms of there being no eye witnesses , no forensic evidence and the dubious nature ... of the persons to whom the confessions had actually been made .", "It was not , however , the case that there was no other evidence at all against his client , nor , in our judgment , is it right to say that the jury would necessarily have concentrated on inadmissible evidence in order to understand the case . This was very much a matter for the judge \u2019s judgment . ORG will not interfere with his ruling in this case .", "The judge was , of course , in making that ruling , acutely conscious of the need to direct the jury in the clearest possible terms as to what evidence was admissible and what was not in the case of each man . He said :", "\u2018 ... what Mr Constantinou may have said to PERSON and PERSON to Mr GPE in the absence of PERSON is not evidence against PERSON , and if there are other occasions vice versa as far as PERSON is concerned .", "The same applies to what Mr Constantinou may have said to PERSON about PERSON PERSON in Mr PERSON \u2019s absence , or what Mr PERSON may have said about Mr PERSON or PERSON in the absence of one or other of them .", "It is desperately important that you bear that in mind at all times and of course it is important because you are going to be considering , as I have already told you , the cases entirely separately in relation to each.\u2019", "The judge was entitled to assume , and this ORG will assume , that the jury understood and acted on a direction that was singled out by the judge as being \u2018 desperately important\u2019 as part of their work . That safeguard is and was the proper safeguard for the various defendants . It is the appropriate safeguard in a case such as this . \u201d", "ORG went on to find that the judge had not erred in admitting the evidence of the covert tapes . They rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments that ORG statement to the police should not have been admitted in evidence as it was entirely self - serving and that the jury \u2019s verdicts were inconsistent ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
