The right of any person , whether NORP or alien , to be present at proceedings before a court , was not related to the question of permission to stay . The applicant , in her recourse , had linked the CARDINAL , but the need for her to be present at the trial before ORG would be regulated by the requirements of the trial and not according to a general obligation of the Republic to grant her permission to stay in the Republic for the duration of the trial , as she asserted .", "CARDINAL .
