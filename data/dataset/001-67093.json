{"ITEMID": "001-67093", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU;ITA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CALABRO v. ITALY and GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , born in DATE and currently detained in FAC . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in flagrante delicto by the GPE police for importing a large quantity ( approximately QUANTITY ) of cocaine .", "According to the police report , the drugs had been imported into GPE by an \u201c infiltrator \u201d called PERSON ( \u201c J\u00fcrgen \u201d ) as part of a joint operation by the NORP and NORP police . On DATE PERSON had stayed at FAC in GPE , which was under close police surveillance . On DATE he had telephoned X , a drug trafficker living in GPE ( GPE ) who was interested in buying drugs ; PERSON said that he had discussed the subject with the applicant . On DATE X had informed PERSON that the applicant was now in GPE . The applicant had subsequently attended ORG , contacted PERSON and asked him whether he had the \u201c merchandise \u201d ( roba , an expression often used in criminal circles to refer to hard drugs ) . On being told that he had , the applicant had gone up to ORG \u2019s room where he was shown a suitcase containing QUANTITY of cocaine . He had made a gesture of approval and had immediately been arrested . The scene was recorded with audiovisual devices . Subsequently , X had telephoned ORG and pressed for news of the applicant .", "By an order of DATE the LOC investigating judge ruled that the applicant \u2019s arrest was lawful and ordered his detention pending trial .", "On DATE the applicant was committed for trial by ORG on charges of international drug trafficking .", "The trial began on DATE . Numerous witnesses , including officers from the NORP police and the NORP federal police ( Bundeskriminalamt \u2013 \u201c the BKA \u201d ) gave evidence . They provided details of the nature of the police operation that had led to the applicant \u2019s arrest and of the procedures used .", "On DATE ORG , which considered it \u201c absolutely necessary \u201d to hear PERSON \u2019s version of the events , issued a request for evidence on commission in which it asked the NORP authorities to take evidence from PERSON in GPE . The request was transmitted to ORG in GPE . In a memorandum dated DATE the GPE district judge informed ORG that , according to information received from the BKA , it had not proved possible to find PERSON , despite numerous attempts . He had gone on holiday on DATE and had not been in touch since .", "On DATE , in view of the fact that PERSON could not be located and that the defence had waived its right to have him examined , ORG withdrew its request of CARDINAL DATE for evidence on commission . At the applicant \u2019s request , it decided to place in the case file certain statements made by ORG in connected criminal proceedings pending in GPE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( ITL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "It relied in its decision on the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest ( which had been confirmed by an audiovisual recording ) , the transcripts of telephone conversations PERSON had had with X and other people implicated in drug trafficking , and statements by the NORP police and the BKA . That evidence showed that NORP drug traffickers had asked PERSON , who was well known in drug - trafficking circles , whether he knew anyone who would be interested in buying cocaine . CARDINAL NORP nationals , GPE , Y and the applicant , had contacted PERSON to express their interest , while X and the applicant had subsequently given him money .", "ORG did not consider it necessary to examine whether , as an undercover agent , PERSON was liable to prosecution under NORP law . His statements had not been made in GPE , but in connection with the proceedings in GPE and , under the laws of that country , he was immune from prosecution . Furthermore , most of his statements concerned his links with the NORP police and were not relevant to the applicant \u2019s case . The only document that was of relevance was one in which J\u00fcrgen had described his dealings with X and the applicant in order to reach an agreement for the sale of the cocaine and to make arrangements for delivery . In view of the fact that the NORP authorities said that PERSON could not be found , his statements had henceforth to be regarded as \u201c unrepeatable \u201d ( irripetibili ) and , consequently , admissible in evidence on the merits of the charges against the applicant . His statements corroborated and confirmed other prosecution evidence against the applicant .", "In sentencing the applicant , ORG noted in particular that he had previous convictions ( albeit for less serious offences ) and that other criminal proceedings were pending against him . It also noted that it was apparent from the nature of the offence that he was active in drug - trafficking circles .", "Both the prosecution and the applicant appealed .", "The applicant submitted , inter alia , that the operation mounted by the police for the simulated sale of drugs was illegal . He argued that while the relevant NORP legislation ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ) authorised operations for the simulated purchase and controlled delivery of drugs in exceptional cases , under no circumstances did it permit the fictitious sale of drugs . In his submission , PERSON and the other police officers who took part in the case should have been examined as co - defendants , not witnesses . The fact that they had not been examined in that capacity meant that their statements should have been excluded . Furthermore , as the true identity of PERSON had not been duly disclosed , admitting his statements in evidence infringed the fundamental principles of the NORP legal system .", "Lastly , the applicant argued that he should have been acquitted under LAW of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , as , had it not been for the actions of J\u00fcrgen and other police officers , the alleged offence would not have been committed .", "On DATE ORG , which considered it \u201c absolutely necessary \u201d for PERSON to give oral testimony , issued a request for evidence on commission in which it asked the NORP authorities to hear PERSON and to ensure that he was assisted by a lawyer .", "ORG arranged for a hearing on DATE for evidence to be taken from J\u00fcrgen in accordance with the relevant provisions of NORP law . It indicated that the NORP judges , a representative from the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the applicant \u2019s lawyers were entitled to attend .", "However , on DATE the BKA informed ORG that PERSON \u2019s whereabouts remained unknown . The hearing on DATE was cancelled . On DATE the applicant , finding the BKA uncooperative , applied for an order requiring PERSON to appear before the NORP judicial authorities .", "The President of ORG granted his application on DATE , ordering PERSON to appear on DATE and inviting him to instruct a lawyer of his choice . The order was forwarded to the NORP authorities , who were requested to serve it on J\u00fcrgen in accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . They were advised that PERSON could remain anonymous .", "ORG did not attend the hearing on DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG increased the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "It noted , firstly , that it was possible under LAW for a witness \u2019s identity not to be disclosed in the record if the witness was in danger . In such cases , the papers certifying the witness \u2019s identity were retained by the public prosecutor \u2019s office . It further found that there could be no doubt as to ORG \u2019s identity , as the case file showed that , on being questioned on DATE by the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , he had produced a passport in the name of PERSON and stated that he had been working as a secret agent for the BKA and the NORP police for DATE . Lastly , several witnesses had said that he was the man responsible for the operation for importing cocaine into LOC .", "ORG also said that , although it had made several attempts to obtain oral testimony from PERSON , this had proved impossible . Accordingly , by virtue of LAW of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , his statements to the NORP authorities could be placed in the court file and relied on by the court when deciding the case .", "As to PERSON \u2019s status in the NORP proceedings , ORG observed that undercover agents were only entitled to immunity if their role in the criminal conduct concerned was \u201c indirect and peripheral \u201d , that is to say limited to surveillance and observing the actions of third parties . In the case before it , since PERSON had played an active role in bringing the cocaine from LOC to GPE and from there to GPE , he should have been treated as a co - defendant in the NORP proceedings . The fact that he had not been meant that his statements could only be relied on to the extent that they did not disclose matters for which he could be held criminally liable . The admissible part of his statements had shed light on the dynamics of the police operation that had led to the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s objection under LAW , ORG noted that that provision precluded the imposition of a penalty on persons whose acts were wholly incapable of producing dangerous or harmful consequences . Moreover , the intervention of an undercover agent had no effect on a defendant \u2019s acts if the defendant already had an intention to commit the offence . ORG said that in the case before it the applicant had taken various preparatory steps : he had asked PERSON to transport QUANTITY of cocaine , paid him sums of money , remained in touch with him and attended the rendezvous for the delivery of the drugs .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . He relied mainly on the same grounds of appeal , but also pointed out that PERSON \u2019s identity had not been established with certainty , and argued that his statements were therefore inadmissible ab initio .", "In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG held that ORG had dealt with all the issues logically and correctly and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "As regards the alleged violation of LAW , it noted that an agreement over the arrangements for the sale of the cocaine had already been made in GPE and that the applicant had decided to perform that agreement of his own free will .", "LAW ORG sets out the cases in which records of evidence obtained in other criminal proceedings may be placed in the case file ( and therefore be used in evidence on the merits of the charges ) . Paragraph CARDINAL of that provision lays down , inter alia , that \u201c depositions which ... can not be repeated \u201d may in all cases be placed in the case file . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the provisions on execution of the ORG provides : \u201c depositions which can not be repeated obtained by a foreign police force may be placed in the court file , either with the parties\u2019 agreement or after the maker of the deposition has been heard ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Criminal Code prohibits punishment being imposed for acts or omissions which , by their nature or owing to the absence of a subject matter , are incapable of producing dangerous or harmful consequences ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
