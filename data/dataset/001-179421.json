On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife , PERSON , gave birth to a son , PERSON On DATE I. gave birth to another son , PERSON The family lived in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and I. divorced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took the children away from their home in PERSON and brought them to the town of GPE in GPE NORP Region where his mother lived . He did not obtain I. \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant applied to ORG of Nizhniy Novgorod Region for a residence order under which ORG and ORG would live with him in GPE . On DATE I. lodged a counterclaim , asking for a residence order under which the children would live with her in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant returned the children to their mother in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE experts appointed by the court issued their report . They found that the applicant was self - confident , domineering and inclined to lie . He was emotionally stable but , at the same time , easily carried away and fickle in his interests , which could mean that he would not always wish to take care of his children . The applicant strived to spend a lot of time with the children and was against punishing them . I. was seen to be impulsive , anxious , diffident and emotionally unstable . Her intellectual capacities were low . Her manner of upbringing was erratic : she vacillated between excessive demands and punishments and insufficient demands and punishments . Her manner of upbringing could be detrimental to the children \u2019s psychological development . The children were anxious and stressed . N. had a closer emotional connection with his father than with his mother . As regards PERSON , any situations involving his mother were stressful to him because they were associated with excessive demands and punishments .", "CARDINAL . NORP The childcare authority issued an opinion that the children should reside with their mother . The mother had better living conditions . The children attended school ( N. ) , a nursery school ( PERSON ) and various extracurricular activities at her place of residence in PERSON . PERSON took good care of the children and did not prevent them from seeing their father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted audio recordings of his conversations with his children . A psychologist , who had analysed those recordings , stated in court that the parents were both uncooperative and were both equally responsible for the stress from which ORG and ORG suffered . The audio recordings submitted by the applicant showed that he had tried to manipulate the children into saying that they wanted to live with him . In her opinion , the children had a stronger attachment to the mother . It was preferable that they lived with her in PERSON where the living conditions were more comfortable and where they had constantly lived since their birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted ORG application for a residence order in her favour and dismissed a similar application by the applicant . The court doubted the authenticity of an employment certificate from a private company submitted by the applicant . Given that he had not produced any official documents confirming his employment , the court found that he had not proved that he had a permanent income . There was no evidence that the applicant had supported his children financially during the period since his separation from ORG in DATE until DATE , when the children had been living with their mother . He had started to pay child maintenance only after he had lodged his application for a residence order in DATE . The applicant had moreover asked that the children \u2019s residence be fixed at his mother \u2019s address , which showed that he did not have any intention of taking care of them personally . It was clear from the audio recordings submitted by the applicant , as analysed by a psychologist , that the applicant had attempted to manipulate the children and to force them to make a choice between the parents . He was therefore willing to reach his aims by any means , even at the price of making his children suffer . He had moreover taken the children away from their home in PERSON and brought them to his mother \u2019s residence in GPE without ORG consent . According to witness statements , PERSON had always taken good care of the children . It was PERSON who had always accompanied them to school and extracurricular activities . The fact that she had a partial disability had never so far prevented her from raising them and caring for them . The fact that the applicant \u2019s living conditions were better was insufficient in itself for making a residence order in his favour . Nor was the court convinced by the applicant \u2019s assertion that the children had a stronger attachment to him than to their mother . The children had always lived with their mother , except for DATE during DATE when they had stayed with him at his mother \u2019s residence in GPE . There was no evidence that PERSON had shouted or excessively punished the children . Although the experts had indeed found her manner of upbringing to be erratic , their report did not mention that she could cause detriment to their psychological development . Moreover , it was evident from the audio recordings that it was the applicant who had tried to turn the children against their mother . The childcare authorities had also considered that it was in the children \u2019s interest to live with the mother . Given that PERSON had never prevented the applicant from seeing the children , the applicant would be able to visit them as often as he liked , while the children would continue living in the environment familiar to them .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Nizhniy ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified . The applicant \u2019s cassation appeal was rejected by a judge of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant applied to ORG of PERSON for a reconsideration of the children \u2019s residence arrangements . He asked for a residence order under which ORG and ORG would live with him in PERSON . He submitted , in particular , that the children wished to live with him . He had been picking them up from school almost every day lately and bringing them back to PERSON only to sleep . I. shouted at the children , slapped them and humiliated them . She did not work and lived on social benefits and child maintenance . In the alternative , he asked for a contact order , claiming that NORP occasionally prevented him from seeing the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE N. and ORG were assessed by a psychologist who found that their psychological state was good . They were resigned to their GPE divorce and no longer experienced any negative emotions in that connection . Their relationship with their mother was friendly and supportive . They considered her as family , while their father was considered to be a friend who came regularly to play with them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the childcare authority issued its opinion on the case . It found that both parents had satisfactory living conditions . N. had expressed a wish to live with the applicant . The childcare authority considered that it was desirable to perform a psychological expert examination of the children to assess their attachment to each parent . However , ORG objected to any assessment of her children by a psychologist . The childcare authorities had however learned that she had secretly seen a psychologist . The children had told the psychologist that they wished to live with their father . However , given that the children had not yet reached an age at which they were able to form their own opinions on the matter , as they were still highly impressionable and changeable , the childcare authority considered that it was possible for the children to continue living with their mother . The applicant should be able to have regular contact with the children for CARDINAL weekends per month .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for a residence order and maintained the residence order in favour of I. It found it established that NORP was unemployed and that the applicant had a permanent job . The living conditions of both parents were satisfactory . The court took note of the expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , observing that the experts had found that the parent - child relationships were complicated in the applicant \u2019s family . The expert report did not however contain an explicit finding that the children were attached to their father more than to their mother . The applicant had not proved that PERSON had shouted at the children , humiliated them or neglected her parental responsibilities . Evidence showed that she was taking good care of the children . There was therefore no reason to change the children \u2019s residence arrangements established by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that ORG and ORG were entitled to maintain contact with their father and his paternal family and determined the contact schedule as follows . The applicant was to be able to have contact with the children DATE from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE at the applicant \u2019s place of residence , with the mother \u2019s prior agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . A cassation appeal by the applicant was rejected by a judge of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new application for a residence order in his favour with ORG . He submitted that PERSON currently lived with him and did not want to return to his mother who shouted at him and physically punished him . Both PERSON and ORG had stated many times that they wanted to live with him . He devoted a lot of time to the children by picking them up after school , bringing them for walks and educating them . He had a comfortable and stable income and good living conditions . By contrast , ORG did not work and did not have any income except social payments and the child maintenance payments that she received from the applicant . It was therefore the applicant who maintained the children financially . The applicant further relied on the expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) from which it was apparent that the children had a stronger attachment to their father than to their mother , that any situations involving their mother were stressful for them and that the mother \u2019s methods of upbringing were detrimental to the children \u2019s psychological development . The applicant submitted audio recordings of many conversations he had had with the children DATE and DATE . The children invariably stated that they wanted to live with the applicant , complained that their mother shouted at them and whipped them with a belt , and protested , crying , that they did not want to return living with her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the childcare authority issued its opinion on the case . It found that ORG had indeed lived with the applicant during his ( PERSON \u2019s ) illness from DATE to DATE . He had however then returned to his mother . The children also stayed with the applicant on DATE . The applicant always accompanied PERSON to nursery school and ORG to extracurricular activities . He paid child maintenance without delay and regularly gave additional financial support to the children . The applicant and ORG were attending mediation sessions . The applicant was in permanent employment and had a high stable income . PERSON was partly disabled and did not work . Her mother and grandmother helped her in raising the children . According to I. , the children were very attached to their father , spoke to him over the telephone every day and spent their holidays with him . The childcare authority concluded that the children were attached to both parents , that PERSON was taking good care of their health and development and that their living conditions were comfortable . It was therefore possible for the children to continue living with their mother .", "CARDINAL . A representative of the childcare authority stated at the hearing that she had followed the family for some time . She had the impression that the children were equally attached to both parents and both parents took equally good care of them . Recently she noted positive changes in the highly conflictive relationship between the parents . In particular , the mother allowed the father to spend more time with the children than before . The father picked up the children from school and they spent DATE and part of their holidays with him . She considered that there was no reason to change the children \u2019s residence arrangements and recommended that the children should continue living with their mother .", "CARDINAL . I. stated that she loved her children and took good care of them . She also alleged that the applicant \u2019s motives for asking for a residence order in his favour were mercenary as he wanted to use the flat that belonged to the children . She therefore asked that the residence order previously granted to her be maintained .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s neighbour stated that she often saw the applicant walking and playing with the children . She thought that he was a very good father and that the children loved him . In DATE I. had come to the applicant \u2019s flat in the middle of the night on CARDINAL occasions . She had shouted , had threatened to break the windows and to take the children away from the applicant by force . The neighbours had had to call the police , who took PERSON away .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the applicant \u2019s request to play the audio recordings submitted by him on CARDINAL October CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the judge stated that it was not necessary because the other party had not contested them . The applicant \u2019s written description of those audio recordings had been examined at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also asked that a copy of the expert report of DATE be admitted as evidence . Both PERSON and the childcare authority objected , arguing that the expert examination had been made DATE before and was therefore out of date . The court rejected the application , finding that the expert report had been analysed by the courts which had issued previous residence orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered an expert psychological examination of the children to assess their relationship with both parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert found that it was not possible to make an expert report because ORG had refused to come to the examination or to bring the children . The court considered that it was not necessary to reiterate the order for an expert examination as there was sufficient material for making a decision on the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for a residence order in his favour . The court found no circumstances warranting the change of the residence arrangements established in the residence orders of DATE and DATE . It had no reason to doubt that NORP loved her children and took good care of them . The applicant \u2019s allegations that PERSON \u2019s manner of upbringing were detrimental to the children \u2019s development had not been confirmed by the evidence in the case . The criminal proceedings on charges of fraud against her had been discontinued . Her living conditions were satisfactory . The fact that she had no employment or income did not justify granting a residence order to the applicant . She did not prevent the applicant from seeing the children as much as he liked . As indicated in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the expert report of DATE did not contain an explicit finding that the children were more attached to their father than to their mother . The childcare authorities had found that the children had been equally attached to both parents . There were therefore no reasons to issue a residence order in favour of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified . In particular , it held that the applicant had not proved that there had been sufficient reasons to change the residence arrangements established by the earlier residence orders . No exceptional circumstances warranting the children \u2019s separation from their mother had been established . It had not been proved that the children had had an exceptionally strong attachment to the father or wished to live with him and him only . In such circumstances , and taking into account the children \u2019s age , their established way of life , the satisfactory living conditions of both parents and the opinion of the childcare authorities\u2019 on the case , the decision to maintain the residence order in favour of the mother was in the best interests of the children . ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had not assessed the family situation with sufficient thoroughness because it had not questioned the children and had refused to admit the expert report of DATE as evidence . ORG held that , given that the children were under DATE , their opinion on the residence issue could not be taken into account . As regards the expert report of DATE , it had been made in the framework of separate proceedings and had been already assessed by the courts in those proceedings . ORG considered that the expert opinion was not necessary because the evidence included in the case file was already sufficient to adjudicate the dispute .", "CARDINAL . A cassation appeal by the applicant was rejected by a judge of ORG of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON authorised , against the applicant \u2019s will , a trip abroad for the children for DATE . On DATE the children left for GPE with their mother . They returned to GPE on DATE . The decision of CARDINAL December CARDINAL was later annulled by ORG because it found that it had no territorial jurisdiction over the case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON applied to ORG of PERSON for a judicial authorisation for the children to travel to GPE during the approaching school summer holidays , complaining that the applicant had refused to give such an authorisation . The applicant submitted in reply that if the children left for DATE he would not be able to see them for DATE . He also submitted that there was a risk that the children might not return from GPE . He asked for an interim measure prohibiting the children from leaving GPE pending the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for interim measures , finding that the application of interim measures requested would amount to a prejudgement of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the children \u2019s trip abroad for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . The court found it established that NORP intended to travel to GPE together with ORG and PERSON during the DATE . She had received an accommodation guarantee from her new partner \u2019s sister , who lived permanently in GPE . The applicant had however refused to give ORG and ORG an authorisation to travel without giving reasons . The court found that the parents could not exercise parental rights to the detriment of their children \u2019s rights . In particular , the children \u2019s right to travel could not be made dependant on the GPE willingness to authorise their going abroad , especially in the case of a disagreement between the parents . The court considered that the children \u2019s trip abroad would not breach the applicant \u2019s rights and would encourage the children \u2019s development , education and broad - mindedness .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted that under domestic law if a child left GPE accompanied by one of the parents an authorisation from the other parent was not required ; such authorisation was required only if the child went abroad unaccompanied by the parents . A judicial travel authorisation could be given only if one of the parents had formally objected to the child \u2019s going abroad ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Given that the applicant had never lodged such an objection in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law , the judicial travel authorisation had been unlawful and unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE I. married her partner , a national of GPE . She then left for GPE with ORG and ORG In DATE she gave birth to a child . N. and V. are now living in GPE with their mother , her new husband and their CARDINAL - brother .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an additional appeal , submitting that although the decision of DATE had not yet become enforceable , ORG had been able to leave with the children for GPE . That fact had clearly demonstrated that a judicial authorisation was not required for leaving GPE . It had however been used by PERSON to obtain a NORP visa for the children , which she could not have otherwise obtained without his agreement . The applicant also complained that the children had not returned to GPE by DATE , although the judicial authorisation had been valid only until that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE on appeal . ORG held that it had been lawful , well reasoned and justified . In particular , it found that the applicant had not submitted to ORG any evidence showing that the trip abroad would have been contrary to the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiffs service opened , at the applicant \u2019s request , enforcement proceedings in respect of the contact order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained about the bailiffs\u2019 inaction to ORG . On DATE ORG rejected his complaint , finding that the bailiffs had taken measures to enforce the contact order but enforcement had been impossible through no fault of the bailiffs service , specifically because NORP and the children had been living in GPE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal . Cassation appeals by the applicant were rejected by a judge of ORG on DATE and then by a judge of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the bailiffs asked ORG for a suspension of the enforcement proceedings on the grounds that ORG and the children were abroad and it was therefore impossible to take any coercive measures against her . On DATE ORG rejected the bailiffs\u2019 request , finding that the children \u2019s residence abroad was not a sufficient reason to suspend the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted numerous requests to various NORP authorities , including in DATE to ORG and Science of GPE , for assistance in recovering his children and in enforcing the contact order of DATE . In DATE he complained of the authorities\u2019 inaction to ORG . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint , finding that those authorities had no competence in the matter . The only authority competent to assist him in re - establishing contact with his children was the bailiffs service . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in DATE the bailiffs service advised the applicant to apply for recognition and enforcement of the contact order to the competent NORP authorities , via ORG and Science of the Russian Federation , in accordance with ORG on LAW ORG , Enforcement and Co - operation in ORG for ORG . There is no evidence that the applicant used that procedure .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON applied to ORG for a residence order under which ORG and ORG would live with her in GPE . The applicant lodged a counterclaim , asking for a residence order under which the children would live with him in PERSON . He also asked for an interim order to return the children to GPE and to ensure that until their return the children communicated with him via VOIP calls TIME , DATE and DATE at TIME ( GPE time ) . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s application for an interim order , finding that he had not proved that the failure to take interim measures might complicate or make impossible the execution of the forthcoming judgment . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal .
