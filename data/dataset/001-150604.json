ORG has furthermore considered that it is not a matter of interpretation of the judgment of the court which imposes the ORG order if , on the basis of the judicial finding of facts , the qualification and the reasons given for the imposition of the penalty or measure , it is self - evident that the crime in issue is such as referred to in LAW .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the aforementioned judgment of ORG of GPE is partly incorrect . ORG considers , first and foremost , that it is the court which imposes the ORG order that decides whether or not this order is limited in duration . ORG furthermore considers that it will be relatively simple to establish whether the order has been imposed in connection with a crime of violence if the court which imposed the ORG order , in giving reasons for so doing , has stated that the measure was imposed in relation to a crime of violence . If such explicit reasoning is missing , this does not mean that the measure can not be extended , if this means that the ORG will last longer than DATE . What is important is whether the ORG order has been imposed for a crime of violence .

In so doing the court that decides on the request for extension has to take into account all relevant circumstances ; in addition , information besides that mentioned in the final judgment can also be taken into account . In the case of a threat the court that decides on the request for extension can take into consideration whether the threat was preceded , accompanied or followed by non - verbal aggressive behaviour towards the threatened person , or was in any ( other ) way reinforced , and also whether it was plausible at the relevant time that the threat would be carried out .

ORG notes that the [ Van der GPE judgment ] concerned a case in which the court which imposed the ORG order ( opleggingsrechter ) had not expressed a view on the question whether the indictable offence in issue had been one directed against , or endangering , the physical integrity of CARDINAL or more persons ( referred to hereafter , for the sake of brevity , as a \u2018 crime of ORG ) , and in which the court which had initially decided on the request for extension of that measure ( verlengingsrechter ) had found that the crime in issue was not a crime of violence in that sense . It was only the court which was called upon on appeal to consider the extension of the ORG order which came to a different conclusion and found the criminal act in connection with which the measure had been imposed to be a crime of violence .", "ORG understands this decision of ORG , in which the interest of legal certainty is stressed where it concerns deprivation of liberty , in the sense that the conditions which must be met for a deprivation of liberty to be considered \u2018 lawful\u2019/\u2019r\u00e9guli\u00e8re\u2019 within the meaning of LAW must be clearly circumscribed and that the way in which they are applied must be reasonably foreseeable . This means , in cases such as the present , that the view taken by the court which imposes the ORG order concerning the question whether the ORG order is imposed in connection with a crime of violence is decisive for the question whether the measure is amenable to extension by the court which decides on extension of the measure , as provided for by Articles GPE and FAC of LAW . It is thus the court which imposes the ORG order which decides DATE in brief \u2013 whether the ORG order imposed by it is limited in duration or not .", "CARDINAL . It will , as a rule , be relatively simple to establish that decision if the court which imposed the ORG order , in giving reasons for so doing \u2013 preferably in the words of LAW , has stated that the measure was imposed in relation to a crime of violence , or not as the case may be . That is of particular importance if the crime in relation to which the ORG order was imposed can not without further explanation be characterised as a crime of violence \u2013 i.e. as an indictable offence that was directed against , or endangered , the physical integrity of CARDINAL or more persons DATE as in the case of threatening ( bedreiging , LAW of LAW ) , or stalking ( belaging , LAW ) , in relation to which the measure here in issue can be imposed pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The sole fact that the sentencing court in its reasoning has not stated in so many words that the ORG order was imposed in connection with a crime of violence does not entail that the measure can no longer be extended if its total duration exceeds a period of DATE . The only condition set by LAW for the extension of the ORG order is that the measure be imposed in connection with a crime of violence . Whether such is the case can also be deduced from the other content of the final judgment of the sentencing court DATE whether it be read in context or not \u2013 such as the conviction , the evidence relied on , the qualification , the reasoning of the rejection of any defences put forward and the reasoning of the sanction or sanctions imposed . If , on that basis , it is evident that the crime is one of violence , then at the very least it can not be said that the possibility of extension of the measure beyond DATE was not foreseeable for the person subject to the ORG order .", "CARDINAL . The opinion of ORG that , except in cases as referred to above , it is not for the court that decides on the extension of the measure to determine retroactively \u2018 by interpretation of the judgment of the court which imposed the TBS order\u2019 whether or not the ORG order was imposed in relation to a crime of violence is not , however , borne out by the said judgment of ORG and moreover can not be accepted as correct . There is no rule of law that prevents the court which decides on the extension of the ORG order from coming to the conclusion , based also on other information than that contained in the final judgment [ of the trial court ] \u2013 such as the proceedings of the hearing of the court which imposed the ORG order , as apparent from the official record made of that hearing DATE that the ORG order was imposed in relation to a crime of violence ; it can not , moreover , be ruled out that other documents available to the court which imposed the ORG order are conclusive on this point .", "CARDINAL . Consultation of these documents will be indicated especially if the final judgment does not contain sufficiently clear reasoning as referred to in LAW or otherwise does not give sufficient pointers ( aanknopingspunten ) to conclude that the fact for which the ORG order was imposed must be characterised ipso facto as a crime of violence , like the threat of lethal violence held proven in the instant case . In such a situation the court that decides on the extension of the ORG order will have to arrive at a conclusion as to whether \u2013 in view of all the facts and circumstances that were known at DATE the threat constituted such a crime of violence . In this connection , it is worth noting that DATE contrary to the point of departure that seems to have been chosen by ORG \u2013 the court which decides on the extension of the ORG order must take into consideration all relevant circumstances . In so doing it will be in a position to consider , among other things , whether the threat was preceded , accompanied , or followed by non - verbal aggressive behaviour against the person threatened or in some ( other ) way reinforced , and whether at the time it was likely that the threat might be carried out .", "There is no rule of law that prevents the court which decides on the extension of the ORG order from considering the finding that the crime in issue was CARDINAL of violence implicit in the final judgment of the court which imposed the ORG order .", "In this way , it can be avoided that in those cases in which the court which imposed the ORG order failed to provide adequate clarity , either as prescribed by LAW procedure or in some other way , as to whether the ORG order was limited in duration , this oversight ( verzuim ) by itself should prevent the measure from being extended , even if it is clear to all concerned that the ORG order was imposed for a crime of violence and it therefore merely concerns an oversight by the court which imposed the ORG order . What is decisive in cases such as the present is that the finding of the court which decides on the extension of the ORG order that the ORG order was at the time imposed in relation to an indictable offence that was directed against , or endangered , the physical integrity of CARDINAL or more persons should be reasonably foreseeable and therefore should not come as a surprise to the person on whom the order was imposed . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
