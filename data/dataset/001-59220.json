The applicant is an NORP citizen , residing in GPE . At the relevant time she was a member of ORG ( PERSON ) , which also acts as ORG ( Landtag ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of a session of ORG , the applicant , in her function as member of ORG , gave a speech . The debate related to the granting of subsidies by the municipality to an association which assists parents whose children had become involved in sects . In this context the applicant made the following statement :", "\u201c Like everyone else , I know that DATE a sect no longer means a small group that breaks away from a big church ... , but a psycho - sect .", "These psycho - sects also exist in GPE . They have common features . CARDINAL aspect they have in common is their totalitarian character . Moreover , in their ideology , they show fascist tendencies and often have hierarchical structures . In general , a person who gets involved with such a sect loses his identity and submits to the group ... \u201d", "After having commented on the activities of an association she considered a sect , the applicant continued as follows :", "\u201c ... the sect ORG [ ORG der PERSON \u2013 Institute for a Better Understanding of Human Psychology ] , which has not long been in existence in GPE but which has existed for DATE in GPE , where it is called the FAC [ Verein zur F\u00f6rderung der PERSON for a Better Understanding of Human Psychology ] has had a certain influence on the drugs policy of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then stated that ORG had issued a publication on drugs policy in cooperation with the ORG , and had organised information activities involving public discussions together with the ORG . The applicant then requested a resolution by ORG that , before granting subsidies to an association , the question whether that association was a sect should be examined .", "CARDINAL . The debate in ORG then turned to the drugs policy and the applicant , in a further speech , criticised the cooperation between ORG and the ORG , and made further statements on the nature and activities of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , an association established under NORP law , and the VPM , an association established under NORP law , filed a civil - law action under LAW against the applicant with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) . The associations requested the court to issue an injunction against the applicant prohibiting her from repeating the statement that the ORG was a sect , ordering her to retract this statement and directing the publication of the applicant \u2019s retraction in several NORP newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commented on the action . She submitted that the term \u201c sect \u201d used by her was a value judgment and not a statement of fact . It had been used in the context of a political debate . If the court , however , was of the opinion that the term \u201c sect \u201d was a statement of fact , she was willing to prove that this statement was true , and proposed documentary evidence and the hearing of witnesses to confirm that the plaintiffs were sects . As documentary evidence , the applicant proposed a decision by a NORP court and CARDINAL articles from newspapers and periodicals on the internal structure and activities of the plaintiffs . She proposed that CARDINAL witnesses be heard . She also requested that the court obtain an expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG and the VPM altered their injunction claim to include the following statement made by the applicant on DATE :", "\u201c CARDINAL aspect they have in common is their totalitarian character . Moreover , in their ideology , they show fascist tendencies and often have hierarchical structures . In general , a person who gets involved with such a sect loses his identity and submits to the group ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant confirmed that she had received the plaintiffs\u2019 amended claim . She submitted a transcript of the session of ORG of DATE , and argued that the modification of the action merely referred to a general explanation of the term \u201c psycho - sect \u201d and had no direct relation to the plaintiffs . She further referred to her previous statements and the evidence proposed therein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG . The court accepted several documents submitted by the parties , closed the taking of evidence and rejected all requests for the taking of other evidence as irrelevant because the documents submitted had clarified the issues sufficiently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the injunction . It ordered the applicant not to repeat her statements that the ORG and the FAC were sects of a totalitarian character . Furthermore , the court ordered the applicant to retract these statements , the retraction to be published in several newspapers . ORG found that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s opinion , her statements were not value judgments , but statements of fact . Having regard to the statutes of the associations and other evidence before it , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s statements had proved to be untrue . The applicant had disseminated unfounded assumptions as proven fact and had therefore acted negligently . As the damage to the plaintiff associations\u2019 earnings and livelihood was manifest , the ORG granted the requested injunction under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . She submitted that ORG had failed to take the evidence requested by her . She contended in particular that the real activities of the plaintiffs and their ( totalitarian ) methods could not be seen from their statutes . In particular , the internal organisational structure ( hierarchical structure ) , their conduct against critics ( exhibiting a totalitarian character and an ideology with fascist features ) and the effect on the personality of the persons concerned ( loss of identity and submission to the group ) should have been examined . Only a report by an expert using sociological and psychological methods , or interviews with the persons affected , could have clarified these issues . In any event , the applicant \u2019s statements were value judgments made in the context of a political debate and not statements of fact . The injunction therefore violated her right to freedom of expression under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) upheld ORG decision in so far as it concerned the prohibition on repetition , but quashed the order for a retraction and its publication .", "CARDINAL . It confirmed ORG view that the applicant \u2019s allegations were statements of fact . Contrary to the opinion of ORG , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s allegations amounted to an insult and fell not only within the scope of the second but also within the scope of the first paragraph of LAW . In that case , the applicant had to prove the truth of her allegations .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had refused to take the evidence she had proposed in order to prove that the plaintiffs were sects , ORG found that such evidence was irrelevant to the proceedings . According to ORG legal point of view , the applicant \u2019s statements had to be seen as a whole . Thus , the use of the term \u201c sect \u201d was not decisive , but the allegation of fascist tendencies was of primary importance . This latter statement amounted to an insult going beyond justified criticism . Since the applicant had not offered any evidence with regard to this definition of a psycho - sect , but only with regard to the question whether the plaintiffs were sects , she had failed to prove its truth , as required by LAW . ORG also found that the request for a retraction of the statement and its publication in several newspapers had to be dismissed because the plaintiffs had failed to specify the addressees of the retraction , even though the applicant \u2019s statements had been reported in the newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected as inadmissible the applicant \u2019s further appeal on points of law ( Revision ) . It confirmed , however , that the statements such as \u201c fascist tendencies \u201d or \u201c totalitarian character \u201d were statements of fact which the applicant had failed to prove . Referring to its previous case - law , it stated that disparagement by means of untrue statements , even though it was made in the course of a political debate , went beyond acceptable political criticism and could not be justified by a weighing of interests or by the right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Everyone who has suffered material damage or loss of profit because of an insult may claim compensation .", "( CARDINAL ) The same applies if anyone disseminates statements of fact which jeopardise another person \u2019s credit , income or livelihood and if the untruth of the statement was known or must have been known to him . In such a case the public retraction of the statement may also be requested ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Members of ORG enjoy a limited parliamentary immunity . They are exempt from legal proceedings for anything said by them in the course of debates in ORG in so far as ORG sits as ORG CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ) . However , this privilege does not extend to sessions of ORG sitting as the local council . The reason is that GPE , under LAW , has a dual function , being at the same time a Land and a local council ( LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
