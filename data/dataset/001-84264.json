The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant to discharge the debt of USD MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) in favour of another private individual . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld this judgment in cassation and it became binding .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant filed with ORG a request for the supervisory review of the final judgment of DATE , seeking the re - opening of the case . On CARDINAL DATE the Vice - President of ORG dismissed that request as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , annulling the system of supervisory review , entered into force . Pursuant to its LAW , supervisory proceedings which had not been finalised before the entry into force of that Code were to be maintained by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant requested ORG to resume examination of her supervisory review request on the basis of LAW ORG . On DATE ORG replied that her request was manifestly ill - founded , insofar as the relevant supervisory proceedings had been terminated on DATE , i.e. prior to the ORG 's entry into force .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought another court action , requesting that ORG be ordered , as \u201c an administrative organ \u201d , to resume the supervisory proceedings under LAW ORG . This action was dismissed as unsubstantiated several times and , lastly , on DATE by ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant refused to discharge the judgment debt of CARDINAL DATE , enforcement proceedings were initiated against her . Subsequently , an enforcement officer attached the applicant 's house , located at CARDINAL FAC in GPE ( \u201c the house \u201d ) , which was put up for public auction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the auction was held but no buyer appeared . In the course of the rescheduled auction on DATE , the house was initially offered for the price of GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , this amount corresponding to its market value according to an auditor 's report of DATE . However , as no bids were made , the enforcement officer started decreasing the price and , ultimately , the creditor , being the sole bidder , purchased the house for GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . On DATE the certificate confirming the creditor 's property title to the house was issued and ORG amended accordingly .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant continued living in the house , the creditor brought a court action for her eviction . On DATE the Zestafoni ORG allowed the action on the basis of both parties ' written and oral submissions . The court found it established that the creditor had acquired ownership of the house through the public auction of DATE . It reasoned that , insofar as the applicant had never challenged the lawfulness of that auction in separate proceedings , the house was to be vacated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal . She claimed to have been discharging the judgment debt in instalments and complained that the forced sale of her house had therefore been unjustified . She also contended that the house had been her husband 's registered property and that the enforcement officer had no competence to conduct the auction .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG , after having heard both parties ' oral pleadings , dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE . It reiterated the lower court 's findings that the applicant had never disputed the results of the public auction and that the creditor had acquired ownership of the house in good faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation claim , reiterating her previous appeal arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's cassation claim admissible and dispensed with an oral hearing on the merits under LAW of the ORG . By the same decision , the applicant was exempted , as an indigent person , from the court fees for cassation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent its decision of DATE to the parties ; the creditor was also served with a copy of the applicant 's cassation claim . The PERSON postal services notified ORG on DATE that this decision had been delivered to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the creditor submitted comments in reply . Those were not transmitted to the applicant . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's cassation claim . It found , in the light of the case materials , that the applicant had been the owner of the disputed house before the public auction . It reasoned that , since the results of the auction had never been the subject of an examination by the lower courts , either in separate proceedings or by way of a counter - claim within the same proceedings , the applicant was absolved from raising certain arguments for the first time before the cassation court . However , as no \u201c additional and well - founded cassation argument \u201d ( sakasacio pretenzia ) had been made , the findings of the lower courts concerning the binding on the cassation court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE , ORG did not take into account the arguments contained in the respondent 's submissions of DATE ; it solely addressed the issues raised in the applicant 's cassation claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent this last decision to the parties . According to the applicant , she never received that dispatch ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to stay the cassation proceedings , in view of the fact that the supervisory proceedings were pending ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In a letter of DATE , ORG replied that its decision of DATE , dismissing her cassation claim , was final and that no appeal lay against it . This letter was delivered to the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the letter of CARDINAL DATE enclosed ORG decision of DATE , and that was how she learned first about the termination of the eviction proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , along with other persons , lodged a constitutional claim with ORG , requesting the annulment of LAW of the ORG for being unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined this claim . As the vote of the sitting judges was tied , the claim , pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW , was dismissed ( for more details , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Articles DATE prescribed the procedure for serving court summons on a party to the proceedings .

They could consult the case file and make extracts from or take copies of all the materials therein .", "Pursuant to LAW , only the lawfulness of an appellate decision could be challenged in a cassation claim . The disputed decision could be found to be unlawful if the appellate court had wrongly applied or interpreted legislative provisions .", "Pursuant to LAW , which regulated the time - limit for lodging a cassation claim , appellate decisions were considered to be delivered when handed to a party in court or communicated under the procedure envisaged by Articles DATE .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( f ) required the appellant to mention in his or her cassation claim those facts which supported the alleged breaches of procedural law if the cassation claim was challenging not only substantive but also procedural legal provisions .", "According to LAW , unless LAW , which contained special rules for cassation proceedings , stated otherwise , the provisions regulating appellate proceedings should equally apply in cassation .", "Chapter PERSON did not contain any provisions overruling or contradicting Articles DATE and CARDINAL .", "Article CARDINAL stated that a copy of the cassation claim with all the supporting documents should be forwarded to the adversary .
