SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr ORG , is a NORP national of NORP origin , who was born in DATE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE but continued immediately to GPE where he was stopped at the border . He applied for asylum but was sent back to GPE in accordance with ORG . He then applied for asylum in GPE .", "The applicant claimed that he is an intelligence officer at ORG of GPE and that he has taken part in the hostilities between NORP and NORP forces , including the NORP defence of the city of PERSON . He stated that he had sent several letters to President PERSON and other NORP politicians , protesting against the war and calling the President , inter alia , a bandit and a criminal . He left GPE to escape from the NORP security police which , allegedly , had threatened his life and was searching for him . During DATE , he had been arrested by the NORP police and detained in a psychiatric clinic for DATE . Also , on CARDINAL occasion , the flat where he lived had been under fire .

ORG considered that the letters in question could have given the NORP security police occasion to check the applicant , maybe even to keep him under surveillance . However , no further interest from the security police could be expected . ORG concluded that neither the nature of the applicant \u2019s activities , his possible encounters with the security police nor the possible future trial and sentence under ordinary NORP law for statements made in the letters could be considered as grounds for asylum .", "On DATE the ORG indicated to the respondent Government , under LAW , that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to expel the applicant to GPE pending clarification of the facts submitted by the applicant .", "DATE the ORG was informed by ORG that the applicant , on DATE , had returned to GPE voluntarily .", "Following the ORG \u2019s request for certain factual information , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG , the respondent Government submitted that the applicant had voluntarily attended a meeting with ORG on DATE to discuss his return to GPE . As the applicant expressed hesitation about the return , it was decided that he was to be accompanied to the airport on DATE of departure by CARDINAL officials from ORG .
