The applicants , Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) , PERSON PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) and Mr PERSON ( \u201c the third applicant \u201d ) , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE respectively . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . s , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants arrived in GPE on unknown dates . The first and second applicants subsequently claimed asylum on the ground that they had previously been detained and tortured by the NORP authorities and feared being subjected to similar treatment if they returned . The second applicant was granted asylum in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the first applicant \u2019s request for asylum was pending , an NORP court issued NORP Arrest Warrant ( \u201c EAW \u201d ) in respect of the applicants , under a ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , seeking their surrender to GPE . They were accused of membership of a criminal organisation for the purposes of terrorism . They were subsequently arrested in the GPE pursuant to the EAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , the Prosecutor to GPE stated :", "\u201c If the GPE judicial authority agrees to extradite [ Mr PERSON ] to GPE , [ Mr PERSON ] will not be extradited to another state without the consent of GPE . The only purpose of this extradition request is to secure the surrender of [ Mr PERSON ] to GPE to stand trial for the offence alleged against him . I can confirm categorically that his extradition is not sought for the purpose of deporting him to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE an extradition hearing took place at GPE ORG . It was accepted in the proceedings that if the applicants were returned to GPE there would be a real risk of a breach of their LAW , following this ORG \u2019s ruling in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE . The question was whether there were substantial grounds to believe that GPE would extradite , expel or deport the applicants to GPE . The judge explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I propose to deal very shortly with any further onward extradition request , or an order of expulsion from GPE that might be linked to a sentence of imprisonment following conviction ... [ T]here are recognised routes of appeal that are available to a person subject to an extradition request ( by GPE should there ever be one ) or an expulsion order ( to GPE ) to enable the highest court in GPE to make a determination as to whether or not , if such an order were allowed to proceed , the defendant \u2019s LAW rights would be prejudiced . That is , there is effective judicial oversight , with guaranteed rights of appeal , available to any defendant who might feel aggrieved by an order for his removal from GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge considered the provisions of the NORP \u201c LAW \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) which governed deportation from GPE at the relevant time . He observed that notwithstanding the apparent inability under that law for a person whose expulsion had been ordered to obtain a stay of execution pending an appeal , expert evidence presented to the court had suggested that it was in practice possible to obtain a stay from ORG . However , he accepted that there was potential for a person to be deported before being able to persuade a court to suspend the process . He accordingly found that LAW failed to provide the necessary guarantees required by LAW . However , he noted that Mr PERSON was not deported prior to this Court \u2019s hearing in PERSON , cited above , nor had he been deported since . While some evidence from NORP lawyers showed a reluctance to accept that NORP courts were bound to ensure that the rulings they made were in accordance with the LAW , the judge rejected that aspect of their evidence . He observed that the lawyers had \u201c a low opinion of the competence and integrity of the NORP judiciary \u201d which he did not share , referring to the expert evidence submitted by the judicial authority which sought the ORG extradition . He therefore concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( CARDINAL ) Since DATE there will have been many people in the NORP civil service giving anxious consideration to the decision in PERSON v GPE , all trying to devise a solution to the \u2018 dilemma\u2019 .", "( CARDINAL ) It is highly likely new provisions will shortly be in place , and that would make this whole discussion , based as it is on the NORP law , somewhat academic .", "( CARDINAL ) I am not surprised the Minister of ORG has declined to give an undertaking that the NORP law will not be applied to any of these QUANTITY men . There are many reasons why it might not be appropriate to offer such a guarantee . The lack of it does not suggest that , if extradited , the NORP law would be applied to them .", "( CARDINAL ) I consider it unlikely , unless and until the circumstances allow it , the Minister of the ORG would make a deportation against any of these CARDINAL men requiring their return to GPE .", "( CARDINAL ) ... I am confident , given all the activity these defendants have generated with the authorities in GPE and their situation being now so \u2018 high PERSON that they would have no difficulty accessing the NORP courts , should they wish to challenge any deportation order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He found no reason to suppose that any future deportation proceedings would not be in accordance with the LAW and the PERSON judgement . He did not consider that evidence of what had undoubtedly happened in the past was evidence that such an approach would be repeated in future , since PERSON would \u201c cause the NORP authorities to rethink its approach to this issue . \u201d The judge therefore held that there were no substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would be expelled from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . He added that LAW on LAW was based on mutual trust and confidence between ORG Member GPE and that he was confident that the NORP authorities could be relied upon not to act contrary to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to a ORG . They argued that , if returned to GPE , there was a real risk of their onward transmission to GPE , in breach of LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , while the case was pending before ORG , an expulsion order was made by the NORP authorities against Mr PERSON , ordering that he be expelled to GPE . He was then removed to GPE , despite Rule CARDINAL having been applied by ORG on DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . The applicants brought the matter to the attention of ORG as evidence of the inadequacy of judicial safeguards in the NORP deportation procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in the applicants\u2019 case . Lord PERSON , delivering the judgment of the court , noted first that the applicants accepted that the EAW was a genuine exercise of the power conferred under the relevant Framework Decision with a view to bringing criminal proceedings against the applicants in GPE . It was not a device to achieve deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Pill LJ examined in some detail a number of reports concerning the procedures in place in GPE , including a DATE report by ORG Human Rights Commissioner and a DATE report by ORG . He considered carefully the submissions of the applicants and those of the judicial authority . He accepted that the DATE assurance by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) covered all CARDINAL applicants . For essentially the same reasons as LOC , he did not consider the absence of an assurance that GPE would not seek to deport the applicants as an indication that it did not intend to fulfil its legal obligations .", "CARDINAL . Pill LJ concluded that a real risk of expulsion to GPE had not been established in the cases . He explained :", "\u201c DATE . ... It is relevant that the extradition to GPE will be effected under LAW ... The NORP authorities are under LAW duties in any event , but the ORG Directive adds an additional dimension . It requires cooperation between judicial authorities on the basis of trust and a high level of confidence ...", "CARDINAL ... [ F]or better or worse we have committed ourselves to this system . Under LAW , we can assume that the trust placed in the NORP authorities will be justified . ORG provides a safeguard and a disincentive to the NORP authorities , as with the authorities of any Member ORG , not to act in breach of LAW . LAW [ on ORG ] provides for sanctions against GPE failing to comply with the basic principles of LAW . Bilateral trust also arises . This is bilateral action premised on the existence of a high degree of confidence . Courts in a returning state would be likely to have a real sense of grievance , having regard to the contents of LAW , if a receiving state subsequently ignored its duty under LAW . The NORP government had not hitherto deported in an LAW case a person received under LAW and had not deported in the case of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He also noted that when the NORP authorities received a person under LAW , the entire judiciary was likely to be alerted to its duties under LAW , which he said was \u201c certainly so \u201d in the LOC cases . He was not prepared to disagree with the District Judge \u2019s assessment of the witnesses or his rejection of ORG low opinion of the NORP judiciary . He continued :", "\u201c DATE . It is disturbing if the evidence before the court is DATE and the court has to take it at face value DATE that the NORP executive in the case of [ PERSON ] have apparently disregarded an interim direction of the ECtHR . I can not regard that act , or the statement of a representative of ORG which is claimed also to have been made , as destroying the trust and confidence which is to be assumed in the context described . I am not prepared to hold , on the basis of a single post - PERSON case , that the NORP ORG will in the present cases ignore its duties under LAW as confirmed in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the risk of further deportation by the NORP authorities , he added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The risk on return has to be assessed on present evidence , and there is no risk of deportation while the contemplated criminal proceedings and any resulting custodial sentence are extant . That being so , any risk is , to that extent , remote from the current situation .", "CARDINAL The District Judge \u2019s optimism about NORP legislation has not yet been justified by events in the post - election period . There are , however , clear limits , in my view , to the extent to which a court assessing current risk should speculate as to events in the long term or even medium term future ... Circumstances can change . The remoteness factor ... adds weight to a conclusion that the appellants have not established a real risk of being deported to GPE within the meaning of the authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An application for a certificate of a point of law of general public importance was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicants made an application to ORG for habeas corpus to reopen their appeals , based on fresh evidence . The fresh evidence in question largely consisted of documents in the proceedings before ORG in respect of Mr PERSON . The applicants contended that the documents revealed an attitude on the part of the NORP authorities which was prepared to deport suspected terrorists irrespective of LAW risks , particularly where diplomatic assurances had been obtained from the receiving ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application was refused . Lord Justice PERSON , with whom Lord Justice PERSON agreed , considered that the new evidence did not provided a reliable guide to GPE \u2019s future conduct ; that there had still been CARDINAL instance of GPE deporting a person in breach of interim measures or LAW since the PERSON judgment ; that there was no evidence of any willingness to deport a person who had been extradited under an EAW so the mutual trust and confidence remained intact ; and that nothing in the fresh evidence undermined the previous finding that the applicants were genuinely wanted for trial in GPE , which made any risk of further deportation remote in any case .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently refused to grant permission to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicants made a request to ORG for interim measures pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent their extradition to GPE . The request was refused by ORG DATE . The letter to the applicants explained :", "\u201c The ORG found that it would be open to your clients to make an application against GPE , including an application under LAW , if it appeared that they would be surrendered from GPE in breach of their rights under the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG was informed of the ORG \u2019s decision in the following terms :", "\u201c I write to inform you that on DATE the above applicants lodged a request for interim measures under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent their extradition from GPE to GPE . They argued that if extradited , they would be at real risk of onward removal to GPE where they would be subjected to ill - treatment contrary to LAW . They relied on ORG recent ruling in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE , ECHR DATE ... and further relied on the fact that in the domestic proceedings in their case , both ORG and ORG accepted that LAW of DATE ( \u2018 the NORP Law\u2019 ) failed to provide the necessary guarantees that are required by LAW . Finally , they relied on your Government \u2019s decision to remove Mr PERSON to GPE despite ORG Rule CARDINAL indication in his case .", "On DATE the Fourth Section decided to refuse their request . The decision to do so was based on the express understanding that GPE as a ORG would abide by its obligations under LAW , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW and in particular the obligation to respect the terms of any interim measure which the ORG might indicate in respect of GPE at the request of the applicants . The ORG also expressed its confidence that your Government would comply with their obligations under LAW of DATE ( on the NORP arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member GPE ) and in particular their obligation under LAW not to extradite to a third ORG a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a NORP Arrest Warrant without the consent of the competent authority of the Member ORG which surrendered the person . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
