On DATE the FAC ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) decided to detain him on remand . The court relied on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the aforementioned offences . It attached particular importance to the likelihood that a severe sentence of imprisonment would be imposed on him and to the risk that he would attempt to obstruct the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s appeal , lodged against the detention order , was dismissed by the second - instance court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently extended by the Wroc\u0142aw - \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Court on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE , by ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , as well as by ORG on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL May and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The courts justified their decisions by the particularly high risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding abroad or otherwise obstructing the course of the proceedings and by the severity of the anticipated penalty . They also had regard to the nature of the offences with which he had been charged and considered that , given the applicant \u2019s personality , a release on bail would not sufficiently secure the proper course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE a bill of indictment against the applicant and another person was lodged with PERSON ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) .

The applicant \u2019s appeals against these CARDINAL decisions were dismissed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , by ORG ( PERSON ) . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the same court granted further extensions of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "The courts relied on the likelihood that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant , given that he had been sentenced at firstinstance to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . They considered that there was therefore a risk that the applicant might obstruct the proceedings by absconding . In establishing the existence of this risk they referred to the applicant \u2019s knowledge of foreign languages and to the fact that he had previously travelled abroad . They also stressed the particularly drastic nature of the offences in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the prosecutor lodged appeals against the firstinstance judgment .", "CARDINAL .
