De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He entered GPE on DATE and applied for political asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , counsel appointed the applicant made written submissions to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) in which he developed the grounds for the applicant \u2019s request for political asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral interview with the applicant in the presence of his counsel and an interpreter . The applicant handed over a declaration of DATE from a pastor in GPE certifying that the applicant had been a member of his congregation since DATE and had been baptised . ORG official therefore started the interview by asking about that matter . The applicant replied that it was a private matter \u201c in [ his ] heart \u201d , adding : \u201c It has nothing to do with this but if you want to ask questions you may . All problems in my home country are caused by ORG entering GPE ... \u201d . ORG official explained that the reason why he was asking questions about it was that he had interpreted the certificate as though the applicant had relied on his conversion as a ground for asylum . The applicant stated : \u201c no , it is not something I want to rely on . It is something private \u201d . ORG official then suggested a break in the interview in order for the applicant and his counsel to confer . After a TIME break , counsel stated : \u201c the applicant wants to underline that he has not changed religion in order to enhance his chances of getting a residence permit but out of personal conviction \u201d . When asked when he had converted , the applicant replied that this had happened after he had arrived in the NORP town of GPE , where there were not many NORP . He had got to know a person who went to church CARDINAL times a week . This person knew that the applicant hated ORG . The applicant continued : \u201c I do not regard NORP as a religion \u201d . When asked why that was so , the applicant replied : \u201c if regarded as a religion it would be like ORG , but NORP is about a kind of love you have for God \u201d . He explained that he had been going to the congregation \u2019s gatherings CARDINAL times per week and that he read the Bible . The applicant gave examples of miracles and prophecies from the Bible which had attracted him to NORP . ORG official asked why , if the applicant did not wish to rely on his conversion as a ground for asylum , he had nevertheless handed in the certificate from the pastor , to which the applicant replied : \u201c I do n\u2019t know . I never asked for it and I had not even considered handing it in , but you wanted it . They gave all converts a certificate like that \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The rest of the interview dealt with the applicant \u2019s political past . The applicant explained that in GPE he had worked with persons connected to different universities who were known to oppose the regime . He had mainly worked on creating and publishing web pages . He and CARDINAL of the other persons had been arrested in DATE . He had been released after TIME and then hospitalised for DATE due to high blood pressure .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the elections on DATE , the applicant had worked with ORG , who had supported PERSON for the presidential position , by spreading their message via the Internet . DATE before the elections , he and his friends had been arrested , questioned and detained in the polling station TIME .", "CARDINAL . After the elections , the applicant had participated in demonstrations and other activities . He had been arrested once again in DATE and imprisoned for DATE . He had been ill - treated in prison . In DATE he had been taken before ORG , which had released him after DATE on condition that he cooperate with the authorities and spy on his friends . He had agreed to the demands and given his business premises as a guarantee . He had also assured them that he would not participate in any demonstrations and that he would respond to their summons . Following his release in a park , he had found that his business LOC had been searched . He had kept politically sensitive material there , which the authorities must have noticed , and his passport and other documents were missing .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was summoned to appear on CARDINAL DATE before ORG . He had contacted a friend who , in turn , had obtained the help of a smuggler to enable him to leave the country . The applicant submitted a summons from ORG dated DATE stating that he should present himself at PERSON prison in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The interview before ORG lasted TIME and the record was subsequently sent to the applicant and his counsel for comment . Counsel commented that the applicant had not read the certificate from the congregation \u2019s pastor before the interview as it had not been translated and that the applicant intended to submit the formal baptism certificate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum . By way of introduction , it stated that while the applicant had not proven his identity or citizenship he had established the probability thereof .", "CARDINAL . As regards the request for political asylum , ORG held that participation in demonstrations or affiliation with ORG could not , of itself , give rise to a risk of persecution , ill - treatment or punishment on his return to GPE . ORG noted that the applicant had changed his story in some parts during the proceedings , and in particular , he had changed his statements concerning the number of times he had been arrested . Furthermore , he had not been able to name the park where he had been released in DATE . Thus , ORG found reason to question whether he had been arrested at all . ORG further considered that the applicant \u2019s political activities had been limited . After the questioning in DATE and until the elections in DATE , he had been able to continue working with the web pages that contained the critical material , even though , according to the applicant , already at that time the authorities had been aware of his activities . For these reasons , ORG found that the applicant could not have been of interest to the authorities on account of his activities or the material he had in his possession .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s conversion to NORP , ORG noted that the conversion and baptism had not taken place in ORG and that the applicant had not handed in any proof of his baptism . The certificate from the congregation \u2019s pastor could be regarded only as a plea to ORG that the applicant should be granted asylum . The applicant had not initially wished to invoke his conversion as a ground for asylum and had stated that his new faith was a private matter . To pursue his faith in private was not found to be a plausible reason for believing that he would risk persecution upon return . In conclusion , ORG found that the applicant had not shown that he was in need of protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and relying on both political and religious grounds for asylum . As regards the latter he handed in a baptism certificate of DATE . He reacted against the decision by ORG , which in his view implied that a conversion within a \u201c free church \u201d was of less relevance than if it had been within ORG . He explained that the reason why he had not initially wished to rely on his conversion was that he did not want to trivialise the seriousness of his beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the presence of the applicant , his counsel , an interpreter and a representative of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not question the fact that the applicant , at the time , professed the NORP faith , but found that this , by itself , was not enough to consider him in need of protection . It referred to ORG operational guidance note of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he did not wish to rely on his conversion as a reason for asylum but considered it something personal . He added that \u201c it would , however , obviously cause [ him ] problems upon return \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In respect of his political past he explained , inter alia , that he had had contact with the student movement and quite a lot of students and had helped them with their home pages . His computer had been taken from his business LOC while he was in prison . Material that was critical of the regime was stored on his computer . While he had not personally criticised the regime , or President PERSON , or the highest leaders , the applicant had visited some websites and had received cartoons via email . Therefore , in his view , there was enough evidence to prove that he was an opponent of the system . It was much the same as the material he had had on his computer in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The summons to appear before ORG on DATE was also submitted to ORG . The applicant explained that the summons had been served at his home and that his sister had brought it to him . He had left the summons with a friend when he left GPE . Subsequently , the said friend had sent it to another friend , who was going to GPE , and who had made sure that the summons was sent to the applicant in GPE . He had not been summoned again and his family had not been targeted . Something might have happened , though , that his family did not wish to burden him with .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It observed that the applicant was no longer relying on his religious views as a ground for persecution and it did not refer further to this issue in its conclusions .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s story in support of his request for political asylum had been coherent and trustworthy on the most essential points . It found that the uncertainties that had been pointed out by ORG had been satisfactorily explained . However , as regards the summons to appear before ORG , ORG found , regardless of the authenticity of the document , that it could not by itself substantiate a need for protection . ORG pointed out in this respect that the document was merely a summons and that no reason had been given as to why the applicant should present himself at PERSON prison . Moreover , the information concerning the applicant \u2019s political activities had generally been vague and lacking in detail . The applicant had only stated that he had participated in the campaign for the opposition before the elections in DATE by joining demonstrations and having contact with the student movement and students in order to help them with their web pages . Furthermore , the applicant had stated that the material he had had in his possession when he was questioned in DATE had not differed from the material he had in DATE . These circumstances , together with the fact that he had not been summoned again to appear before ORG after DATE and that his family had not been targeted , made ORG doubt that his political activities had been of such a nature and extent as to have resulted in the consequences alleged . ORG found that the applicant had exaggerated the importance of his political activities and their consequences and therefore also the authorities\u2019 interest in him . For these reasons , it considered that the applicant had not made out that the NORP authorities had a special interest in him and that therefore he was in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested leave to appeal to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) . He maintained his need for political asylum . He also alleged that before ORG he had relied on his conversion . He submitted that the latter issue had been sensitive for him , that he had considered it a private matter and that had not wanted to tarnish the seriousness of his belief . This was the reason why he , in response to a direct question by ORG , had stated that he was no longer relying on his conversion as a ground for asylum . After the oral hearing before ORG he had become a member of another NORP congregation and had taken part in an initiation ceremony broadcast on the Internet . His fear that his conversion had become known to the NORP authorities had therefore increased . He enclosed a letter of CARDINAL DATE from his new congregation which supported his explanation . In particular , it stated that the applicant had converted shortly after his arrival in GPE , that he had shown with honest intent and interest that he was willing to learn more about NORP , and that he took part in church services , prayer meetings and social activities . It also stated that he became a member of the congregation in DATE and that his NORP beliefs were no longer private as the services he attended were broadcast on the Internet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal . The removal order thus became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to stay the enforcement of his expulsion and to reconsider its previous decision in the light of new circumstances . He stated , inter alia , that the act of conversion from ORG to another religion was a taboo and punishable by death in GPE . The applicant submitted the above - mentioned letter of CARDINAL DATE from his new congregation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to re - examine the applicant \u2019s request for asylum based on his conversion . ORG noted that in the original asylum proceedings the applicant had stated that he had been baptised and had converted to NORP . He had also stated that his conversion was a personal matter which he did not wish to rely on as a ground for asylum . ORG found it noteworthy that the applicant now raised the question of conversion , when he had been given the chance to elaborate on it during the oral hearing before ORG but had declined to do so . It thus concluded that the applicant \u2019s conversion could not be regarded as a new circumstance , which was a precondition for ORG to re - examine the request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , maintaining his claims . He submitted that since he had not previously relied on his conversion , it should be regarded as a new circumstance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It observed that the authorities had already been aware of the applicant \u2019s conversion in the original proceeding leading to the decision to expel him . Therefore , the conversion could not be considered as a \u201c new circumstance \u201d . The fact that the applicant had previously chosen not to rely on his conversion as a ground for asylum did not change the court \u2019s assessment in this regard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal was refused by ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , the validity of a deportation order expires DATE after the date on which it acquired legal force , in the present case the deportation at issue expired on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
