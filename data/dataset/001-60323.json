THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 2 as regards circumstances of the applicant's son's death;Violation of Art. 2 as regards the failure to provide an effective investigation;No separate issue under Art. 6 or 8;Violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of this case were subject to investigation before a private , non - statutory inquiry , which issued a report on DATE , setting out extensive findings of fact . As these were not contested by the parties , the ORG has relied on the report in its own assessment of the facts below .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his death , PERSON had shown signs of developing a serious mental illness . In DATE a psychiatric assessment expressed the tentative diagnosis of schizophrenia . In DATE he stopped living at home with the applicants , his parents . At this time he stopped taking his medication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , then DATE , was arrested in GPE by the police and taken to GPE police station . He had been approaching young women in the street and making inappropriate suggestions . His behaviour before arrest , and at the police station where he attempted to assault a policewoman , led police officers to suspect that he might be mentally ill . He was assessed at the police station by an approved social worker , who discussed the matter on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist . They agreed that , while there was some evidence of possible developing schizophrenia , he did not need urgent medical attention and that he was fit to be detained at the police station . Any psychiatric assessment could take place as part of a pre - sentencing exercise . PERSON was held in a cell on his own . The police officer responsible did not fill in a CIDCARDINAL form identifying PERSON as an exceptional risk on ground of mental illness due to the opinion expressed by the social worker . The police officer did , however , note in the confidential information form ( DATE ) her belief that if PERSON was not treated or seen by the mental health team he might seriously harm a female . She was not aware that her own suspicion of his mental state was sufficient to warrant categorising PERSON as an exceptional risk .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was brought to ORG . Immediately his handcuffs were removed , he pushed through the other prisoners and confronted a female prison officer . He was restrained , but struggled and tried to approach her again . He was placed in a cell on his own . During the morning , he continually banged on the cell door and shouted : \u201c I want a woman . \u201d He shouted obscenities about women . The applicants met the duty solicitor at TIME and explained that their son was mentally unwell and that they wanted him to receive medical care and not to be remanded in custody . When the duty solicitor attempted to talk to PERSON in his cell , he received no assistance from his client who continued to make obscene suggestions about women . The duty solicitor discussed the problem with ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On his way to court and in the courtroom , PERSON repeated his earlier comments about women . The prosecutor had in her possession the MGCARDINALA form and had been requested by the police to obtain his remand in custody as there was a risk that he would reoffend and there was a real question mark about his mental state . The prosecutor informed the court that he was perceived as a risk to women , although it is unclear how much detail was given . She relied on the fact that an assessment by a psychiatrist had not yet been carried out in support of her application . Consideration was given by the PERSON , together with the prosecutor , duty solicitor and ORG 's ORG as to whether he could be remanded to hospital . It was concluded that there was no power to do so under LAW DATE . No consideration was given , inter alia , to the application of civil provisions ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE of the Mental Health Act DATE ) or to section CARDINAL of LAW , which provided for remand to a hospital for assessment .", "CARDINAL . The magistrates decided to remand PERSON in custody for DATE , which was a shorter period than usual , bringing forward the date to DATE so that instructions could be taken and legal aid forms completed . Further consideration would then be given , inter alia , to the obtaining of a psychiatric report . After the hearing , the first applicant telephoned the probation service in GPE and expressed concern about his son 's mental health . He was advised to contact FAC . He rang the probation officer at the prison and informed her of his son 's medical history . Her telephone note indicated that she had been told that he had been prescribed stelazine , though he had been refusing to take it or accept that he was mentally ill . The probation officer visited the health care centre and spoke to the senior medical officer , PERSON Although there was later dispute as to how much detail she passed on to the doctor , he recalled being informed that PERSON was considered to be a risk to women . However , having regard to the psychiatric social worker 's comments that PERSON was fit for detention in a police station and the fact that the court had not ordered any psychiatric reports , he stated that he would not interfere with the usual admissions procedure which meant that PERSON would be screened on arrival in the usual way and his location in the prison would depend on the result of that process . Neither he nor the probation officer passed on any of this information to the reception staff .", "CARDINAL . A prison officer returning to ORG from the ORG informed the officer in charge of reception staff that a female prison officer had been assaulted by a prisoner who was due to arrive DATE . The police officers at the ORG custody area suspected from his behaviour that PERSON was mentally abnormal and might be a threat to women and decided to warn the prison staff . A police officer rang and spoke to the senior officer at the prison reception and told him , inter alia , that the magistrates had wanted to remand PERSON to a mental hospital and that he had assaulted a female prison officer . The senior officer was concerned at this information and contacted ORG to verify whether he was being remanded under a normal warrant . He also spoke to the duty governor about the allocation of PERSON and it was decided , subject to the health care screening , that he should be located on wing ORG where no female officers worked .", "CARDINAL . In TIME , PERSON was taken to ORG . The reception staff were aware of the information passed on from the police at the ORG and that he was a potential danger to women . He was placed in a holding area while the other prison arrivals were processed . His behaviour was noted as \u201c strange \u201d and \u201c odd \u201d and when being placed in the holding cell he was aggressive and tried to punch a prison officer . After TIME he was screened by Mr N. , a member of the prison health care staff , who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre . Mr N. knew nothing about previous discussions in the court or the concerns passed on to the prison about PERSON mental health . He was only aware that PERSON was alleged to have assaulted a female police constable . Mr PERSON followed the standard questionnaire . To question CARDINAL ( Have you ever been seen by a psychiatrist ? ) , the answer was \u201c DATE \u201d . PERSON did not disclose that he had been taking stelazine . There was no evidence of active mental disturbance or bizarre behaviour during the interview , which was unlikely to have lasted TIME . No medical officer was on duty at the centre at this time , or was present in the prison . PERSON was admitted to the main prison and placed in cell DCARDINAL - DATE .", "CARDINAL . He was detained in a cell on his own during this period .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , PERSON was arrested in GPE on CARDINAL DATE for assaulting his friend and her neighbour . At GPE police station , he was seen by a police surgeon as it was suspected that he was mentally ill . The police surgeon certified that PERSON was not fit to be detained . PERSON was assessed by a psychiatric registrar who consulted on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist , who decided that he did not need to be admitted to hospital and that he was fit to be detained . PERSON was transferred to GPE police station , where the police surgeon also found him fit to be detained . While his conduct before and after arrest was bizarre , it was attributed by the doctors to the effects of alcohol abuse , amphetamine withdrawal and to a deliberate attempt to manipulate the criminal justice system . The registrar , who had previously treated PERSON , knew that he had been diagnosed at various times as suffering from schizophrenia or as having a personality disorder , but also knew him as someone who became ill when abusing alcohol and drugs . Over DATE , PERSON showed further bizarre behaviour and was violent towards police officers . He was not reassessed by a doctor . No CIDCARDINAL form was filled in , although police officers remained of the opinion that he was mentally ill . On DATE PERSON was remanded in custody by ORG . The magistrates were presented with a \u201c sane but dangerous \u201d description of him . PERSON arrived at FAC shortly after PERSON , where he was screened by the same member of the prison health care service who had seen PERSON and who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre . PERSON did not behave in a bizarre fashion during the screening . Mr N. did not have knowledge of PERSON previous convictions , which would have alerted him to his admittance to hospital in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Initially , PERSON was placed in cell DCARDINAL - DATE on his own . He was then moved into cell DCARDINAL - CARDINAL with PERSON . This was due to shortage of space , as all the other cells on the landing were doubly occupied .", "CARDINAL . Each cell had a green emergency light situated on the wall outside the cell next to the door which came on when the call button was depressed inside the cell . Additionally , once the button was pressed , a buzzer sounded on the landing and a red light lit up on a control panel in the office on the landing concerned , indicating the cell . The red light remained on and the buzzer continued to sound even if the prisoner ceased to press the button . At TIME , either PERSON or PERSON pressed the call button . A prison officer saw the green light outside the cell and was told that they wished one of the cell lights , operated from the exterior , to be switched off . He agreed to do so . He saw that the CARDINAL men appeared to be \u201c getting on all right \u201d . He noticed that while the green light had gone on the buzzer which should have been sounding continuously had not done so . He did not report the apparent defect .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before TIME on DATE , a prison officer heard a buzzer sound . He saw no red light on the D - landing control panel and saw a prison officer go to check the other landings . Some time later , he heard continuous banging on a cell door on his landing . On going to investigate he saw the green light on outside cell DCARDINAL - CARDINAL . Looking through the spy hole , he saw PERSON holding a bloodstained plastic fork and noticed blood on the floor and on PERSON 's feet . There was a delay of TIME while officers donned protective clothing . They entered the cell to find that PERSON had been stamped and kicked to death . PERSON was making continual reference to being possessed by evil spirits and devils . D - landing had previously been patrolled at TIME , which indicated that TIME could have elapsed since the pressing of the cell 's call button .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the attack , PERSON was acutely mentally ill . He was transferred later on DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON pleaded guilty at ORG to the manslaughter of PERSON by reason of diminished responsibility . The trial was therefore brief . The judge imposed a hospital order under LAW of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , together with a restriction order under section CARDINAL . PERSON is currently still at ORG , diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . A coroner 's inquest had been opened but adjourned pending the criminal proceedings against PERSON . After PERSON conviction , the coroner closed the inquest , as there was no obligation to continue in those circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were advised by the Assistant Chief Constable that it was considered that there was insufficient evidence to establish the offence of manslaughter by gross negligence on the part of anyone involved in the case but that the matter would be probably reviewed at the conclusion of the inquiry which had been commenced by the statutory agencies concerned in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a private , non - statutory inquiry was commissioned by CARDINAL ORG agencies with statutory responsibilities towards PERSON \u2013 ORG , ORG and ORG . Its terms of reference were :", "\u201c To investigate the death of PERSON in FAC , including factors in his and Mr PERSON 's detention which are relevant to that , and in particular : the extent to which their reception , detention , management and care corresponded to statutory obligations , ORG and local operational policies .", "CARDINAL . To examine the adequacy , both in fact and of relevant procedures , of collaboration and communication between the agencies ( ORG , ORG , the courts , ORG and its predecessor , and ORG ) involved in the care , custody and control of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , or in the provision of services to them .", "CARDINAL . To examine the circumstances surrounding the arrest , detention and custody of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON by ORG , including whether all relevant information was effectively and efficiently passed between GPE , the prison service , the courts , and any other relevant agencies ... ;", "CARDINAL . To examine all the relevant circumstances surrounding the treatment and care of PERSON and PERSON , by the health service and social services , and in particular : the extent to which PERSON and PERSON care corresponded to relevant statutory obligations , relevant guidance from ORG ... and local operational policies .", "CARDINAL . To prepare a report and make recommendations to ORG , ORG and ORG , and other such agencies as are identified as appropriate ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants were advised by their solicitors that they had a claim for funeral costs and a potential claim for compensation and any pain and suffering between PERSON injury and death , but that taking into account legal costs it would not be economic to bring such a claim .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG awarded the applicants MONEY ( GBP ) for funeral expenses but decided that there should be no dependency or bereavement award .", "CARDINAL . The inquiry opened in DATE . It was chaired by PERSON , ORG , the other members of the panel consisting of Professor PERSON ( Emeritus Professor of ORG at ORG ) , Mr PERSON ( former Director of ORG , ORG and member of ORG ) , Mr PERSON ( former Governor of ORG and FAC and ORG Deputy Chief Inspector of Prisons DATE ) and Mr PERSON ( Commissioner of GPE DATE ) . They were assisted by a firm of solicitors appointed by the commissioning agencies to provide secretarial and administrative support and to arrange for the attendance of witnesses . CARDINAL solicitors from this firm were appointed as advocates to the inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The inquiry received evidence on DATE over DATE . It sat in private . It had no powers of compulsion of witnesses or production of documents . CARDINAL prison officers refused to give evidence . The inquiry report later noted that CARDINAL of these had potentially significant evidence and his refusal was said to be \u201c all the more regrettable since he had passed by PERSON cell shortly before he met his death \u201d . The inquiry panel conducted visits to the police stations , ORG building and prison concerned . Professor PERSON , a member of the panel , interviewed PERSON in hospital . CARDINAL witnesses attended the inquiry to give evidence , while a considerable number of others submitted written evidence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants issued a summons in ORG for negligence against the Chief Constable of GPE and ORG . They did not , however , serve it due to legal advice from their solicitors .", "CARDINAL . Draft extracts of the inquiry 's preliminary findings were circulated to those subjected to criticism to allow them the opportunity to comment . A number of witnesses were recalled to give evidence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The inquiry report was published on DATE . It concluded that ideally PERSON and PERSON should not have been in prison and in practice they should not have been sharing the same cell . It found \u201c a systemic collapse of the protective mechanisms that ought to have operated to protect this vulnerable prisoner \u201d . It identified a series of shortcomings , including poor record - keeping , inadequate communication and limited inter - agency cooperation , and a number of missed opportunities to prevent the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The findings included the following :", "( a ) Ideally , if suitable beds had been available , PERSON should have been admitted to hospital for assessment under LAW .", "( b ) It was a serious omission , and breach of LAW under LAW DATE ( \u201c PACE \u201d ) , that no doctor had been asked by the custody officer to see PERSON .", "( c ) It was a serious failure by GPE Police that a CIDCARDINAL form was not completed describing PERSON as a prisoner reasonably suspected of being an exceptional risk on the grounds of mental disturbance , though it was noted that even if he had been so described by the police this would not have been enough , by itself , to ensure that he was admitted to the health care centre at FAC .", "( d ) At the Magistrates ' Court hearing on DATE no consideration was given to LAW which provided for a remand to hospital for assessment .", "( e ) No attempt was made by the court to notify the prison authorities , in particular the senior medical officer , that PERSON was suspected of suffering from a mental illness .", "( f ) ORG provided to the prison by the applicants about PERSON psychiatric background was not recorded or passed on to the person carrying out the screening .", "( g ) When PERSON arrived at FAC there was no medical officer on duty , in breach of ORG .", "( h ) The prison health care worker , PERSON , who assessed PERSON was inadequately trained in the recognition of mental disorder and had been given insufficient guidance . The screening was rushed and superficial and did not take place in adequate conditions of privacy .", "( i ) Mr N. had not been provided with any information about the concerns as to PERSON mental condition by the police or the court . If he had received a CIDCARDINAL form identifying mental disturbance or the court had expressed some concern , this might have prompted sufficient residual doubts to cause him to err on the side of caution and have him admitted to the health centre for TIME .", "( j ) The cell 's call system was defective ; it had been pressed up to TIME before the alarm was raised by PERSON banging on the door and the warning buzzer had not sounded , or if it did it only sounded briefly . If it had functioned , a prompt response might have saved PERSON life . The system could be disabled simply by wedging a matchstick behind the re - set button on the control panel and it could not be ruled out that it might have been tampered with by a prison officer or prisoner who wanted a \u201c quiet night \u201d . The fact that it could so easily be disabled rendered the system inadequate and unsafe . It was also noted that according to good practice , where the cell 's call system was defective , either the occupants should be moved to another cell or effective visual monitoring should be provided , as a cell could not be certified fit for occupation without a method of communication in working condition .", "( k ) PERSON had a history of violent outbursts and assaults , including a previous assault on a cell - mate in prison . He had been admitted to mental hospital in DATE , and subsequently had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia . Despite psychotic episodes and further assessments , he was not admitted to hospital after DATE , as he was not considered to be suffering from acute mental illness . A case conference was held on DATE , where CARDINAL of PERSON general practitioners and a police officer expressed the view that he was capable of serious violence or murder . However , no formal risk assessment was carried out . The consultant psychiatrist did not accept that the risk to public safety was serious and it was decided to make CARDINAL last attempt to induce PERSON to take depot medication before detaining him under LAW . On DATE , it was reported to the consultant that PERSON was refusing depot medication .", "( l ) After PERSON arrest on DATE , no attempt was made to locate his medical notes before being assessed . The psychiatric registrar was unaware of the case conference or the outline plan to detain him .", "( m ) No CIDCARDINAL form was filled in by the police for PERSON despite his attacks on CARDINAL officers , as the officer concerned did not know that such a form existed .", "( n ) NORP The police , prosecution and magistrates were aware that PERSON was described as dangerous but no formal warning was given to the prison authorities .", "( o ) At FAC , PERSON was screened by Mr DATE , who knew nothing about him except that he had been \u201c difficult \u201d in the police station ; although the provision of a CIDCARDINAL form would not have been conclusive , information about his previous convictions ( and admittance to hospital ) might have prompted a closer appraisal and he might have had sufficient doubts to have him admitted to the health care centre despite the absence of really bizarre symptoms .", "CARDINAL . Following the publication of the report , the applicants sought advice as to whether there were any civil remedies available to them in the light of the findings of the inquiry . At a conference on DATE , they were advised by counsel that there were still no available civil remedies . The inquiry had made no relevant findings in relation to whether any time elapsed between their son being injured and his death , which would have determined whether they had any action in respect of pain and suffering experienced by their son before he died .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG maintained their previous decision that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with criminal charges . The applicants ' counsel advised on DATE that , notwithstanding the numerous shortcomings , there was insufficient material to found a criminal charge of gross negligence against any individual or agency .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE , ORG ( ORG ) provided the applicants with a report on their complaints about police conduct in dealing with PERSON and on the subsequent investigation into his death . The report upheld CARDINAL of the complaints and made a number of recommendations to ORG in relation to practice and procedure . It found , inter alia , a breach of LAW under PACE in that the police failed to summon a doctor to the police station when PERSON behaviour led them to believe that he might be suffering from a mental illness and that , as regarded the failure of the officers to fill in a CIDCARDINAL form identifying PERSON and PERSON as exceptional risks on grounds of mental disturbance , the officers concerned had been insufficiently informed as to the existence and purposes of the form . It also upheld complaints about the police investigation after the death , including a failure by the police investigators to test the cell buzzer properly to establish its effectiveness , the loss of the list of prisoners held on the relevant landing on TIME of the incident and a failure to interview relevant persons in the prison , for example , PERSON , the health care worker , the prison doctor and the prison probation officer concerning the allegation of criminal negligence raised by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . Under the common law , no one can recover damages in tort for the death of another .", "CARDINAL . LAW CARDINAL confers a right of action for a wrongful act causing death . LAW ) provides :", "\u201c If death is caused by any wrongful act , neglect or default which is such as would ( if death had not ensued ) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof , the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages , notwithstanding the death of the person injured . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , the statutory right of action is reserved to the deceased 's dependants ( section CARDINAL ) which allows the recovery of their pecuniary loss ) . If there are no dependants , there is no pecuniary loss to recover as damages . Bereavement damages ( fixed at GBP CARDINAL ) are only available to the parents of a child under DATE ( section CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) ) . Funeral expenses are recoverable ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Miscellaneous ) LAW DATE provides for the survival of causes of action for the benefit of the deceased 's personal estate . The relevant part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c Subject to the provisions of this section , on the death of any person after the commencement of this LAW all causes of action subsisting against or vested in him shall survive against , or , as the case may be , for the benefit of , his estate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This enables recovery on behalf of the estate of damages for losses suffered by the deceased before he died , including any non - pecuniary loss such as damages for pain and suffering experienced between the infliction of injury and death . Where death is instantaneous , or where it can not be proved that the deceased experienced pain and suffering before death , damages are not recoverable under LAW and the only recoverable amount would be funeral expenses .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL cases have arisen since the entry into force on DATE of LAW DATE concerning deaths in custody in which the domestic courts have examined the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In NORP on the application of PERSON v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG , ORG and GPE ) CARDINAL , DATE ) , proceedings were brought by the mother and aunt of a man who died in custody as a result of a severe asthma attack in which it was alleged that his treatment prior to his death did not comply with ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the ORG and that there had been a failure to provide a proper investigation into his death . ORG found that it was arguable that ORG had breached ORG and CARDINAL in its treatment of this prisoner and that , as the inquest and civil proceedings did not constitute an effective official investigation for the purpose of the procedural obligations under these provisions , the claimants were entitled to an order that the Secretary of ORG set up an independent investigation into the circumstances of the death . Although the death had occurred prior to DATE , the court held that there was a continuing obligation after that date to provide an effective investigation in the special circumstances of that case where the death was still the subject of active debate and controversy .", "CARDINAL . In NORP on the application of PERSON v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG , ORG and GPE ) CARDINAL , DATE ) , where DATE PERSON was bludgeoned to death by a violent and racist prisoner , there was a claim that the Secretary of ORG had failed to hold an open and public investigation into the circumstances of the death . ORG found that internal inquiry by ORG and the criminal trial of the assailant did not constitute an effective investigation for the purposes of the procedural obligation under LAW , principally as it did not establish why on that night PERSON was sharing a cell with his assailant . The claimants were accordingly entitled to a declaration that an independent public investigation with the family legally represented , provided with the relevant material and able to cross - examine the principal witnesses , must be held to satisfy the obligations imposed by LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
