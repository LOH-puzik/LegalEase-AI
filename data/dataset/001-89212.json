The ORG was a public body composed of CARDINAL members appointed by the President of GPE . LAW also introduced a new licensing procedure , according to which a broadcasting licence was granted on the basis of a call for tenders conducted by the ORG in respect of the list of available frequencies .", "During DATE all existing broadcasting licences were temporarily re - registered by the ORG until the relevant calls for tenders were announced .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the ORG decided to postpone the call for tenders for band CARDINAL until the adoption of appropriate rules and regulations and to permit ORG to continue to operate on band CARDINAL for an indefinite period of time until such call for tenders was issued .", "On DATE the ORG announced calls for tenders for various broadcasting frequencies , including band CARDINAL . The ORG issued a notice in which it defined the conditions for participation in the call for tenders for band CARDINAL and the information and documents to be submitted . The information required included data on the technical facilities , the financial sources , the staff and the programme policy of an applicant .", "The applicant company and CARDINAL other companies , GPE and ORG , submitted bids for band CARDINAL . The applicant company alleged that GPE was a company producing predominantly clerical programmes , while PERSON TV focused mostly on entertainment programmes .", "On DATE the ORG held a points - based vote and recognised PERSON as the winner of the call for tenders for band CARDINAL . The decision stated :", "\u201c Based on [ the relevant provisions LAW and other complementary legal acts ] , and taking into account the results of the call for tenders for television broadcasting on decimetric band CARDINAL in the area of GPE , [ the ORG ] decides ( CARDINAL ) to recognise ORG as the winner of the call for tenders for television broadcasting on decimetric band CARDINAL in the area of GPE , and ( CARDINAL ) to grant a television broadcasting licence to ORG \u201d", "On an unspecified date the manager of the applicant company , Mr GPE , lodged an application with ORG ( \u0540\u0540 \u057f\u0576\u057f\u0565\u057d\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576 ) , claiming that the tender procedure had been conducted with violations of the law and seeking to invalidate its results . In particular , he argued that the ORG , by announcing separate calls for tenders for different bands as opposed to a single one for all bands , had restricted the applicant company 's right to win a licence for any of the unoccupied bands . He further argued that the information required by the ORG had not been consistent with the information to be contained in a bid for a broadcasting licence as defined by law . Moreover , the ORG had not been authorised by law to define the information to be contained in a bid . Furthermore , he submitted that the ORG had failed to inform the applicant company in writing about the reasons for the refusal of a licence .", "On DATE ORG examined the applicant company 's application . The applicant company was represented at this hearing by CARDINAL lawyers , GPE , FAC and PERSON , who made submissions on its behalf . ORG decided to dismiss the application , finding that the fact that the ORG had announced separate calls for tenders as opposed to a single one did not contravene the law . Nothing had precluded the applicant company from submitting bids for all these calls for tenders . The court further found that the ORG had been authorised by law to define the procedures and conditions of the tender process and that it had acted in accordance with the law in doing so . Nothing in the information required by the ORG in its notice issued following the announcement of the call for tenders on DATE had conflicted with the requirements of the law . As to the requirement to provide a written notification of the reasons for the refusal of a licence , the court found that the ORG , having recognised PERSON as the winner of the competition , had informed the applicant company about this in writing on DATE .", "On an unspecified date Mr GPE lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( \u0540\u0540 \u057e\u0573\u057c\u0561\u0562\u0565\u056f \u0564\u0561\u057f\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576 ) . In his appeal , he raised the same arguments as before ORG", "On DATE ORG notified the applicant company that its hearing was scheduled for DATE at TIME", "On DATE lawyer PERSON informed ORG in writing that on DATE at TIME he had to appear at another court hearing . In order to avoid an overlap between the QUANTITY hearings , lawyer PERSON requested ORG to notify him of the exact time when the applicant company 's claim would be examined . It appears that no reply was received to this letter .", "On DATE at TIME Mr GPE , accompanied by lawyers PERSON and FAC , appeared at ORG . The latter had CARDINAL cases scheduled for that date with all the parties involved being notified to appear at TIME . The hearings started at TIME", "The applicant company alleged that at TIME lawyer PERSON requested the presiding judge to inform him as to when the hearing on the applicant company 's claim would commence . The presiding judge replied that the hearing would commence \u201c whenever the court found it necessary \u201d . The lawyer repeated his request , explaining about the need to prevent any overlap between the QUANTITY hearings , whereupon he was removed from the courtroom upon the instruction of the presiding judge for violating order in court . At TIME ORG proceeded to examining the applicant company 's case . The ORG was represented at the hearing by CARDINAL lawyers , while the applicant company was represented only by Mr GPE since lawyer ORG had not been instructed to represent the applicant company . The hearing lasted TIME . The parties were not asked any questions and did not make any submissions .", "The Government contested this allegation , claiming that the applicant company 's lawyer was never removed from the courtroom . ORG had CARDINAL cases scheduled to be examined on DATE , starting at TIME was given to cases involving parties coming from distant regions and women . Having found out about this order , the lawyer informed the court that he had another hearing to attend at TIME and requested that the applicant company 's case be heard in a priority order . This request was refused so the lawyer voluntarily left the courtroom . The Government further alleged that the applicant company was represented by CARDINAL other lawyers , while the ORG had no representative .", "ORG , and concluded by dismissing the applicant company 's appeal , finding that :", "\u201c ... the arguments put forward in the appeal concerning a violation by ORG of [ the relevant legal acts ] are groundless , as [ the ORG ] , acting within the authority vested in it by the above legal acts ... defined the tender procedure for licensing of television broadcasting , which contains the rules on the conditions , procedures and time - limits of a call for tenders , submission of bids , recognising the winner of the call for tenders and declaring the call for tenders void .
