NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is the owner of a court library and archives dating back to DATE . In DATE the library contained CARDINAL volumes ; DATE , it contains CARDINAL volumes . The library is accessible to the public and the archives are accessible for scientific purposes .", "CARDINAL . NORP The property was originally incorporated in a family trust fund ( NORP ) . Under LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber PERSON Familienfideikommisse und sonstiger ORG , ORG , see relvant domestic law , below ) , which entered into force on DATE , all family trust funds were dissolved by DATE . The property contained in these funds was , as a rule , transferred into normal private property . However , section CARDINAL of the abovementioned law allowed the authorities to impose certain protective and security measures in respect of objects of particular artistic , scientific , historical or patrimonial value .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ORG , in its capacity as a trust fund court , relying on section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned law , placed the administration of the different parts of the court library and archives under the supervision of the director of the NORP ORG , and of the directors of ORG in GPE and GPE . The current owner and his legal successors were ordered to obtain authorisation from the supervising authority before changing , displacing , or disposing of the library or the archives or of parts thereof . Furthermore , it was ordered that the library and archives had to be maintained in an \u201c orderly condition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG to lift the above - mentioned measures . Relying on section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Dissolution of Family Trust Funds , he argued that the measures deprived him of making use of his property in a reasonable way . Under the orders issued in DATE , he had to bear considerable expenses while being denied any possibility of profiting from his property . The applicant submitted that the factual and legal circumstances had changed since DATE . The costs of maintenance for the court library and the central archives had increased dramatically . For DATE , the total expenses were estimated at MONEY . The applicant further argued that the limitations imposed were unconstitutional , as he did not receive any compensation for the factual expropriation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the grounds that the applicant had not established that the factual and legal circumstances had changed since the imposition of the impugned measures in DATE . ORG conceded that the expenses submitted by the applicant for the maintenance of the library and the archives were considerable . However , there was no indication that these expenses had not merely increased because of general inflation , but had been generated after DATE . ORG further considered that section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the dissolution of ORG Funds was constitutional . The court noted in this context that the court library and archives were cultural goods of exceptional importance meriting special protection . The measures imposed were justified by the public interest in the conservation of valuable goods giving testimony of NORP culture and history . If the measures imposed in DATE were lifted , the conservation and accessibility of the court library and central archives could no longer be assured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP High Court ( Oberstes Landesgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint on the grounds that the orders issued in DATE were legally binding and that the factual and legal circumstances had not changed in a way which would justify the measures to be lifted . The court observed that the court library and central archives remained an important part of the cultural heritage which necessitated protection . Conversely , economic interests did not play a decisive role in the decision taken in DATE . Accordingly , the general change in the economic context did not justify the measures to be lifted . ORG further considered that there was no violation of the right to equal treatment . The situation had to be seen in the context of the historical and social circumstances under which the property was acquired . These circumstances , taken in their entirety , could not be compared to the circumstances under which \u201c civil \u201d property was acquired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .
