Instead of helping me , the policeman hit me over my right eye with the truncheon . I held my eye crying , and when I said to him : \u201c What have I done to you that you hit me ? \u201d , I saw him raising his arm to hit me again . At this point I felt that some other policemen standing nearby said something to him , and then all of them went away from me . I could not see any rank insignia on their shoulders . I would not be able to recognise the policeman who hit me and the policemen who were near him . It is possible that some of the civilians who were nearby saw [ this incident ] , but I do not know specifically who witnessed it . I stood up by myself and while I was hobbling in the direction of Pharmacy no . CARDINAL , an unknown old man took me by the arm and accompanied me to the pharmacy so that I could get medical aid .

At this point some soldiers approached the pharmacy and started knocking on the window , and a grey - haired old woman who was an employee of the pharmacy [ admonished them ] . At the same time , when ORG , whom I recognised because he used to be a television journalist , tried to open the door of the pharmacy [ from inside ] , one of the soldiers [ who was standing outside ] tried to hit him with a truncheon but missed . The reason [ ORG wanted to open the door and go outside ] was that he wanted to call an ambulance for the injured ... After a while an ambulance took us to a hospital ...
