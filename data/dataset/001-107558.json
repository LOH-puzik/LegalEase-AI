The applicant was born in DATE . He was detained in FAC until his release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been convicted CARDINAL times since DATE , initially notably for smuggling and thefts . Since DATE he has spent most of his life in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL charges of joint aggravated ( armed ) robbery of a bank , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery - style theft committed against a money courier . Taking into account the term of imprisonment from the judgment of DATE , it imposed on the applicant a cumulative sentence of DATE imprisonment , but quashed the order for preventive detention . The remainder of his prison sentence was suspended on DATE and the applicant was released and placed on probation ; this suspension was subsequently revoked .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , in particular , of CARDINAL counts of joint aggravated ( armed ) robbery , of aiding and abetting another joint aggravated robbery , of CARDINAL counts of aggravated theft and CARDINAL count of attempted aggravated theft . It sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Cologne Regional Court found that the applicant , who had been released from prison on DATE and had a job , had committed the said offences DATE and his arrest in DATE . Together with CARDINAL accomplices , he had robbed a money courier and a bank , armed . He had further stolen or attempted to steal together with others several cars which had later been used when committing the CARDINAL robberies and another bank robbery in which the applicant had not otherwise participated .", "CARDINAL . Having consulted an expert , ORG found that since his youth the applicant had been strongly inclined to commit offences and to make his living thereby , even though he could have worked . Serving long sentences had not prevented him from reoffending and from committing more and more serious offences at ever shorter intervals . Since there were no indications that the applicant would not reoffend , he was dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE , which thereby became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reopened the proceedings in respect of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s accomplices , PERSON , who had also been convicted of bank robbery on DATE , and acquitted him . The third accomplice to the robbery , ORG . , had confessed that he had wrongfully incriminated both PERSON and the applicant in this offence . The applicant \u2019s request for reopening of the proceedings against him was subsequently dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the order remanding the applicant in preventive detention from DATE ( when the applicant would have served his full prison sentence ) , granted probation and ordered the applicant to be placed under supervision of conduct ( F\u00fchrungsaufsicht ) for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served the sentence imposed by the judgment of DATE in full , as well as the remainder of the sentence imposed by the judgment of DATE , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated ( armed ) robbery committed with others , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention . It found that the applicant , armed with a machine gun , had robbed a bank together with an accomplice in DATE ; he had been in custody since then .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE so far as the applicant \u2019s sentence and his preventive detention were concerned and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It considered the conditions for his preventive detention under LAW to have been met . However , for reasons of proportionality , the court did not order the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , which would then have been of indefinite duration . It argued that from DATE , the applicant would be placed in preventive detention on the basis of the judgment of DATE , as the provisional suspension of his preventive detention on DATE was likely to be revoked , and that he would be of advanced age afterwards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as the court dealing with the execution of sentences , revoked the suspension of the applicant \u2019s provisional preventive detention granted on DATE pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in view of his renewed conviction for aggravated robbery committed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , disagreeing with ORG view , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE . The applicant \u2019s objection was of no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against the decision of ORG dated DATE . It found that the applicant had failed sufficiently to substantiate his complaint , which was therefore inadmissible . It observed , however , that the provisions of LAW did not permit the revocation of the suspension of the applicant \u2019s provisional preventive detention after the expiry of the DATE period of supervision of his conduct . It was firstly up to the courts dealing with matters relating to the execution of sentences to examine whether the revocation decision could be amended at the applicant \u2019s request or of the court \u2019s own motion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , supported by ORG , for the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE to be set aside . It found that under LAW , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the supervision of the applicant \u2019s conduct for DATE ordered in DATE had not ended until now as the applicant had been detained since DATE and the time spent in detention did not count towards the period of the supervision of his conduct . Therefore , the provisional suspension of the preventive detention order against him could still be revoked in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG started the proceedings for examination of the need for the applicant \u2019s preventive detention after the end of his prison term by requesting ORG to send the case file and by ordering FAC authorities to make a statement .", "CARDINAL . NORP The director of FAC thereupon sent a statement dated DATE , which he supplemented at the court \u2019s request on DATE . Following CARDINAL reminders from ORG , ORG submitted the case file to the court in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested a psychiatric expert to give an opinion on whether the applicant was still so dangerous that his preventive detention was necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his prison sentence in full , DATE . From CARDINAL DATE the applicant was in preventive detention ordered in the judgment dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an inquiry of ORG at the applicant \u2019s request , the latter was examined by the psychiatric expert on DATE . Following CARDINAL further requests made by the applicant to make progress in the proceedings , a report drafted by CARDINAL psychiatric experts was submitted to the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG , having heard the applicant and his counsel on DATE and having consulted the director of FAC and CARDINAL experts , ordered the execution of the preventive detention order in respect of the applicant made in ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered in detail the previous convictions of the applicant , aged DATE , notably his convictions for aggravated robbery and robbery - style theft by judgments dated DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the execution of the preventive detention order against the applicant was still necessary in view of its objective ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant was likely to commit further serious offences similar to those he had previously committed if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the applicant had been a persistent offender since his youth , who had reoffended shortly after being released on probation and after serving long prison sentences . He did not have any family ties outside prison and did not have any precise plans as to what he would be doing when released . He was lively for his age . He suffered from orthopaedic health problems , notably injuries to his left knee and his hip , which , as found by the prison doctor , entailed a considerable but not extreme walking disability . His walking ability could have been considerably improved by an artificial hip , but he refused to have the operation while he was in prison . Having consulted the prison doctor , the court took the view that the applicant \u2019s walking disability could not yet be considered so severe as to render him physically unable to commit an offence , notably as his previous offences had not required significant mobility .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the report dated DATE by the CARDINAL psychiatric experts who had examined the applicant , took the view that the applicant \u2019s personal and social situation remained similar to that which had existed when he was released from prison in DATE at DATE . He had not changed his attitude towards offences and therefore remained dangerous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the GPE ORG decision of DATE . It did not share the view expressed by ORG in its decision dated DATE that the revocation of the suspension of the applicant \u2019s provisional preventive detention had no longer been possible on DATE according to the provisions of LAW . Pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , preventive detention would cease to apply at the end of the offender \u2019s supervision of conduct if the court had not revoked the suspension of his preventive detention before that date . However , the supervision of the applicant \u2019s conduct for DATE ordered in DATE had not ended , as the applicant had been detained since DATE and the time spent in detention did not count towards the duration of the supervision of conduct ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG found that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions in his appeal , the fact that ORG had failed to reach a decision on the applicant \u2019s preventive detention before the applicant had served his full prison sentence on DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) did not render its decision unlawful . In any event , the mistake had been remedied ex nunc when the decision was taken .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant needed to be kept in preventive detention in order to protect the public from particularly dangerous offenders . The applicant did not truly question or regret his offences . As found by CARDINAL experts in an additional report , the applicant \u2019s statements concerning his offences were very similar to those he had made before his previous release from prison , following which he had reoffended . The applicant \u2019s age and the health problems accompanying it did not , at least at the time , warrant a different conclusion as to the danger he presented to the public . The applicant had also already reached retirement age when he had committed his last offence . As found by the prison doctor on DATE , his knee and hip were damaged . The court found that these illnesses caused pain , but did not entail a walking disability .", "CARDINAL . NORP Remanding the applicant in preventive detention was also not disproportionate , as he was likely to commit serious offences if released . However , in view of his present illnesses and the usual diminution of physical fitness with advancing age the applicant \u2019s preventive detention would probably not last until its termination in DATE , but would be suspended on probation . Therefore , the applicant should be prepared for a life outside prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE . He claimed that his right to liberty had been violated . He argued that , as had been expressly found in the decision of ORG dated DATE , the revocation of the suspension of his provisional preventive detention had no longer been possible on DATE . Moreover , he had been remanded in preventive detention since DATE without a legal basis , in particular because the courts had failed to reach a decision on the necessity of that remand in custody within a reasonable time , as required by Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW as interpreted in the well - established case - law of the courts of appeal and of ORG itself ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Due to his age , DATE , and his walking disability , which had already made him physically unable to reoffend , his preventive detention was also disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . DATE ) . It found that the complaint had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that , even assuming that the decisions on the necessity to remand the applicant in preventive detention should have been based on paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINALc of LAW , they did not violate LAW . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s view , he had not been detained without legal basis in the period between the end of his prison term and ORG decision ordering the execution of the preventive detention order against him . Referring to its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( file no . QUANTITY BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it found that the execution of a preventive detention order on the basis of a judgment of the sentencing court ordering it under LAW was permitted if ORG dealing with the execution of sentences had begun with its examination under LAW before the person concerned had fully served his prison sentence , even if it had not yet taken its decision .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further took the view that ORG , which had started the proceedings concerning suspension of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention DATE the applicant \u2019s prison term , had not delayed the proceedings in a manner which would violate his right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the decision of the courts dealing with the execution of sentences not to suspend the preventive detention order against the applicant and grant probation did not appear arbitrary in view of the applicant \u2019s repeated serious offences and there was no violation of the ORG duty to investigate the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to suspend the preventive detention order made against the applicant in ORG judgment of DATE and grant probation as of DATE ; it further ordered supervision of the applicant \u2019s conduct . Having regard to all the , including , in particular , the applicant \u2019s walking disability , the court considered , in accordance with the view taken by the medical expert it had consulted and contrary to the view taken by the director of ORG and ORG , that it was to be expected that the applicant would not commit further serious offences similar to those he had previously been convicted of if released PERSON ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions relevant to the present case can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . A sentencing court may , at the time of an offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention , known as a measure of correction and prevention , under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence , a penalty , if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is convicted of an intentional offence and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied : firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Preventive detention may only be ordered if such a measure is proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the perpetrator as well as to his dangerousness ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and DATE ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it temporarily suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and places the person on probation with supervision of their conduct which commences with the suspension . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , preventive detention may only be executed on the explicit order of the court if its execution has not started DATE after the order becomes final , unless paragraph CARDINAL applies . ORG spent by the offender in detention by order of a public authority shall not count towards this time - limit . The court shall order the execution of the preventive detention order if the objective of the measure still requires it .", "CARDINAL . As regards the lawfulness of the execution of a preventive detention order in cases in which the person concerned has served his sentence in full , but the courts dealing with the execution of sentences have not yet taken their decision under LAW as to whether preventive detention was still necessary in view of its objective , the following principles have been established in the NORP ORG case - law . The execution of the preventive detention order made in the judgment of the criminal sentencing court under LAW is lawful and does not violate the constitutional right to liberty of the person concerned if the courts dealing with the execution of sentences have started examining the need for preventive detention before the person concerned has served his prison sentence in full and have terminated the proceedings without avoidable delays and within a reasonable time ( see ORG , file no . CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , Collection of the decisions of ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ss . ; ORG , file no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE , ORG DATE , pp . CARDINAL ss . ; ORG , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ; and ORG , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) . The execution of a preventive detention order was not permitted , in any event , if a convict , owing to avoidable delays , has already been in preventive detention for DATE without a need for preventive detention having been established ( see ORG , ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) . In such cases , the execution of the preventive detention order had to be interrupted at the detainee \u2019s request under LAW and CARDINAL , read in conjunction with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , irrespective of the dangerousness of the person concerned ( see ORG , ibid . , p. CARDINAL ; and ORG , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Article GPE of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL g concerns the revocation of the suspension on probation of a preventive detention order . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL no . CARDINAL , the court shall revoke the suspension of a preventive detention order if the convicted person , during the period of supervision of conduct , commits an unlawful act which shows that the objective of the measure necessitates his preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that preventive detention shall cease to apply at the end of the offender \u2019s supervision of conduct if the court did not revoke the suspension of his preventive detention before that date .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW regulates the duration of the supervision of conduct . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL , in its version in force between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , supervision of conduct shall begin once the order of that measure has become final ( first sentence ) . The time the convicted person spends in detention by order of a public authority does not count towards the duration of the supervision of conduct ( second sentence ) . DATE and DATE the same provision was made in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if objections are raised to the admissibility of the execution of a penalty , a court decision shall be obtained . The further execution of the penalty shall not be suspended thereby ; the court may , however , order a suspension of execution ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . Pursuant to LAW , LAW applies , mutatis mutandis , to the execution of measures of correction and prevention .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and about the retrospective order of the ORG preventive detention respectively ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the most . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released no later than DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG stressed that the fact that the LAW stood above the LAW in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and NORP dialogue between the courts , but was , on the contrary , its normative basis in view of the fact that the LAW was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law ( v\u00f6lkerrechtsfreundliche GPE ) . It stressed that , in line with that openness of the LAW to public international law , it attempted to avoid breaches of the LAW in the interpretation of the LAW . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
