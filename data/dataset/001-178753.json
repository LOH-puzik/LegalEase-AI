The applicant was born in DATE and is now serving a sentence of imprisonment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the so - called \u201c Rose Revolution \u201d erupted in GPE , after elections perceived as rigged . It consisted of DATE of peaceful protests , and caused the then President , Mr PERSON , former First Secretary of ORG and former NORP foreign minister , who had led GPE since DATE , to resign . New presidential and parliamentary elections were held in DATE . They were won by ORG ( \u201c UNM \u201d ) , led by PERSON , one of ORG protagonists .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was an active participant in those events , a close collaborator of Mr PERSON , and a leading figure in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , when ORG lost the parliamentary elections to the coalition ORG , led by Mr PERSON , the applicant was a member of ORG : from DATE to DATE he was Minister of ORG and then , from DATE , Prime Minister .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after the parliamentary elections , the applicant was elected Secretary General of ORG , which became the chief opposition party in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after his term of office came to an end , after the presidential election on DATE , Mr PERSON , who had been President of GPE since DATE , left the country .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE , when he was arrested ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant had made CARDINAL trips abroad , always returning as scheduled .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE the applicant had attempted to cross the border at FAC using a fake passport .", "CARDINAL . After checking the passport against the official electronic database , an officer of ORG spotted a discrepancy between the photograph in it , which matched the applicant \u2019s appearance , and the other data , including the name , PERSON , which differed from the information about the applicant in the database . The officer returned the passport to the applicant \u2019s personal assistant , asking for clarification . The assistant then brought from the applicant \u2019s office another passport , issued in the applicant \u2019s real name and matching all his identification data . After a check of that passport \u2019s authenticity , the applicant was allowed to cross the border .", "CARDINAL . The same day the Border Police opened a criminal investigation into the incident . The head officer immediately went to FAC to interview the officer who had discovered the allegedly fake passport . According to evidence gathered in the course of the ensuing investigation , while he was at the airport the head of FAC received a call from the applicant on his mobile telephone . Relying on his status and long - standing personal connections within ORG , the applicant demanded that the incident not be investigated and that the border - police officer not be asked to give evidence in relation to the incident . According to statements later given to the investigating officers by the head of ORG , the applicant had threatened him personally and with regard to his career and used obscene language during their telephone conversation .", "CARDINAL . When interviewed on CARDINAL and DATE in relation to the incident , the applicant denied having presented a passport under the name of PERSON , and said that he only had CARDINAL passports , CARDINAL ordinary ones and CARDINAL diplomatic ones , all issued under his real name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor \u2019s Office of Western Georgia in GPE opened criminal proceedings against the applicant and PERSON , the Minister of ORG in his government ( who immediately after the DATE elections had been appointed governor of the PERSON region ) , for alleged embezzlement and abuse of official authority , in relation to a \u201c State programme for job seekers \u201d put in place by the applicant \u2019s government DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant and PERSON appeared before the prosecuting authorities and were interviewed as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE opened separate criminal proceedings against the applicant for alleged abuse of official authority in relation to a private house in GPE , a resort on GPE \u2019s southern LOC coast .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined as a witness in the context of those separate criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL sets of proceedings were joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON were summoned by the investigator attached to ORG in GPE , which was dealing with the joined case , for an interview DATE . DATE the applicant \u2019s wife left GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared for the interview , which took place from TIME to TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the interview , at TIME , the investigator arrested the applicant under LAW ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She noted that the arrest was being made because , faced with a reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence and a possible punishment , the applicant might try to flee . That risk was corroborated by his attempt to cross the border with a fake passport in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , as well as by his many trips abroad , which showed that he would have no difficulties getting out of GPE . The investigator also noted that the applicant had held high office for DATE , and was still an influential figure . There was hence a risk that he would obstruct the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before that , at TIME , the investigator had also arrested PERSON GPE", "CARDINAL . DATE , at TIME , the applicant was charged .", "CARDINAL . The first charge was that DATE he had devised , and PERSON and the director of GPE \u2019s ORG had implemented , a scheme creating fictitious public - sector jobs for CARDINAL persons whereby they were unduly paid a total of CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL ) ( at that time equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) of budgetary funds for carrying out campaign work for ORG in the run - up to the DATE elections . According to the authorities , the applicant had thereby bought votes contrary to LAW , misappropriated property in large quantities , acting in an organised group and using his official position contrary to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) and ( d ) and CARDINAL ( b ) of the LAW , and abused his power as a public official holding a political post contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The second charge was that after DATE the applicant had systematically used the house in GPE , which belonged to a limited liability company under investigation by ORG , for family vacations , that in DATE and DATE he had had work costing GEL ORG done on that house with funds of ORG , and that he had caused GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to be spent on the salaries of staff servicing the house , thus depriving the ORG budget of a total of GEL MONEY ( at that time equivalent to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . According to the prosecuting authorities , the applicant had thereby infringed the inviolability of property by using an official position contrary to LAW ( b ) of LAW , misappropriated property in large quantities by using an official position contrary to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) and CARDINAL ( b ) , and abused his power as a public official holding a political post contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In their observations , the ORG set out the witness and other evidence on which those CARDINAL sets of charges were based . Many of the witnesses whose statements related to the first set of charges were current or former officials of ORG , of ORG , or of other ministries or government departments ; some were ORG party officials . Many of the witnesses whose statements related to the second set of charges were former officials of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the prosecuting authorities searched the applicant \u2019s flat . They discovered and seized GEL CARDINAL ( at that time equivalent to ORG CARDINAL ) , MONEY and ORG CARDINAL in cash .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the district prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC asked ORG to place the applicant in pre - trial detention . It described the offences with which the applicant was charged and cited the witness and other evidence supporting the charges . It also argued that there was a risk that the applicant would flee and a risk that he would obstruct the gathering of evidence , and that those risks could not be averted by a less restrictive measure .", "CARDINAL . In the prosecution \u2019s view , the risk of flight was borne out , firstly , by the applicant \u2019s having established , by dint of his having held high public office for DATE , many contacts abroad and in GPE , which would facilitate his departure from the country . Since DATE he had crossed the border CARDINAL times . Secondly , the applicant \u2019s wife had left the country on CARDINAL DATE , immediately after the applicant had been served with the summons to appear for his interview with the investigator in GPE . Thirdly , the search of the applicant \u2019s flat on CARDINAL DATE had revealed large sums in cash . It was reasonable to suppose that the applicant had amassed that money in order to be able to leave the country . Fourthly , the applicant had a fake international passport that had been issued to him at the time when he had still been Minister of ORG . Lastly , the seriousness of the charges which the applicant was facing and the severity of the possible sentence also had to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . The risk of obstructing the gathering of evidence was , for its part , borne out by the applicant \u2019s having held a number of high political posts and by his uncivil attempt to put pressure on the head of ORG during the incident on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution requested that the applicant \u2019s co - accused , PERSON , also be placed in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant opposed the prosecution \u2019s request . In their written submissions to ORG they argued that since the applicant had been a member of the Government , by law only the Minister of ORG could institute criminal proceedings against him . Yet he had been arrested by an investigator from the district prosecutor \u2019s office of LOC , and charged by a prosecutor from the same office . His arrest and the criminal proceedings against him were therefore unlawful . Moreover , his arrest had been in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The alleged risk that he would flee was not supported by concrete evidence , and was belied by his repeated appearances before the investigating authorities and his public pledge that he would cooperate with them . Also , he had been out of GPE many times and had not once tried to flee , including after the opening of the investigation . On DATE of his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning . There had therefore been no need to detain him without a judicial warrant . The alleged risk of his obstructing the investigation was also not specifically borne out . Moreover , the investigation had already lasted DATE without any instances of his having interfered with it being reported . Counsel for the applicant also invited the court to take into account the applicant \u2019s achievements in combating crime and police reform during his time in office .", "CARDINAL . The Kutaisi City Court heard the prosecution \u2019s request at a public hearing held on DATE , CARDINAL DATE . Both parties made oral submissions .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing , the court decided to place the applicant in pre - trial detention , but to release PERSON on bail . It briefly noted that , according to the materials in the case file , there had been no serious procedural breaches in the applicant \u2019s arrest or the bringing of charges against him . In particular , by law only acting , not former , members of the Government had to be prosecuted by the Minister of ORG rather than a regular prosecutor . The court went on to say that there was enough information to show that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and PERSON The other pre - requisites for placing the applicant in pre - trial detention were also in place . A number of investigative steps were yet to be carried out , and as was apparent from the prosecution \u2019s request , there was a risk that the applicant would tamper with the evidence or put pressure on witnesses . That was borne out , in particular , by the applicant \u2019s having already tried to put pressure on a witness against him . Another factor which suggested such a risk was that the applicant had for DATE held high public office and was still an influential figure in some circles of NORP society , especially bearing in mind that the charges against him related to his time in office . Many witnesses were former subordinates of his or people under his professional or personal influence . The court also agreed with the prosecution that there was a risk that the applicant would flee . That was borne out , in particular , by his facing serious charges and the possibility of a severe sentence . Lastly , the court found that those CARDINAL risks could not be averted by a less restrictive measure .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court fixed the pre - trial conference hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was remanded in custody in Prison no . CARDINAL in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that on a proper reading of the relevant statutory provisions the Minister of ORG alone was competent to prosecute offences committed by anyone in their capacity as member of the Government , not only someone who was such a member at the time when the prosecution was being brought . He also argued that ORG had erred by not examining in detail the lawfulness of his arrest . That arrest had been in breach of LAW , in particular because on DATE of the arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning . It was also hard to believe that ORG , which had ruled on the prosecution \u2019s request CARDINAL or four hours after it had been made , had really studied the evidence said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion against the applicant . There were no facts or information in the case file to suggest that he had committed the offences . The lower court had also expected him to disprove the risks of flight and obstruction of justice alleged by the prosecution rather than require the prosecution to establish those risks . Its finding that the applicant had put pressure on a witness ran counter to the presumption of innocence . He had never called or threatened the head of ORG . ORG had also disregarded the fact that in DATE before his arrest he had voluntarily appeared for questioning several times . Neither that court nor the prosecution had pointed to evidence showing that he would flee abroad . He had travelled out of GPE many times since the investigation had been opened . The argument that his being an influential figure in some circles suggested that he could influence witnesses made it clear that he was a victim of political persecution . His character showed that there was not even a minimal risk of his fleeing , putting pressure on witnesses or destroying evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having examined the appeal on the papers , declared it inadmissible . It noted that ORG had reviewed the materials in the case and the evidence submitted to it , and had checked whether the gathering of that evidence and the bringing of the charges against the applicant had complied with LAW . When deciding to place the applicant in pre - trial detention , that court had taken into account his personality and the risk of his obstructing the proceedings . Since that court had already dealt with all the points raised in the appeal , as well as with all the important points concerning the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention , there was no reason to entertain the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution , citing the need for additional investigative steps , asked ORG to adjourn the pre - trial conference hearing until DATE . On DATE the court partly allowed the request , adjourning the conference until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , citing the volume of materials in the case file and the need for more time to prepare his defence , sought a further adjournment of the pre - trial conference . The prosecution objected , stating that the applicant was trying to protract the proceedings and leave less time for the examination of the case on the merits . On DATE ORG allowed the request in full and scheduled the pre - trial conference for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The pre - trial conference hearing took place on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the session on DATE the applicant requested to be released from pre - trial detention . He pointed out that he had publicly pledged to cooperate with the investigation , that before his arrest he had always duly appeared for questioning , and that he had been abroad many times and had always returned as scheduled . He also offered to hand in his passport . He went on to say that since the investigation had already been concluded and the authorities had secured all witness and other evidence , there was no longer a risk of his influencing witnesses , which in any event did not exist since he no longer held the high posts which he had occupied previously .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution argued that the applicant \u2019s high political status and connections abroad and his possession of CARDINAL diplomatic passports and a fake passport made it easy for him to leave GPE . It was also possible that he had other unidentified passports , a device used by other former officials to get out of the country . The surrender of his passport would therefore not obviate the risk of flight . The risk of his influencing witnesses was also still present . He had already done so on DATE , when no longer occupying an official post . Moreover , the witnesses were still due to testify at trial , which was by law the only way of adducing their evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined and rejected the request for release DATE . It gave its decision orally . As evidenced by the audio record of the hearing , the judge said , without further explanation , that the \u201c request for termination of the pre - trial detention [ wa]s to be rejected \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial started on DATE , and he again sought release from pre - trial detention . He pointed out that before his arrest he had always appeared freely before the investigating authorities , had repeatedly declared that he had no intention of fleeing , had been abroad and back even after the proceedings against him had started , was the secretary general of a major political party , and had a wife and CARDINAL children . All those factors showed that there was no real risk of his fleeing . Nor was there any risk of his influencing witnesses . The prosecuting authorities had already questioned a considerable number of witnesses , and there was no risk that those witnesses would change their statements , as they could incur criminal liability if they did so .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the request in a written decision of DATE . It noted that the applicant had failed to point to , or provide evidence of , new circumstances calling for a reconsideration of the decision to place him in pre - trial detention . In that decision , the court had already dealt with all the points raised in his request . The fact that the trial had already started had no bearing on the justification for the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to say that its decision could be appealed against at the same time as its final judgment on the merits of the criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of buying votes contrary to LAW , and of misappropriating property in large quantities , acting in an organised group and using his official position contrary to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) and ( d ) and CARDINAL ( b ) of the LAW , in relation to the fictitious - jobs scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court also found the applicant guilty of infringing the inviolability of property by using an official position contrary to LAW , and of misappropriating property in large quantities by using an official position contrary to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) and CARDINAL ( b ) of the LAW , in relation to the house in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court dismissed the charges of abuse of power under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code as superfluous . It sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and banned him from holding public office for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment , but on DATE ORG upheld it in full .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s ensuing appeal on points of law inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with exceeding his power by using violence , contrary to LAW , in relation to his role in a police operation to disperse a rally on CARDINAL DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG placed the applicant in pre - trial detention in relation to that charge , and on DATE convicted him of it . The applicant appealed against that judgment , but on CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld it . An appeal by the applicant to ORG on points of law was declared inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with abusing his power as a public official holding a political post , contrary to LAW . The case concerned the applicant \u2019s role , in his capacity as Minister of ORG , in the alleged cover - up of a DATE murder implicating high - ranking officers of ORG and the applicant \u2019s wife ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . DATE , on DATE , ORG refused the prosecution \u2019s request to place the applicant in pre - trial detention in relation to that charge . The applicant was later additionally charged with forging official documents in his capacity as an official , contrary to LAW . On DATE the ORG convicted him of the CARDINAL offences , and on DATE ORG upheld the conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with exceeding his power by using violence , contrary to LAW , in relation to his role in the planning and supervision of a police raid on a private television and radio company , ORG , on DATE , and the ensuing withdrawal of the company \u2019s broadcasting licence ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . The case is apparently still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with exceeding his power by using violence , contrary to LAW , in relation to his having allegedly ordered high - ranking police officers to have a member of parliament subjected to ill - treatment in reprisal for having made insulting public statements about Mr PERSON \u2019s wife . The prosecuting authorities later also charged the applicant with wilfully causing that person grievous bodily harm , acting in concert with others , contrary to LAW . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of those offences . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a court hearing in the trial against him , which was being broadcast live on television , the applicant stated that at about TIME DATE , DATE , he had been taken out of his prison cell , put in a car with his head shrouded in his jacket , and driven from Prison no . CARDINAL in GPE , where he was being held in custody , to what he believed to be ORG building . There , he had been taken to an office where , having had the jacket removed from his head , he had seen CARDINAL men . The first had been the then Chief Public Prosecutor , PERSON The applicant was not certain of the identity of the second , as he had left the office shortly after his arrival , but surmised that he had been Mr GPE , the head of ORG . PERSON who had been appointed as ORG on DATE and resigned on DATE over allegations that he had a criminal record in GPE DATE had requested the applicant to provide information about the death in DATE of Mr PERSON , the then Prime Minister , and about the bank accounts of the already former President of GPE , PERSON PERSON . If the applicant did that , he would be allowed to leave GPE with \u201c the money that he [ had ] made during his time in office \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was CARDINAL of the protagonists of the Rose Revolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Shortly after it , in DATE , he became Prime Minister . In DATE the applicant became Minister of ORG in his government . PERSON died in DATE . On DATE his dead body was found along with the dead body of Mr GPE , a deputy regional governor , in a flat in GPE . According to the official version of the events , the CARDINAL had died accidentally from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by faulty ventilation in a gas heater . The circumstances of PERSON death are still a subject of heated debate in GPE , and ORG made it CARDINAL of their campaign promises in the DATE elections to elucidate them . Shortly after those elections , in DATE , the investigation into PERSON death was renewed and is apparently still pending . The applicant was questioned as a witness in the course of that renewed investigation on DATE . During the hearing before ORG , the Government stated that while no one had asked the applicant anything about Mr Zhvania \u2019s death on DATE , there was still a \u201c huge question \u201d to him in relation to that death , in view of the lack of credibility of the version that he had put forward at the time when it had happened : that it had been due to an accident .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he had replied to PERSON that it made no sense to accuse Mr PERSON of corruption . As for PERSON death , the investigation into it in DATE had been comprehensive , and there was no further information that he could provide in relation to it . PERSON had then threatened the applicant that if he did not cooperate , his detention conditions would worsen and he would not be able to get out of prison \u201c until [ Mr PERSON ] \u2019s government was in power \u201d . PERSON had become Prime Minister of GPE on DATE , succeeding PERSON GPE , who had become Prime Minister on DATE , following the parliamentary election won by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was then taken back to Prison no . CARDINAL , arriving in his cell at TIME", "CARDINAL . The applicant went on to say that he could describe the office where the meeting had taken place and identify the CARDINAL men who had taken him from Prison no . CARDINAL to that office .", "CARDINAL . At the end of his statement , the applicant suggested that the authorities could verify his allegations by checking the footage from the surveillance cameras in Prison no . CARDINAL . He also requested an examination of the footage from the road - traffic cameras situated along the road allegedly taken by the car transporting him from the prison to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the applicant submitted that he had first discussed the meeting with ORG with his lawyers when they had visited him in prison DATE , on DATE . According to him , he could not have voiced his allegations earlier , as he was not allowed to receive visitors during DATE and did not have free access to a telephone . For their part , the Government submitted that the applicant could have telephoned his lawyers or ORG at any time , including at DATE and during TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s allegations prompted public reactions from several high officials .", "DATE . On DATE , DATE , the Prime Minister stated that the allegations were an attempt to discredit the Government and a provocation , and that \u201c questions should be rather put to psychologists and psychiatrists \u201d in connection with them . In an official statement put out DATE , ORG described the allegations as \u201c absurd and untrue \u201d , and surmised that the applicant had made them to manipulate public opinion and the criminal trial against him .", "CARDINAL . For her part , the Minister of ORG stated that , while the allegations appeared \u201c unbelievable \u201d , they were to be addressed seriously .", "CARDINAL . The following day , DATE , the Prime Minister again described the allegations as a provocation and said that he would not take seriously calls for the Minister of Prisons and ORG to be suspended from office .

As a result of the concerns about the criminal prosecutions against former government officials from ORG , in DATE the OSCE \u2019s ORG assigned monitors to CARDINAL of those cases , including the case against the applicant at issue in these proceedings . In its report , published in DATE , the ORG noted a number of shortcomings with respect to those CARDINAL cases , including the cases against the applicant . The specific points in the report highlighted by the applicant related to the criticisms , in paragraphs CARDINAL , of the NORP courts\u2019 failure to give appropriate reasons regarding the credibility of the witness and other evidence against him , of the cogency of those ORG findings in relation to each of the elements of the offences of which he was convicted , for example the exact manner in which he had exceeded his powers , and of the quality of their reasoning in relation to the factors determining his sentence .", "CARDINAL . By way of general findings , the report also noted , in paragraph CARDINAL of its executive summary , that NORP law was generally in line with international standards and guaranteed the right to an independent tribunal . There were , however , some aspects which raised concerns in that respect , such as the practices of transferring judges between courts , allocating cases without a fully transparent procedure , and changing judges in the course of ongoing proceedings with no explanation . Another issue was comments by public officials about ongoing criminal proceedings made in a manner implying that they had some control over the prosecuting authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the executive summary ) . Public officials had also expressed their views on the guilt of some defendants before they had been convicted , which raised an issue with regard to the presumption of innocence ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the executive summary ) . The report also expressed concern about the courts\u2019 failure in some cases to give reasons for their decisions to order pre - trial detention or to reject requests for release , and about the lack of provision in LAW for periodic review of pre - trial detention . That had contributed to a practice of automatic prolongation of pre - trial detention up to the maximum statutory time - limit of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the executive summary ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL/EXT/CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG - en - GPE refused to extradite to GPE Mr GPE , Minister of Defence from DATE . It held , among other things , that the prosecution against him was politically motivated . It based that finding on the fact that even though the NORP court had issued warrants for the arrest of both Mr GPE and his brother - in - law , who were being sought on identical charges , and even though the CARDINAL had been found together when Mr GPE had been arrested by the NORP authorities , the NORP authorities had at first only sought the extradition of Mr GPE , specifically mentioning his political responsibilities in the Interpol Red Notice . The only difference between the CARDINAL was that Mr GPE \u2019s brother - in - law was not involved in politics .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , ORG refused to extradite to GPE Mr D.A. , former head of ORG . It held that there were compelling reasons to believe that there was a risk that , if extradited , his position would worsen owing to his political beliefs and his having held high office in a previous government which was in opposition to the current one .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( unreported ) , ORG also refused to extradite Mr GPE to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Having reviewed at length reports and other evidence about the political and legal situation there since DATE and the criminal proceedings against Mr GPE , the chief magistrate concluded :", "\u201c On the facts as found above ... I am not sure that the request for PERSON [ PERSON ] \u2019s extradition is for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his political opinions . I am aware that the requests may have been made for entirely proper purposes . The evidence may be there to sustain CARDINAL or more convictions . However this is not the test . On balance I consider it more likely than not that the desire to prosecute former ORG politicians is a purpose behind these requests . It may not be the only purpose , but without that factor I do not believe , on balance , that these requests would have been made and pursued in the way they have been .", "As for the future , I have considerable respect for the judiciary of GPE . I believe it is likely that the judiciary will successfully resist pressure on them from the administration , through the public prosecutors . However , looking at what has happened to others , I am satisfied that there is a reasonable chance , a serious possibility , that this defendant \u2019s liberty will be restricted ( and in particular that he may be detained in pre - trial detention ) because of a flawed prosecution process motivated by a desire to obtain a conviction of a ORG politician , or by a desire to obtain evidence from PERSON [ PERSON ] that can be used against senior former colleagues . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court described the evidence which had led it to conclude that there was a possibility that Mr GPE could be placed in pre - trial detention in order to be pressured to give evidence against former colleagues of his in GPE in these terms :", "\u201c I have heard evidence , about which I can not be sure but think it is likely correct , that pressure has been applied by the prosecutor \u2019s office to witnesses to leave ORG and/or give false testimony . ... Mr [ PERSON ] gave evidence that he was told by former [ P]rime [ PERSON , who was also relaying the views of former Prime Minister PERSON , that if he helped to locate [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s bank accounts \u2018 it would help relieve the situation of [ Mr PERSON ] as well and that all the charges against him w[ould ] be dropped.\u2019 The same witness suggested that if returned , illegal methods would be used to force him ( [ Mr GPE ] ) to give evidence against [ Mr ] PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG decided to delete from its files all information relating to Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON It did so on the basis of CARDINAL recommendations by ORG Files , according to which the political elements surrounding their cases prevailed over the common - law criminal elements . In arriving at that conclusion , the Commission said that in cases of doubt , it had to decide in the interest of the party seeking deletion ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
