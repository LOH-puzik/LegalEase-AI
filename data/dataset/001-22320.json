{"ITEMID": "001-22320", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "JAVANMARDI and AHMADI v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE respectively and live in GPE , GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in the same town .", "The applicants left GPE and arrived in GPE on DATE with a visa authorising them to remain in GPE for DATE . On DATE they applied for political asylum and a residence permit , invoking the following circumstances . The first applicant had , as a midwife at ORG in GPE , carried out an illegal abortion at the hospital on a friend of hers , who was unmarried and politically active . For DATE the applicants had supported this friend financially in her political activities . The friend held views which were close to those of the PERSON and obtained help from the applicants for the printing of a political publication . As the first applicant \u2019s superior found out about the abortion she was reported to the police . Allegedly , she was arrested and detained for TIME . She claims that she was beaten during that period . She was released on bail following the payment of a large sum by her father . Both applicants then left GPE for GPE . Thereafter , the security guards visited her GPE home on several occasions and looked for her at the hospital and at the university where she had obtained her degree . Her father was interrogated for TIME by the police in order to obtain information about her whereabouts .", "This was not the first time the applicants had sought entry into GPE . The first applicant had unsuccessfully applied for a visa once in DATE , once in DATE and once again in DATE . The second applicant applied twice in DATE , but without success . A further application for a visa had been rejected in DATE but a second application made in DATE had been granted . The second applicant applied for a residence permit in order to settle with his mother and brothers and sisters . The application was rejected . He avoided returning to GPE but , following his arrest on suspicion of shop lifting , he was expelled in DATE . His applications for a visa in DATE and DATE were rejected .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) refused the ORG above - mentioned application of DATE for asylum and residence in GPE and ordered their expulsion to GPE . The couple were prohibited from re - entering GPE for DATE . ORG observed that the first applicant did not appear to have been of significant interest to the NORP authorities since the couple had left GPE lawfully with passports issued in their own names . The couple only applied for asylum DATE after arriving in GPE . The applicants had never been active in any political party or organisation . While they asserted that they had contributed financially to the printing of a political publication , they were not able to identify the party or organisation , nor the contents of the publication . Nor had they claimed that the NORP authorities knew of this . Although abortion was illegal in GPE , it was a frequent occurrence and was seldom pursued by the NORP authorities and prosecution could be avoided by paying bribes . In any event , the offence in question was only liable to punishment by fines or imprisonment . An appeal by the applicants to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) was rejected on DATE .", "The applicants then requested a fresh examination of their application by ORG , claiming that the first applicant suffered from a psychotic health condition , which had its background in her experience in GPE . She had been treated at a psychiatric hospital in DATE and was readmitted on DATE . The applicants relied on a medical certificate of DATE , which stated that the first applicant had had psychological problems over DATE . She described herself as being persecuted and monitored by NORP spies and had given a strong impression that she was suffering from anxiety and desperation , with a paranoid psychotic character . She had hallucinated in particular about her superior at the hospital who had reported her to the police . On the whole , she displayed unequivocal psychotic symptoms which could have been caused by stress and pressures and was in need of acute psychiatric care . Her condition pointed to a distinct risk of suicide . The doctor recommended that the first applicant continue to undergo psychiatric care and advised against burdensome transportation . On DATE the first applicant was discharged as she was no longer considered suicidal and since her husband could look after her .", "On DATE ORG rejected the renewed request , finding that neither the information in the medical certificate nor the other material submitted in the case were of such a character as to warrant granting the couple a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an application complaining that , if expelled to GPE , the first applicant would risk the death penalty , corporal punishment , torture and other forms of ill - treatment and detention . Her mental health was such that expulsion would violate LAW . Moreover , they requested the ORG to indicate to the NORP authorities not to execute the order to expel them to GPE .", "On DATE the first applicant was again committed to the psychiatric ward on her husband \u2019s initiative since she was suffering from a depressive psychosis .", "On DATE the parties were informed that the acting President had decided not to grant the Rule CARDINAL request with respect to the husband and was not minded to apply Rule CARDINAL with respect to the wife in the absence of more specific documentary evidence in support of her account about the abortion , her detention , the payment of bail by her father or the proceedings ( investigation / charges ) against her .", "In response , the applicants submitted CARDINAL statements dated CARDINAL and DATE by Professor PERSON of ORG , Section of Islamology , at ORG , GPE . They also supplied a medical certificate dated DATE . According to the medical certificate , the first applicant \u2019s condition had worsened despite being given appropriate medication . When examined on DATE she was found to be autistic and suffering from hallucinations . She was also deeply depressed . In conclusion , the Chief Doctor stated that the patient suffered from an illness of a depressive nature with strong psychotic symptoms . Despite treatment with adequate medication , her condition had lately worsened . The patient was in need of care at a closed psychiatric ward and was at great risk of committing suicide . New forms of treatment were being considered beginning with electro - treatment , which needed to be carried out urgently .", "On DATE the first applicant was diagnosed as suffering from severe depression . She was found to be in a therapy - resistant condition and required continuing specialist care . There was an imminent risk of suicide but , thanks to her husband , it was possible to treat her as an outpatient . She was last discharged on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG considered the above Rule CARDINAL request with respect to the first applicant , PERSON . The ORG found it desirable to continue the deliberations at DATE and , to this end , decided to apply provisionally Rule CARDINAL until its next meeting to be held on DATE . On DATE the ORG rejected the Rule CARDINAL request with respect to the first applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
