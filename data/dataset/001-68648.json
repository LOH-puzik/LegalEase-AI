The applicant , the ORG \u201c ORG \u201d ( ORG \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , is a privately owned legal entity , registered and situated in GPE , GPE . It owns a DATE newspaper DATE ( \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u201c NORP \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE The Day published an article by PERSON PERSON entitled \u201c Is this a second PERSON for poor PERSON , or a NORP version of GPE ? \u201d The article read as follows :", "\u201c Epigraph : All of this is about her , our PERSON as well as yours . About the position that a progressive socialist , PERSON , may or may not hold - depending on which of the scenarios from NORP [ the name of the street where ORG is situated ] will eventually win the \u201c tender \u201d offered by office No . CARDINAL . Certainly , allowing for a certain margin of error , it will be possible to forecast which of the nominees would be easier to manipulate from the said office .", "The first version [ concerning her position ] was predicted by DATE as far back as the spring , and was based on the assumption that , from the point of view of NORP , PERSON [ leader of ORG ] was not \u201c nice or bright \u201d enough for the role of \u201c a scarecrow \u201d in the pre - election scenario \u00e0 la russe : \u201c the reformer against the red threat \u201d . PERSON , with her \u201c Uranium mines \u201d , and PERSON are much more impressive and the best political scientists and sociologists told us , therefore , that she was the only person able to defeat PERSON in the second round of the elections with a predicted PERCENT of the poll . Political scientists and sociologists were soon proved wrong and PERSON rating substantially decreased . However , this is due perhaps to the freedom of scientific debate and discord around the main body [ that of the President ] rather than PERSON real ratings . Of course , it is hard to believe that CARDINAL of the country 's population , watching a TV programme where PERSON battered a deputy who had been knocked to the floor with the help of PERSON 's fists , would choose not to call an ambulance and medical help , but instead would race to vote for \u201c progressive socialism \u201d . It is evident , however , that the \u201c Zhirinovsky percentage \u201d of PERCENT is a normal result in a normal country , but not one where the society is mainly composed of sick people and beggars ... PERSON special role was confirmed by the \u201c painful \u201d recounting of the number of signatures in support of her [ registration as a candidate ] at ORG ( ORG ) . DATE the highly respected President of the ORG , Mr PERSON , told us how wrong ORG was when it ignored the required CARDINAL signatures and compelled the ORG to register the nominated candidates for the position of President in neglect of this norm . But only recently the same NORP shared his insights with the public which , if translated from the confidential - emotional language used , could sound like this : all the candidates registered by the ORG ( acting on its own ! ) should not have been registered , because if the signatures submitted by the nominees had been subjected to serious scrutiny , none of the candidates , including PERSON , would have withstood verification . What then was the criterion ? Was it a presumption on the part of the ORG and its President about which scenario would be the best at the pre - election stage ? For the ORG as well , apparently , it is not a secret which discussions preceded the decision of NORP to register PERSON , who had problems for various reasons . Perhaps PERSON , who left our country prematurely and in a very untimely manner , might be able to disclose the details ? Or maybe PERSON 's election agent , PERSON PERSON , who fought for and won PERSON 's registration ?", "As was discovered , it was not the apprehension , in the event of her failure to register , of having PERSON as a wild force that could break loose which influenced the final decision of NORP , but the scenario \u201c PERSON v. PERSON \u201d , which is urgently being modified because of ORG [ PERSON 's ] alleged unreliability . The issue concerns the certainty repeatedly demonstrated by the Speaker [ of ORG ] PERSON , that they [ Bankova ] would manage to agree with PERSON , and the steady position of ORG ( CPU ) ideologists who believe that the CPU does not want a clear loss , or a clean victory ( referring to GPE ) . This provoked even more commotion in NORP . The NORP scenario that was used in the past is rusting away , and there is nothing else ! Therefore an improved scenario was introduced : taking PERSON to the second round , nominating her against PERSON - with the certainty that the fear of having PERSON and PERSON managing the country would line everyone up to vote for PERSON , including the left - wing .", "The boys at NORP are desperate gamblers because their venture might be answered adequately . For instance , the headquarters of all the main candidates who have already dropped out of the competition might negotiate and decide to let their supporters vote freely . Of course , they would not ask them to support PERSON , but to work in such a way that the motto \u201c Anyone but PERSON ! \u201d would be as topical as ever . Ultimately , it is no less immoral than the scenarios of PERSON 's headquarters . And if our \u201c green \u201d democracy has to have \u201c the mumps \u201d , the earlier the better : the acquired immunity would be stronger , as children 's diseases have to be contracted in childhood .", "In a country under President PERSON it would be both frightful and enjoyable , but not for long . Like in the GPE under PERSON . And what country - wide insanity that was / ... / At the beginning it was bizarre and then funny . He would come out , yell in front of the people , so self - assured , artistic , his voice so confident , metallic , everything clear , elderly ladies screaming and sobbing , trying to kiss his hands ... And not a single institution obeying him . He seized an automatic gun and rushed to replace the head of the police . [ He ] replaced him . But nobody cared about the new one . Then he rushed to the ORG [ Security Service of GPE ] . And here they spoke to him politely , and they threw the people he had just appointed down the stairs and promised they would have something torn out ... ORG flies and the differently coloured opposition is becoming united , the gangsters who left are returning , public servants from housing maintenance offices up to Government officials are sabotaging [ him ] , PERSON [ ORG ] is imposing restrictions on presidential powers - all of them are gathering against ORG , life is not getting any better , his personal charisma is falling to pieces , people are sobering up . Some people say : this was the LOC , it was backed by GPE . But we are not going to dwell upon the matter of who backed it and when they appeared . However , the point is that ORG is not the ORG . Had there been an army , everything would have been over sooner , citizens ... PERSON of course will seek to order General PERSON about and make him resign . This would be something worth seeing ... And PERSON will become such a friendly body , and constitutional amendments will be adopted without delays ! The heyday of parliamentarism ! Are pre - term presidential elections likely to be held in spring ? PERSON , may God give her health , will finally put an end to disputes about whether the NORP soil can bear its own \u201c Newtons \u201d in skirts . And the only prospective evil as a result of this experiment might be the complexities that will confront PERSON as a female candidate during the next elections ... Some people say : and what about the country and the people ! ? Ladies and gentlemen , do not prevent people from exercising their own sacred right to vote , if you are NORP . And do not prevent the same people from facing the consequences of their choice and their responsibility for it ...", "However , we are unlikely to see the full extent of the people 's joy or our PERSON 's triumph , as long as there remain a few \u201c real raving madmen \u201d in NORP . As a result , apparently , the blueprint of the NORP headquarters will be developed directly along the lines of the \u201c NORP scenario \u201d . And here we will discover great news about who can claim the role of GPE in our country , who had been appointed to ORG prior to the elections and later surrendered to the incumbent President [ PERSON ] , and thus largely determining the latter 's victory during the new elections . According to an information source , the scenario of \u201c the homegrown GPE \u201d emerging before the first round of the elections is as follows . At DATE it is planned to launch a mass media campaign supporting the idea of setting up ORG ( Alas ! But PERSON seems to have already mentioned the need to revive this structure ) . In DATE , at the numerous requests of the workers , the President will issue a decree setting up this committee . It will start functioning immediately . CARDINAL of the events that will be widely covered by the media is to be held in conjunction with the ORG and is to prevent violations of electoral law . At the same time , the media will launch an anti - PERSON campaign ( only the pro - presidential media will move with this idea and they will be fully involved in it ) . And then the President , in accordance with the plan , should make a speech sternly demanding that the dirty propaganda campaign against the people 's defender be terminated . The people will applaud the President and then , at DATE , he will appoint the grateful PERSON as the Head of ORG . This would be followed by an official statement of candidates - PERSON and PERSON - as a result of which CARDINAL candidate will remain . PERSON will be dancing NORP . It means that she is still unlikely to hear the \u201c swan song \u201d of her political career , but the NORP script writers are rubbing their hands with glee , waiting for the electoral campaign to be over with a feeling that their strategic duty has been completely fulfilled . One should admit that the scenario is not weak . The matter to be addressed is the extent to which PERSON is ready for the originality of those who are using her , and to what extent she is aware of the level of cynicism of the system that has been preparing the background for DATE to allow this progressive socialist to demonstrate her brilliant abilities in accounting and auditing on behalf of the people ? The chain is getting tighter and the leash is getting shorter ... However , the PERSON - guided PERSON was quickly dismissed from his post and he eventually landed , with his [ PERSON 's ] help , in rich territory . The headquarters ' script writers , commissioned by the NORP oligarch , are unlikely to have the same long - term and prospective intentions for our PERSON . However , it is quite possible that , even perceiving the danger of this for herself , PERSON will be compelled to understand that she has been made an offer she can not refuse . It is hardly a coincidence that the GPE governor , PERSON , is telling the media that he financially supported the LOC 's [ ORG of GPE ] ORG . Then PERSON will also recollect how he promoted PERSON in GPE . And here Mr Rabinovych , who started work on PERSON ratings ( \u201c Rabinovych v. Moroz \u201d ... despite the feelings that Rabinovych may arouse in the majority of the population ) , following the advice from ORG , will recollect the LOC 's prospects ... And then it will be corroborated that PERSON had been helping PERSON not only because their family and that of Mr Razumkov were on friendly terms . It is possible that no one will have any more doubts that the cool opposition member is just \u201c a loudspeaker \u201d of the administration of the President of GPE , whose role is that of ORG ( as some slanderers would say ) and is employed and paid personally . The role is simple : you might say whatever you like , but act \u201c correctly \u201d , without making the Father [ the President ] grieve , whilst undermining his enemies .", "So , if the theme of the \u201c People 's audit \u201d is outlined , the NORP plan will be launched . And PERSON 's competitor will be PERSON . The electoral palette will increasingly gain more clear - cut contours . PERSON and PERSON [ MPs ] have initiated another electoral block , an alliance that constitutes an alternative to that of the \u201c CARDINAL whales \u201d : Marchuk - Moroz - Tkachenko \u2013 the reasons are quite understandable . However , PERSON 's \u201c Rukh \u201d [ ORG ] appears and disappears now and then . But definitely there are still NORP [ MP ] and other loyal followers of the tactics of PERSON [ leader of another fraction of the \u201c GPE at the time ] , even though they were knocked down [ by PERSON 's \u201c Rukh \u201d ] . Fidgeting behind the ORG authorities on an ideological underlay with anti - left colouring . It will be determined here , DATE , which CARDINAL of the \u201c Rukhs \u201d is better prepared for defending the national - patriotic masses . Poor PERSON who is used to various kinds of \u201c kydalovo \u201d ( deception ) could not possibly answer the question : \u201c If they promise you the TIME 's office , will you go against PERSON ? \u201d After the centre - right had been joined by the \u201c green \u201d GPE [ a member of ORG ] whose main idea was to avoid PERSON 's anger while not working for him , there were no more doubts that the ideology of the block lies in self - preservation . And PERSON , an \u201c unidentified object \u201d who joined them , has crafty ideas himself . The general perception has not therefore changed .", "Thus , only the \u201c triple alliance \u201d of Marchuk - Moroz - Tkachenko joined by \u201c an active bayonet , \u201d PERSON , still remains within NORP 's firing line , and on this alliance depends how successful all the candidates will be in NORP 's game aimed at ORG 's victory . ... Sometimes it really seems that our country deserves PERSON , or PERSON ... Are we poor PERSON indeed ? And had there not been the fear that the election results might be declared null and void - such fears being unanimously expressed by the pro - presidential people - it might have been possible to think that they were all right ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The comparison of the plaintiff to \u201c a little sparrow \u201d is in his [ the plaintiff 's ] opinion humiliating .
