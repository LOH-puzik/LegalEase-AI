The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , a member of the board of a wound - up company ( \u201c V. \u201d ) , was detained on suspicion of involvement in offences of aggravated fraud , debtor dishonesty and false book - keeping , allegedly committed in DATE , before the winding up of ORG", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings against his CARDINAL co - defendants began on DATE before the Salo ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) . The charges were served on the applicant on DATE and DATE , respectively , and the trial against him apparently began on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its judgment . It convicted the applicant of aggravated fraud . The court found that the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement laid down in the LAW and the LAW had not been respected and that the applicant was therefore entitled to redress . The court considered that the redress had to be significant and , having regard to the exceptionally lengthy nature of the proceedings , it should also be substantial . The applicant had not contributed to the length of the proceedings . The court stated that it would reduce the applicant \u2019s sentence by CARDINAL , owing to the breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement . It sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his co - defendants appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants requested that ORG terminate the proceedings immediately in his respect and dismiss all charges against him . He based his request on ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case PERSON v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL ) , in which the ORG found a violation of LAW due to the excessive length of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected this request . The court found that ORG had not requested in its judgment that the proceedings be terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave its judgment . It found that , taking into account the applicant \u2019s previous conviction , the applicant should have been sentenced to imprisonment of DATE . However , due to the excessive length , this sentence should be mitigated and the redress had to be more significant than that granted by ORG . ORG mitigated the applicant \u2019s sentence by CARDINAL owing to the breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his co - defendants appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bankruptcy estate of ORG lodged claims for damages against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court informed the applicant CARDINAL times , the first being on DATE , that the case had been adjourned in anticipation of the outcome of the criminal proceedings pending before ORG ( see above ) , which was based on the same facts as the civil proceedings . On DATE and DATE it issued decisions to the same effect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant objected and requested that the civil proceedings be continued . He also requested that the claims be dismissed because the length of the proceedings had already exceeded a reasonable time . On DATE the court rejected his request . It stated that the length of the proceedings was due to the need to await the outcome of the pending criminal proceedings , and adjourned the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) . On DATE the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman found that the domestic legislation did not provide a possibility for the NORP courts to dismiss civil claims because of the length of proceedings . The applicable domestic law and practice were unsatisfactory , also in the light of LAW . However , as the instant case was pending before the domestic court and ORG , he could not rule on the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant renewed his request to ORG that the claims be dismissed , arguing that during the pre - trial investigation the plaintiff \u2019s ( ORG \u2019s ) lawyer had seen and read legally privileged documents which could not be used as evidence against him . He also maintained that the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . NORP The plaintiff objected . It gave an assurance that it would not use any privileged information in the forthcoming trial . It further stated that the appellate court would deliver its judgment in the criminal proceedings in DATE or DATE . If the first - instance court \u2019s judgment were upheld , there would be no grounds for continuing the civil proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . It noted the plaintiff \u2019s submission that no prohibited privileged material would be used in the trial . Furthermore , the criminal proceedings were the main proceedings and consequently , in order to avoid unnecessary trial costs , the civil proceedings should only be resumed once the criminal proceedings had come to an end .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the plaintiff in the civil proceedings withdrew its action . The case was expected to be pending for DATE more as ORG needed to decide on the costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen , \u201c the police \u201d ) conducted a search of a storage facility , situated in GPE and rented by Mr O. The search was based on the suspicion that the applicant had not declared all his assets in debt recovery proceedings . The police seized a large number of documents belonging to some private persons , including , inter alia , correspondence between the applicant and his NORP lawyer , C.", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested ORG to annul the seizure on grounds of its unlawfulness , since the documents seized contained privileged information between him and his lawyer . On DATE the court upheld the seizure . It found that the material seized contained documents which were protected by legal professional privilege under LAW , LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . Consequently , such documents could not be seized from the applicant \u2019s or his lawyer \u2019s possession . The court , however , went on to find that in the instant case the seized documents were not \u201c in the possession \u201d of the applicant or his lawyer within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngsmedelslagen ) as they had been stored in a storage facility together with other ORG belongings . The seizure had therefore been lawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , claiming that LAW had been interpreted in a manner that contradicted the LAW , given that he had sole authority over the seized documents . They were thus \u201c in his possession \u201d and had only been stored in the storage facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the seizure in so far as it concerned the correspondence between the applicant and PERSON and ordered the documents to be returned to the applicant . It held that the correspondence had not been in the possession of a third party and was therefore protected by legal professional privilege . In its view , the domestic legislation had to be interpreted in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the police leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the police requested ORG to prolong the seizure until DATE . In their view , the correspondence between the applicant and C. was not privileged material which had been drafted for the applicant \u2019s defence in a pending trial but concerned his possessions abroad , thus falling outside legal professional privilege .", "CARDINAL . ORG disagreed . In its decision of DATE , it held that the correspondence might have contained legally privileged information . Thus it was , as a whole , subject to a prohibition on seizure .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s request , the bailiff ordered the police to return the documents . The documents were to be stored in the bailiff \u2019s office until the decision on seizure had acquired legal force .", "CARDINAL . The police appealed to ORG , maintaining that the seized documents did not concern legally privileged information that the applicant had passed to C. for the purpose of pleading a case before a trial . In addition C. was not , at the time , the applicant \u2019s defence lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision .", "CARDINAL . Having granted interim measures , ORG granted the police leave to appeal on DATE . By decision of DATE it quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the revocation of the seizure had already acquired legal force on DATE when ORG had refused leave to appeal . On DATE the seizure was revoked and the documents were to be returned to the applicant . Consequently , it would not have been possible , even in theory , to prolong the seizure after that date . The court did not address the issue of whether the documents seized concerned legally privileged material . It also declined to examine the police \u2019s request to prolong the time - limit for prosecution as such a request should have been filed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the police again seized the same documents on the basis that they could be used as evidence in forthcoming criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police requested ORG to prolong the time - limit for bringing charges against the applicant and for the seizure of the documents , as they had not been allowed to examine the content of the seized documents due to the pending complaints concerning their allegedly privileged nature . The applicant objected , claiming that the police should not have seized the same documents twice . He further maintained that the material was privileged and could not be seized . In his view , the seizure was in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG revoked the seizure on DATE , referring to ORG decision of DATE and finding that legal privilege applied to the correspondence .", "CARDINAL . The police appealed to ORG , renewing their argument that the documents seized did not concern information which the applicant had passed to C. for the purpose of pleading a case before a trial , and which , for that reason , could be covered by legal professional privilege .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision , rejecting the police \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Having granted the police leave to appeal , ORG quashed the decision by QUANTITY votes to CARDINAL on DATE . The decision became a precedent ( no . ORG ) . The majority found that the main issue in the proceedings was whether counsel \u2019s right not to testify against his client and the consequent prohibition on seizure extended also to material passing between a client and his lawyer if that material did not relate to a pending or forthcoming trial . They found the domestic legislation in this respect somewhat open to interpretation but concluded , having assessed the ORG \u2019s case - law , that as the seized documents did not concern information which the applicant had given to his lawyer in order to assist him in a trial , they could have been subject to seizure . CARDINAL of the Justices dissented , finding that the seizure had interfered with the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . However , the applicable domestic legislation was not clear and unambiguous , and therefore it should have been applied with due regard to fundamental rights and the requirements of legal professional privilege . The dissenting Justices interpreted the domestic law to the effect that the correspondence between the applicant and C. was covered by the prohibition on seizure .", "CARDINAL . The documents seized were returned to the police and it appears that the seizure was prolonged a number of times until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings started in ORG . On DATE the charges , CARDINAL counts of aggravated debtor fraud , were served on the applicant . On DATE ORG dismissed the first count as it was already statute - barred . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of aggravated debtor fraud and sentenced him to a DATE term of imprisonment . The court found that the pre - trial investigation had been excessively long in the applicant \u2019s case . The applicant would have been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment but as he had already been sentenced to imprisonment on DATE and on DATE , his sentence was mitigated by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the public prosecutor appealed to ORG where the case is apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE , Article CARDINAL , point CARDINAL , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen ; as amended by Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which took effect on DATE ) reads :", "\u201c In addition to what is provided above in section CARDINAL , grounds for mitigating the sentence that are also to be taken into consideration are", "...", "( CARDINAL ) a considerably long period that has passed since the commission of the offence ;", "if the punishment that accords with established practice would for these reasons lead to an unreasonable or exceptionally detrimental result . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that , although there were no legal provisions justifying the dismissal of a criminal charge due to unreasonably long proceedings , such a dismissal or declaring a case inadmissible might in some exceptional circumstances , for example if their duration ruled out a good defence , be the only effective remedy satisfying the requirements of LAW . That was , however , not the case here . In considering whether there were grounds for applying LAW , DATE , of LAW , ORG held that it had to be decided in PERSON whether the duration of the proceedings ( here over DATE ) had been unreasonable . It concluded that in this case there were no grounds not to impose a sentence or to mitigate the sentence owing to the duration of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) ORG , applying LAW , DATE , of LAW , reduced the sentence by DATE owing to the lengthy proceedings ( DATE ) . It imposed an immediate term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , finding that it was not justifiable to further mitigate the sentence by suspending the term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .

A document may nevertheless be seized if , under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen ; Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a person referred to in LAW , Article CARDINAL , of the Code of Judicial Procedure would have been entitled or obliged to give evidence in the pre - trial investigation about the matter contained in the document .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , counsel may not testify in respect of what a client has told him or her for the purpose of pleading a case , unless the client consents to such testimony . Although subsection CARDINAL provides for an exception to this secrecy obligation if the charges concern an offence carrying a minimum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ( or attempting or aiding and abetting such an offence ) , this exception does not extend to counsel for an accused .", "CARDINAL .

Breach of this confidentiality obligation shall be punishable in accordance with LAW , LAW , of LAW , unless the law provides for a more severe punishment on another count .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Pre - trial LAW , only such evidence as may be considered relevant in the case shall be entered in the records of investigation . As regards other evidence , any police officer is under an obligation to respect the confidentiality requirement .", "CARDINAL . ORG issued on DATE a precedent on the interpretation of LAW , LAW , of LAW ( ORG , no . CARDINAL , votes CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) . The decision concerned specifically the course of events in the present case . According to the decision of ORG , the documents seized from the applicant , related to the commission relationship between himself and his NORP legal counsel , did not contain information entrusted by the applicant to his legal counsel for the pursuit of a case as referred to in LAW , DATE , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW . Therefore , there was no obstacle to seizing the documents from the applicant .
