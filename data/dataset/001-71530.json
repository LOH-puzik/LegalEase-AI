{"ITEMID": "001-71530", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "METZGER v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She was represented before the ORG by Mr H .- PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant , an employed bookseller , is a member of ORG ( GPE ) sitting for ORG .", "On DATE she attended as a listener a session of ORG ( PERSON ) , which arranged a public discussion and subsequent vote on the question whether an old people \u2019s home in a residential area of the town should be converted into a foster home for mentally ill persons . A ORG initiative with CARDINAL members had been formed by the neighbours of that home and further sympathizers to oppose this project . The members of the initiative argued , inter alia , that neighbours , notably children , would be endangered by the prospective patients , and expressed fear that their real property might lose part of its value . During the public discussion in ORG , a member of the ORG initiative , Ms B. , repeated these arguments . The applicant herself supported the conversion project .", "Following the session , the applicant was accused in CARDINAL letters to the editor published in a regional newspaper , ORG , of having commented Ms B. \u2019s statement by saying in a rather low voice to her neighbour : \u201c But these are NORP , these are NORP methods . \u201d Furthermore , she was accused of having said to a group of people belonging to the ORG initiative , who were standing close to the town hall after the session : \u201c You NORP . \u201d", "The applicant subsequently instituted civil proceedings in ORG both against the CARDINAL signatories of the letters to the editor and against the editor himself , in the course of which she confirmed in CARDINAL affidavits that she had never made such statements . On CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant an interim injunction prohibiting the defendants to impart the allegation that the applicant had made the impugned statements . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG concerning the editor and dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for an interim injunction .", "Furthermore , on DATE the ORG conducted a hearing in proceedings brought by the applicant \u2019s lawyer against ORG for damages caused by the press coverage concerning the applicant \u2019s alleged statements . In that hearing , the applicant , who testified as a witness , again denied having made the impugned remarks . ORG subsequently partly allowed the action .", "On DATE ORG refused to open criminal main proceedings against the applicant for libel . Having regard to the evidence before it , it argued that it was not sufficiently likely that the applicant would be convicted .", "Following the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG on DATE and opened the main proceedings before ORG . On DATE it allowed the motion of CARDINAL persons to join the proceedings as associated prosecutors ( Nebenkl\u00e4ger ) .", "On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of libel to the detriment of CARDINAL persons , of having made CARDINAL wrong affidavits ( falsche ORG an Eides Statt ) and of having given false evidence in court ( falsche uneidliche Aussage ) . After having heard CARDINAL witnesses , the court came to the conclusion that the applicant had not made the impugned statements . ORG and CARDINAL associated prosecutors appealed against the judgment .", "On DATE ORG , after having heard most of the witnesses called already by ORG , quashed the judgment of that court . It convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of libel , of having made CARDINAL wrong affidavits and of having given false evidence in court and sentenced her to a fine of CARDINAL ORG ( CARDINAL DATE rates of ORG CARDINAL ) . She was further ordered to bear the costs of the proceedings . These included the expenses of some DEM CARDINAL incurred by the associated prosecutors who had appealed against ORG judgment .", "Having assessed the evidence before it , ORG was convinced that the applicant had in fact made the impugned remarks . The court further found that the ORG initiative comprised a small group of people whose members were determinable , so that each of these members was affected by the applicant \u2019s remarks .", "The court then examined the question whether the applicant \u2019s remark , having regard to her right to freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW , had been justified . It stated that in discussions about vital issues of public interest , there was a presumption that a statement was permitted . Consequently , value judgments were protected under LAW even if they were harsh , polemic or exaggerated . However , LAW did not cover statements which were aimed at insulting a person in the first place , instead of contributing to the discussion on the subject - matter in dispute . The court found the applicant \u2019s remarks to be falling within that latter category of vituperation ( Schm\u00e4hung ) of others . By comparing the members of the ORG initiative to NORP , who had sterilised and killed mentally ill people solely because of their illness , the applicant had severely insulted these persons without having established a direct link to the subject in dispute .", "On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG as ill - founded .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged on CARDINAL DATE . It found that the provision underlying the applicant \u2019s conviction , Section CARDINAL of LAW , was formulated in a sufficiently precise way , even though not all questions concerning group libel ( GPE ) had already been settled .", "The competent criminal courts had not violated the right to freedom of expression . It could be left open whether the impugned remarks had correctly been qualified as vituperation . Even assuming that this was not the case , there was nothing to suggest that , when balancing the competing fundamental rights involved , freedom of expression prevailed .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL of LAW , libel is punishable with imprisonment of DATE or a fine and , if libel has been committed by an assault , with imprisonment of DATE or a fine .", "There is no specific provision in the LAW governing group libel , that is , the defamation of individual members of a group by a statement that only refers to the group as such . ORG libel falls to be examined under the general provision of Section CARDINAL of LAW . According to the well - established case - law of the NORP courts , notably ORG ( see , in particular , nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE , Decisions of ORG ) , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , it is possible to insult an individual member of a group by a collective term referring to the group as such ( Beleidigung unter einer GPE ) , if the insult can be linked to that individual . However , the group must be clearly distinguishable by external signs from the general public , and the victims must be determinable . It is not necessary that the defendant knows every single victim of his defamation .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , a victim of libel is entitled to join the criminal proceedings against the defendant as an associated prosecutor . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the defendant shall be charged the necessary expenses of an associate prosecutor , if he is convicted for an offence affecting the associate prosecutor . However , the court can wholly or partly abstain from ordering the defendant to pay these expenses , if such an order were inequitable ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
