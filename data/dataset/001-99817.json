As we stated in our letter to your office dated DATE , it must be remembered that according to the report of the social worker in GPE , the father and child had a wonderful relationship . There were plans to expand the visitation , to include TIME visits , however these plans were interrupted as a result of the mother \u2019s abduction of the child . If the mother were to refuse to return to GPE with the child , she would in effect be agreeing to the father having de facto custody , and PERSON could apply to the NORP court to grant an order reflecting the new reality .", "You further asked what steps could be taken to protect the mother should she return , given her allegations of violence on the part of PERSON . PERSON denies all such allegations . Furthermore , we are attaching a copy of the decision of ORG dated DATE , together with a translation into LANGUAGE . This decision concerned an indictment filed against PERSON for allegations of assault by his second wife .

We are attaching a translation of that law into LANGUAGE , and an unofficial translation into LANGUAGE . LAW provides for protection orders that can be made . Therefore , if the mother has any concerns for her safety , she can apply to the court in GPE and request any necessary protection . Her allegations should not constitute a basis for the NORP court to refuse to return the child to GPE .", "You informed us that the court ordered a psychological evaluation of the child . We must express our concern in this respect . Such evaluation was not ordered by the lower court , and we wish to inquire as to why it has been ordered at this late stage . It must be remembered that the child was abducted by the mother in DATE . The child has not seen his father in DATE . During this period he has been subject to the sole influence of the mother . We therefore question what can be gained by a psychological evaluation of the child . It must be remembered that this is LAW proceeding , and not a custody case . It seems that the mother is trying to prove that the child will be psychologically damaged by being separated from her if he is returned to GPE . However this can be avoided if the mother will act in the child \u2019s best interests and return with him .

The ORG Attorney \u2019s guidelines provide that criminal proceedings should be commenced only in very exceptional circumstances . In PERSON case , should she comply with an order to return the child to GPE , not disappear with the child upon her arrival to GPE , cooperate with the NORP authorities and comply with the existing court order for supervised visitation by PERSON ( pending any further decision ) , ORG for GPE would positively consider instructing ORG to close the criminal file for lack of public interest , provided that Ms Neulinger not commit further acts of abjection with respect to the child .", "In terms of civil consequences , we can inform you that the sole consideration in both the NORP civil courts and ORG courts , when deciding matters such as custody and access , is the best interests of the child ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of ORG dismissed the father \u2019s appeal . Having carried out an additional investigation , and taking into account the expert \u2019s report by PERSON of DATE , it took the view that the child \u2019s return carried a grave risk of psychological harm , whether or not he was accompanied by his mother , and would also place him in an intolerable situation . It therefore considered that the conditions of LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW were met . Finding , however , that the child could not be deprived of all relations with his father , it prescribed measures with a view to rebuilding the personal relationship between them . Its judgment read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( d ) ... In response to the questions put to him , expert B. ... states in his conclusions that PERSON \u2019s return to GPE with his mother would expose him to psychological harm , the intensity of which can not be assessed without knowledge of the conditions of such return , in particular those awaiting his mother and the repercussions which they might have on the child ; as regards the child \u2019s return to GPE without his mother , [ the expert ] is of the opinion that it would expose him to major psychological harm , as described in detail in the report . In the \u2018 discussion\u2019 part of his report the expert emphasises that PERSON \u2019s situation seems at present to be completely blocked . On the one hand , given his young age and his complete lack of recollection of DATE in GPE , including of his father , any visit to that country without his mother , even a brief visit , and even if the legal situation allowed it , would be psychologically highly traumatic , involving extreme separation - related anxiety and a major risk of severe depression . On the other hand , the possibility of the mother \u2019s return to GPE with PERSON , even for a short period , is totally out of the question for the mother . In answer to the question whether PERSON \u2019s return to GPE might place the child in an intolerable situation , the expert replied that it was \u2018 GPE the conditions of the child \u2019s possible return to GPE that would or would not render the situation intolerable . He observed that , likewise , it was the conditions of his continuing residence in GPE that would or would not render his situation there intolerable and that the maintaining of the status quo represented a long - term major psychological risk for the child , with the result that , if there were no understanding between his parents , an agreement would urgently be required between the child protection services of GPE residence in order to make up for their failure to act .", "In accordance with LAW paragraph , of LAW , this court also requested ORG to provide information about the child \u2019s social background , by answering the following questions : \u2018 in the event that , as she has stated , the mother does not return to GPE , who will take care of the child and where will he stay ? As the father does not appear to be in gainful employment , who will provide for the child \u2019s upkeep ? As the right of access has been restricted by judicial decisions , what measures will be taken to ensure that the exercise of the right of access does not harm the child \u2019s physical and psychological welfare?\u2019 In its letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG did not really answer the questions put to it , so it is impossible to be satisfied about the interests of the child . ORG merely mentioned the appellant \u2019s intentions concerning his son if his son should return to GPE without his mother , in the following terms : \u2018 [ I]n the event that PERSON \u2019s mother refuses to return to GPE , the father will take care of the child . He currently lives in an apartment with a roommate ; however if the child is returned to GPE , he states that he will immediately secure an apartment to live in with the child . He is currently working and studying at an institution for religious learning , from CARDINAL a.m. to CARDINAL p.m. The child would be in DATE care / nursery school during TIME . Mr GPE points out that prior to the child \u2019s abduction to GPE , he was in day care as the mother worked . PERSON advises that his extended family would provide a back - up system for him in the event that he needs assistance from time to time.\u2019 As to the issue of how PERSON would be able to take care of the child , given that he has only a restricted right of access , ORG emphasised : \u2018 As we stated in our findings of DATE , according to the report of the social worker in GPE , the father and child had a wonderful relationship . There were plans to expand the visitation , to include TIME visits ; however these plans were interrupted as a result of the mother \u2019s abduction of the ORG concluded that \u2018 [ i]f the mother were to refuse to return to GPE with the child , she would in effect be agreeing to the father having de facto custody , and PERSON could apply to the NORP court to grant an order reflecting the new ORG .", "It should be noted that neither the conclusions of the child psychiatrist \u2019s report nor the information provided by ORG are conducive to PERSON \u2019s return to GPE . Not only would such a return entail a grave risk of exposure to psychological harm , whether or not he is accompanied by his mother , it would also place him again in an intolerable situation . Firstly , the psychiatric expert observes that if the child returns to GPE with his mother , he will risk being exposed to psychological harm whose intensity can not be assessed without knowledge of the conditions of that return . In that connection , ORG is of the opinion that , since the child \u2019s removal to GPE , even if his mother accompanies him , may expose the child to psychological harm and since , unlike the \u2018 classic scenario\u2019 envisaged by LAW , the respondent has custody of her son , she can not reasonably be required to return to GPE . An additional factor is that the mother \u2019s return to GPE would also undermine the child \u2019s economic security , since the mother would be required to find a job there , in order to provide not only for her own needs but also for those of her son . The fact that the appellant has never provided for his child \u2019s upkeep and that he is known to earn CARDINAL [ Swiss ] francs per month can not be disregarded when the interests of the child are taken into consideration in that context . Lastly , it must be considered that the requirement of the mother \u2019s return is disproportionate to the reason for the return : the object of LAW is to put the child back into the legal situation in which he was before he was abducted . However , the present return is requested in order to allow the appellant to exercise his right to a personal relationship , a right which is shown to have been exercised before the child \u2019s departure under the supervision of the social services in the form of CARDINAL DATE meetings of TIME each . To require a mother to uproot herself in order to permit the exercise of such a restricted right of access , when the child \u2019s return certainly entails a risk of grave psychological harm , in view of the conditions of insecurity in which the return will take place , constitutes an intolerable situation for the child within the meaning of LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "As to PERSON \u2019s return to GPE without his mother , the expert is of the opinion that it would be psychologically highly traumatic , involving extreme separation anxiety and a major risk of severe depression , which can be explained by his young age and his total lack of recollection of DATE in GPE , including of his father . That element is sufficient for a finding that the condition laid down in DATE , sub - paragraph ( b ) , is satisfied . In addition , the information provided by ORG about the arrangements envisaged in the event that the child returns without his mother are , at the very least , a matter for concern : although the appellant has , legally speaking , only a very restricted right of access , under supervision , it is envisaged , according to the information provided by ORG , that the appellant will take his son home ( without any guarantee that he will by then have an individual flat ) and will thus have de facto custody . In that connection , ORG claims that by refusing to return to GPE with her son , the respondent is implicitly acquiescing in that change of situation \u2013 a new reality of which the appellant will then seek validation by the NORP judicial authorities . That does not correspond to the aim pursued by LAW , which provides for the immediate return of the unlawfully removed child in order to put it back in the status quo ante . Such a return can not therefore be ordered on the basis of LAW , and it is emphasised that there is no doubt that PERSON \u2019s return to GPE in such circumstances would definitely expose him to a risk of major psychological harm , owing not only to the fact that he would be abruptly separated from his mother , when she has been his principal parental reference since he was born and has been the only one to provide for his upkeep , but also to the fact that he will be just as abruptly faced with a father of whose existence he has just learnt . In the light of the foregoing , the appeal on this point must be dismissed . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... In the present case , it is apparent from the file that PERSON has lived with his mother , who has custody of him , for DATE in GPE . Thus , the Justice of the Peace of LOC had jurisdiction , ratione loci and ratione materiae , to take the disputed protective measure . As to the merits , it is sufficient to state that , since the child has no recollection of his father , owing to the process of physiological amnesia attributable to his very young age , there are valid grounds for avoiding an abrupt reunion , as the welfare of the child requires that the resumption of a personal relationship with his father should take place calmly and gradually , after he has been properly prepared for that new situation , as may be seen from the expert \u2019s convincing submissions on that point . The ground of appeal is therefore ill - founded and must be rejected ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The father lodged a civil appeal with ORG seeking the quashing of ORG judgment and the return of the child to GPE . He alleged that the court had misapplied LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , principally , and LAW , secondarily .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the President of the appropriate division of ORG granted the father \u2019s request for immediate suspension of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , served on the first applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE , ORG allowed the father \u2019s appeal . The relevant passages of its judgment read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The object of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ( DATE , sub - paragraph ( a ) ) . The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ( Article CARDINAL , sub - paragraph ( a ) ) . \u2018 Rights of custody\u2019 include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and , in particular , the right to determine the child \u2019s place of residence ( DATE ( a ) ) . In the present case it is not in dispute that the child \u2019s removal to GPE was wrongful , since the father retained , jointly with the respondent , the right of \u2018 ORG , which under NORP law includes the right to decide on the child \u2019s residence . Moreover , since the application for return was presented within DATE after the removal , the respondent can not deny either that , in principle , pursuant to LAW , the child \u2019s prompt return should be ordered . The only matter in dispute is therefore the question whether an exception to that return may be applied under LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the appellant , by refusing to order the child \u2019s return to GPE , ORG misapplied LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "CARDINAL Under LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , in respect of which ORG is entitled to examine matters of compliance freely ( section CARDINAL(b ) of LAW ) , the judicial authority of the requested ORG is not bound to order the child \u2019s return when the person opposing that return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation .", "The exceptions to return provided for LAW must be interpreted restrictively ; the parent who has abducted the child can not take advantage of his or her unlawful conduct ( judgment CARDINAL of DATE , recital CARDINAL , in DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Only grave risks must be taken into consideration , excluding any grounds relating to the GPE child - rearing capacities , as the purpose of LAW is not to attribute parental authority ( ORG judgment CARDINAL III CARDINAL , recital CARDINAL ; CARDINAL II CARDINAL , recital CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . An exception to return under LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , is therefore not open to consideration unless the child \u2019s intellectual , physical , moral or social development is under serious threat ( judgment CARDINAL of DATE , recital CARDINAL / bb , in DATE , p. CARDINAL and the reference cited therein ) . The burden of proof lies with the person who opposes the child \u2019s return ( ibid . , recital CARDINAL , in DATE , p. CARDINAL and the reference cited therein ) .", "CARDINAL ORG observed that the case concerned a very young child in the custody of his mother , who had always provided for him . The father , for his part , lived in a religious community where he was fed , and from his activity as a sports and art teacher he had a DATE income of CARDINAL [ Swiss ] francs . The custody of the child had been withdrawn from him on account of the atmosphere of fear that he had created at the family home . For the same reason , the NORP courts ordered him to live separately and prohibited him from approaching the mother \u2019s flat . Before the child \u2019s removal to GPE he had only had a restricted right of visitation , limited to TIME twice a week , under the supervision of the NORP social services . Concerning the conditions of a possible return of the child without his mother , according to the information provided by ORG on DATE , the father , who now shares a flat with CARDINAL other tenant and still works in an institution for religious education , would be prepared to take care of the child . Taking into account the laconic and not very reassuring nature of this information , together with the expert \u2019s report by PERSON ... , a psychiatrist , ORG considered that a return to GPE involved a risk of psychological harm for the child and might place him in an intolerable situation , whether or not he was accompanied by his mother . The court added that , in view of the father \u2019s low income , the return to GPE of the respondent would also undermine the child \u2019s economic stability and the mother would have to find a job in order to provide for them both .", "In his appeal , the appellant does not criticise ORG finding that there was a grave risk that the child would be exposed to psychological harm if he returned to GPE without his mother . He is of the opinion , however , that such a risk would not exist if the child \u2019s mother accompanied him to GPE , as could be reasonably expected of her . As regards that latter hypothesis , the judgment of ORG fails to provide any evidence of such a grave risk of harm , or of any intolerable situation for the child . The expert psychiatrist failed , in particular , to address that question , simply explaining that the risk could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of a possible return . As to the appellant \u2019s aggressive behaviour towards the respondent , it does not appear from ORG judgment that the child would be threatened directly or indirectly as a result of witnessing such violence against his mother . She stated that the father had complied with the arrangements for his right of visitation and that the visits had gone well . The social worker appointed to supervise the right of visitation had described as \u2018 ORG the father - son relationship as established just before the child \u2019s abduction by his mother . She has not claimed that the appellant breached the judicial instructions which required him not to approach her flat or to disturb and/or harass her . As to the considerations relating to the father \u2019s low income and his ties with the \u2018 Lubavitch\u2019 religious community , as they stand they do not indicate a grave risk that the child would be exposed to harm within the meaning of LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW . Whilst such considerations may help to determine which of the CARDINAL parents offers the best child - rearing capacities for the purpose of deciding on the attribution of the right of custody \u2013 a matter that is decided by the judicial authorities of the place of habitual residence ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) \u2013 they are not pertinent , however , for a decision about the return of a child after a wrongful abduction ( see recital CARDINAL above ) .", "As to the mother \u2019s threat not to return to GPE , the judgment of ORG did not deal at all with the reasons for her refusal , whereas it should have established the existence of objective circumstances justifying that attitude . ORG judges quoted the expert psychiatrist who had referred to the \u2018 judicial ORG that would be entailed in the event of a return to GPE , without any indication as to whether the respondent actually faced a prison sentence as a result of the abduction . Supposing that such a risk were proven , she could not be expected to return to GPE with the child \u2013 and that would accordingly rule out the return of [ the child ] in view of the major psychological harm that would be caused to him by the separation from his mother . She made no comment on that question in her reply to ORG ; in particular , she has not claimed that immediate imprisonment , or even any criminal sanction at all , would be imposed on her . Neither has she argued that in the event of her return to GPE it would be impossible or very difficult for her to integrate , or , in particular , to find a new job . Consequently , it can not be said that the mother \u2019s return , and therefore that of the child , would be unbearable for economic reasons either . Therefore , as the respondent has failed to establish the existence of reasons that would objectively justify a refusal on her part to return to GPE , it must be accepted that she could reasonably be expected to return to that ORG of origin accompanied by the child .

It does not in principle concern situations arising from breaches of access rights , in particular where the child is taken abroad by its custodian ( Explanatory Report , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW provides no enforcement mechanism or oversight body to ensure that GPE implement it . Therefore , it is possible that the case - law of domestic courts relating to LAW may differ from CARDINAL ORG to another . In practice , there is a lack of consistency in the interpretation of the various judicial bodies as regards ORG distinction between custody rights and access rights , more specifically where they have to decide whether to grant the remedy of return to non - custodial parents who hold access rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , there seems to be a trend towards a wide interpretation of wrongful removal or retention , thus broadening the scope of custody rights to allow types of parenting other than the holding of custody rights to benefit from the ORG \u2019s protection .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON and ORG ; [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , for example , a custodial parent had removed a child from GPE in breach of a restraining order ( also called a ne exeat order , prohibiting a child \u2019s removal from a given geographical area ) . In that case the child could not be removed without the consent of the non - custodial parent . The court found that the ORG \u2019s judicial remedy of return applied . They justified this reasoning by equating the ability to grant or withhold consent for relocation with a custodial \u201c right to determine the child \u2019s place of residence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG took the same approach in the case of PERSON , where a father lodged an application under LAW return of his children after they had been taken to GPE by their maternal grandparents ( PERSON and PERSON , [ DATE ] CARDINAL ) . The NORP court considered both a custody order , which gave the father \u201c reasonable access \u201d to the youngest child , and an injunction restraining both the mother and the father from removing the children from GPE . It ultimately ordered the return of the children pursuant to the Convention because their removal had violated the father \u2019s custody rights that had been created by the restraining order . Similarly , ORG found that a custody agreement between parents contained a mutual consultation clause for major changes and unusual events , which implicitly included decisions on the residence of the child ( PERSON v. PERSON , ORG , DATE ) . The court thus considered that the father had rights of custody within the meaning of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . It appears that other national courts , in particular in common - law countries , have largely cited the C. v. C. case and have followed its general holding that if the custodial parent needs permission from the court or the non - custodial parent before removing the child from a country , a removal without such permission may be regarded as \u201c wrongful \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see Re F , GPE and ORG , [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , where the father had rights of custody , even though the mother had a court order giving her temporary \u201c care and control \u201d and there was no order barring the child \u2019s removal ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the practice of domestic courts is not homogeneous . Thus , for example , ORG found that access rights coupled with a ne exeat clause did not constitute \u201c rights of custody \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL F.CARDINALd CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Swiss ORG enacted the \u201c LAW and LAW , for the purpose of clarifying certain notions , especially in relation to the application of LAW of DATE . The LAW came into force on DATE .

In connection with the federal decree concerning this LAW , ORG submitted to ORG a \u201c dispatch \u201d ( PERSON DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , of which the relevant passages read as follows :", "In order to ensure an application of LAW of DATE that is better adapted to the interests of the child , it is necessary for the legislature to specify the various situations in which the return of the child can no longer be taken into consideration because it would place him or her in a manifestly intolerable situation . The rule in section CARDINAL is not supposed to supersede the provision of LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW of DATE . The term \u2018 in ORG means that the list merely enumerates a few situations which \u2013 although essential \u2013 do not preclude reliance on the clause provided for in the Convention .", "Firstly , sub - paragraph ( a ) refers to the situations in which the child \u2019s accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not in the child \u2019s interests . If that is not so , in particular where the parent who lodged the application has an exclusive right of custody or is the only one who could be granted such responsibility , there will not , in principle , be any cause for fear that the child will be placed in an intolerable situation on his or her return and therefore there is no reason why the return should be refused . This will not be the case where it appears obvious to the court that the party lodging the application would not be able to take care of the child .", "ORG - paragraph ( b ) governs cases in which the appropriateness of the child \u2019s return can be assessed only from the standpoint of his or her relationship with the abducting parent . Where the child \u2019s accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not to be taken into consideration , the problem of his or her return to the ORG of origin will be addressed differently , depending on whether the person who wrongfully removed or retained the child ( usually the mother ) is or is not in a position to return to that ORG . If the said parent is not able to do so because , for example , he or she faces a prison sentence that would lead to separation from the child or because the parent has very close family ties in GPE ( for example following remarriage or on account of a situation of hardship suffered by another family member living in GPE ) , the child \u2019s psychological and physical stability may be at stake , because the child would , after the return , be obliged to live apart from his or her parents . Such separation is tolerable only in exceptional cases and must constitute an ultima ratio .", "Second type of situation : where , given all the circumstances , it can not reasonably be required of the abducting parent that he or she take care of the child in the ORG where the child had his or her habitual residence immediately before the abduction ( section CARDINAL(b ) ) . It is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to that ORG . He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there , with the child , the court \u2019s final decision on the granting of custody . In that context , we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother can not be guaranteed safe or affordable accommodation outside the home of her former partner . One must further take into account those cases in which the parent who has requested the return of the child will not resume the exercise of the right of custody and will not obtain it by court order , whilst the abducting parent is clearly the child \u2019s primary carer . In such a case the child would only be taken to the ORG of origin to await the final attribution of the right of custody to the abducting parent , before coming back to GPE again with that parent . Such coming and going would ultimately only have served the purpose of bringing the case before the authorities of the former ORG of residence . Such a solution would be inadmissible according to the spirit and purpose of LAW , because it would be incompatible with the child \u2019s interests . But the situation would have to be beyond doubt for the NORP court dealing with the request for return . Unless the circumstances can be established clearly , the court will have to rule that the return to the parent \u2019s ORG of origin is bearable and that , accordingly , the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation such as to justify a decision denying the return under LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "ORG - paragraph ( c ) refers to placement with third parties . If the child \u2019s return were to lead to separation from the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child ( because return is impossible for that parent or can not reasonably be required of him or her ) , it could only be carried out in appropriate conditions if the child were placed with a third party in the ORG of origin . However , such a solution should only be sought , with the resulting possibility for the competent NORP court to order the child \u2019s return , if placement with CARDINAL party is not manifestly contrary to the child \u2019s interests . That third condition can be satisfied only if separation from the parent remaining in GPE is bearable for the child \u2013 which may be the case where he or she has an antagonistic relationship with that parent DATE and if the foster family receiving the child can provide proper guarantees as to the protection and normal upbringing of the child . In any event , such a situation should only be envisaged as an ultima ratio .", "It must further be noted that , for the return to be compatible with the child \u2019s interests and , in particular , for the conditions of LAW to be fulfilled , the authority ruling on the matter has to be apprised of the situation prevailing in the ORG of origin and of the legal provisions in force there . Thus , the parties , and in particular the parents , have a duty to participate in the establishment of the facts . The hearing of the parties in person by the court ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) is therefore of great importance . The new provisions concerning the procedure and the cooperation with the competent authorities of the ORG of origin also play an essential role . The court must be able to verify whether , and in what manner , it is possible to ensure the child \u2019s return ( section ORG ) ) . If it does not succeed in that task , or succeeds only partially , it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child . The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child \u2019s reception and protection , in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent \u2019s capacity to look after the child properly . In this respect , section CARDINAL is thus directly related to the practical application of section CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The concept of guardianship is defined in LAW Law DATE . The term custody is not defined as such but is mentioned .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of that PERSON provides that \u201c [ p]arents shall be the natural guardians of their minor children \u201d . In GPE , parents , whether married , divorced or unmarried , are joint and equal guardians of their children . The term \u201c guardianship \u201d may be regarded as equivalent to \u201c parental authority \u201d in other jurisdictions .", "CARDINAL . Guardianship is an automatic right which both parents acquire and can only be restricted or removed in exceptional circumstances ( where a ORG adopts CARDINAL of the measures mentioned in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . This rule is set out in section CARDINAL of the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL defines and describes the role of parents in NORP law and outlines what parental guardianship entails in the following terms :", "\u201c The guardianship of the parents shall include the duty and the right to take care of the needs of the minor , including his education , studies , vocational and occupational training and work and to preserve , manage and develop his property ; it shall also include the right to the custody of the minor , to determine his place of residence and the authority to act on his behalf . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL sets the standard of GPE duties . It states that in exercising their guardianship , \u201c parents [ must ] act in the best interests of the minor in such manner as devoted parents would act in the circumstances \u201d .", "CARDINAL . There is a general presumption that parents should cooperate in taking decisions relating to their guardianship ( section CARDINAL ) . However , where no agreement is reached , they may refer to the court to decide the issue ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that , when parents live apart , they may reach an agreement as to : who is going to have guardianship of the minor , wholly or in part ; who is going to have custody of the minor ; and what rights the other parent is going to have , in particular as regards contact with the child . Such an agreement is subject to the approval of the court .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , if the parents can not reach such an agreement these issues may be determined by the court having regard to the best interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL further creates a presumption of custody in favour of the mother for children DATE unless there are special reasons for directing otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly both parents share joint decision - making authority regarding their child \u2019s place of residence . CARDINAL parent can not remove the child from GPE without the permission of the other parent or of a court . If CARDINAL parent wishes to remove the child from GPE without the other parent \u2019s consent , then the parent wishing to leave must apply to the NORP courts for a relocation order and an order for custody of the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
