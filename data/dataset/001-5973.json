SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants [ Mr PERSON and PERSON GPE ] are CARDINAL NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in Lamadrid ( GPE ) . The first applicant is the father of the second applicant . They were represented before the ORG by Mr S. ORG , of ORG .", "During DATE the second applicant , PERSON , then aged DATE , was in DATE of compulsory primary and secondary education ( Ense\u00f1anza General Obligatoria ) in a state school of GPE , a village situated in a rural area of the GPE region . The first applicant , her father , was a teacher at the school and her personal tutor during DATE .", "In DATE , towards the end of DATE , ORG teacher held classes on human sexuality as part of the \u201c ORG \u201d syllabus . As a teaching aid , the teacher distributed to the pupils a ORG from a publication edited in DATE by ORG of ORG of GPE .", "The booklet in question comprised the following chapters :", "\u201c Concept of sexuality \u201d ;", "\u201c We are sexual beings \u201d ;", "\u201c Body awareness and sexual development \u201d ;", "\u201c PERSON , pregnancy and childbirth \u201d ;", "\u201c Contraception and abortion \u201d ;", "\u201c Sexually transmitted diseases and Aids \u201d .", "Those chapters included comprehension questions and basic terminology .", "The first applicant , who considered that the contents of the booklet went well beyond the scope of ORG and contained actual guidelines on sexuality which were contrary to his moral and religious convictions , informed the headmaster of the school that his daughter would not be attending the sex education classes . He referred , in his capacity as parent , to his constitutional right to choose his daughter \u2019s moral education . The second applicant did not attend the classes in question and refused to answer the questions when she sat the final examination in the subject . Consequently , she failed the examination and had to repeat DATE . The first applicant then lodged an administrative application with ORG . In a decision of DATE , the provincial director of ORG rejected the application . On DATE the applicant lodged a special appeal for protection of fundamental rights with ORG ) of GPE . He complained , inter alia , of the lack of consultation with parents regarding the content of the sex education classes ; of the clearly moral component of the course ; of an infringement of his right to freedom of choice of education guaranteed by LAW ; of an infringement of the principle of non - discrimination proclaimed by LAW ; and an infringement of the right to freedom of religion and thought laid down in LAW .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE , after a hearing in which both parties had made submissions , ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that the ORG \u2019s decision had been in conformity with the fundamental rights enshrined in LAW . Referring to various applicable international provisions , such as LAW CARDINAL to ORG , LAW of DATE against ORG , the DATE LAW and the case - law of ORG , the court held , inter alia , :", "\u201c ... The right of parents to provide their children with an education in accordance with their convictions presupposes , in a pluralist society , the right to choose , that right being linked to the freedom to establish schools so that parents can choose one adapted to their beliefs and ideas . However , that does not presuppose , nor can it presuppose , the right to impose one \u2019s personal convictions on others or to request different treatment in accordance with such convictions .", "... The enunciation of respect for personal convictions , in the form of the right to freely choose a school , derives from and is based on certain legal provisions and statements of ORG and ORG .", "... LAW DATE of DATE on the right to education states :", "\u201c parents or guardians shall be entitled , in accordance with the legal provisions :", "( a ) to provide their children ... with an education in conformity with the aims laid down in the LAW and the present LAW .", "( b ) to choose a different school from those set up by the public authorities .", "( c ) to provide ... their children with religious and moral education in conformity with their own convictions . \u201d", "There is , accordingly , a clear legal link between the right to choose a different school from those set up by the public authorities and the right to an education in conformity with one \u2019s own convictions .", "...", "In conclusion , the right of parents to educate their children in accordance with their own moral , religious and ideological convictions is not an absolute right , but must be determined in relation to the rights which the LAW guarantees to other partners in the educational community , so that it is not fair to attempt to impose a difference of treatment or positive discrimination on the basis of one \u2019s own ideas , or to choose or predetermine , on the basis of CARDINAL \u2019s particular ideas , the contents of a school curriculum in a state establishment , since the right to a particular type of education is ensured by means of the right to establish [ private ] schools ; the latter can offer a special curriculum , unlike the position in state schools in a pluralist ORG , and parents have the right to choose the type of education which they wish their children to receive . \u201d", "The first applicant lodged an amparo appeal against that judgment with ORG . He relied on LAW ( right of parents to choose their children \u2019s religious and moral education ) , DATE ( principle of non - discrimination ) and CARDINAL ( right to a fair trial ) of the LAW . In a decision of DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it was manifestly ill - founded , for the following reasons :", "\u201c LAW recognises rights in favour of all those who participate in the education system , which presupposes that , in the event of dispute , a balance has to be struck between the different interests in issue . In the instant case , the trial court adequately weighed the various conflicting interests while stressing that state education was involved . In the context of that type of education , ideological neutrality has to be preserved , as the court affirmed ... . In the instant case , neutrality was preserved , with the result that the trial court \u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor absurd and thus can not be reviewed in amparo proceedings . .... Nor has there been an infringement of the principle of equality laid down in LAW since no relevant term of comparison has been submitted in support of the appeal . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
