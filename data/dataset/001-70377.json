ORG of ORG 's reasoning included the following :", "\u201c In determining the sentence ORG will further consider the circumstances in which the suspect has been , and is still being , detained .", "The following is apparent in relation to the suspect 's conditions of detention . On DATE the suspect was placed in a punishment cell . He had already been placed in a punishment cell at an earlier stage for various reasons , including an escape . His stay in the punishment cell was twice extended for DATE , until DATE , first for failing to follow an order given by a staff member and subsequently for disturbing the order , peace and security of the institution . The second extension related to the action of a number of detainees who refused to return to their cells after outdoor exercise . On DATE , the date [ of the attack on PERSON ] , the prisoner 's solitary confinement was extended for DATE for threatening and spitting on a prison guard . Afterwards , his solitary confinement was extended until DATE for [ the attack on PERSON ] , with the result that the suspect has spent a total of DATE in the punishment cell . By letter of DATE the ORG authorities let it be known that the suspect was to spend the remainder of his detention in the committal cell , subject to restrictive measures including not being allowed to leave the cell without handcuffs and fetters . This measure was amended on DATE by being limited to the use of handcuffs .", "As regards the committal cell , it appears that the roof is made of corrugated plastic sheeting and was defective during at least part of the detention period . During [ the suspect 's ] stay in the committal cell he has had no television , activities , work or sport . Moreover , outdoor exercise no longer takes place on a regular basis since the suspect has indicated that he is unable to walk .", "ORG considers that the applicant has established that during his period of detention on remand DATE which has lasted until DATE he has been kept under an exceptionally severe regime . The [ suspect 's ] continuous placement in a punishment cell , which began shortly after [ his ] detention , suggests that the interaction between the suspect and the staff of the ORG has resulted in a downward spiral , in the sense that an incident was followed by punishment , which in turn was followed by a reaction from the suspect , and so on . All this culminated in the attack on Mr GPE . It is understandable in itself that after such an act the ORG should not have wished , after having imposed an extended stay in the punishment cell , to place the suspect under the normal detention regime again . However , this does not alter the fact that prolonged detention in the punishment cell and the committal cell in restrictive conditions approaches the limits of what is acceptable , assuming that these have not already been exceeded . ORG of Justice also considers it plausible that the conditions of detention have negatively influenced the suspect 's health .", "The above leads ORG of Justice to impose a considerably lighter sentence than would be justified by the crimes .", "The suspect has also argued that he has been ill - treated in detention . However , an investigation of [ that allegation ] falls outside the scope of the present proceedings .", "As a result of the conditions which the suspect has set for his cooperation in drawing up psychiatric reports and a probation report [ reclasseringsrapport ] , no such reports are available .

However , it is not apparent that this has been withheld from him .", "( f ) The Joint Court of Justice would add the following . The said downward spiral has resulted in the applicant 's being detained in difficult conditions . Even though he is not blameless in this regard , he should nonetheless be treated as humanely as possible . If , for whatever reason , outdoor exercise , visits or other activities do not take place , then in order that the applicant 's detention should remain ' within the limits of what is acceptable ' the ORG must consider and decide on each occasion whether measures to compensate the loss may be offered , such as the use of a television or personal computer .", "( g ) In so far as this is not already being done , a written record shall be kept of any future incidents which cause the restrictions to be maintained , as well as of the ( reasoned ) decisions referred to under ( f ) , in order to determine in any future proceedings whether this decision has been complied with . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The public prosecution service has no competence in this matter . The actual execution of orders for detention on remand is the responsibility of ORG , represented by the governor of the ORG . The request directed against the public prosecution service will be dismissed for this reason .", "CARDINAL . It is clear from the decision of DATE 's date given by ORG on PERSON 's other request , for the lifting of his detention on remand , that this request has not been granted . Accordingly , PERSON has a legitimate interest based on his alternative claim against the governor of the ORG ( transfer to the ' normal detention regime ' ) .", "CARDINAL NORP GPE has the responsibility to ensure that the execution of judicial detention orders takes place in accordance with the regulations in force .

This was based on the consideration that PERSON had been returned to the committal cell in response to an incident . It has become clear in the meantime \u2013 since the prison governor has admitted as much at the hearing DATE that [ the applicant 's ] placement in the committal cell should not ( any longer ) be seen as a response to an incident , but as \u2013 in the prison governor 's perception \u2013 the only possible regime for PERSON . It has been argued in support of this proposition that PERSON is quite unsuited to detention on remand in a communal setting . This prompts the question whether this is in fact the case , and , if so , what consequences should ensue for the complaints raised in these proceedings by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Ever since PERSON was first detained in FAC there have been problems , in particular PERSON 's unpredictable behaviour . Reports by prison staff of recalcitrant behaviour , followed by the ( sudden ) use of violence by PERSON , are legion . The number of reported incidents is such that it may be concluded that it is no longer feasible to let PERSON undergo his detention on remand in a communal setting . It is now sufficiently plausible that there is no alternative within ORG , given the aforementioned conclusion , than to keep PERSON detained in the committal cell . It can not be ruled out that at some point PERSON 's attitude and behaviour may show such a change that it may be possible to return him to a communal regime , but ORG sees no indications that such is the case now or will be in the near future . It is therefore pointless to set the prison governor a time - limit for reconsidering the matter .", "As to ( b ) and ( c ) :", "CARDINAL . As regards outdoor exercise and receiving visits , it does not appear that the present circumstances are any different from those noted at the time of ORG of ORG 's decision of DATE . That means that it can once again be considered established that PERSON is given the opportunity to take outdoor exercise and to receive visits in the visitors ' area . It is up to PERSON whether or not he makes use of that opportunity . In the absence of medical information to the contrary the ORG assumes that PERSON is still able to reach the outdoor exercise and visitors ' areas unaided [ op eigen kracht ] .", "...", "As to ( f ) :", "CARDINAL . As it did at the time of its decision of DATE , ORG of Justice again finds nothing to indicate that PERSON is being denied the medical assistance he requires .

The conditions of PERSON 's detention , according to that letter , are CARDINAL reason why the ' prospects ' are ' uncertain ' at present . Although it is not quite clear to ORG of Justice what is meant by this , CARDINAL thing is clear : the letter does not state that an operation is necessary now , without further delay . On that basis alone there is no need to order any measures . In addition , the public prosecution service and the prison governor have promised that PERSON will receive the necessary medical care . There is no indication that the public prosecution service and the prison governor will fail to honour that promise . For that reason also there is no need to order any measure . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

They submitted that the boot and the trousers worn by the person holding his foot on the applicant 's head ( who was clearly also the person taking the photograph ) in the first photograph were identifiable as part of the uniform worn by prison staff : it was obvious , therefore , that the applicant had bribed a member of the ORG staff to take the pictures and smuggle them out of the prison .", "CARDINAL .
