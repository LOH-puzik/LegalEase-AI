THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and , at the time of the introduction of the application , was serving a prison sentence in the GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr Hermsen , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the body of the applicant \u2019s partner PERSON was found on NORP territory . As it appeared that she had been killed by strangulation , the NORP authorities opened a criminal investigation .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE , where he then resided . On DATE he was extradited to GPE , where he was placed in detention .", "In the course of the criminal investigation in GPE it appeared that the victim had not been killed in GPE but in GPE and that , therefore , the NORP criminal courts were not competent to deal with the case . Consequently , the criminal proceedings against the applicant in GPE were discontinued . On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant could not be extradited to GPE . On DATE , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention in GPE .", "At DATE , the NORP authorities transmitted the case - file on the criminal investigation against the applicant to the GPE Minister of Justice with the request to consider the possibility of taking criminal proceedings against the applicant in the GPE in relation to the killing of PERSON The case - file was registered in DATE at the public prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE and , in DATE , a criminal investigation was opened in the GPE , during which new evidence against the applicant was found .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested in the GPE and placed in pre - trial detention and charged with homicide . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) held that it was competent to deal with the case , convicted the applicant of homicide and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It rejected the argument raised by the defence that , given the time that had elapsed between the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE and the hearing before ORG , the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of LAW and that , therefore , the prosecution should be declared inadmissible . ORG did , however , state that in the determination of the sentence it would take into account the time that had elapsed since the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE as well as the time the applicant had spent in pre - trial detention in GPE .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal in cassation \u2013 including his complaint that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible on the basis of the fact that the criminal proceedings against him had already started on DATE and should thus be regarded as having lasted an unreasonably long time DATE was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint of the length of the criminal proceedings , ORG held that the relevant period for the GPE authorities started to run on DATE , when the applicant was arrested in the GPE and , on this basis , concluded that the criminal proceedings against the applicant in the GPE had not been unreasonably long ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
