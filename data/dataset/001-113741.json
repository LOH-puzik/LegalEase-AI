The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . According to the relevant police reports , the applicant was slightly inebriated when he was arrested on DATE and had physically resisted police officers . As a result , he had sustained slightly swollen lips and a small bruise on his forehead .", "CARDINAL . Following his arrest the applicant underwent an external visual examination upon his being taken to the temporary detention centre . A report drawn up thereafter by a doctor on duty recorded a large bruise on the left part of the applicant \u2019s forehead , a large bruise on the right temple , a large bruise near the left eye and cheekbone , a bruise and evidence of an injury that had bled on his lips , and large bruises on his neck and all over his back ( the report of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was charged with the offence of resisting police officers with the intention of obstructing them in the course of their duties , committed as part of a group in a premeditated manner ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of GPE ) . According to the decision to bring charges , CARDINAL police officers , GPE and GPE , had seen a young man running down the street at around TIME with a mobile phone in his hand , being \u201c chased \u201d by QUANTITY women ( who turned out to be his wife and a friend ) . Before the young man could get into a car parked at the end of the road , the QUANTITY police officers had stopped and questioned him to find out why he was running and to whom the mobile phone belonged . At that point the applicant had got out of the car and , together with another young man , PERSON , his friend , had begun to verbally and physically attack the police officers . The police had been unable to calm them down and the applicant and his friend had torn the police ORG shirts and jumpers during the struggle . The police had called for backup and , after several colleagues had arrived as reinforcements , had managed to arrest the offenders . Once placed in custody in a temporary detention centre , the offenders had continued to verbally and physically attack the police . In particular , the applicant had delivered a punch to the left eye of a police officer , GPE . , who had accompanied him to the investigation room to take care of some procedural matters .", "CARDINAL . According to CARDINAL medical reports concerning the examination of the QUANTITY police officers who had allegedly been attacked by the applicant and his friend PERSON . had a closed head injury and a bruise on his left eye , PERSON had a closed head injury and a graze on his right knee , and ORG had a superficial lesion on his lips and cheek . All CARDINAL police officers were discharged from the hospital on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator , with the consent of the supervising prosecutor , sought an order from ORG that the applicant be remanded in custody pending trial . The reasons given for the request were the risks that the applicant might abscond and that he might impede the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , refusing the applicant \u2019s application for a non - custodial measure , ordered his pre - trial detention for DATE . Having reviewed the criminal case materials and heard the parties\u2019 oral pleadings , the court confirmed the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the offence had been committed . The imposition of pretrial detention was found to be further justified by the assumption that if the applicant was freed he might influence the eyewitnesses , which would prevent the truth of the matter from being established . Moreover , because of the severity of the penalty for such a serious crime , the applicant might evade trial .", "CARDINAL . Photographs of the applicant taken at the hearing on DATE showed bruising around his eyes and an injury to the left hand side of his forehead . On the same date he was transferred to GPE no.CARDINAL Prison , where following his external inspection by a doctor on duty , a medical certificate was drawn up reporting an injury to the left hand side of the applicant \u2019s forehead ( medical certificate of DATE ) . According to the certificate , the injury DATE which the applicant claimed to have sustained before his arrest DATE was healing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator responsible for the case rejected the defence \u2019s application to have a medical examination carried out . According to the investigator , it had not been established that the applicant had been injured during his arrest , as the medical certificate issued by the doctor in GPE no . CARDINAL Prison showed that the injury had predated his arrest . Moreover , the investigator considered that , had the applicant been injured during his arrest , he would have raised the complaint at the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicant appealed against the detention order , claiming , inter alia , that the assumptions that he would abscond from the trial and influence the investigation were wholly unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst holding an oral hearing , ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , concluding that his remand in custody was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and the facts and arguments contained in the court decision of DATE . With regard to the defence \u2019s complaint that the authorities had refused to allow the applicant to undergo a medical examination , ORG noted that the defence had never requested such an examination under LAW ( g ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the refusal to allow a medical examination , complaining that the investigator had been acting as a medical expert in determining when he might have received the various injuries . In his opinion , the refusal to allow a medical examination had amounted to a violation of his rights under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( g ) of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge ordered the investigating authorities to have the applicant examined by a medical expert . The examination was carried out DATE and DATE . The medical expert had a copy of the medical report of CARDINAL DATE . In addition he himself noticed a scar measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY on the right temple , corresponding to an injury classified as slight , and caused by a hard blunt object . The expert concluded that all the applicant \u2019s injuries could possibly date back to DATE of the arrest , as the applicant was contending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s detention had been extended by DATE . This decision had been upheld on DATE by ORG which , in a separate decision , drew the investigator \u2019s attention to the fact that no investigative actions had been taken for DATE and that the proceedings had therefore been prolonged without reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was allegedly again beaten , this incident occurring on the premises of the court of first instance , before which he had been brought for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of having committed the offence defined in LAW and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Before the court , GPE confirmed that he had been hit by the applicant while the other young man had insulted him . Around CARDINAL people had come out of a nearby bar to back up the young men and insult the police officers . It had therefore been difficult to arrest the offenders and the officers had had to call for backup . Once the QUANTITY men had been arrested , GPE and his colleague PERSON had gone to the hospital to be treated . Their clothes had been torn . According to GPE , the applicant had had blood on his lip and the possibility that he had sustained other injuries to his body could not be excluded .", "CARDINAL . G.A. claimed that he had been hit by both young men and that the applicant had already had an injury to his face prior to the arrest .", "CARDINAL . A.Ts . submitted that he had arrived at the scene when the arrest operation was almost over and had seen that the CARDINAL young men had been taken to the temporary detention centre . He had encountered the applicant in the investigation room , where the latter had punched him in the eye . PERSON . stated that he had not physically attacked the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s friend who , according to the police officers , had been running down the street with a mobile phone , stated that he had been drunk , had felt unwell and had been walking quickly down the street , followed by his wife and a friend . When the police had stopped him to find out who the telephone belonged to , he had handed the phone to his wife and had run into the bushes because he had felt sick . On his return , he had seen that the CARDINAL women were screaming and that the police were trying to hit the applicant and another of his friends , PERSON had helped the applicant , who had been on the ground , to get up . He claimed that the police ORG clothes had not been ripped and that his CARDINAL friends had not had any visible injuries on their bodies before being arrested .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL other policemen who had arrived as backup stated in evidence that they had seen the CARDINAL young men beating PERSON , who had fallen to the ground . The offenders had been swearing and refusing to get into the police car .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal against conviction , complaining that the court had agreed with the police officers\u2019 contention that they had been beaten , without examining his complaint that he had been mistreated by those same police officers during his arrest , as well as later on in the police station . He also alleged that during his arrest he had fallen to the ground and had been kicked in the head , stomach and back . His friend had helped him up . He alleged that in the temporary detention centre a glass had been smashed over his head and the police had beaten him violently . During DATE he had not slept , had suffered from headaches and had been behaving strangely . The applicant further complained that the first - instance court had ignored the medical report which had proved that he had been beaten . Requiring medical care as a result of the treatment he had endured , the applicant submitted that he had been the victim of a violation of LAW and requested that ORG attribute the same importance to that aspect of the case as to the other facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that , in the light of the facts established by the first - instance court , it could not be found that the applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment at the hands of the police . The first - instance judgment was upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant , in which he reiterated his complaint under LAW , was declared inadmissible by ORG of GPE . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to medical certificates issued by different psychiatric clinics in GPE , they had never treated the applicant before his arrest .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after his arrest , on DATE the applicant had to be placed in the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital because of his psychiatric instability . On DATE he was examined by experts from ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) . The preliminary results of the examination showed that the applicant was suffering from a head injury and concussion and was delirious . The experts also noted , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s account , that the latter had suffered from head injuries several times in the past and that he had had a history of aggressive behaviour related to inebriation . The experts recommended that he undergo an in - patient psychiatric examination and a tomography scan of his brain and that he receive treatment with drugs and appropriate medical supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a request with ORG for a psychiatric examination of his client to be carried out in order to determine whether he required to be admitted to a specialised institution , whether his condition was a result of the way he had been treated during his arrest and whether he could be held accountable for his actions at the time of the offence of which he was accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered an out - patient psychiatric examination , which resulted in a medical report of DATE . According to the report , the applicant was not suffering from any chronic psychiatric illness , temporary psychological disorder , or mental illness . He was suffering from mild depression and was responsible for his actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the director of ORG approached the prison authorities , drawing their attention to the applicant \u2019s psychiatric problems and the suicidal tendencies which his sister and the chaplain had reported to her . She requested that the applicant be kept in the prison hospital in order to receive appropriate treatment and to undergo an in - patient psychiatric examination .", "CARDINAL . The case file shows that the applicant was kept in the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital until DATE . Between DATE and CARDINAL DATE , he remained in the same institution , but on a different ward . On the latter date he was sent to GPE no . CARDINAL Prison , and was once again admitted to the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital on DATE . On DATE he was sent to ORG no . CARDINAL Prison and placed in solitary confinement in the hospital wing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an in - patient psychiatric examination of the applicant took place . According to the report , the applicant had not been mentally ill before or at the time of the acts with which he was charged . He had therefore been responsible for his actions . However , at the time of the examination the applicant was suffering from a temporary psychological disorder in the form of brief reactive psychosis . He could not control his actions and needed intensive compulsory psychiatric treatment under increased medical supervision . On DATE ORG decided to order the applicant \u2019s admission to ORG , where he remained until his release . As it appears from the relevant medical files , the applicant received various treatments there and was monitored by medical specialists .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by the experts from the ORG dated DATE containing the results of their monitoring of the applicant DATE and DATE , the applicant \u2019s psychotic state had been triggered DATE after his arrest and he had been cured only after appropriate treatment had been administered by the doctors at the clinic in PERSON and by other doctors during DATE following his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a complaint filed by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the GPE prosecuting authorities decided to separate the aspects of the case potentially relating to the alleged abuse of authority by the police officers during the arrest ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) from the criminal case brought against the applicant and his friend . A separate investigation was therefore opened in that regard .", "CARDINAL . When questioned as a witness during that investigation on DATE , the applicant affirmed that he had been subjected to ill - treatment during his arrest . Notably , he alleged that he had first been pushed by the police officers , as a result of which he had fallen to the ground , and then the police officers had kicked him and beaten him with truncheons , causing particularly serious blows to his head . He also explained that he had been beaten at the temporary detention centre by CARDINAL or QUANTITY police officers who had also insulted him . He had fought back in order to defend himself . When he had been in GPE no . CARDINAL Prison , a visual medical examination had been carried out , during which he had deliberately misled the doctor by telling him that he had suffered the injury to his forehead prior to his arrest . He had in fact been afraid of being subjected to further ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . The police officers who had stopped the applicant \u2019s friend as he ran down the road with his phone and the officers who had arrived on the scene later to help with the arrest were also questioned . Their statements were the same as those they had made in the criminal case against the applicant . GPE added that force had been used during the arrest and that the applicant had shown signs of it on his body . However , he claimed that the force used had been proportionate , in view of the fact that the applicant had been physically resisting the police officers .", "CARDINAL . A.Ts . also confirmed his previous statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He added that his injured eye had bled and that since then he had almost completely lost his sight . The police officers who had been present in the temporary detention centre confirmed that GPE . \u2019s eye had been injured by the applicant and also explained that breakable objects were not allowed inside the investigation room of the detention centre , which meant that the applicant could not have had a glass smashed over his head .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s friend , who was arrested at the same time , confirmed that the applicant had been ill - treated during the arrest . His wife , who had been present at the scene , stated in her deposition that all she had seen was a quarrel , which had turned into a fight . Another of their friends stated in her deposition that the applicant had insulted the police officers first . However , she had not seen who had dealt the first blow .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a complaint with ORG about the refusal of ORG to grant his client the status of civil party in the new case and the fact that , despite the requirements of LAW , the investigation was not moving forward .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecuting authorities , relying on the witness depositions and the medical examinations carried out on the police officers , decided to discontinue the proceedings . They considered that the police had acted in accordance with the law during the applicant \u2019s arrest and that there was no evidence to substantiate the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment during his arrest and at the temporary detention centre .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision , arguing that no explanation had been provided for the injuries and the health problems he had experienced following his arrest . He repeated that those problems were the direct consequence of the ill - treatment he had suffered at the hands of the police , who had abused their authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tbilisi ORG examined the case without the participation of the parties , relying solely on the evidence in the case file . It upheld the decision of DATE to discontinue the proceedings on the grounds that the applicant had not raised the complaint of illtreatment either during questioning when he had been charged or when he had been questioned as an accused , despite being assisted by a lawyer during all the procedural steps concerning him . Furthermore , he had not availed himself of his right to request a medical examination or a medical opinion . ORG concluded that , at the time of the applicant \u2019s arrest , the police officers had not committed any acts which were contrary to the law and that the ill - treatment of the applicant at the police station had not been proved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , ruling without the parties present and as the court of last instance , held that the previous decisions were well - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME , representatives of ORG ( \u201c PDO \u201d ) visited the applicant in the prison hospital and found that he had traces of blows and injuries to the head , loin and back . The applicant explained that , during TIME DATE , he had been beaten by the deputy director of the prison hospital , PERSON , and CARDINAL other members of the prison hospital staff , among whom he could identify ORG and NORP He alleged that he had been kicked , insulted and spat on . The applicant , who stated that he had insulted his attackers in return , had been placed in solitary confinement where , venting his aggression , he had smashed up everything . At the time of the representatives\u2019 visit , he claimed to be hungry and complained of the prison authorities\u2019 refusal to allow him to eat , drink or go to the toilet . He asked the representatives to help him obtain a transfer to a safe place and said that he feared being killed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG commenced an investigation under LAW ( intentionally causing less serious harm to the health of another ) .", "CARDINAL . When questioned as a witness by an investigator on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant changed his initial testimony . He asserted that he could not recall the details of the incident of DATE , as he had been taking psychotropic medication at the material time . All he could remember was that he had not had a fight with the representatives of the prison administration . He further claimed that he had frequent quarrels with other prisoners , whom he could not name because of the risk posed to his life .", "CARDINAL . The deputy director of the prison hospital , PERSON , implicated by the applicant in his initial statement as having been involved in his ill - treatment , maintained that a fight had broken out between the applicant and another prisoner , PERSON , in the prison hospital yard on DATE and that prison officers had had to intervene in order to stop it . He claimed that he had not witnessed the incident personally and had only arrived at the prison hospital yard after the fight was over . The applicant had then been placed in solitary confinement . According to PERSON , neither he nor any of the prison officers had either psychically or verbally insulted the applicant during this incident .", "CARDINAL . The prison officers who had been in the prison hospital yard during the incident were also questioned . They maintained that prisoner PERSON and the applicant , who they asserted was always aggressive towards prison hospital staff and other prisoners , had had a fight on DATE and that due to the applicant \u2019s aggressive behaviour he had been subsequently placed in solitary confinement . They claimed that on DATE the applicant had burnt his shirt , smashed up the cell and continued verbally assaulting prison officers . They also stated that the incident had lasted for a short period of time and that they had noticed no injuries on either PERSON or the applicant afterwards .", "CARDINAL . PERSON confirmed in a statement that on DATE at TIME while exercising in the prison hospital courtyard he had had an argument with the applicant and had kicked him once , after which prison officers had intervened and restrained them . PERSON noted that neither the prison officers nor the prisoners who were in the prison hospital courtyard during the incident had engaged in the fighting or had assaulted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Another CARDINAL prisoners , eyewitnesses to the incident , were additionally questioned in the course of the investigation .

An independent medical report drawn up on DATE at the request of the defence found that the applicant had CARDINAL haematomas on his back , measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY and QUANTITY by QUANTITY , and QUANTITY by QUANTITY haematoma in the area of his loin . These injuries had been inflicted by a hard , blunt object and could have been inflicted at the time and in the circumstances referred to in the report of the visit of the ORG representatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the proceedings for lack of evidence of a crime . Whilst omitting the medical evidence concerning the applicant \u2019s injuries , he based his findings primarily on the deposition of the applicant given to the investigator on CARDINAL DATE , as well as on the statements of the Governor of the prison hospital , his CARDINAL deputies , the prison officers and the applicant \u2019s fellow prisoners questioned in the course of the investigation . The prosecutor concluded that it could not be established that the applicant had been physically assaulted by the staff of the prison hospital .", "CARDINAL .
