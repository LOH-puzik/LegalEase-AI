Hizb ut - PERSON ( ORG \u2013 hereinafter \u201c PERSON \u201d ) is an international NORP organisation with branches in many parts of the world , including LOC and LOC . It advocates the overthrow of governments and their replacement by an NORP State in the form of a recreated Caliphate . PERSON first emerged among NORP in GPE in DATE . It has achieved a small , but highly committed following in a number of LOC states and has also gained in popularity among NORP in western LOC and GPE . It began working in LOC in DATE and has developed a committed following inside GPE , and to a lesser extent in neighbouring GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE found CARDINAL organisations , including PERSON ut - GPE , to be terrorist organisations and prohibited their activity in the territory of GPE . It held a hearing in camera which was attended by a representative of ORG office , but not the NORP representatives . The part concerning ORG ut - GPE reads in its entirety as follows :", "\u201c ORG ( \u2018 PERSON - GPE ) is an organisation that pursues the aims of overthrowing non - NORP governments and of establishing NORP rule on an international scale by reviving a \u2018 Worldwide Islamic Caliphate\u2019 , in the first place in the regions with a predominantly NORP population , including GPE and other members of ORG . Its main methods and activities include NORP militant propaganda , combined with intolerance towards other religions , active recruitment of supporters , and activities aimed at promoting schism and disunity in society ( primarily proselytism with massive financial support ) . It is banned in LOC and ORG countries ( GPE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected as out of time the appeal submitted by one of the banned organisations . It found it established , on the basis of the evidence submitted by ORG office , that the information about the decision of DATE had been published in the mass media in DATE . The fact that the organisation had not learned about that decision until DATE was irrelevant . There had therefore been no reason to extend the time - limit for appealing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a list of organisations declared to be terrorist organisations by the NORP courts was for the first time published in the official periodical ORG . The list included , among others , the organisations declared to be terrorist organisations by ORG decision of DATE , such as ORG ut - GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against him and his partner Ms NORP They were accused of being members of PERSON and were charged with aiding and abetting terrorism , founding a criminal organisation and using forged documents , offences under LAW , LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the investigator , the first applicant admitted to being a member of PERSON ut - GPE and living in GPE under a false name and with forged identity documents . According to him , PERSON was a political organisation with a strict hierarchical structure and the aim of establishing the Caliphate through \u201c velvet revolutions \u201d , first in NORP lands and then in other traditionally non - NORP countries . It did not resort to , or call for , violence . Its members viewed ORG as a political ideology rather than a religious belief . The first applicant \u2019s main activity consisted in talking to people in an attempt to persuade them to join PERSON ut - GPE . He distributed PERSON literature and explained its ideology . He had succeeded in recruiting CARDINAL or CARDINAL people who formed the GPE section of NORP ut - GPE under his leadership . He gave instructions to the members of his section and was also responsible for maintaining contacts with other local sections of NORP ut - GPE . He knew that the organisation had been banned in GPE and therefore the members of his section had pseudonyms .", "CARDINAL . His partner PERSON gave similar evidence . She affirmed that PERSON was not a terrorist organisation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator also obtained statements from several witnesses . The witnesses stated that the first applicant and PERSON had attempted to persuade them to become members of PERSON ut - GPE and had supplied them with PERSON literature . They gave the leaflets and brochures received from the first applicant to the investigator . Some of the witnesses testified that the first applicant had urged them to fight the unfaithful , including with weapons , and they had the impression that he had called for assistance to NORP guerrillas . CARDINAL witness also stated that the first applicant had advocated the establishment of sharia on the territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s flat was searched and guidelines on the use of weapons , explosives and poisons were found there .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the case was sent for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant pleaded not guilty . He admitted his membership of NORP ut - PERSON and confirmed his previous description of its activities and ideology . He insisted that it was not a terrorist organisation and that it condemned any use of violence . He repudiated in part his previous statement , stating that it had been given under pressure , and denied any attempts to persuade people to join PERSON . He further stated that the guidelines found in his flat had been planted by the police .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s partner PERSON denied being a member of PERSON and stated that she had not known about its being banned in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The trial court then questioned witnesses called by the prosecution , who confirmed the statements they had given during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the trial court examined the leaflets and brochures distributed by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the first applicant guilty of aiding and abetting terrorism , founding a criminal organisation and using forged documents ( LAW , LAW and LAW ) . Referring to the witness testimony , the first applicant \u2019s statements to the investigator and documentary evidence , the court found it established that the first applicant , being a member of PERSON , had founded a local section of that organisation and , in the period from DATE to DATE , had recruited new members and distributed the organisation \u2019s literature . The court analysed the contents of the leaflets and brochures distributed by the first applicant and found that they proclaimed the superiority of ORG over other religions and political ideologies , such as communism and capitalism , and advocated intolerance towards non - NORP . They also rejected democratic principles as incompatible with the rules of sharia . They declared war on governments which were not based on ORG and called for their overthrow , including by violent methods . They urged members of PERSON to take part in the sacred war ( jihad ) . By stating that jihad was not a defensive war but a struggle to expand ORG , which had to be carried out even if the \u201c unfaithful \u201d did not attack NORP , the documents in question openly advocated and glorified warfare in the name of Allah . They also stated that such countries as GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE were enemy GPE and that war had to be declared against any ORG that occupied NORP lands . ORG above enemy States should not be allowed to enter NORP states and it should be permitted to kill them and take their property if they were not NORP . Referring to the contents of the above - mentioned leaflets and brochures , the contents of the guidelines on the use of weapons , explosives and poisons found in the first applicant \u2019s flat and ORG decision of DATE , the court concluded that the local section of NORP ut - GPE founded by the first applicant was a terrorist organisation . The court also found it established that the first applicant had known about ORG decision of DATE . His actions had therefore amounted to incitement to participate in the activities of a terrorist organisation , punishable under LAW , and to founding of a criminal organisation , punishable under LAW of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court sentenced the first applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions on appeal the first applicant stated that he had never called for or resorted to violence . Nor had he been involved in any terrorist activities . His conviction for spreading NORP ideology had breached his right to freedom of speech and opinion . He also argued that the trial court had incorrectly interpreted the religious terminology contained in PERSON ut - GPE \u2019s literature . Given that the trial judge did not have sufficient knowledge of religious matters , an expert opinion should have been ordered . Finally , the first applicant submitted that he had had no knowledge of the decision of ORG banning PERSON as that decision had never been officially published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the conviction on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE decided to bring the applicant \u2019s sentence into conformity with the recent amendments to LAW . It found that incitement to participate in the activities of a terrorist organisation was no longer classified as adding or abetting terrorism in the new version of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court therefore decided to set aside the conviction under LAW and reduce the first applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant finished serving his sentence . He is now facing extradition proceedings to GPE , where criminal proceedings are pending against him in relation to his membership of ORG ut - GPE . On DATE he disappeared from GPE and his current whereabouts are unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the second applicant and CARDINAL other persons by the LOC regional prosecutor \u2019s office . They were accused of being members of ORG ut - GPE and charged with aiding and abetting terrorism , an offence under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , and founding and membership of an extremist organisation , an offence under LAW and QUANTITY of LAW .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by the investigator , the second applicant admitted to being a member of ORG ut - GPE and , since DATE , the leader of its local sections in LOC and Tobolsk . Their aim was to establish the Caliphate in LOC . He had learned that the organisation had been banned in GPE in the course of his interview with the police in DATE . The meetings of the local sections had all been held in secret . He had chaired the meetings , had admitted new members , had distributed PERSON literature and had explained its ideology . He had also been responsible for maintaining contacts with the GPE section of NORP ut - GPE .", "CARDINAL . His co - defendants gave similar evidence . They confirmed the second applicant \u2019s leadership position and his regular contact with other local sections of ORG ut - GPE in GPE . During their regular and secret meetings they had read PERSON literature and discussed its aims , among which had been recruitment of new members and dissemination of ORG ut - GPE \u2019s ideology among the population through media publications and distribution of leaflets . The issues they had discussed during the meetings were often political rather than religious . Members of the organisation had to give an oath , pay contributions and obey orders by the leaders . They considered themselves part of the international organisation NORP ut - PERSON . Some of them stated that they knew that the organisation had been banned in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The investigator also obtained statements from several witnesses . The witnesses stated that the defendants had attempted to persuade them to become members of ORG ut - GPE and had supplied them with the organisation \u2019s literature .", "CARDINAL . The GPE flats were searched and multiple copies of ORG literature and leaflets were found there . Some of those leaflets criticised the authorities\u2019 decision to ban ORG ut - GPE and the ensuing arrests and criminal proceedings against its members . It was also discovered that documents containing PERSON ut - GPE \u2019s texts and information about its activities were stored on the hard disk of the second applicant \u2019s computer and several floppy disks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the case was sent for trial before ORG . All defendants , including the second applicant , repudiated their previous statements , stating that they had been given under duress , and pleaded not guilty .", "CARDINAL . They admitted to being followers of ORG ut - GPE \u2019s ideology but denied being members of the organisation . They had gathered regularly and openly to read NORP texts and discuss religious issues . All the texts had been printed out from the Internet and none of them had been banned or recognised as extremist . They had never planned or participated in any terrorist activities , nor had they incited others to commit terrorist acts . They were opposed to violence and strived to achieve their aim , namely establishment of the ORG , through ideological and political struggle .", "CARDINAL . The trial court then questioned witnesses called by the prosecution . Some of them confirmed the evidence they had given during the investigation , while the others repudiated their previous statements .", "CARDINAL . The court also listened to audio recordings and watched video recordings of the defendants\u2019 meetings . During the meetings the defendants discussed the ideology and aims of ORG ut - GPE , its structure and the methods employed by it . The second applicant and his assistant had been the principal spokesmen . They had instructed the others that orders should be immediately obeyed and had warned that those who refused to obey would be punished . They had also explained that the local section \u2019s main activities were to be proselytism , involvement of new members and establishment of contacts with high - ranking ORG officials . During CARDINAL of the meetings the defendants had discussed the possibility of obtaining arms and explosives and committing terrorist acts . During another meeting the second applicant \u2019s assistant had stated the following :", "\u201c \u2018 I am astonished why you have NORP here , why you have so many of them accumulated?\u2019", "\u2018 We have overseers in CARDINAL towns , I mean our supporters . The criminal world supports us . PERSON supports us . In our town the [ criminals ] support us.\u2019", "\u2018 You should have hate , fury ... You should be a wolf , you should attack . You should not be afraid of burying someone in asphalt , when someone is assaulted you should join in , you should make a contribution to violence . You should be like that . NORP are foul people , they act in an underhand way . They will not carry out an attack themselves , they will hire someone . They are sly and rich , they control the town thanks to their PERSON \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further examined the contents of the Internet site maintained by ORG ut - GPE and the literature found in the GPE flats .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court examined expert reports submitted by the prosecutor . A panel composed of experts in religious , political and linguistic matters examined the literature found during the search of the GPE flats and the audio and video recordings . The experts concluded that the documents and recordings contained religious and political propaganda on behalf of ORG ut - GPE . Some of them contained radical fundamentalist statements accepting and advocating the use of violence and armed struggle in the form of jihad . Therefore , there were reasons to consider that PERSON utTahrir \u2019s literature was extremist in nature and that its dissemination amounted to pro - terrorism propaganda . The documents under examination advocated the idea that all existing GPE and governments were illegitimate as they were not based on ORG and called for their overthrow , including by violent methods , for the universal NORP of mankind and for the establishment of a \u201c Worldwide NORP Caliphate \u201d ; in other words , they called for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and the forcible taking over of the government in all countries . The experts noted that although the documents did not indicate clearly the methods by which the organisation \u2019s aims were to be achieved and did not openly call for the commission of terrorist acts , they unambiguously rejected any possibility of the organisation \u2019s participation in the democratic political process . It followed , in the experts\u2019 opinion , that its aim of taking over governments could only be achieved through the use of violence . The documents also contained ideas promoting the superiority of NORP over adherents of other religions and consistent calls for confrontation between NORP fundamentalists and all others . They were capable of creating hostility and disunity in society . Finally , the linguistic experts found that the documents under examination were highly manipulative and capable of influencing the mind and the will of the reader . They employed professional manipulation techniques . Thus , they twisted the meanings of some words , for example interpreting \u201c terrorism \u201d as acts of violence against NORP only , while the same acts against adherents of other religions were described as sacred war against non - believers ( jihad ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial court questioned CARDINAL of the experts , who confirmed his findings . He added that ORG ut - GPE was an extremist organisation that was intolerant towards other religions . It called for violence against non - believers , which might be interpreted as incitement to terrorism .", "CARDINAL . The experts called by the defence disputed the above findings . CARDINAL of the experts , a co - president of ORG of GPE , stated to the court that PERSON ut - GPE was not a terrorist organisation and was not involved in the commission of any terrorist acts . Its ideology was utopian and unrealistic . Its main activity was NORP proselytism . According to its texts , the ORG was to be established by peaceful methods . Another expert also testified that the members of ORG ut - GPE were not violent and did not present any danger to national security .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the second applicant and his co - defendants guilty as charged . Referring to the witness testimony , the GPE statements to the investigator , the audio and video recordings of the GPE meetings and the expert opinions , the court found it established that since DATE the defendants had been members of PERSON . That organisation had been declared to be a terrorist and extremist organisation and banned by ORG . Given that ORG decision had been duly published , that the second applicant had been informed about its contents in DATE in the course of his interview with the police in connection with a similar criminal case and that leaflets criticising that decision and the ensuing arrests and criminal proceedings against members of PERSON had been found in the GPE flats , ORG found it established that the defendants knew about ORG decision banning PERSON . Despite that fact , they had not stopped their activities as members of ORG ut - GPE and had continued to hold secret meetings , recruit new members and distribute the organisation \u2019s literature . The documents distributed by the defendants were extremist as they advocated violence , rejected the rule of law and encouraged hatred towards adherents of other religions . Their actions had therefore amounted to founding and membership of a banned extremist organisation , punishable under LAW of LAW , and to incitement to participate in the activities of a terrorist organisation , punishable under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court sentenced the second applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment for the offence under LAW and to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the offence under LAW . The aggregate sentence was fixed at CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions on appeal the second applicant stated that he had never committed any terrorist acts or been involved in any terrorist activities . He and his co - defendants had gathered to read NORP literature and to discuss religious issues . His conviction had therefore violated his rights under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Information on the nature and activities of ORG ut - GPE is scarce and contradictory . The most comprehensive report was prepared by ORG in DATE . The report , entitled \u201c Radical ORG in LOC : Responding to PERSON \u201d , reads , as far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c PERSON ut - GPE is not a religious organisation , but rather a political party whose ideology is based on ORG . It aims to re - establish the historical Caliphate in order to bring together all NORP lands under NORP rule and establish a state capable of counterbalancing the West . It rejects contemporary efforts to establish NORP states , asserting that GPE and GPE do not meet the necessary criteria . According to PERSON , the NORP state is one in which NORP law \u2013 Sharia \u2013 is applied to all walks of life , and there is no compromise with other forms of legislation .", "ORG ut - GPE claims to reject violence as a form of political struggle , and most of its activities are peaceful . In theory , the group rejects terrorism , considering the killing of innocents to be against NORP law . However , behind this rhetoric , there is some ideological justification for violence in its literature , and it admits participation in a number of failed coup attempts in LOC . It also has contacts with some groups much less scrupulous about violence . But despite the allegations of governments , there is no proof of its involvement in terrorist activities in LOC or elsewhere .", "Government responses have been contradictory and often ineffective . In much of LOC , the organisation is banned from acting openly , and many of its members have been imprisoned . NORP governments have taken particularly harsh stances , with GPE leading the way by arresting and sentencing CARDINAL of members to long prison terms . In some other NORP countries , such as GPE , PERSON ut - GPE acts more or less openly , as it does in much of LOC ...", "The party \u2019s writings elaborate CARDINAL stages of political struggle , based on its interpretation of the historical mission of the Prophet PERSON in establishing the first NORP state :", "The First : The stage of culturing ; this involves finding and cultivating individuals who are convinced by the thought and method of the party . This is necessary in order to formulate and establish a group capable of carrying the party \u2019s ideas .", "The Second : The stage of interaction with the ORG ( wider NORP community ) in order to encourage the ORG to work for ORG and to carry the Da\u2019wah ( message ) as if it was its own , and so that it works to establish NORP in life , state and society .", "The Third : The stage of taking the government and implementing ORG completely and totally , and carrying its message to the world .", "The first stage is the most important in present party activity and CARDINAL of the keys to its longevity . It is based on finding appropriate members and moulding them to its thinking ...", "The second stage involves : \u2018 Collective culturing of the masses ... through organising lessons in the FAC , conferences , lectures , places of public gathering , newspapers , books and leaflets ... \u2019 PERSON ut - GPE is very effective at spreading its views through wide publication of books and leaflets in multiple languages and a network of well - run websites that provide access to most of the party \u2019s literature .", "Through these CARDINAL stages of political work , PERSON ut - GPE claims that it can develop mass understanding of its ideas ( although not necessarily mass membership ) , and most importantly that it can persuade influential figures in politics , the military and elsewhere to act in accordance with its program and aims . The party actively attempts to recruit well - educated members of society , particularly those in positions that allow them to influence popular opinion .", "Getting from this position \u2013 wide acceptance of ideas , and some influence on those who are capable of influencing policy DATE to establishment of an NORP state is the essence of the third stage of political struggle . It is this stage , the actual seizure of power , and the establishment of the NORP state , that is most murky in the literature . In most of its writings PERSON rejects participation in parliamentary democracy , or any alliances with other political parties to gain power ...", "There is little doubt about ORG ut - GPE \u2019s disregard for democracy . It rejects the concept as a NORP , anti - NORP invention and is not interested in acting as a party within an open political system . A recent publication claims : \u2018 Democracy ... is considered a kufr [ unbelievers ] system , it is in clear contradiction with the Qu\u2019ran and GPE ...", "It is widely reported that ORG ut - GPE , both in LOC and beyond , eschews violence to achieve its ends . Some human rights activists have argued that it is essentially a peaceful group that operates only in the realm of ideas and propaganda . It has never been proven to have been involved in any violence in LOC , and in its other global activities it has generally pursued its aims through peaceful propaganda . It is strongly opposed to GPE policy in LOC , but does not call for terrorist actions against GPE . Indeed , it claims to be opposed to terrorist activity and asserts that the killing of innocent civilians is against NORP law . Its literature is straightforward , claiming that \u2018 ... military struggle is not the method of re - establishing the Khilafah\u2019 ...", "Yet the view that ORG ut - GPE is opposed to political violence per se is mistaken . The situation is much more nuanced than most researchers allow ... CARDINAL scholar explains :", "\u2018 ... in practical terms an - PERSON argued that a regime could be brought down through acts of civil disobedience such as strikes , noncooperation with the authorities or demonstrations , or through a procession to the palace or presidential residence , provided that the movement enjoys exclusive control and leadership ... Alternatively , it could be toppled through a military coup executed by forces that have agreed to hand over power to the movement.\u2019", "However , ORG ut - ORG argues that as a political party it does not undertake any physical or violent actions . So how can it justify involvement in a military coup ?", "\u2018 ORG ut - GPE itself eschews the use of force [ but ] ... internal sources argue that groups pledging the party their back - up can use arms ... if society stands against the regime its removal even by military force does not constitute an act of violence : this would be the case only if the party were to kill its opponents to arrive in power , for example.\u2019 ...", "What this means in practice is not certain , but it could clearly be interpreted as seeking military assistance from other groups , should members be experiencing considerable harm , or in the broadest sense to establish the ORG . In this way , the party remains committed to its intellectual and political struggle but does not rule out seeking assistance from other groups , including some that will take military action on its behalf ...", "The party \u2019s interpretation of jihad is also somewhat confused at first glance ... A member in GPE explained : \u2018 There are CARDINAL types of jihad : the physical and the spiritual . The physical jihad will come after the establishment of the Caliphate . The spiritual is for now\u2019 ...", "Although the main jihad is not expected until the ORG is introduced , this does not mean that NORP should not fight defensive wars . Thus , NORP , PERSON ut - GPE members included , are enjoined to fight against an invader if attacked ...", "There is much loose rhetoric about jihad in party leaflets , which does not always underline these distinctions . And there is clearly some potential for a defensive jihad to be interpreted in a very broad fashion . But the main thrust of ORG ut - GPE thinking seems to have remained intact : the jihad will come when the ORG is established ...", "Historically , the party \u2019s record provides no evidence of it being involved in terrorist activity against civilians , or in military actions against GPE or Western interests . But there is good evidence of its involvement in a series of failed coups and attempts to overthrow governments in LOC . Some of the evidence for these incidents is disputed , but it seems clear that PERSON ut - GPE was involved in an attempted coup PERSON in GPE on several occasions in DATE and DATE . It was also accused of involvement in an attack on the military academy in GPE in DATE , interpreted by the government as preparation for a coup . Far from denying involvement , party representatives admit that , \u2018 It is no secret that ORG ut - GPE has been involved in a number of failed coup attempts in the GPE ...", "Thus while it seems clear that ideologically and practically PERSON can not be classified as a terrorist group , it is willing to persuade militaries to overthrow their governments , and in certain cases be involved in such military coups itself . Should it ever come to power , its willingness to use violence as an NORP state would be more certain : it consistently emphasises that the duty of the NORP state is to carry out military campaigns to free NORP lands from the rule of \u2018 ORG and to wage war against GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report goes on to describe the position of ORG ut - GPE in western LOC :", "\u201c According to the ORG ut - GPE leader in GPE , PERSON , the party is growing by actively recruiting second - generation NORP immigrants ... The party \u2019s popularity among NORP in the LOC has continued to grow , providing it a strong organisational , and possibly financial , base .", "GPE became the first NORP state to ban ORG ut - GPE in DATE , citing its anti - NORP and anti - NORP propaganda . However , the NORP authorities did not provide any evidence of links between it and terrorist groups . NORP security forces carried out further raids on known activists , now working illegally , in DATE .", "In GPE the party has also garnered support among immigrants . In DATE its leader , PERSON , was convicted of breaking anti - racism laws , after he handed out leaflets allegedly calling for NORP to be killed . The group claims the quotes were taken out of context . The government has apparently considered banning the party , which according to media reports has CARDINAL members .", "In the GPE PERSON remains very active , particularly in GPE and in towns with major NORP populations such as GPE , GPE and GPE . It has been notably successful in recruiting students , although it has been banned from many university campuses , because of its anti - Semitism , alleged threatening behaviour towards students of other faiths , and public objections to homosexuality ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Human Rights Watch notes in its DATE report \u201c Creating Enemies of the ORG . Religious Persecution in GPE \u201d :", "\u201c PERSON ut - GPE renounces violence as a means to achieve reestablishment of the ORG . However , it does not reject the use of violence during armed conflicts already under way and in which the group regards NORP as struggling against oppressors , such as NORP violence against NORP occupation . Its literature denounces secularism and Western - style democracy . Its anti - NORP and anti - GPE statements have led the government of GPE to ban it ... Some in the diplomatic community , in particular the GPE government , consider NORP ut - GPE to be a political organization and therefore argue that imprisoned NORP ut - GPE members are not victims of religious persecution . But religion and politics are inseparable in PERSON ut - GPE \u2019s ideology and activities ... Even if CARDINAL accepts that there is a political component to ORG ut - GPE \u2019s ideology , methods , and goals , this does not vitiate the right of that group \u2019s members to be protected from religion - based persecution ...", "ORG ut - GPE \u2019s designation as a nonviolent organization has been contested . PERSON ut - GPE literature does not renounce violence in armed struggles already under way ORG and GPE , GPE , and LOC \u2013 in which it views NORP as the victims of persecution . But PERSON ut - GPE members have consistently rejected the use of violence to achieve the aim of reestablishing the Caliphate , which they believe will only be legitimate if created the same way they believe the Prophet PERSON created the original Caliphate , and which can occur only as a result of gradual \u2018 ORG among NORP ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Another report on ORG ut - GPE \u2019s activities , entitled \u201c Whether PERSON ut - GPE is an extremist organisation ? \u201d , was published on DATE by ORG , a NORP nongovernmental organisation . The report states , in particular , that following ORG decision of DATE banning PERSON ut - GPE , many of its members were charged with aiding and abetting terrorism , membership of a criminal organisation , membership of an extremist organisation or unlawful possession of arms . The first applicant was the first to be convicted at final instance . Many other convictions followed thereafter .", "CARDINAL . The report further states that the analysis of ORG ut - GPE \u2019s literature reveals that that organisation openly and unequivocally rejects democratic principles and political freedoms , such as freedom of religion and freedom of thought , declaring that they are contrary to ORG . Moreover , the literature declares that it is justified to use violence to fight democracy . However , it affirms that such violence will be used only after the establishment of the ORG and the commencement of jihad . Although there are CARDINAL commonly accepted meanings of this term in GPE , PERSON utTahrir \u2019s literature almost always means holy war when speaking of jihad . Many countries , such as GPE and GPE , are declared to be enemy GPE which should be fought against already , including by violent methods . PERSON , however , does not directly call upon its members to participate in that fight . PERSON expresses its support to NORP separatists , even though it condemns terrorist acts against the civil population committed on NORP territory , at the same time denying the possibility of involvement of NORP separatists in such acts . It should be also noted that PERSON does not use the term \u201c terrorism \u201d in its common meaning , considering any violent acts against enemy GPE , including those that would be normally classified as terrorist acts , to constitute part of holy war . The report cites PERSON document entitled \u201c The NORP rule on hijacking aeroplanes \u201d , which states that it is justified to hijack civil aeroplanes of enemy GPE and kill their passengers because the citizens of such GPE and their property constitute legitimate war targets . That document was deleted from PERSON website DATE , but no statements disavowing its contents have ever been made by the organisation \u2019s leadership , which gives cause to believe that it has been deleted for the purposes of secrecy . As regards the means for the establishment of the ORG , ORG ut - GPE \u2019s literature is not clear on this point . It is certain that the organisation rejects the possibility of participation in parliamentary elections or any other democratic process in order to come to power . There remains the possibility of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat committed by more or less violent methods . The Caliphate must , however , first be established on traditionally NORP territories , which do not include GPE . Accordingly , the report concludes that PERSON ut - GPE is not planning any coup PERSON in GPE and its activities there are limited to proselytism .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the report notes that some of ORG ut - GPE \u2019s documents , including those that can still be found on the organisation \u2019s NORP website , contain anti - NORP propaganda , glorification of suicide bombers in GPE and calls for violence against NORP and for the destruction of GPE . It thus concludes that NORP ut - GPE is an extremist organisation stirring anti - NORP hatred and advocating violence . The report recommends , however , that ORG decision banning PERSON ut - GPE should be annulled and that prosecution of individuals on the mere ground of their membership of that organisation should be stopped . It considers it advisable that only those of the organisation \u2019s members who have made statements advocating hatred or violence should face criminal or other proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A report entitled \u201c PERSON ut GPE ( ORG ) \u201d , published on DATE by the NORP research project ORG , Security , and LAW ( TTSRL ) , financed by ORG , reads as follows :", "\u201c PERSON ut GPE ( ORG ) presents itself as \u2018 a political party whose ideology is ORG , so politics is its work and ORG is its ideology ... \u2019 ... In their own eyes , PERSON ut GPE ( for short ) is a political group and not a priestly one ... It is a trans - national party or movement that claims to try to achieve its political goals without the use of violence and has branches in CARDINAL countries , including both NORP and NORP countries . In the NORP world they are , for instance , active not only in LOC , but also in GPE , GPE , GPE , and the former NORP republics in LOC . In almost all of these countries , NORP ut GPE is perceived as a threat to the state or even as a terrorist organisation . In the NORP world , PERSON ut GPE has a presence in , among others , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . To these countries , ORG ut GPE presents a particularly difficult challenge since it holds radical NORP views , but openly only advocates peaceful change . Nonetheless , in a number of ORG member states , the party is regarded as one that secretly does support the idea of a violent jihad and/or has been involved in anti - NORP incidents ...", "The organizational structure of ORG ut GPE is rather complex ... The identities of ORG ut GPE \u2019s current leader and senior officers have not been mentioned in reliable open sources .", "Concrete issues at the level of different national branches are in the hands of national leaders , where the scope and content of the activities within the branches greatly differ . A general distinction can be made between countries in which the party is permitted to operate freely , and countries in which ORG ut GPE is prosecuted . In GPE , for instance , [ NORP ut GPE ] is organized in a secretive and hierarchical pyramid structure made up of many CARDINAL - person cells whose members , after they have completed training averaging DATE , form their own groups or \u2018 halka\u2019 - also of CARDINAL to CARDINAL members . Other sources speak of CARDINAL - person cells ... In ORG member states , the branches of NORP ut GPE are organized like most political parties and have a hierarchical structure with a national leader , local groups and the possibility of membership for anyone who supports the party \u2019s ideas . In addition , the NORP branches of the party also consist of study groups , the above - mentioned \u2018 halkas.\u2019 ...", "From the beginning , PERSON ut GPE \u2019s leadership decreed that members should not participate in terrorist activities . This message has been continuously reverberated . There are , however , many allegations of links between the party and terrorist organisations . It should be stressed that none of these allegations are backed by concrete evidence ...", "There are , nonetheless , possible indirect links between ORG ut GPE and terrorist groups and individuals . In GPE , CARDINAL men , who in DATE were arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate the NORP ambassador , were reported to have been in possession of NORP ut GPE literature and to have helped organize PERSON ut GPE meetings in GPE ... Another man , PERSON DATE who is linked to the CARDINAL men currently on trial in GPE on charges of planning terrorist attacks DATE and DATE has stated that he became a member of PERSON ut GPE and another radical group , PERSON , while at the university , when he became angered by the Gulf War ... In the above mentioned cases , as well as in most cases , those behind the allegations only point at involvement in GPE ut GPE activities while studying , the possession of NORP ut GPE materials , and other rather indirect relations between suspects of terrorism and the party . More serious are the allegations that connect the party to the other radical group mentioned above , AlMuhajiroun , established in DATE as a splinter group that broke off from LOC . According to leader PERSON , the CARDINAL groups initially split because PERSON ut GPE was \u2018 too soft\u2019 ... His group has been accused of recruiting young NORP in GPE to fight abroad in places such as LOC , GPE and GPE ...", "Despite the above - mentioned allegations , authorities in the ORG have not yet formally accused NORP ut GPE for having links with terrorist organisations . In addition , there are no official reports that members have joined or become involved in the global jihad movement . However , it should be noted that some counties do see the organisation as a possible or potential threat to democracy and the rule of law ...", "Unlike more traditional NORP parties , PERSON ut GPE refuses to be involved in local politics , making it impossible for regional leaders to co - opt the group . Although PERSON ut GPE describes itself as a political party , it does not want to participate in elections or want to be part of coalition governments ... The process towards the utopian NORP Caliphate is viewed more as a social or intellectual process rather than a political one .", "For the above - mentioned intellectual struggle and intellectual transformation , PERSON ut GPE focuses primarily on highly educated NORP . The method is the socalled NORP da\u2019wah through which society can be transformed into an NORP one . Within the ORG , the concrete translation of this concept is distributing leaflets at universities and near FAC , or to organise meetings on current political and social issues , such as the situation in GPE , the cartoon issue in GPE and LOC ... Although the method of da\u2019wah seems very theoretical and impractical in relation to the stated goal , it can not be denied that the party has managed to attract CARDINAL of NORP in LOC who believe in its method ...", "As mentioned above , PERSON ut GPE has branches in CARDINAL countries , in a number of which the party is considered a terrorist organisation . Within the ORG , where religiously inspired political parties enjoy relatively greater freedom than they do anywhere else , only GPE has outlawed NORP ut GPE ...", "... [ Many ] questions remain open with regard to the nature of this party and its impact on society and how to deal with its spreading of anti - NORP , anti - Western and non - democratic ideas and sentiments ...", "A case - study on an organisation such as ORG ut GPE as part of an overall large research project on counter - terrorism might suggest prematurely that PERSON ut - GPE falls in the category of labelled terrorist organisations , or at least belongs to a group of organisations that pose a serious threat to our NORP society . However , such qualifications can not be given to PERSON without serious reservations . The question can even be raised whether such qualification is fit for this organisation at all . Although , in its philosophy PERSON ut - GPE has anti - democratic tendencies , it also rejects the idea of violent jihad to achieve their goal of a caliphate . Most allegations on the terrorist connection of the organisation or some of its members point at rather indirect links , are not based on solid sources , or should by their numbers be assessed as mere coincidences .", "On the other hand , experience shows that organisations such as ORG ut - GPE are \u2018 very smart in walking the very fine line between propaganda and incitement to ORG , according to PERSON , director of ORG at ORG ... However , outlawing this organisation without a proper cause might have the opposite effect . It is therefore important to monitor with prudence and to act on facts instead of allegations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
