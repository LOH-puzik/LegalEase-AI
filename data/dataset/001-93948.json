In addition , the part of the city where the GCARDINAL were meeting ( the historic centre ) was designated as a \u201c red zone \u201d and cordoned off by means of a metal fence . As a result , only residents and persons working in the area were allowed access . Access to the port was blocked and the airport was closed . The red zone was contained within a yellow zone , which in turn was surrounded by a white ( normal ) zone .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the written orders issued by the officer in charge of the lawenforcement agencies , who was responsible for maintaining and restoring public order , the ORG submitted to the ORG service orders dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .

CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning law enforcement and security at the GCARDINAL summit to be held in GPE from DATE , as follows . \u201d The order of CARDINAL DATE was not submitted .", "CARDINAL . The service order of DATE is the one issued DATE before the events . It sums up the priorities of the law - enforcement agencies as follows : establishing a line of defence within the \u201c red zone \u201d , with the task of repelling rapidly any attempt to break through ; establishing a line of defence within the \u201c yellow zone \u201d to deal with any incidents , taking account of the position of the demonstrators in various locations and of actions perpetrated by more extremist elements ; finally , putting in place publicorder measures on the streets concerned by the demonstrations , in view of the risk of violence encouraged by the presence of crowds of people .", "CARDINAL . The parties agreed as to the fact that the service order of DATE amended the plans hitherto established regarding the deployment of the available means and resources to enable the lawenforcement agencies to counter effectively any attempt to enter the red zone by participants in the demonstration by the FAC bianche ( \u201c White overalls \u201d ) which had been announced and authorised for DATE .", "Referring to testimonies given during the criminal proceedings instituted against CARDINAL demonstrators ( see \u201c the trial of the CARDINAL \u201d below ) , the applicants stated that the service order of DATE gave the detachment of carabinieri concerned a \u201c roving brief \u201d , whereas it had previously been supposed to remain in CARDINAL location .", "As regards the manner in which these instructions were circulated , the ORG stated that the orders issued and received by the officers on the ground were communicated orally .

The judgment given in the \u201c trial of the CARDINAL \u201d ( see below ) , which was added to the case file , makes clear that there had been some tensions before the GCARDINAL summit began .

The same judgment noted that on TIME CARDINAL DATE groups of particularly aggressive demonstrators , wearing balaclavas and masks ( the \u201c LOC \u201d ) had sparked numerous incidents and clashes with lawenforcement officers . At TIME the FAC bianche march was ready to set off from the ORG stadium . This was a demonstration involving several organisations : representatives of the \u201c No Global \u201d movement and of community centres , and young communists from the GPE comunista party . While they believed in non - violent protest ( civil disobedience ) , they had announced a strategic objective , namely to try to penetrate the red zone . For that reason the NORP police chief ( questore ) had decided on DATE to prohibit the FAC bianche procession from entering the red zone or the zone adjacent to it , and had deployed lawenforcement officers to halt the procession at FAC . Consequently , the demonstrators were able to march from the ORG stadium and all the way along PERSON to PERSON , that is to say , well beyond the junction of ORG and PERSON , where the events dealt with below took place . At TIME the procession set off and headed slowly westwards .

Once there , the demonstrators split up : some headed towards the seafront , while others sought refuge in ORG and then in the area around PERSON . Some demonstrators retaliated , finding hard objects such as glass bottles or rubbish bins and starting to throw them at the law - enforcement officers . Armoured vehicles belonging to the carabinieri drove up Via Casaregis and PERSON at high speed , knocking down the barriers erected by the demonstrators using containers , and forcing the demonstrators at the scene to leave . At TIME the control room ordered ORG to move away and allow the Tute bianche to pass .

On DATE the public prosecutor 's office authorised the cremation of PERSON body in accordance with the family 's wishes .", "CARDINAL . The expert report was submitted on DATE . The experts noted that ORG had been struck below the left eye by a bullet which had passed through the skull and exited through the rear of the skull on the left . The bullet 's trajectory had been as follows : it had been fired from a distance exceeding QUANTITY and had travelled from front to back , from right to left and in a downward direction . PERSON had been QUANTITY tall . The person firing the shot had been facing the victim and slightly to his right . According to the experts , the bullet injury to the head was so severe that it would have resulted in death within TIME . The jeep being driven over the body had resulted only in minor injuries of no significance to the organs in the thorax and the abdomen .", "CARDINAL . After leaving PERSON the CARDINAL carabinieri who had been in the jeep went to the casualty department of GPE hospital in GPE . GPE complained of diffuse bruising in his right leg and an injury to the skull with open wounds ; against the advice of the doctors , who wished to admit him , PERSON signed a discharge and left the hospital at TIME He had an injury to the skull which , he said , had been caused by a blow to the head with a hard object while he had been in the jeep . According to the doctors , PERSON 's condition was not life - threatening .", "CARDINAL .

The forensic medical reports drawn up to establish the exact nature of the injuries and their connection with the attack on the jeep 's occupants concluded that the injuries sustained by GPE and GPE had not been lifethreatening . The report found that GPE 's head injuries could have been caused by a stone thrown at him , whereas it was not possible to determine the origin of his other injuries . As to PERSON , the injury to his face could have been caused by a stone being thrown at him , and his shoulder injury by a blow from a wooden plank .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office instructed Mr ORG to establish whether the CARDINAL spent cartridges found at the scene ( one in the jeep and the other QUANTITY from FAC body ) had been fired from the same weapon , and in particular from LOC 's weapon . In his report of DATE , the expert concluded that there was a PERCENT probability that the cartridge found in the jeep had come from ORG 's Beretta pistol , whereas there was only a PERCENT probability that the cartridge found close to PERSON body had been fired from the same pistol . This expert examination was carried out unilaterally under LAW , that is to say , without the injured party having an opportunity to participate .", "DATE . The public prosecutor 's office appointed a second expert , police inspector PERSON . The latter , in a report submitted on DATE , concluded that there was a PERCENT probability that the spent cartridge found near the victim 's body had come from GPE 's weapon . He concluded that both the cartridges had been fired from GPE 's pistol . As to the distance between LOC and Carlo Giuliani at the moment of impact , he estimated it at QUANTITY .

It appears from the file that PERSON had published an editorial article in DATE in a specialist review ( ORG ) , in which he had expressed the view that ORG had acted in selfdefence .", "The experts were given permission to consult all the documents , audiovisual material and expert reports held by the public prosecutor 's office . Representatives and experts appointed by the applicants attended the expert examinations . According to the TIME , the applicants were represented by PERSON , who said he did not wish to make an application for the immediate production of evidence ( incidente probatorio ) .", "CARDINAL . An on - site inspection was conducted on DATE . On that occasion , traces of the impact of the second pistol shot were found on the wall of a building on FAC , at a height of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert report ( entitled : \u201c Study of the dynamic of events leading to the death of Carlo Giuliani based on analysis of the images \u201d ) was submitted to the public prosecutor 's office . The report was aimed at determining the position of the QUANTITY persons concerned and the distance between them when the shot was fired , in order to establish the angle of view . The experts stated at the outset that the fact that they had not had access to PERSON body ( because it had been cremated ) had been a major obstacle which had prevented them from producing an exhaustive report , as they had been unable to re - examine parts of the body and search for micro - traces .", "CARDINAL . First of all , on the basis of the \u201c little material available \u201d the experts attempted to establish what the impact of the bullet had been on PERSON body . According to the experts , the injuries to the skull were very serious and had resulted in death \u201c within a short space of time \u201d . They further found that the bullet had not exited whole from Carlo Giuliani 's head ; the scan performed before the autopsy showed an opaque piece of metal which looked like a fragment of bullet casing . As to the entry wound on the face , its appearance did not permit an unequivocal interpretation ; its irregular shape was explained chiefly by the type of tissue in that part of the body . However , CARDINAL possible explanation was that the bullet had not struck Carlo Giuliani directly , but had encountered an intermediate object which could have distorted it and slowed it down before it reached the victim 's body . That hypothesis tallied with the small dimensions of the exit wound and the fact that the bullet had fragmented inside Carlo Giuliani 's skull .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this hypothesis , the experts then searched for traces and reported finding a small fragment of lead , probably from the bullet . As it had come off PERSON balaclava when the latter was being handled , it was impossible to ascertain whether the fragment had come from the front , side or back of the balaclava . That said , the experts observed traces of a substance which was not part of the bullet as such , but came from material used in the construction industry . In addition , micro - fragments of lead were found on the front and back of the balaclava , apparently confirming the hypothesis that the bullet had lost part of its casing at the moment of impact .", "As to the nature of the \u201c intermediate object \u201d , the experts stated that it had not been possible to establish what it might have been , but ruled out the possibility that it was the fire extinguisher which Carlo Giuliani had been holding in his outstretched hand .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as to the distance from which the shot had been fired , the experts estimated it at CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to reconstruct the events based on the \u201c hypothesis of a collision with an object \u201d , the experts then had some test shots fired and conducted video and computer simulations . Their conclusions were as follows : if the bullet had struck another object , they could not establish its trajectory , which would undoubtedly have been altered as a result . On the basis of video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air and of the shot that could be heard on the soundtrack , the experts concluded that the stone had shattered immediately after the shot had been fired .", "On the basis of a computer simulation , the experts concluded that the bullet fired upwards by ORG had struck PERSON after colliding with the stone in question , which had been thrown at the jeep by another demonstrator . The experts estimated the distance between Carlo Giuliani and the jeep at QUANTITY when the shot was fired and judged that , at that precise moment , GPE had been able to see PERSON .", "DATE . The applicants submitted a statement made to their lawyer by PERSON , CARDINAL of the demonstrators , on DATE . PERSON stated in particular that Carlo Giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body and that he , PERSON , had drawn officers ' attention to the injured man , shouting out something like \u201c Doctor , hospital ... \u201d . When the law - enforcement officers arrived , PERSON had left .", "The applicants subsequently submitted a statement made by a carabiniere ( V.M. ) , who reported a widespread practice among lawenforcement officers consisting in altering bullets of the kind used by ORG in order to make them more likely to expand and hence break up .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicants submitted CARDINAL expert reports drawn up by experts they themselves had appointed . According to CARDINAL of the experts , Mr Gentile , the bullet had already been in fragments when it struck the victim 's body . The fact that it had fragmented could be explained by a defect in the bullet or by its having been manipulated to make it more likely to break up . PERSON considered that this occurred in a limited number of cases ; accordingly , it was a less likely hypothesis than the one put forward by the prosecuting authorities ' experts ( namely that the bullet had struck an object during its trajectory ) .", "The other experts instructed by the applicants to reconstruct the events ruled out the possibility that \u201c the stone \u201d had shattered after colliding with the bullet fired by ORG ; in their view it had shattered against the jeep . According to the experts , in order to reconstruct the events on the basis of the audiovisual material , and especially of the photographs , it was necessary to establish the exact position of the photographer , and in particular his or her angle of vision , taking into account also the type of equipment used ( focal length , type of camera body or video camera ) . In addition , it was necessary to establish the timing of the images and how they fitted in with the sound . The experts also challenged the method used by the prosecution authorities ' experts , who had based their analysis on \u201c video and computer simulations \u201d and had not analysed the available images rigorously and in depth . Similar criticisms were made of the method used to perform the test shooting , which , in the view of the applicants ' experts , was not reliable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' experts concluded that PERSON had been QUANTITY away from the jeep when the shot was fired and that , while it was undeniable that the fatal bullet had been in fragments when it struck PERSON , the possibility of its having collided with the stone which could be seen in the picture in question should be ruled out , in particular because a stone would have distorted the bullet in a different way and left different marks on PERSON body . Moreover , PERSON had not fired in an upward direction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor noted first of all that far - reaching changes had been made to the organisation of the public - order operation on TIME DATE , and took the view that this partly explained the problems that had arisen on DATE . However , he did not detail the changes or the problems that had resulted .", "On the basis of the evidence in the file , the public prosecutor reconstructed the events leading up to the death of PERSON . As to the decision to position men in ORG in order to block the path of the demonstrators in PERSON , the public prosecutor noted that Mr PERSON 's version of events was at variance in some respects with that of Captain PERSON : whereas Mr PERSON spoke of a decision taken by mutual agreement , Captain PERSON maintained that the men had taken up position on the basis of a unilateral decision by Mr PERSON , in spite of the potential risks involved ( on account of the small size of the detachment and the fact that the men were tired ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor then examined the expert reports and noted that the different experts agreed in particular on the fact that CARDINAL shots had been fired from GPE 's pistol , the first of which had fatally wounded PERSON ; that the bullet in question had not fragmented merely as a result of striking Carlo Giuliani 's body ; and that the photograph of Carlo Giuliani holding the fire extinguisher had been taken when he was QUANTITY away from the jeep .", "However , the experts differed on the following points in particular :", "( a ) according to the experts appointed by the public prosecutor 's office , PERSON had been QUANTITY away from the jeep at the moment he was wounded ( QUANTITY away according to the PERSON family 's experts ) ;", "( b ) the relative timing of the image of the stone and the sound of the gunshot ( according to the PERSON family 's experts , the shot had been fired before the stone could be seen , contrary to the view of the prosecution authorities ' experts ) .", "CARDINAL . Given that the parties agreed that the bullet had fragmented before striking the victim 's body , the public prosecutor concluded that they also agreed as to the causes of the bullet 's fragmentation , and that the applicants subscribed to the \u201c theory of the bullet having been deflected by a solid object \u201d . The relevant parts of the request for the proceedings to be discontinued read as follows :", "\u201c The points on which there is no substantial disagreement are outlined below :", "...", "Before striking PERSON , the bullet encountered an object in its path which caused it to fragment partially .", "The footnote reads as follows . On page CARDINAL of the expert report of DATE the expert , PERSON , states : ' In short , all the available evidence points to the fact that the bullet , before striking the face of PERSON , made contact with a hard object ( intermediate target ) capable of slowing down its trajectory significantly and damaging its casing , making it likely to break up , and of leaving traces on the lead core . ' The PERSON family 's expert , PERSON , for his part , stated as follows on page CARDINAL of the expert report which he submitted on DATE : ' We can not but share the assessment of Professor PERSON that a bullet of that calibre , which conformed to ORG standards , would not ( the negative was added by PERSON by hand on DATE during the confrontation between the experts ) have fragmented as the sole result of the final impact with the victim . \u201d", "Other possible explanations for the fragmentation of the bullet advanced by the applicants \u2013 such as the manipulation of the bullet in order to make it more likely to fragment , or a manufacturing defect DATE were considered by the applicants themselves as \u201c much less likely \u201d . Given the lower degree of probability , these hypotheses could not \u2013 according to the public prosecutor \u2013 be regarded as valid explanations .", "CARDINAL . Before moving on to legal considerations , the public prosecutor observed that the investigation had been lengthy , owing in particular to delays with some of the expert reports , the \u201c superficial nature \u201d of the autopsy report and the errors made by CARDINAL of the experts , Mr PERSON . The public prosecutor then observed that the investigation had been completed and that all the relevant issues had been addressed in detail . In conclusion , he said that the hypothesis of the bullet having been fired upwards and deflected by a stone thrown into the air was \u201c the most convincing \u201d . However , the public prosecutor considered that there was insufficient evidence in the file to determine whether GPE had fired the shots with the sole intention of dispersing the demonstrators or had knowingly run the risk of injuring or killing CARDINAL or more of them . CARDINAL possibilities had been considered , and \u201c the matter would never be resolved with certainty \u201d :", "\u2013 the first possibility was that the shots had been designed to intimidate the demonstrators and that it was therefore a case of causing death by negligence ;", "\u2013 the second possibility was that GPE had fired the shots in order to put a stop to the attack and had accepted the risk of killing someone ; that would mean that it was a case of intentional homicide ;", "\u2013 the third possibility was that GPE had aimed at Carlo Giuliani ; this would also be intentional homicide .", "In the view of the public prosecutor , the evidence in the file was sufficient to rule out the third possibility .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor further considered that the bullet 's having collided with the stone was not capable of severing the causal link between ORG 's actions and PERSON death . That link remained ; the question was whether PERSON had acted in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . In the public prosecutor 's view , it had been proven that the physical integrity of the jeep 's occupants had been under threat and that GPE had been \u201c responding \u201d in the face of danger . That said , PERSON 's response had to be examined in terms of both its necessity and its proportionality , \u201c the latter aspect being the more delicate \u201d .", "As to whether ORG had had any other option and could have been expected to act differently , the public prosecutor replied in the negative , giving the following reasons : \u201c ... the jeep was surrounded by demonstrators and the physical aggression against the occupants was patent and virulent ... \u201d . PERSON had been justified in perceiving his life to be in danger . The pistol had been an instrument capable of putting a stop to the attack , and GPE could not be criticised for the choice of the equipment issued to him . From a legal viewpoint , GPE could not be expected to refrain from using his firearm and submit to an attack liable to endanger his physical integrity .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these considerations , the public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an objection against the request for the proceedings to be discontinued . Referring to the fact that the prosecution authorities themselves had acknowledged that the investigation had been flawed and raised doubts which had not been resolved with certainty , they argued that adversarial proceedings were essential in order to arrive at the truth .", "CARDINAL . As to GPE , the applicants disputed the theory that the bullet had been deflected by a stone . In their view , it was impossible to argue simultaneously that GPE had fired into the air and that he had acted in selfdefence , particularly since GPE had said he could not see PERSON when he had fired the shot .", "The applicants further observed that the theory that the bullet had been deflected by an object had been put forward DATE after the events by an expert appointed by the public prosecutor 's office , and was based on pure supposition not backed up by objective evidence . The applicants ' expert had stated that a collision with a stone would have distorted the bullet in a different manner . In addition , the applicants referred to the statement reporting the practice of modifying bullets in order to make them more likely to expand and hence to fragment .", "CARDINAL . With regard to ORG , the applicants observed that the file showed that Carlo Giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body . In that connection they pointed out that the autopsy report , which found that no appreciable injuries had been caused by the jeep driving over the body , had been described as superficial by the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these considerations , and having criticised the decision to entrust a number of investigative measures to the carabinieri , the applicants demanded that a trial be held in order to establish responsibility for PERSON death .", "CARDINAL . In the alternative , the applicants requested that further investigative measures be undertaken , in particular :", "( a ) that an expert report be prepared aimed at establishing the causes and the time of PERSON death , in order to ascertain in particular whether he had still been alive when the jeep drove over his body , and afterwards ;", "( b ) that evidence be heard from the chief of police , Mr PERSON , and from carabiniere Zappia , to establish what instructions had been given regarding the wearing of weapons on the thigh ;", "( c ) that the person who had thrown the stone in question be identified and traced ;", "( d ) that further evidence be heard from the demonstrators who had come forward ;", "( e ) that evidence be heard from the carabiniere PERSON , who had reported the practice of cutting the tips of bullets in order to increase their impact ;", "( f ) that an expert examination be carried out on the spent cartridges and on the weapons of all the police and carabinieri on ORG at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before the investigating judge took place on DATE . The verbatim record of the hearing shows that the applicants maintained their argument that the bullet had not broken up after colliding with the stone . They ruled out the possibility that the bullet had been deflected and submitted that it had struck the victim 's body directly . Mr Vinci , the applicants ' representative at the hearing , stated with regard to the theory that the bullet might have been modified in order to make it more effective , in line with the practice reported by CARDINAL witness : \u201c Obviously , we do not have any proof ; it is a case of evidence adduced in order to advance different hypotheses . Naturally we can not assert , nor do we wish to , that GPE did that . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor who attended the hearing said he had the impression that \u201c certain points which [ he had ] believed to be the subject of mutual agreement were in fact not ; on the contrary , there were divergences of opinion \u201d . He pointed out that the applicants ' expert , PERSON , had been in agreement as to the fact that the bullet had been damaged before striking PERSON , and had acknowledged that one of the possible causes of the damage was a collision with some object or an intrinsic defect in the bullet , and that the second hypothesis was less likely than the first .", "CARDINAL . By an order lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , the Genoa investigating judge discontinued the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In seeking to reconstruct the events the judge referred to an anonymous account posted on an anarchist website ( www.anarchyCARDINAL.net ) , which the judge considered to be credible given that it concurred with the audiovisual material and with the witness statements .", "\u201c [ I]t is particularly interesting to study the description , which is included in the file , posted by an anonymous participant in the demonstrations on an Internet site with possible links to NORP anarchists ( www.anarchyCARDINAL.net ) . This provides a detailed and clearly accurate account , as testified by the details emerging from the videos and photographs and from the testimonies in the file , and can therefore be used as a basis for a precise reconstruction of the events as regards both the movements of the demonstrators at the location where Carlo Giuliani died and the assessment of the number and conduct of the demonstrators and the law - enforcement agencies in the moments leading up to the young man 's death . \u201d", "The website in question described the situation on PERSON and a charge by demonstrators against the carabinieri . The charge was led by demonstrators throwing anything that came to hand , followed by others carrying containers , rubbish bins , etc . for use as mobile barricades . The atmosphere on the square was described as \u201c frenetic \u201d . The following passage was reproduced in the judge 's decision :", "\u201c ... I really do n't think that many of us on that march went as far as the centre of the area where the clashes were taking place , where PERSON narrows and becomes PERSON ...", "There were CARDINAL of people in the area close to the clashes who were resting , watching or getting some air after having tear gas fired at them . I kept on going towards PERSON . There were still a lot of people and I could see the first signs of clashes ... There really were lots of people carrying equipment or parts of equipment in the style of the FAC bianche ...", "I carried on further . There were still a lot of people . There were CARDINAL of people in the front lines of rioters ... Not long after I joined the front lines , the demonstrators began a major counter - attack ... CARDINAL of people started to advance towards the cops . Gradually , more and more missiles were being thrown at the police lines . Stones were starting to rain down . More and more were hitting them ... They were getting them right in their faces and they could all see that behind the CARDINAL of people attacking them there were another CARDINAL or CARDINAL further up the street who were starting to follow the front lines , coming thicker and faster , heading straight for them . People were shouting \u201c ORG ! ORG ! \u201d .", "Then the police ranks began to break up ... Everyone charged , shouting and throwing anything they could find ... People grabbed all the missiles lying on the ground . Every QUANTITY , the things thrown at the cops were picked up and reused straight away . The stone throwers were now moving forward strongly and quickly . A little way behind , CARDINAL of people were running along carrying bins , containers , railings , etc . , so that they were moving the barricade while charging forward in a series of short bursts . The atmosphere was frenetic . The level of violence was really high . Tear gas was being fired frantically from the back of what was left of the police lines . That slowed us down . The vehicles managed to find a way out . The cops started to re - form their lines . I think we pushed them back QUANTITY . It must have taken them a long time to gain that much ground , and we made them lose it again in TIME . People started to gather ammunition for a fresh attack ( picking up and making piles of missiles and parts for mobile barricades , forming large groups behind the front lines ... ) . The cops had just taken a hammering and were destabilised , on the defensive . That must have been why they sent CARDINAL cops down the small side street , to the left of the front lines of demonstrators . They must have thought that the front lines would be afraid of a charge from the side that would cut them off from the rest of the demo ( and which would have been followed immediately by a head - on charge ) and were going to withdraw slightly to ease the pressure on the police in FAC . Or maybe they were trying to deter us from spreading out into the little streets on the left and widening the circle of the clashes . I do n't know why they did it but , in any case , it was n't a good idea because there were a lot of overexcited people arriving to support the front lines and fill the space gained during the charge of demonstrators , and CARDINAL cops were very quickly charged by CARDINAL people . The cops withdrew to a small street at right angles . The charge continued . The more they pulled back , the more we charged . We followed them into the street at right angles and caught up with them where the street runs into a small square with a church . The cops were still retreating under the hail of missiles . Quite a few demonstrators had iron bars or axe handles . There were more of us than them and they were trying to avoid contact . The cops entered a street off the square to re - form their lines . When they withdrew , they left CARDINAL small carabinieri jeeps QUANTITY behind them . The situation was violent and confused , things were happening quickly , so I 'll be careful what I say . The CARDINAL jeeps tried to reverse but , for some reason I do n't understand , the second one at least was n't able to . It then found itself cut off from the rest of the police and in direct contact with the demonstrators , who started to throw stones at it and to hit it with bars and wooden handles . The back window of the jeep was smashed , I do n't know how it happened but it was missing . I was QUANTITY from the jeep , slightly higher than it ( it was to my left ) because I was on the steps of the little church . That 's when I heard the first shot , quite loud , sharp and close by . I instinctively bent down , thinking that it was a gunshot . I looked straight ahead at the police ranks at the entrance to the side street to see what was happening , whether they had fired the shot and if they were charging . They were QUANTITY away , there was gas , I could n't see much . I think there was another shot . I turned round , still bent , and went back down CARDINAL or CARDINAL steps , went a few paces and crouched down for cover behind something or other . I raised myself up slightly . Straight in front of me , still QUANTITY away I 'd say , was the back of the carabinieri jeep with its back window smashed in . I could see some movement inside . I lowered myself again and almost immediately got up again slightly . I think ( but I ca n't be certain , it 's all a bit confused ) that I saw , through the smashed rear window , fairly clearly , CARDINAL cops wearing helmets , bent over or crouching , holding on to each other . I saw the outline of a hand , at chest height , and extending from it , a glinting black shape . I realised at once that it could only be a hand weapon and that it had been the source of the shots . I thought they had fired into the air in order to extricate themselves . The cops ( I think there were CARDINAL of them ) seemed nervous and had turned round slightly to look through the broken window for any demonstrators approaching . I could n't see what was happening on the ground . Then I looked behind me to see what was going on , whether the demonstrators were going forward or retreating . When I looked in front of me again , the carabinieri jeep had gone . I got up and moved forward . There were very few people in front of me . I had the feeling that it was much quieter for TIME . Then there were some shouts . I thought to myself that there was a problem and that something serious had happened . I saw a few people running and stopping CARDINAL QUANTITY to my left . I went over . There were CARDINAL people in a circle . I walked round them . I saw someone on the ground . A tear - gas grenade had rolled over to near the group of people . I kicked it back towards the cops , who were not moving and were still QUANTITY or so away ... His feet were close to mine . I remember his white t - shirt and his black balaclava , which was sticky and glistening with blood . I saw a pool of blood spreading out from his head . I noticed blood spurting out of his left eye . I realised it was a bullet that had done that and that the shots had n't been fired into the air . I took a few steps backwards holding my head . When I turned round I saw CARDINAL journalists with videos and cameras taking close - ups of the guy on the ground . The cops started to come over slowly . A group of CARDINAL or CARDINAL cops moved away from their ranks and , staying behind CARDINAL riot shields , they walked straight up to us , quite slowly and calmly it seemed to me . CARDINAL youths began to lift up the guy on the ground . I moved closer to help them but another demonstrator came up saying that the guy was seriously injured and should n't be moved . The CARDINAL youths put him down again . Actually , no one thought he was dead . The little group of CARDINAL or CARDINAL cops had moved closer . They were perhaps QUANTITY metres away from us . We moved back and the line of cops following the leading group at a distance began to charge , so we cleared off altogether . We did n't know what to do because we thought the guy on the ground was badly hurt , but not dead . We did n't check his heart or his pulse . If we 'd realised he was already dead , obviously we 'd never have left his body to the cops ; we would have taken it to PERSON and found an ambulance there ( I dread to think what effect that would have had on the CARDINAL of people there . ) Anyway , the cops charged and the square emptied , the last of the demonstrators caught up with the rest and said that a guy had been shot and might be dead . People started shouting angrily . The cops , after clearing the square , started off down the side street along which people had started to head back towards PERSON . When they saw the cops coming , the people hurled themselves at them , shouting \u201c GPE \u201d and forced them back on to the little square . Opposite me was the street where people were charging towards the square and , on my right , the street leading to PERSON . At the end of that street I noticed a light armoured vehicle which was heading up PERSON at speed , sweeping aside all obstacles . I hope there was no one in its way because the vehicle was driving straight through at full throttle . I bumped into one of the journalists who had been there when the demonstrator died . He spoke NORP and said to me and another NORP guy who was hanging around that we should n't get our hopes up , because the guy was dead . He said he was dashing off to send the pictures . I went back to PERSON by a side street , further up from the one where I had seen the armoured vehicle pass by . The news was starting to get round in the front lines of the demonstrators and people were attacking the cops frantically . I started to head back slowly in the opposite direction . The bad news was spreading through the demonstrators . Then I sped up and kept shouting out in several languages , while I walked quickly along , that someone had been killed by a bullet to the head . I told the news to the SO of the LCR . Then I walked back up the lines of demonstrators for a while announcing it ... The rioters in the front lines were very angry at the news , whereas most of the demonstrators were sickened and left . End of account . An anarchist somewhere in GPE , DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the judge , the description by the anonymous demonstrator tallied completely with the content of the statements made in relation to the notification of the offence and with the conclusions of the investigation , which had been launched immediately and according to which \u201c at TIME , a group of demonstrators gathered in ORG at the junction with PERSON , erecting barricades using rubbish bins , supermarket trolleys and anything they could find in the vicinity . From behind this barricade , the group began throwing large numbers of stones and hard objects at a contingent of carabinieri who , having been stationed originally on ORG at the corner of ORG , had begun to move forward in a bid to stop the demonstrators , whose numbers had increased in the meantime following the arrival of other demonstrators coming from PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge pieced together the subsequent events as follows :", "\u201c That was why CARDINAL Defender jeeps , CARDINAL of them driven by carabinieri officer PERSON and with officers PERSON and PERSON on board , had arrived as reinforcements for the contingent that was blocked .", "Wholly unexpectedly , the demonstrators had launched an extremely violent charge which forced the contingent of carabinieri to withdraw into the relative safety of ORG . Consequently , the CARDINAL jeeps reversed as far as PERSON . Whereas CARDINAL of them managed from there to move off in the direction of PERSON , the other , driven by officer PERSON , in trying to turn round , ran into a rubbish bin with its front bumper and was unable to reverse immediately . In an instant the vehicle was surrounded by large numbers of demonstrators who formed a circle round it , attacking it and hitting it with anything that came to hand ( pipes , poles from road signs , planks , etc . ) while the demonstrators next to and further away from the vehicle continued their barrage of stones . The extensive footage filmed at the scene shows the violence of the attack on the contingent of carabinieri . In particular , the film made by PERSON clearly shows that the attack on the jeep hemmed in at the corner of PERSON was extremely violent , with demonstrators hurling themselves at the vehicle and smashing the windows with stones , iron bars and sticks . The film extracts and photographs taken during the events and assembled in the album of the mobile unit , which contains QUANTITY images indicating the precise sequence of events , show the foot patrol of carabinieri on the part of ORG which links ORG and PERSON , confronted by large numbers of demonstrators brandishing iron bars and sticks and throwing stones from behind a barricade erected at the junction with ORG . Behind the barrier , on photograph CARDINAL , we can see PERSON himself throwing a stone at the carabinieri .", "Photographs CARDINAL to CARDINAL show the demonstrators advancing on the contingent of carabinieri followed by the jeep . The demonstrators are armed with iron bars and sticks and with numerous stones which they are throwing at the carabinieri , as shown clearly by photograph CARDINAL .", "The next pictures show the withdrawal of the contingent , preceded by the jeeps travelling in reverse , \u201c followed \u201d by very large numbers of demonstrators ( including , on photograph CARDINAL , PERSON , running along clutching a beam ) , with the demonstrators already on ORG having been joined in the meantime by numerous others coming from ORG . The foot patrol manages to cross the square running , withdrawing in the direction of PERSON , still pursued by the demonstrators . The jeeps try to do a rapid U - turn but the demonstrators move over to them and launch an attack , as clearly shown by photographs CARDINAL and DATE . CARDINAL of the vehicles succeeds in completing the manoeuvre and leaving the square ; the other , trying to turn round , runs into a waste container at the front and is unable to extricate itself , in particular , as we shall see , because its engine stalls several times .", "While some demonstrators continue to throw stones even at the foot patrol , which has moved away , and against the parting jeep , the vehicle driven by officer PERSON , with officers PERSON and PERSON now on board , is immediately encircled by demonstrators who hurl themselves at it , smashing the windows and hitting the occupants repeatedly with stones and iron bars through the windows . The ferocity with which the demonstrators attack the vehicle , as shown by the video and photographic material in the file , is striking : the vehicle is coming under a barrage of stones some of which , as we shall see , hit the carabinieri in the face and head . PERSON can be seen clearly , still armed with the long wooden beam , which he thrusts in through the right - side window , inflicting on PERSON , among other injuries , ' bruises and grazing in the area of the right shoulder blade ' which , according to the findings of the forensic expert report ordered by the public prosecutor 's office , are compatible with a blow struck in precisely that manner ( photographs DATE ) . Photograph CARDINAL shows the foot of one of the carabinieri in the jeep protruding through the shattered rear window , repelling a fire extinguisher thrown at the inside of the vehicle . This could be the object that caused ' severe bruising to the right leg with diffuse swelling throughout the leg ' reported by officer PERSON , who mentioned during questioning that he had also been hit in the leg by an ' extremely heavy metal object ' .", "While objects continue to be thrown at the Defender jeep and its assailants are still crowding around the vehicle , CARDINAL of the carabinieri inside the vehicle takes a gun in his right hand ; this is clearly visible in photographs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , which show a hand on the inside clutching a pistol at the level of the upper edge of the line formed on the photograph by the shape of the spare wheel on the back door ; while the attack is continuing , a young man bends down and picks up a fire extinguisher which he raises in the direction of the back window of the jeep as if to throw it .", "CARDINAL shots are fired in quick succession from the inside of the vehicle . The young man with the fire extinguisher falls and his body rolls on the ground , coming to a stop against the left rear wheel of the vehicle ; the extinguisher has rolled next to the wheel , in front of the body .", "TIME the Defender jeep manages to reverse , driving over the body of the young man with its left rear wheel and then touching it again as it moves forward and turns into ORG in the direction of PERSON , stopping almost immediately on the corner of a side street . The inanimate body of a young man with a balaclava on his head , later identified as PERSON , remains lying in the roadway . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to ORG , the judge took the view that the evidence in the file excluded any criminal responsibility on his part , given that PERSON PERSON 's death had certainly been caused within TIME by the pistol shot and that the jeep 's driving over his body had caused only bruising . In addition , ORG had not been able to see PERSON , owing to the confused situation around the jeep . This ruled out any responsibility for homicide on the part of the driver .", "CARDINAL . As to GPE , the judge noted that the evidence in the file showed that the first bullet had struck and killed PERSON . It was an encased CARDINAL PERSON bullet , and therefore very powerful . In the judge 's opinion this fact , together with the low resistance of the body tissue through which the bullet had travelled , supported the hypothesis advanced by the prosecution authorities ' experts to the effect that the bullet had struck an object before hitting PERSON . The intermediate object could have been one of the numerous stones which had been thrown at the jeep by demonstrators . This appeared to be borne out by the video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air at the same time that a shot was heard .", "CARDINAL . As to the initial trajectory of the bullet ( \u201c l'originaria direzione del colpo \u201d ) , the investigating judge noted that the ballistic expert examination had been unable to establish it . However , she took the view that , assuming that the jeep was QUANTITY high and that the stone visible on the film had been at a height of QUANTITY when the picture was taken , it made sense to consider that the shot had been fired upwards , in line with the conclusions of the experts appointed by the public prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL . The judge considered that the first possibility advanced by the public prosecutor DATE namely , that LOC had fired with the sole aim of intimidating the demonstrators \u2013 should be ruled out ; PERSON had sought to counter the attack . There was not sufficient evidence , either , to establish that GPE had been able to see PERSON at the moment of firing the shot and therefore had taken aim at him .", "According to the judge , the most likely hypothesis was that ORG had fired the shot knowing that there was a risk that someone would be killed ; it was therefore a case of intentional homicide . However , CARDINAL elements which excluded criminal responsibility were present in the case . The first was the legitimate use of weapons , as set forth in LAW ( \u201c a ORG agent who uses or orders the use of weapons or any other means of physical force in the exercise of his or her official duties shall not be liable to punishment where he or she is obliged to do so in order to repel an act of violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority \u201d ) ; the second element was self - defence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The first issue to be determined was whether the use of a weapon had been necessary . The detailed reconstruction of the events suggested that GPE had been in a situation of extreme violence designed to disturb public order and targeting the carabinieri , whose physical integrity had been directly threatened . In the judge 's view , the danger had stemmed from the number of demonstrators and the overall methods of action ( \u201c modalit\u00e0 complessive dell'azione \u201d ) which made the acts of violence against GPE and the other CARDINAL carabinieri liable to endanger their physical integrity . In conclusion , the use of a firearm had been justified and the likelihood had been that its use would not cause serious harm , given that GPE had \u201c certainly fired upwards \u201d and that the bullet had struck Carlo Giuliani only because its trajectory had been altered in a way that could not have been foreseen . The relevant passage of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The death of PERSON from a bullet fired by a carabiniere who , in the course of a demonstration , made use of his weapon , requires above all that we establish whether PERSON 's conduct was justified under LAW , which provides that ' a ORG agent who uses or orders the use of weapons or any other means of physical force in the exercise of his or her official duties shall not be liable to punishment where he or she is obliged to do so in order to repel an act of violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority ' . This is not the same as self - defence , but confers wider powers whereby the legitimacy of the response is not dependent on its proportionality to the threat , provided it does not exceed the bounds of ' necessity ' ; should this be the case , LAW , which makes unintentional excess punishable , is applicable , it being understood that even for ORG agents the use of a weapon is an extreme measure and that the least harmful option must therefore always be chosen . But where the use of a weapon is considered legitimate , provided the proportionality principle has been complied with , the ORG agent concerned can not be held responsible for the fact that something more serious occurs unintentionally , in so far as the foreseeability of such an event is intrinsically linked to the risk inherent in the use of a firearm issued to a ORG agent , and that risk could be eliminated only by his refraining from using the firearm , the use of which is authorised by law ( see case - law acknowledging the legitimate use by carabinieri of their weapons : as the officers had aimed at the tyres of a car in order to stop it escaping , they could not be held responsible under LAW for the unintentional killing of the vehicle 's occupants ORG , DATE , ORG ) . The use of weapons or any other form of physical force ( consisting therefore in physical violence against the person ) is not punishable :", "\u2013 where the act is committed in the performance of an official duty and stems from the need for the perpetrator to repel an act of violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority ;", "\u2013 where it is specifically authorised by statute ;", "\u2013 in a general sense , and hence without the need to rely on a specific statute , responsibility for the act is excluded where it stems from the need to repel violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority , whether or not the violence or resistance amounts to CARDINAL of the offences contemplated in Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW .", "However , Article CARDINAL provides for an exception to the provisions of Articles DATE and DATE , which applies also to ORG agents and provides justification for the ORG agent 's conduct even where he is not responding to the threat of an unjust offence against him . This specific exception also applies in the event of an obligation to perform a duty linked to his functions .", "This provision , then , supplements Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW by laying down autonomous rules governing the use of weapons and eliminating any uncertainty as to the conditions required by law in order for the ORG agent or individual not to be subject to punishment .", "As already stated , the justification is broader than that of self - defence , and is more frequently applied in cases involving resistance than in cases of direct violence against the ORG agent ; however , there is no doubt that the distinction between the CARDINAL legal scenarios , precisely if the perpetrator of the offence is a ORG agent , can become difficult to define .", "There can be no doubt , following the painstakingly conducted reconstruction of events , that PERSON , who was under orders to enforce public order , could quite legitimately make use of his weapon once the preconditions of the need to repel violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority were met . Equally , there is no doubt that the situation with which PERSON found himself confronted was CARDINAL of extreme violence designed to disturb public order and oppose the lawenforcement officers themselves , whose safety was directly threatened .", "In the instant case , it was not a question of a need to repel an act of violence on the basis of a generic concept encompassing failure to comply with authority , but of a need to ward off the real threat of an unjust act of aggression directly targeting PERSON and the persons who were with him .", "It is certain that , owing to the number of demonstrators and the very nature of the violent action being taken against PERSON and the crew of ORG in which he was travelling , he faced the threat of serious physical injury , as clearly demonstrated by the injuries reported by PERSON and officer PERSON , since they were struck in the head and the face with large stones and elsewhere on their bodies by blows administered by planks of wood , beams and sticks which were thrust violently through the broken windows of the jeep .", "The situation , then , was one of grave danger ; this is established beyond dispute not just by the video and photographic evidence in the file , but also by the statements of those who participated in the attack .", "We need only recall the description of the moments in question by the anonymous anarchist and the words of some of those directly involved in attacking the jeep :", "' ... I tried to escape down a side street and found myself , with CARDINAL people , in the bit of street leading to PERSON , where I hoped the situation would be calmer and I 'd be able to catch my breath ... almost as soon as we entered the side street we found ourselves facing CARDINAL or so carabinieri who , seeing me running towards them , took fright and fled after spraying us using small tear - gas canisters .", "We kept running , the carabinieri in front and us behind , until we reached PERSON . That was where the CARDINAL carabinieri jeeps drove between us and them , stopping us and allowing the officers to run off .", "Of the CARDINAL jeeps that arrived , CARDINAL quickly took up position with the cordon of police and carabinieri stationed in the part of ORG close to ORG ; the other , for some reason I could n't understand , drove , with its back window smashed in , into a rubbish bin which became wedged between the jeep and the wall .", "At that point I was beside the jeep ; I could see several demonstrators crowding around the vehicle , needing to get TIME of fear and frustration out of their systems ...", "I was watching what was happening around the jeep and realised that the carabiniere sitting inside was brandishing his pistol . I heard him shout \u201c NORP , bastards , I 'll kill the lot of you ! \u201d . I turned round and called out that he had a gun , trying to warn the others of the danger . At that moment PERSON , whom I did n't know at the time , was near me and looking down at the ground . As I ran towards the street where I wanted to go , I heard shots . I turned round and saw the body of a young man on the ground , the others who had been next to the vehicle stopped and moved away ... I think that TIME went by between the moment when I saw the pistol and when I heard the shots , during which the carabiniere kept shouting \u201c I 'll kill the lot of you ! \u201d . I would add that , before shooting at the man I later knew to be PERSON , the carabiniere had pointed the weapon at other people , in particular at the young man wearing a scarf and a black helmet who , realising like me that there was a gun , ran away out of the line of fire ' . Later on , during the same interview , he changed his story , saying that ' we were trying to get to a place where some people said there was no one ; in ORG , in fact , there were CARDINAL carabinieri , it was strange , they seemed to be lost ... It must have been QUANTITY to PERSON ; there were CARDINAL of them , CARDINAL of us . Almost as soon as they saw us they sprayed us with tear gas , firing in threes into the air ... At that moment they fled , we were QUANTITY away ... I did n't throw any stones or hit the jeep ... I fired a pebble from QUANTITY ... I might have kicked the jeep a few times , but to say that I picked up something , a piece of iron , and hit the jeep , I did n't do that ... I might have thrown a stone , I do n't know , in any case without intending to hurt anyone , more than anything I was afraid ... You know , if someone came at me pointing a gun , I could imagine that I 'd pick up the fire extinguisher to get the weapon off him , for instance , I can understand it , I can imagine ... I did n't go there with the intention of attacking a jeep ... I do n't think I stayed around the jeep for CARDINAL or TIME , just long enough to see this carabiniere on the side who then turned , yes , before this photo , he turned , I was looking in the direction of this young guy with the purple scarf who spoke LANGUAGE . While I was looking I took off my scarf and started calling out that we should run , and TIME after the photo was taken I heard the shots ... QUANTITY or so people ran with me , the others stayed around ...

If I 'd wanted to hurt someone , I would have used the wooden beams I found , sticks , a sledgehammer , whatever , and I 'd have gone behind to hit the jeep where the carabiniere was at the window , like the guy who tried to throw a stone at his face , and I did n't do that ... If I 'd been planning , since I arrived in the street at TIME , to hurt someone , in this case one of the law - enforcement officers , I 'd have had a very good opportunity , I 'd have had a fantastic opportunity to hurt someone , and I did n't ...

( Interview of Predonzani by the public prosecutor dated DATE ) .", "In order to understand what really happened on PERSON , it is also useful to study the statements made by PERSON , who reported to the public prosecutor 's office of his own accord on DATE , and stated as follows :", "' ... During the clashes , during the chaos , when they were charging us again , at CARDINAL point we were close to PERSON , anyway I was near FAC ... I was trying to do something , to retreat backwards or go forwards , but I could n't go anywhere : they were in front of us . Behind , there was a crowd of people throwing stones . At that point , something was happening , we were all there with a few people I do n't know , some of them had balaclavas , some were like me , others had headscarves , we saw the carabinieri retreating ... I saw some people throwing small stones at the carabinieri . The carabinieri were running back ; there was CARDINAL group moving forward and a group trying to surround them ; we pulled back , throwing stones ... The carabinieri were running back and people were throwing stones at them ... Well , they definitely got closer to us , we were running away ... At that moment the carabinieri left , we stopped and these CARDINAL jeeps arrived at top speed , I do n't know why . Anyway , they drove towards us , so obviously we ran off ; of the QUANTITY jeeps , one reversed from the church and managed to get away , the other did a U - turn and got stuck . We all threw ourselves on it , as you can see ; there , QUANTITY away , I saw this wooden beam , I picked it up and hit the jeep CARDINAL times , but not the window , because it was already smashed when I arrived . I hit the arriving jeep CARDINAL times , then I took the stick , the window was already broken and the carabiniere was there looking at me ... The one who did n't shoot , the one who saw me with the beam ... I did n't see anything , not even the gun , nothing , then , leaving the stick and turning round , I heard someone say ' Come on , we might be able to save him , come on ' and ' Murderers , murderers , they 've killed him ' . I hit the van CARDINAL times , I pulled back , there were CARDINAL carabinieri , the one who had n't fired who was looking at me , I swiped at him with the beam , I do n't even know if I got him , I might have hit him in the side . He ducked down to take cover , I stopped , I let go of the beam ; in the meantime , people carried on throwing stones . He fired and I was still there , when I threw the beam , I did n't run away ... When I threw myself against him , that 's when the guy fired ... It was they who attacked us with ORG , that 's different . The security forces were retreating on foot and we were running , we were practically nose to nose , they went back as far as possible , we stopped and the CARDINAL jeeps came towards us . Then they reversed and the jeep stopped , next we had the QUANTITY seconds of madness , with all the people who were there . I would n't have killed anyone , I 'm not a criminal ... With all the stones that were being thrown , I did n't hear the shots being fired ... Someone shouted ' Bastards , go away ! \u201d for TIME ... ' When asked how many people had been close to the jeep , he replied ' Lots ' .", "The photographs in the file provide ample evidence of the violence described by the demonstrators themselves .", "Photographs CARDINAL clearly show a fire extinguisher which , having been thrown at the smashed rear window of the jeep , hits PERSON 's right foot . The latter is clearly leaning over the spare wheel in an attempt to prevent the fire extinguisher from reaching the inside of the jeep . This is the same fire extinguisher which , TIME , Carlo Giuliani picks up off the ground , raising it above his head in order to throw it once more at the inside of the jeep , as someone , possibly even PERSON himself , had tried to do moments earlier , according to the statement made to the police on DATE by PERSON , manager of the QCARDINAL petrol station in ORG . PERSON stated that , shortly after TIME , she had observed from her home a young man wearing a dark balaclava , a white t - shirt and dark trousers , leaving the petrol station with a fire extinguisher whose contents he emptied , and then turning down ORG . She later recognised the portable extinguisher found next to the body of Carlo Giuliani as being the same one .", "The violence of the attack by large numbers of demonstrators , the constant barrage of stones to which the vehicle was subjected and which caused physical harm to its passengers , as noted by the forensic medical reports , the aggression towards the passengers by the demonstrators , who continued to surround the vehicle at very DATE while thrusting hard objects inside , and the consequent persistence of a dangerous situation , undeniably amounted to a real and unjust threat to the personal integrity of PERSON and his colleagues , one which certainly called for a defensive reaction that was bound to culminate in his using the only means at his disposal : his weapon .", "PERSON 's action was not an isolated act of aggression , as suggested by the family 's lawyers , but simply CARDINAL phase in a violent attack on the jeep by the large numbers of persons who had surrounded it and were trying to turn it over and , probably , to open the door , as stated by some of those present at the time of the events , at the risk of causing direct and more serious injuries to the vehicle 's occupants .", "On the basis of the hypothesis , now proven , that the shot fired by PERSON was fired upwards , there can be no doubt that the latter 's conduct , which resulted in the death of PERSON , is covered by the provisions of LAW , as the carabiniere fired two shots directly upwards , after numerous unsuccessful warnings to end the violence , and one of the objects thrown deflected the bullet , as the result of a wholly unforeseeable event , causing the death of Carlo Giuliani .", "All the evidence produced by the investigation , which was undoubtedly conducted thoroughly , therefore enables us to rule out with certainty the possibility that PERSON deliberately aimed his shots at FAC . However , even had that proved to be the case , there can be no doubt that the carabiniere , who was authorised to use firearms , with the risks inherent in the use of such instruments , found himself facing a genuine threat to his life or physical integrity and those of his colleagues , a threat which had already materialised in the form of actions threatening officers ' physical integrity and which were becoming more and more violent . Hence , he could legitimately have aimed his weapon at the attackers in order to prevent them from continuing their actions , and even sought to inflict limited injury ( for instance , by firing shots designed not to hit any vital organs ) , since it was not a case of passive resistance , nor had the assailant taken a hostage as a human shield \u2013 the only cases in which legal commentators and the case - law are united in excluding the legitimate use of a weapon directly against the aggressor .", "On the basis of the above considerations we can therefore conclude that PERSON 's action was justified under LAW , particularly since the use of his weapon , which was absolutely essential , was adapted in order to present the minimum danger possible , given that the shots were certainly fired upwards and that it was only as the result of an unforeseeable change in trajectory that one of them struck Carlo Giuliani . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge next considered it necessary to determine whether ORG had acted in self - defence , given that this was a \u201c more stringent \u201d test for excluding responsibility .", "In that connection that judge took the view that GPE had rightly perceived a threat to his physical integrity and that of his colleagues , and that the threat had persisted on account of the violence of the context . In the judge 's opinion , in assessing whether GPE 's response had been necessary and proportionate , PERSON situation and action ( lifting up an empty fire extinguisher ) could not be viewed in isolation . On the contrary , his action had to be considered as one phase in a violent attack on the jeep by a crowd of demonstrators . The attack had not been perpetrated by PERSON acting on his own , but by a crowd of assailants . Hence , PERSON 's response had to be viewed in relation to the latter in order to be assessed in its proper \u201c context \u201d .", "In view of the number of assailants , the means used , the sustained nature of the violence , the injuries to the carabinieri in the jeep and the vehicle 's difficulty in leaving the square due to engine trouble , ORG 's response could be said to have been necessary . Furthermore , it had been appropriate given the level of violence .", "In that connection the judge said that there was no doubt that , had ORG not taken out his weapon and fired CARDINAL shots , the attack would have continued . She further stated that if the fire extinguisher \u2013 which GPE had already kicked away once \u2013 had landed in the jeep , it would have caused serious injury to the occupants . The judge said that GPE had had CARDINAL means of countering the attack : his firearm . She took the view in that connection that GPE had made proportionate use of the weapon since , before shooting , he had shouted to the demonstrators to leave in an attempt to put a stop to their behaviour ; he had then fired upwards . The judge concluded that GPE had acted in self - defence . She added that the fact that GPE could see PERSON \u2013 as asserted by the prosecution authorities ' experts and by the applicants DATE and that he had taken the risk of killing someone did nothing to alter that conclusion , given that GPE 's action had been prompted by the need to defend the physical integrity of the jeep 's occupants and had been proportionate to the importance of what was being defended and the means available to him in order to defend it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision to discontinue the proceedings read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON 's conduct has to be assessed also in the light of the persistence of the most restrictive conditions laid down by LAW in order to ascertain whether , with regard to the factual circumstances and the response to them , it is possible also to invoke the elements needed to satisfy the more stringent conditions for claiming self - defence . The factual circumstances and the context in which PERSON had to act have been described at length . There can be no doubt that in such a situation , comparable to the situation in the nearby PERSON which had led shortly beforehand to an armoured vehicle being set on fire after a Molotov cocktail was thrown inside it , PERSON was under the firm impression that there was a threat to his safety and that of his colleagues , a threat which had already materialised in the form of injuries ( as revealed by the documents in the file and the injuries reported by the jeep 's occupants ) , and that the danger continued despite his having issued repeated warnings while displaying his weapon . One has only to observe the numerous photographs showing the jeep still surrounded by demonstrators smashing in the windows with sticks and iron bars which they are thrusting inside the vehicle with the clear aim not just of damaging the vehicle by way of protest , but of hurting the crew , and throwing a huge number of stones at the vehicle , most of which reached the inside and hit the occupants , in order to gain some idea of the very real violence being unleashed and the subsequent injury which could have been caused to the vehicle 's occupants . It is not possible either to support the hypothesis , put forward by the injured party 's lawyers during the hearing , that PERSON 's head injuries could have been caused by his having knocked against the internal levers of the flashing light on top of the jeep rather than by the demonstrators ' actions . Quite apart from the objective fact that numerous bloodstained stones were found inside the jeep , the lever of the flashing light on the roof is covered in plastic and inserted in a ball - and - socket joint covered with a protective cap which is used to direct the light . The very fact that the lever is connected to a ball - and - socket joint means that the whole structure lacks the necessary rigidity to cause injuries to passengers ' heads , still less injuries with abrasions of the kind reported by PERSON . Coming back to the actual situation , there can be no doubt that the response was necessary in view of all the surrounding circumstances and in particular the number of assailants , the means they were using to attack individuals , the length of time for which the violence continued despite repeated warnings from the carabinieri , the injuries already sustained by the latter and , lastly , the difficulty of leaving the scene given that the jeep 's engine had stalled ( a move that was not required but was nevertheless attempted ) . It follows that even if we assess whether the defensive reaction was commensurate with the attack being perpetrated in terms of the substantial equivalence of the interests under threat , our conclusion can not but be positive , as the attack on the carabinieri jeep took the form of actions which were not only dangerous , but in themselves amounted to a violation of the rights and , in particular , the physical integrity of the vehicle 's occupants . Furthermore , it is beyond dispute , in the light of the factual circumstances , that had PERSON not drawn his weapon , threatening the demonstrators and then firing the CARDINAL shots , the attack would have continued and would have had further , undoubtedly more serious , consequences ; similarly , if the fire extinguisher which PERSON had already kicked away once had landed inside the jeep and hit the already injured carabinieri , it would have caused very serious injury , or worse . The presence of real danger and of an unjust attack was therefore borne out not just by the level of risk but by the fact that the attack was already in progress , and it must next be ascertained whether the requirement of proportionality was met , in terms also of the means available to the person under attack and the manner in which those means were deployed . As to whether the means of defence were proportionate to the attack , ORG has specified on a number of occasions that , for the purposes of determining whether an individual acted in self - defence , the decision as to proportionality , which must be taken by reference to the means available to the person under attack and the interests being protected , can not be qualitative and is by its nature relative . It is invariably a question of balancing the interests of the assailant and those of the person under attack who , in defending himself , is not in a position , in the specific situation , to make a precise assessment of the real danger and the effects of his response , with the result that the principle of proportionality is not infringed even if the harm to the assailant would be slightly in excess of the threatened harm to the person being attacked . ( In the case in question , with regard to the plea that was accepted , the accused had defended himself using a shotgun , the only instrument to hand at that moment , in order to counter the unexpected attack which the victim , armed with an iron bar QUANTITY in length , had previously unleashed on the accused 's father and then on the accused himself , inflicting various injuries . ORG , First Section , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE Catane ) . ORG further found that , as regards the notion of self - defence , the expressions ' need to defend ' and ' provided that the defensive response is proportionate to the attack ' , contained in LAW , should be taken to mean that the response must be , in the circumstances , the only one possible in the sense that it could not be replaced by another , less damaging response equally capable of protecting the right under attack ( whether of the person in question or another person ) ( Court of Cassation , First Section , judgment no . DATE of DATE \u2013 GPE and PERSON ) . These principles , on which the established case - law and most legal commentators are in agreement , when applied to the factual circumstances surrounding the tragic death of PERSON , also enable us to conclude that the requirement of proportionality between the means of attack available to the assailants and the means available to the persons under attack was met . This conclusion is justified in view of the fact that the concept of proportionality must make reference not just to the competing interests at stake , as already mentioned , but also to the means used to defend them . PERSON had only one means of dealing with the violence against him and the attack on his physical integrity , not to say his life , and that of his colleagues : his weapon . In this respect also the factual findings suggest that in using that means of defence , he adapted it in order to cause the minimum harm to his assailants while attempting to deter them from taking action and make them desist . ORG has even stated that , ' for the purposes of determining whether the individual acted in self - defence , an assessment must be made of the proportionality between the defensive means available to the person under attack and the means actually deployed \u2013 where CARDINAL means is available but it can be used in a varying and calibrated manner \u2013 in order to compare the different deployment options available and the option actually chosen in the light of the method of attack or its foreseeable consequences . Such a situation is in every respect identical to a situation in which a comparison has to be made between a variety of means available and the means actually deployed . That is why the use of a firearm as a means of defence should be confined , where the attack is aimed at causing maximum harm to the person 's physical integrity , to displaying the weapon and one 's resolve to make use of it , while firing only into the air and on the ground , or in the direction of the assailant but taking care not to hit him or , at most , to hit him only in parts of the body not containing vital organs , and hence with the sole aim of deterring or wounding , but not of causing death ' or , to put it another way , ' with the sole aim of offering resistance or damaging the assailant 's physical integrity ' ( PERSON .

Notwithstanding the fact that numerous photographs show the jeep surrounded by demonstrators , with PERSON 's arm sticking out and brandishing the weapon , and the fact that the statements in the file made by the person under investigation and also by the assailants themselves testify to the carabiniere 's repeated warnings to the demonstrators to disperse , the same photographic material clearly shows that these attempts to deter the assailants had no effect on the demonstrators , who continued to display extreme violence , eventually prompting PERSON to make use of his weapon , his only available means of countering the violence . What is more , PERSON 's conduct appears to have complied fully with the proportionality requirement as regards the manner in which he deployed the means at his disposal bearing in mind that , had he wished to be sure of injuring CARDINAL or other of his assailants , he could have pointed the weapon at the side windows outside which numerous demonstrators had gathered , whereas the complex technical findings show that the shots were certainly fired upwards ; only as the result of a tragic turn of events did the first shot cause the death of the young Mr PERSON . Consequently , whether PERSON had a partial view of PERSON , as the injured party 's lawyers maintain ( a hypothesis also entertained by the prosecution authorities ' experts ) , or whether , as seems more likely , he really did not see him and fired from the highest point which his position would allow , possibly accepting the risk that the shot might hit somebody , his action appears justified on grounds of self - defence , given that the intentional element of what occurred , whether it was planned or simply anticipated , was undoubtedly determined by the need to defend rights that were being unjustly violated , and that the defensive response remained within the bounds of proportionality , in terms of both the value of the interests at stake and the means available to protect them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The requests for additional investigation made by counsel for the applicants were rejected by the judge in their entirety for the reasons set out below .", "CARDINAL . As to the request concerning the forensic medical report on the causes of PERSON death , seeking in particular to ascertain whether the latter had still been alive when the jeep drove over him and , accordingly , whether the investigative methods used had been scientifically sound :", "\u201c It has already been stated that there is no evidence in the file capable of raising doubts as to whether the checks were carried out thoroughly and the investigative methods used by the experts were sound ; accordingly , the additional checks requested are unnecessary . It is further observed that the injured parties were offered the opportunity of participating in the autopsy on the young man 's body with their own experts , and hence of satisfying themselves that the investigative methods used were correct , but chose not to avail themselves of that possibility or to carry out their own examination of the young man 's remains . On the contrary , the body was cremated scarcely DATE after his death , thereby rendering any subsequent examination impossible , even assuming that it would have served any purpose ( which was not the case ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the request for police chief PERSON and carabinieri second lieutenant PERSON to be examined on the subject of the directives issued with a view to maintaining public order , and the lawfulness of the use of \u201c thigh holsters \u201d of the kind from which GPE had drawn the weapon that fired the fatal shot :", "\u201c This examination too seems wholly inappropriate in terms of investigating the tragic events leading to the death of PERSON , given that the directives issued with a view to the maintenance of public order can not but be of a general nature and certainly do not encompass instructions governing unforeseeable situations involving direct attacks on officers of the kind to which officer PERSON was responding . The latter 's conduct , as stated on several occasions , was justified both on the basis of legitimate use of a weapon and the more stringent conditions for claiming selfdefence . As to the request to investigate the lawfulness of the use of \u201c thigh holsters \u201d and the detailed arrangements governing their use by carabinieri , it is not clear what this information would add to the investigation , as the manner in which PERSON was wearing the pistol is of no relevance given that , in the situation described , he could legitimately make use of the weapon irrespective of where he was wearing it or where he drew it from . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the request to trace the person who threw the stone that may have deflected the bullet , with a view to obtaining evidence from him or her concerning the trajectory of the stone :", "\u201c This is impossible to verify in practice , even were it to be considered necessary , as it is unrealistic to imagine that a demonstrator would follow the trajectory of a stone after throwing it in order to make sure that it had reached its target ; the demonstrators were more concerned with finding new hard objects to throw at the law - enforcement officers .", "In addition , even allowing for the possibility of such evidence being taken from an unknown demonstrator who , paradoxically and unintentionally , caused the death of a fellow demonstrator , it would be impossible to identify the person concerned and his or her statements would in any event be irrelevant in relation to the existing technical findings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the request for further examination of the demonstrator PERSON concerning the conduct of the carabinieri inside the Defender jeep , the number of demonstrators around the vehicle and the person inside the jeep who actually seized the weapon , in the light of the statements made by Monai during an earlier interview ; also regarding further examination of E. Predonzani concerning the same circumstances , PERSON position before he was struck by the fatal bullet and the number of the jeep 's windows that were broken :", "\u201c Any further examination would serve no purpose whatsoever , given the statements made by Monai and PERSON very shortly after the events \u2013 while those events were fresher in their minds than would be the case DATE when they reported of their own accord to the public prosecutor 's office in order to give evidence , to the best of their knowledge , concerning the events in which they had played a part and the tragic death of PERSON . These statements contain extremely precise details which have been confirmed by the video footage and photographs in the file , with the result that they provide important confirmation of the findings of the technical investigations . The various statements made by PERSON and , in particular , NORP , to the press and on television , on the other hand , have no legal value and it is not necessary in any case to shed further light on their content in view of the precise reconstruction conducted immediately after the events , which was confirmed by objective data such as photographs and film footage . It does not appear relevant either to establish how many of the jeep 's windows were broken , as it is beyond dispute that some of the right - side windows and the rear window were smashed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the request for evidence to be taken from PERSON PERSON , supposedly to confirm that no Molotov cocktails were thrown on PERSON , contrary to what was suggested by PERSON , and to determine how far away PERSON was when he took the photograph on which the prosecution authorities ' experts based their findings in conducting the ballistics reconstruction :", "\u201c This request does not appear capable , either , of making any contribution to the investigation , as the photograph taken by PERSON was just one of the elements used to determine PERSON 's position when he was struck by the bullet . The distance between the victim and the jeep was calculated taking account of the presumed position of the persons shown in the photographs in relation to fixed elements such as street furniture and road signs , on the basis of which specific measurements were taken ; this distance is confirmed by the statements of the persons who were next to PERSON .", "The assertion made in the request for further investigation that PERSON suggested that Molotov cocktails had been thrown on PERSON is inaccurate . PERSON never maintained that Molotov cocktails had been thrown on PERSON \u2013 he simply stated that he had been afraid they might be . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the request for evidence to be heard from ORG as to when the hatchback window of the jeep had been smashed :", "\u201c There is no doubt that the window was not broken by PERSON 's shot , as it is clear from the photos which show PERSON 's hand brandishing the pistol in order to intimidate the demonstrators that it had already been broken \u2013 probably by a stone being thrown \u2013 well before PERSON fired the shot that killed PERSON . The differing perception of CARDINAL of the occupants of another jeep did not influence the reconstruction of the events , which were established in an indisputable and wholly objective manner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the request concerning access to the footage filmed on ORG by CARDINAL carabinieri whose helmets were equipped with video cameras , \u201c labelled and handed over to Colonel Leso \u201d :", "\u201c The material in question is already in the file , as made clear by the communication from the Genoa carabinieri dated DATE which records the handing - over to the public prosecutor 's office of CARDINAL video cassettes , CARDINAL of which contain footage shot in various locations around the city \u2013 including ORG \u2013 using video cameras attached to the helmets of certain carabinieri ; the other CARDINAL video cassettes contain images taken from the army helicopter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the request for carabiniere PERSON to be examined on the reasons why the bullet had lost its casing :", "\u201c The request from the injured party 's lawyers is based on the unsolicited statements made by PERSON in which he said that ' cutting the tips of bullets in order to make them fragment more easily [ was ] common practice ' and that this automatically ruled out ' any intention to use firearms to intimidate . They [ were ] designed to kill on first impact ' .", "While the existence of this practice as it emerges from PERSON 's statement is noted , it is not clear what purpose would be served if PERSON were to be examined by the public prosecutor 's office , given that we already have the findings of the ballistics expert reports based on objective examinations . Since the possibility raised by PERSON can only be considered as a reference to an improper practice which is not widespread , it is hard to see for what reason and on the basis of what objective information officer PERSON should be thought to have engaged in it , given , moreover , that the other bullets found in the magazine of his pistol were perfectly normal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Regarding the request for forensic examination of the jeep in order to determine the cause of the damage to the top part of its upright , above the second ' i ' of the word ' NORP ' :", "\u201c The inspection carried out to determine the origin of the damage caused to the hatchback , which was certainly caused by the large number of stones and hard objects thrown at the vehicle , has already been dealt with at length . There can be no doubt that the damage in question here came from the same source .", "The additional examination requested would not therefore serve to dispel the doubts of counsel for the requesting party concerning the collision of the bullet with a stone , as it is not reasonable to assume that a single stone could have been thrown at the vehicle and dented it in several places , given that large numbers of objects were thrown at the scene and at the vehicles of the law - enforcement agencies and caused not only personal injury but also visible damage to the bodywork of the jeep . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the request concerning the panel 's examination of the spent cartridges seized with a view to checking which weapon they were fired from , seeking to extend the examination to include the weapons of all the lawenforcement officers present on Piazza Alimonda at the moment when PERSON was struck by the bullet :", "\u201c This examination clearly serves no real purpose . It is beyond doubt , by PERSON 's own admission and according to the findings of the expert reports , that the shot which killed PERSON was indeed fired from PERSON 's weapon .", "The investigations conducted at the time by the public prosecutor 's office in order to establish whether other law - enforcement officers had used their firearms in or around Piazza Alimonda on DATE produced a negative response , except as regards the shots fired in PERSON , at the junction with GPE , by the carabiniere PERSON in order to intimidate and disperse some demonstrators armed with bars , stones and pickaxes who had surrounded another armoured vehicle and were throwing stones at it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the criticism by the applicants ' lawyers concerning the fact that numerous steps in the investigation had been delegated to the carabinieri and that a considerable amount of evidence had been taken in the presence of members of the carabinieri , the judge found as follows :", "\u201c While such considerations may at first sight appear justified , they have no bearing on the events actually found to have occurred on PERSON , resulting in the tragic death of young PERSON , and whose dramatic unfolding has been reconstructed with the aid of the large volume of video footage and photographs in the file and the statements of the participants themselves . The wealth of these resources and details is such that no further attention can DATE or should \u2013 be devoted to other wholly irrelevant considerations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In the light of these findings , the investigating judge concluded that \u201c it [ had ] been proven that the carabiniere GPE [ had ] acted in circumstances justifying a decision not to prosecute and that there [ were ] no grounds for holding ORG responsible in relation to the death of Carlo Giuliani \u201d . The judge therefore issued a decision to discontinue the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a parliamentary commission of inquiry heard evidence from Mr PERSON , an officer of the GPE police , who had taken part in the public - order operation in Genoa .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that the carabinieri had been equipped with throat microphones , enabling them to communicate very rapidly with one another .", "When asked to explain why the law - enforcement officers stationed quite near to the jeep ( QUANTITY away ) had not intervened , Mr PERSON replied that the men had been on duty since the morning and had been involved in several clashes during DATE . He added that he had not noticed at the time of the events that there was a group of carabinieri and police officers who could have intervened .", "As to the function of the CARDINAL jeeps , Mr PERSON explained that they had brought fresh supplies at TIME and had left and then returned TIME to see if anyone had been injured .", "PERSON also said that he had called an ambulance for Carlo Giuliani as no doctor had been present at the scene .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a group of parliamentarians called on the government to explain why law - enforcement officers being deployed on public - order operations were equipped with live ammunition rather than rubber bullets . The parliamentarians advocated the use of the latter , arguing that they had been used successfully on many occasions in other countries .", "The government spokesman replied that the legislation made no provision for that option and that , moreover , it had not been proven that rubber bullets did not also entail very serious consequences for the victim . Finally , he said that the possibility of introducing non - lethal weapons was currently being examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made public its judgment following the trial of CARDINAL demonstrators on a number of charges ( including criminal damage , theft , destroying property , looting and acts of violence against law - enforcement officers ) in relation to the events of DATE . ORG , Defence and Justice , and the government , had joined the proceedings as civil parties seeking damages . An appeal has been lodged against the judgment in question and the proceedings are pending .", "CARDINAL . This judgment helps shed light on the events of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In the course of CARDINAL hearings ORG had the opportunity , inter alia , to hear evidence from large numbers of witnesses and to examine the abundant audiovisual material in detail .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its conclusions the court held that the attack by carabinieri on the FAC bianche procession had been unlawful and arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . In reaching that conclusion , the court found it established that the FAC bianche demonstrators had not committed any significant acts of violence against the carabinieri who attacked them . The use of tear gas and the carabinieri advance towards PERSON had occurred without there being any real need to use force . The attack had been carried out against CARDINAL of persons who were doing no harm , and had not even been aimed at isolating and blocking off the few individuals engaged in throwing objects at the carabinieri , who were able to carry on undisturbed . Furthermore , no order to disperse had been given .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to find that the subsequent charge had also been unlawful and arbitrary . It had not been preceded by a warning to disperse , nor had it been ordered by the officer authorised to do so . It had been unnecessary : the footage showed that the demonstrators had been standing motionless behind PERSON shields and that no objects were being thrown by the participants in the march , apart from CARDINAL objects fired from outside the crowd . In addition , the law - enforcement officers had had enough time ( CARDINAL ) to request instructions , but had not done so . Lastly , the march had been lawful and the demonstrators had not attacked the carabinieri .", "CARDINAL . The methods deployed had also been unlawful . The carabinieri had fired tear gas at chest height , a large number of demonstrators had sustained injuries caused by truncheons which did not conform to the regulations , and the armoured vehicles had knocked down the barricades and pursued members of the crowd on to the pavement with the clear intention of hurting them .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG considered that the unlawful and arbitrary nature of the carabinieri 's actions had justified the resistance shown by the demonstrators while tear gas was being used and during the charge on the procession . It had also justified the clashes which occurred in the side streets , FAC and PERSON , prior to TIME , that is , prior to the point at which the carabinieri had acted on the order to stop and to allow the march to proceed . In conclusion , the court held that the accused 's actions had been a \u201c necessary response \u201d to the arbitrary actions of the law - enforcement officers for the purposes of LAW no . FAC of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court also forwarded the file to the public prosecutor 's office on the ground that the statements by Mr ORG and CARDINAL other lawenforcement officers to the effect that the attack had been necessary to counter the aggression shown by the demonstrators did not match the facts .", "CARDINAL . As to the demonstrators ' conduct after TIME , on the other hand , ORG considered that it had no longer been justified by the actions of the law - enforcement officers , as the unlawful and arbitrary attack had come to an end . Consequently , although the demonstrators may have still felt a sense of abuse and injustice , their conduct at that stage had no longer been defensive but had been driven by a desire for revenge , making it unjustified and punishable .", "CARDINAL . With specific reference to the events on PERSON , ORG considered that the attack ordered by police officer PERSON against the group of demonstrators had been neither unlawful nor arbitrary . As a result , the ensuing violent reaction by the demonstrators , consisting in pursuing the carabinieri and attacking the jeep , could not be regarded as a defensive response to arbitrary conduct on the part of the lawenforcement agencies .", "CARDINAL . As to the conduct of the carabinieri in the jeep , the persons concerned might well have imagined that they were being subjected to an attempted lynching . The fact that the demonstrators in question \u2013 unlike LOC groups DATE did not have Molotov cocktails and had therefore not been in a position to set the vehicle on fire was a factor that could be appreciated with TIME . ORG found that the occupants of the jeep could not be blamed for not having followed that line of reasoning and having panicked .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , PERSON had been QUANTITY from the jeep when he was shot and killed . In his statements , ORG said that his gas mask had allowed him only a partial view . ORG said that he did not understand why the vehicle he had boarded had not taken him to hospital but had followed the contingent . He had only been able to see what was happening inside the vehicle . When the shot was fired , he had been lying down with his feet pointing towards the rear door of the vehicle . He had pulled PERSON down on top of him and could not see his own hand ; he was unable to say whether it had been inside or outside the jeep . In any event , he had fired upwards . ORG judgment mentions that the expert PERSON , who performed the autopsy on PERSON body , stated for his part that the trajectory of the fatal bullet indicated a direct shot ( \u201c la traiettoria rimandava ad uno sparo diretto \u201d ) .
