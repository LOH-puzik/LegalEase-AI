He was represented before the ORG by Dr J. Herrera , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "Following a car accident on DATE , the applicant was sued by third parties for damages .", "According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( ORG ) the action was filed with ORG ( ORG ) . As the parties did not agree on the choice of arbitrator , an arbitrator was appointed by the ORG \u2019s Chairman according to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ( see relevant domestic law ) . The applicant acknowledged that the CARDINAL insurance policies covering the traffic accident had not been issued by an insurance company for which the arbitrator nominated acted as a legal adviser when working in private practice . Thus , there was no direct conflict of interest .", "At the first sitting the applicant submitted that the law making this type of action subject to arbitration , as opposed to the ordinary courts , breached his LAW rights under LAW . At the request of the applicant the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of constitutional proceedings ( see below ) . After they were resumed in DATE the proceedings were again suspended pending the outcome of proceedings before this ORG . According to the applicant , had he not requested these suspensions , the ORG would have argued that he had accepted the jurisdiction of the arbitrator .", "On DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings alleging a breach of LAW on account of the fact that he was forced to submit his case to an arbitrator who did not offer sufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality . He requested the court to stay the proceedings .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction upheld the applicant \u2019s claim . It considered that the applicant had a legal interest in filing the claim as it was the law itself and not its application in the applicant \u2019s case that infringed his rights . It held that since arbitration was mandatory in certain cases , the tribunal had to be independent and impartial . Having analysed the ORG provisions ( see relevant domestic law ) , it considered that an arbitrator was subject to the ORG \u2019s decision . The ORG \u2019s Chairman had a discretion to decide whether to appoint a person as arbitrator and whether to appoint that person again in a subsequent case . It followed that the appointment of an arbitrator to CARDINAL or more cases depended on the subjective appreciation of the ORG , who was to an extent subject to the control of the Minister . Thus , the arbitrator did not enjoy security of tenure . He or she would be chosen for specific cases and might never be chosen again if disliked . The court further considered that an appeal on points of law could not remedy this defect , since such right of appeal was limited in scope . In consequence , ORG did not fulfil the requirement of independence under LAW , particularly where , as in the instant case , the parties had not agreed on the choice of arbitrator . The court further held that the system also created justified doubts as to the objective impartiality of ORG , having regard to its composition , organisation and the appointment and removal of arbitrators .", "On DATE the defendants appealed .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the appeal and reversed the first - instance judgment . Reiterating that the ORG must comply with the requirements of impartiality and independence , it held that the criteria for choosing an arbitrator according to LAW ( see relevant domestic law ) were intended to ensure that persons appointed as arbitrators were competent and displayed integrity . In the absence of agreement between the parties , the selection of an independent arbitrator was left to the chairman . While it was true that the chairman was appointed by the Minister and was therefore to a certain extent subject to the Minister \u2019s control , this could not be relevant since in most cases the Government were not a party to the arbitration proceedings . It followed that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ( see relevant domestic law ) offered sufficient guarantees . Moreover , the removal of an arbitrator was , like any other decision of the ORG , an administrative decision subject to judicial review . However , the removal of an arbitrator from a particular case was usually intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure and could not raise issues as to security of tenure . Lastly , in the applicant \u2019s case there was no actual or realistic threat to the independence of the tribunal . For the reasons stated above , the court also considered that there was no issue of partiality , particularly because the arbitrator was independent of the parties in a case and the law offered sufficient guarantees in this respect . A chairman making an appointment would have to take account of all the relevant considerations beforehand . Indeed , in the present case , it did not appear that the applicant was complaining about the specific choice of arbitrator in his case . Since such proceedings were LAW compliant it was not necessary to consider whether an appeal could have remedied the defect alleged .", "In so far as relevant , the pertinent provisions of LAW , LAW of LAW , read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) There shall be a ORG which shall be responsible for the policy and general administration of the affairs and business of the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The ORG shall consist of not CARDINAL and not CARDINAL members , appointed by the President of GPE acting on the advice of the Minister , one of whom shall be designated by the Minister as chairman .
