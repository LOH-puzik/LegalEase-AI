THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of association)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a trade union based in GPE with a membership of CARDINAL persons employed in different sectors of the transport industry in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Noting that in the domestic system industrial disputes are governed by very detailed legislative provisions , the applicant union raised CARDINAL specific limitations on the statutory protection of strike action that it submitted were inconsistent with LAW , each of the contested limitations being exposed by a separate set of facts .", "CARDINAL . The relevant set of facts relied on under this head involved the company ORG ( ORG ) , which was under contract to manage , operate and maintain the electrical power network used by GPE \u2019s underground transport system . The ORG was one of several trade unions recognised by the company for the purposes of collective bargaining . In all , the company employed CARDINAL staff at CARDINAL different sites , the biggest one being that at GPE with CARDINAL employees . According to the applicant union , there were CARDINAL RMT members there at the relevant time . The company would not have known which of its employees were members of a trade union , as it did not operate a system for deducting union subscriptions from staff wages .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant union and the company held several rounds of negotiation on pay and conditions of service . Dissatisfied with the company \u2019s offer , it decided to embark on industrial action and on DATE gave the requisite ballot notice to the company ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The notice described the category of workers that would be voting on industrial action as \u201c Engineer / Technician \u201d and stated how many of such were based at each site . DATE the company wrote to the applicant union , stating that it did not recognise the term \u201c Technician \u201d ( it categorised its workers in a more precise way : fitters , jointers , test - room inspectors , day testers , shift testers , ORG fitters ) . It considered the ballot notice served on it was therefore not compliant with the relevant statutory provisions . The applicant union replied DATE , maintaining that the term it had used was sufficient to allow the company to know which employees were concerned , thereby meeting the purpose of the relevant provisions of law .", "CARDINAL . Following a further exchange of correspondence between the CARDINAL sides , the company applied to ORG for an injunction to restrain the applicant union from calling industrial action on the basis of the ballot . The injunction was granted by PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The judge did not accept the applicant union \u2019s claim that the statutory requirements unduly restricted the exercise of its right to call industrial action , this same argument having been rejected by ORG in the case of ORG v. ORG ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . He also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it . Instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction . Given the sector involved , the implications of a shutdown would be substantial , with widespread ramifications elsewhere . Addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted , the judge found that it had not , since the union \u2019s members at GPE included persons working at different trades . The applicant union was not under an absolute duty , but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company . The fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive . Similarly , the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration , but not necessarily a decisive one . The applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment \u2013 it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so . Finally , the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike ( the ballot not having taken place ) , there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer \u2019s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action . The applicant union \u2019s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach .", "CARDINAL . Application for permission to appeal was refused on the papers on DATE . Renewed application for permission to appeal was refused on DATE , by which point the industrial dispute between the applicant union and ORG had already been resolved .", "CARDINAL . Following the granting of the injunction against the strike , the applicant union set about gathering the precise job descriptions of the workers concerned and included these in a fresh notice of a strike ballot , the result of which supported industrial action . This went ahead on dates in DATE and DATE . ORG made an improved offer on DATE which was accepted by the union \u2019s members and took effect as a collective agreement on DATE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The set of facts relied on under this head involved some RMT members who were employed in railway maintenance by ORG , a company that formed part of a group of companies known as ORG plc . Another company in the group , ORG , was engaged in rail engineering work . At the time , PERSON and ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) employed CARDINAL persons in total , CARDINAL of whom were members of the ORG . In DATE , ORG transferred part of its undertaking , comprising CARDINAL employees , to another company known as ORG ( GPE ) Ltd ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . These employees\u2019 existing terms and conditions were preserved by ORG , as required by law ( ORG ) . According to the applicant union , the employees involved were nonetheless concerned for their situation , as ORG workers were paid significantly less . It also appeared that trade unions had less influence in that company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG \u2019s management informed the ex - PERSON employees that because of difficult market conditions it intended to reduce the level of their terms and conditions to that of other ORG staff . This meant a reduction in salary of PERCENT , according to the applicant union . In DATE that followed , the applicant union made representations to ORG on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement . When the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan , the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned ( CARDINAL by that stage ) . They voted in favour of a strike , which took place DATE and DATE . During the strike , the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work . This caused ORG to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer \u2019s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . A second strike was announced for DATE , but this was postponed when ORG indicated its willingness to resume discussions with the applicant union . This led to a revised offer which the union submitted to its ORG members , recommending that they accept it . The result of the vote was known on DATE . CARDINAL votes were cast , all of them rejecting the ORG offer . According to the applicant union , its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the ORG workforce . These were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company , whose activities had not really been disrupted at all . The applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its ORG interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its PERSON members as well . The simple threat of a strike on this scale , and a fortiori an actual stoppage , would have exerted significantly more pressure on ORG to maintain existing terms and conditions . The applicant union stated that PERSON employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at ORG . Instead , the ORG members had had to stand alone , and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions . They did so under protest .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant union , neither PERSON nor ORG exist any longer , having been put into administration in DATE and DATE respectively . The ORG undertaking was purchased by another company , which in turn sold it on in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the ORG case , PERSON referred to the following provisions of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) An act done by a trade union to induce a person to take part , or continue to take part , in industrial action", "( a ) is not protected unless the industrial action has the support of a ballot , and", "( b ) where section CARDINALA falls to be complied with in relation to the person \u2019s employer , is not protected as respects the employer unless the trade union has complied with section CARDINALA in relation to him . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The trade union must take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that\u2014", "( a ) not later than DATE before DATE of the ballot , the notice specified in subsection ( CARDINAL ) , ...", "is received by every person who it is reasonable for the union to believe ( at the latest time when steps could be taken to comply with paragraph ( a ) ) will be the employer of persons who will be entitled to vote in the ballot .", "( CARDINAL ) The notice referred to in paragraph ( a ) of subsection ( CARDINAL ) is a notice in writing\u2014", "( a ) stating that the union intends to hold the ballot ,", "( b ) specifying the date which the union reasonably believes will be DATE of the ballot , and", "( c ) NORP containing\u2014", "( i ) the lists mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) and the figures mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) , together with an explanation of how those figures were arrived at , or", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The lists are\u2014", "( a ) a list of the categories of employee to which the employees concerned belong , and", "( b ) a list of the workplaces at which the employees concerned work .", "( CARDINAL ) The figures are\u2014", "( a ) the total number of employees concerned ,", "( b ) the number of the employees concerned in each of the categories in the list mentioned in subsection ( CARDINALA)(a ) , and", "( c ) the number of the employees concerned who work at each workplace in the list mentioned in subsection ( CARDINALA)(b ) .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The lists and figures supplied under this section , or the information mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) that is so supplied , must be as accurate as is reasonably practicable in the light of the information in the possession of the union at the time when it complies with subsection ( CARDINAL)(a ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relation to the ORG situation , the statutory protection against liability in tort regarding acts done \u201c in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute \u201d ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) is confined , by section CARDINAL of the same Act , to \u201c a dispute between workers and their employer \u201d . Secondary action is expressly excluded from statutory protection by section CARDINAL of the LAW , which defines it as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) There is secondary action in relation to a trade dispute when , and only when , a person\u2014", "( a ) induces another to break a contract of employment or interferes or induces another to interfere with its performance , or", "( b ) threatens that a contract of employment under which he or another is employed will be broken or its performance interfered with , or that he will induce another to break a contract of employment or to interfere with its performance ,", "and the employer under the contract of employment is not the employer party to the dispute . \u201d", "The provisions on peaceful picketing are contained in section QUANTITY of the LAW , which provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It is lawful for a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute to attend\u2014", "( a ) at or near his own place of work , or", "( b ) if he is an official of a trade union , at or near the place of work of a member of the union whom he is accompanying and whom he represents ,", "for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information , or peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working .", "( CARDINAL ) If a person works or normally works\u2014", "( a ) otherwise than at any CARDINAL place , or", "( b ) at a place the location of which is such that attendance there for a purpose mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) is impracticable ,", "his place of work for the purposes of that subsection shall be any premises of his employer from which he works or from which his work is administered . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both parties referred to the previous legislative regime , which included secondary action in the scope of the statutory protection . The ORG explained that secondary action was first outlawed by ORG DATE , adopted in the aftermath of the general strike of DATE . The situation changed with ORG , which lifted the ban .", "CARDINAL . NORP Further reforms occurred in DATE . ORG Labour Relations Act DATE afforded substantially broader protection to industrial action than is the case at present . It provided at section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( as amended in DATE ) :", "\u201c An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort on the ground only\u2014", "( a ) that it induces another person to break a contract or interferes or induces any other person to interfere with its performance ; or .", "( b ) that it consists in his threatening that a contract ( whether one to which he is a party or not ) will be broken or its performance interfered with , or that he will induce another person to break a contract or to interfere with its performance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision was considered by ORG in the case of ORG v. PERSON and another ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . The case involved secondary action in the newspaper industry , led by ORG . The majority of the ORG held that the test to be applied to determine whether an act enjoyed the protection of section MONEY ) was a subjective one , that is to say , it was sufficient that the person honestly believed that the act in question might further the cause of those taking part in the dispute . The genuineness of such belief could be tested by the courts , but the person calling the strike did not need to prove that it was reasonably capable of achieving the objective . Lord PERSON dissented on the nature of the test , but concurred with the finding that the injunction granted against the union should be discharged .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant union maintained that the PERSON judgment was not a significant development in the law , in that it merely confirmed the interpretation of clear statutory language , the case was referred to during the parliamentary debates leading to the passage of LAW as CARDINAL of the reasons for introducing restrictions on secondary action ( in section CARDINAL of that Act ) . LAW retained immunity for secondary action provided that CARDINAL conditions were satisfied : ( i ) that it was taken against first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute or against associated employers of the employer which were substituting for it during the dispute ; ( ii ) that its principal purpose was to directly prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services between the employer in dispute and his supplier or customer during the dispute ; and ( iii ) that it was likely to achieve that purpose .", "CARDINAL . NORP The current rule was originally introduced by LAW , and then re - enacted in LAW in the terms set out above .", "CARDINAL . The parties provided statistical information on DATE lost to industrial action in GPE , going back to DATE . The Government pointed out that in DATE , the average number of DATE lost DATE was CARDINAL . This decreased in DATE to an average of DATE . From DATE to DATE , the figure is much lower , standing at DATE lost per year on average . They attributed part of this decline at least to the ban on secondary action . The applicant union disputed that interpretation . It noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes . It was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before DATE and , consequently , impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in DATE and DATE . In the applicant union \u2019s view , secondary action had been relatively rare , the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes . It referred to official figures ( contained in a Government publication , the \u201c Employment Gazette \u201d ) indicating that , since DATE , GPE was consistently close to the NORP average for DATE lost to industrial action . According to this source , the country had been middle - ranking since DATE . The only exception was for DATE , on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year . The Government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution , given the profound transformation of LOC over DATE . The fact that GPE remained close to the NORP average in this regard indicated that , contrary to the applicant union \u2019s point of view , the rules on industrial action were not so restrictive as to make it excessively difficult to organise strikes .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of its application , the applicant union included references to other international legal instruments , and the interpretation given to them by the competent organs . The most relevant and detailed of these materials are referred to below .", "CARDINAL . While there is no provision in the ORG adopted by ORG ( ORG ) expressly conferring a right to strike , both ORG and ORG on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations ( \u201c ORG ) have progressively developed a number of principles on the right to strike , based on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG of the Right to Organise Convention , DATE ( No . DATE ) ( summarised in \u201c Giving globalization a human face \u201d , ORG , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This Convention was ratified by GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has commented several times upon the notice requirements for industrial action in GPE . The applicant union referred to the following statement , adopted in DATE :", "\u201c In its previous comments , ORG had taken note of comments made by the ORG to the effect that the notice requirements for an industrial action to be protected by immunity were unjustifiably burdensome . The ORG notes that according to the Government , a number of measures have already been taken to simplify sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG and CARDINAL of the DATE Order ; moreover , as part of a plan published in DATE to simplify aspects of employment law , the Government explicitly invited trade unions to come forward with their ideas to simplify trade union law further . Since then , the Government has held discussions with the ORG to examine their ideas to simplify aspects of the law on industrial action ballots and notices . These discussions are ongoing . The ORG notes that in its latest comments , the ORG notes that there has been no progress in this reform . The ORG requests the Government to indicate in its next report progress made in this regard . \u201d", "CARDINAL . More recently , in a direct request to the Government of GPE , ORG stated :", "\u201c In its previous comments , ORG had taken note of comments made by ORG ( ORG ) to the effect that the notice requirements for an industrial action to be protected by immunity were unjustifiably burdensome . ORG requested the Government to continue to provide information on any developments , as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements . The ORG notes the Government \u2019s indication that the ORG of Appeal decision in ORG v. Serco and in ORG v. GPE ( DATE ) EWCA CARDINAL , overturned injunctions which had been obtained by ORG and ORG against the CARDINAL main national transport unions , the ORG and ORG . In both cases , the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the ORG breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures . This case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of ORG technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place . In the ORG v. Serco decision , ORG issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements . A ORG decision is binding on all lower courts . Subsequent to this case , in ORG ( DATE ) EWHC CARDINAL ( QB ) , the ORG found against ORG , taking account of the Serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers . The ORG notes the ORG \u2019s observation that , while it greatly welcomes both decisions , it considers that they do not fully address the problems arising under the legislation that it has identified and that the legislation continues to impose intolerable demands on trade unions . The ORG notes these developments with interest and requests the Government to provide its comments on the concerns raised by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has taken the following view ( see \u201c Giving globalization a human face \u201d , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c With regard to so - called \u2018 ORG strikes , the ORG considers that a general prohibition of this form of strike action could lead to abuse , particularly in the context of globalization characterized by increasing interdependence and the internationalization of production , and that workers should be able to take such action , provided that the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considers this form of industrial action to be protected by international labour law ( see \u201c ORG \u201d , Digest of the decisions and principles of ORG of the ORG , Fifth ( revised ) edition , ORG , DATE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful .", "...", "CARDINAL . A ban on strike action not linked to a collective dispute to which the employee or union is a party is contrary to the principles of freedom of association . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its consideration of GPE observance of Convention No . DATE , ORG has repeatedly criticised the fact that secondary strikes are illegal . The initial criticism was included in its DATE observation concerning GPE :", "\u201c The ORG notes that the common law renders virtually all forms of strikes or other industrial action unlawful as a matter of civil law . This means that workers and unions who engage in such action are liable to be sued for damages by employers ( or other parties ) who suffer loss as a consequence , and ( more importantly in practical terms ) may be restrained from committing unlawful acts by means of injunctions ( issued on both an interlocutory and a permanent basis ) . It appears to the ORG that unrestricted access to such remedies would deny workers the right to take strikes or other industrial action in order to protect and to promote their economic and social interests .", "It is most important , therefore , that workers and unions should have some measure of protection against civil liability . There has been legislative recognition of this imperative since DATE in the form of a series of \u2018 immunities\u2019 ( or , more accurately , \u2018 ORG ) against tort action for trade unions and their members and officials . The current version of the \u2018 immunities\u2019 is to be found in ORG DATE .", "The scope of these protections has been narrowed in a number of respects since DATE . ORG notes , for example , that section CARDINAL of LAW has been amended so as to limit the right to picket to a worker \u2019s own place of work or , in the case of a trade union official , the place of work of the relevant membership , whilst section CARDINAL of the DATE Act removes protection from \u2018 secondary GPE in the sense of action directed against an employer who is not directly a party to a given trade dispute . In addition , the definition of \u2018 trade ORG in LAW of LAW has been narrowed so as to encompass only disputes between workers and their own employer , rather than disputes between \u2018 employers and workers\u2019 or \u2018 workers and workers\u2019 as was formerly the case .", "Taken together , these changes appear to make it virtually impossible for workers and unions lawfully to engage in any form of boycott activity , or \u2018 sympathetic\u2019 action against parties not directly involved in a given dispute . ORG has never expressed any decided view on the use of boycotts as an exercise of the right to strike . However , it appears to ORG that where a boycott relates directly to the social and economic interests of the workers involved in either or both of the original dispute and the secondary action , and where the original dispute and the secondary action are not unlawful in themselves , then that boycott should be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike . This is clearly consistent with the approach the ORG has adopted in relation to \u2018 sympathy strikes\u2019 :", "It would appear that more frequent recourse is being had to this form of action ( i.e. sympathy strikes ) because of the structure or the concentration of industries or the distribution of work centres in different regions of the world . The ORG considers that a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG did not take a definitive position on the ban until its DATE observation concerning GPE , when it observed as follows :", "\u201c The ORG draws the Government \u2019s attention to paragraph CARDINAL of its DATE General Survey on ORG where it indicates that a general prohibition on sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action , provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful . The lifting of immunity opens such industrial action to be actionable in tort and therefore would constitute a serious impediment to the workers\u2019 right to carry out sympathy strikes . \u201d", "It has maintained this view since , stating in its most recent review of the situation ( DATE observation , see Report of ORG to ORG , CARDINALnd Session , DATE , ILC.CARDINAL/III(CARDINALA ) , pp . CARDINAL ) . ) :", "\u201c Immunities in respect of civil liability for strikes and other industrial action ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the TULRA ) . In its previous comments , ORG had noted that according to the ORG , due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system , it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures , transferring work , or hiving off companies . ORG generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though , in certain cases , the direct employer may not be party to the dispute , and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful . ORG takes note of the Government indication that : ( CARDINAL ) its position remains as set out in its report for DATE , that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area ; and ( CARDINAL ) this issue forms part of a matter brought before the ORG by ORG ) and that the ORG has yet to consider the case . The ORG recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers\u2019 organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their ORG interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined . In these circumstances , the ORG once again requests the Government to review sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , in full consultation with the social partners , and to provide further information in its next report on the outcome of these consultations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the ORG \u2019s most recent pronouncement on the matter ( Conclusions PERSON , DATE ) it said :", "\u201c In its previous conclusions ... the ORG found that lawful collective action was limited to disputes between workers and their employer , thus preventing a union from taking action against the de facto employer if this was not the immediate employer . It furthermore noted that NORP courts excluded collective action concerning a future employer and future terms and conditions of employment in the context of a transfer of part of a business ( ORG v.

The parties provided some elements of comparative law in relation to secondary strikes . Both referred to a comparative study on the regulation of industrial action in LOC ( Strike rules in the ORG and beyond : A comparative overview , PERSON , ORG , ORG and ORG ( ETUI - REHS ) , DATE ) . According to this source , secondary action is protected or permitted , subject to varying restrictions and conditions , in the great majority of the member ORG . The GPE that , like GPE , do not permit secondary action were identified as GPE , GPE and the GPE .", "CARDINAL . In their initial submissions , the ORG sought to draw support for the situation in GPE by reference to the situation in the following GPE : GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . They contended that these illustrated a broad tendency in LOC to subject secondary action to much more restrictive conditions than primary industrial action . In reply to this the applicant union provided to the ORG statements from labour - law experts in a number of NORP countries contradicting the ORG \u2019s remarks . The applicant union concluded that GPE is the most restrictive among the Contracting Parties to the LAW in this respect . The Government concluded that the material demonstrated that , notwithstanding the great variety of industrial - relations systems and traditions in LOC , most GPE distinguished between primary and secondary action , with greater restriction on the latter . The broad right claimed by the applicant union was not supported by any real NORP consensus .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that comparative information is available from the monitoring mechanism of LAW . As indicated above , this body has repeatedly criticised the situation in GPE , which appears to be the only ORG subject to criticism on this specific ground . The ORG has also commented in DATE on the lawfulness of secondary action ( sometimes using the term \u201c sympathy \u201d or \u201c solidarity \u201d action ) in the following GPE : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .
