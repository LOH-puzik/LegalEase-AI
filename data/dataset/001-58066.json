As candidates on an independent list in the general election of CARDINAL DATE in PERSON , the accused wrote , CARDINAL DATE , a pamphlet printed in GPE which they distributed in the town of PERSON and other places in the department of GPE and in which the terms ' NORP ' , ' NORP ' , ' NORP minority of LOC and ' NORP community ' repeatedly appeared . In this manner the accused deliberately set out to describe as ' NORP \" the NORP citizens of NORP faith , although they knew that under LAW only a NORP minority , not a NORP minority , has been recognised in the region of LOC . Nevertheless , by the above - mentioned act , which was an appeal to the feelings , minds and will of the NORP citizens of the NORP minority , the accused deliberately sought to instil and implant in their hearts the seeds of discord , hatred and hostility towards NORP who lived in the same region . In this manner they succeeded in provoking and inciting the citizens to mutual discord , a further consequence of which was disturbance of the public peace . All the foregoing has been corroborated by the prosecution witnesses PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who , living in PERSON , had direct knowledge of these facts . They stated that , because of the distribution of the pamphlet in question , the public peace among the citizens of the town of PERSON was seriously disturbed , so that in a short space of time acts of violence were committed between NORP and NORP . The accused 's assertion that what they sought to achieve through the pamphlet in question was only to win the support of the electors of the NORP population is not convincing because , if that had been the case , they could have achieved their aim by any other suitable method without referring to NORP in the pamphlet in question as ' NORP ' , even though they knew that a NORP minority is not recognised in LOC and that if they attempted to raise such an issue in such a sensitive region , the peace between NORP and NORP would certainly be disturbed , which was indeed what actually happened . Consequently , the accused are declared guilty of the above - mentioned offence , as described analytically in the operative provisions of this judgment . Nevertheless , the ORG will take into consideration the extenuating circumstance that before committing the offence the accused had always led blameless private , family , professional and social lives . \"", "Lastly , ORG reduced Mr PERSON prison sentence to DATE and commuted it to a fine of MONEY ( GRD ) per day .", "CARDINAL .
