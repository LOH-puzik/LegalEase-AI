No legal procedure was available to review the legality , justification , adequacy and proportionality of the sanction imposed .

The Constitutional Court next referred to the essential features and activities of the communist ORG security service . This part of the reasoning reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ...

The main objective of this apparatus was to preserve and support the communist regime . To this end , functionaries of the ORG security service of ORG in the initial period used terror and , routinely , humiliation , surveillance of innocent people , and fabrication of evidence ; they violated fundamental human rights and freedoms . The methods they used and the scale and intensity [ of their activities ] changed over time , but their essence was DATE to support a political regime which was hostile to human rights . In reward , the ruling communist party gave those functionaries practical impunity for abuses of power , promotions that were faster than in other uniformed services , a high remuneration for service , other numerous additional economic and social privileges , and high retirement pension benefits .", "CARDINAL . This court does not judge the individual motivations of MONEY of people who chose voluntarily to serve in the State security authorities of NORP People \u2019s Republic , mostly young men . It is likely that purely professional motivation ( service in the secret police ) was similar to that which exists DATE . A considerable difference lies in the object of the choice . In no case does the choice of service in the secret political police of the communist ORG merit approval , notwithstanding the organisational unit and the grade of the functionary ...", "By DATE of the Polish People \u2019s Republic CARDINAL functionaries were employed by the ORG security authorities . DATE there are in total CARDINAL . This is not CARDINAL of the previous total . The security authorities of ORG , instead of serving to protect the political , social and economic aspirations of NORP , constituted a highly specialised net of institutions which worked against these aspirations .

It meant that former functionaries of ORG could be admitted to service in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The object of the vetting procedure was not to issue certificates of good moral standing to functionaries of particular departments of ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A considerable part of the reasoning was devoted to a comparison between pensions under the general social security scheme and the uniformed services system .", "In respect of the calculation of pensions under the general rules , it was noted that the system was organised in such a way that an ordinary employee on his retirement received PERCENT of his salary calculated for a period of DATE chosen by him from DATE preceding his retirement , including contributory and non - contributory periods . The longer the period of employment , the higher the pension . In practice , in order to receive a pension CARDINAL the average salary in DATE , a person had to be employed for DATE .", "In contrast , a functionary of the uniformed services acquired the right to a pension equal to PERCENT of his average salary after DATE of service . The average salary of persons insured under the general scheme was PERCENT that of the uniformed services personnel and this difference was even more marked in comparison to the special services . Accordingly , a pensioner insured in the general scheme received PERCENT of his average salary for DATE for a period of employment which was twice as long .", "CARDINAL . As regards the belated introduction of the new rules and nonconformity of the DATE Act with the DATE ORG , ORG observed , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ... The lapse of time since the NORP ORG gained sovereignty in DATE , although not without significance , can not be a decisive criterion for the evaluation of constitutionality of the regulations adopted by the legislature in order to settle accounts with the former functionaries of the communist regime . There is no provision in the LAW which would impose a prohibition on enacting such regulations . LAW does not set time - limits for the settling of accounts with the past communist regime . It is not within the competence of ORG to give an opinion on whether , and if so by when , the legislature of free GPE can introduce such laws ... How much time elapses between the collapse of the communist regime and the adoption of a given law depends on the existence of a configuration of power capable of enacting the law during its parliamentary term . As shown by the examples of GPE and other countries in our region of LOC , as well as certain countries in LOC , DATE may elapse after the establishment or reestablishment of democracy before laws are enacted regulating a certain aspect of responsibility for systemic abuses of power ...", "CARDINAL . Referring to the argument that LAW of DATE is in \u2018 flagrant contradiction\u2019 of the DATE ORG and of the guidelines to that document ...

The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle . On an institutional level this heritage includes ( FAC , the militarisation of civilian institutions , bureaucratisation , monopolisation , and overregulation ; on the level of society , it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns . To re - establish a civilised , liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome . ...", "CARDINAL . Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must , in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems , apply the procedural means of such a state . It can not apply any other means , since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled . A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it can not , and should not , however , cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice . It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , such as the right to due process and the right to be heard , and it must apply them even to those people who , when they were in power , did not apply them themselves . A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat , since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law , and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommends that member states dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian regimes by restructuring the old legal and institutional systems , a process which should be based on the principle(s ) of :", "i. demilitarisation , to ensure that the militarisation of essentially civilian institutions , such as the existence of military prison administration or troops of ORG , which is typical of NORP totalitarian systems , comes to an end ;", "ii . decentralisation , especially at local and regional levels and within state institutions ;", "iii . demonopolisation and privatisation , which are central to the construction of some kind of a market economy and of a pluralist society ;", "iv . debureaucratisation , which should reduce communist totalitarian over - regulation and transfer the power from the bureaucrats back to the citizens .", "CARDINAL . This process must include a transformation of mentalities ( a transformation of hearts and minds ) whose main goal should be to eliminate the fear of responsibility , and to eliminate as well the disrespect for diversity , extreme nationalism , intolerance , racism and xenophobia , which are part of the heritage of the old regimes . All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance , respect for diversity , subsidiarity and accountability for one \u2019s actions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the NORP totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code . If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes , this can be extended , since it is only a procedural , not a substantive matter . Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is , however , not permitted . On the other hand , the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law , but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations , is permitted . Moreover , where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights , the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt . ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former NORP totalitarian countries . It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine , upon their request , the files kept on them by the former secret services . ....", "CARDINAL . Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them , the ORG notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures , such as lustration or de - communisation laws . The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they can not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles , as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses that , in general , these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met . Firstly , guilt , being individual , rather than collective , must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual , and not collective , application of lustration laws . Secondly , the right of defence , the presumption of innocence until proven guilty , and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed . Revenge may never be a goal of such measures , nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed . The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law , and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG recommends that employees discharged from their position on the basis of lustration laws should not in principle lose their previously accrued financial rights . In exceptional cases , where the ruling elite of the former regime awarded itself pension rights higher than those of the ordinary population , these should be reduced to the ordinary level . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
