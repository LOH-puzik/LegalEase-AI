As the applicant had refused to confess , they had handcuffed his hands behind his back , pulled a black cap over his head , covering his eyes , and had taken him somewhere downstairs . The applicant had been made to sit on a chair and his feet had been tied to the chair legs . The applicant had felt something touching his head behind the ears and something being pressed against his temples , and as his body started to shake and jerk realised that electric shocks were being administered to him .

On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of the premeditated murder of PERSON . and sentenced him to thirteen years\u2019 imprisonment . It relied , in particular , on the applicant \u2019s \u201c surrender to the police \u201d and subsequent self - incriminating statements .

On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for additional investigation . It referred to the issues pointed out by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG pronounced a new verdict , the operative part of which was identical to that of DATE . As before , the court relied on the applicant \u2019s initial confessions , including that of CARDINAL DATE , which was documented as his \u201c voluntary surrender to the police \u201d . The court dismissed all the defence arguments , considering them to be nothing more than the applicant \u2019s attempts to avoid criminal liability . As to his motives for the murder , the court considered them to have been his jealousy and his wish to reunite with PERSON . Allegations of aggressive behaviour towards the victim in the past had been confirmed by several witnesses . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s allegation about having suffered electric shocks was rejected as unsubstantiated . The court noted in that regard that the applicant had made his confessions in the presence of his lawyer PERSON", "CARDINAL .
