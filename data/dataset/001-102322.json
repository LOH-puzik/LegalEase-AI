The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a journalist writing for the ORG newspaper .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a DATE boy attending the PERSON DATE camp complained to his parents that he had been beaten up and sexually abused by his DATE roommates . Further to a complaint by the boy 's parents , the police found evidence of criminal offences which , however , were not prosecutable because the offenders were minors .", "CARDINAL . One of the offenders was the son of CARDINAL federal judges , PERSON and PERSON Another culprit was the stepgrandson of the deputy head of ORG , PERSON", "CARDINAL . As the offenders ' parents held prominent positions in the region , the media took an intense interest in the story . The first article about the incident was published on DATE by ORG DATE newspaper . The publication listed the names and positions of the offenders ' relatives .", "CARDINAL . After the victim 's mother had brought the police reports and the relevant medical records to the applicant 's newspaper , the applicant undertook independent research into the events . In particular , he interviewed the principal of the PERSON DATE camp , several of its teachers , an official responsible for the supervision of DATE camps in the region , a spokesman for the police department charged with the investigation and the head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an article about the incident at the DATE camp in the ORG newspaper , under the headline \u201c Day of reckoning \u201d ( PERSON \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b ) . He wrote , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c Any story [ of battery and sexual abuse ] deserves the most rapt attention . This one is particularly shameful because of the fact that the parents of CARDINAL little bastard work as judges in a district court , and a close relative of another is one of the heads of the regional traffic police .", "It is hard to write about this matter . The case affects children , their lives , their tragedy and their future . It is hard because the guilt and its extent should be determined by a court , but the underage participants in this story are , alas , not liable to prosecution ... Their parents should be responsible for their deeds vis - \u00e0 - vis society and the ORG . This is why we have decided to take the matter up ...", "I believe readers will excuse me for not providing a detailed description of the abuse to which the kid was subjected ( in fact , our colleagues from the PERSON newspaper have already provided one ) . I will say CARDINAL thing : the circumstances of those unchildlish deeds were established by evidence . They amount to assault and battery , punishable by LAW , and sexual assault , punishable by LAW ] . Thus , if those moral freaks had been charged with criminal offences and committed for trial , they would have risked long terms of imprisonment .", "... [ After the parents of the victim had complained to the police , ] an investigation was conducted by officers from ORG of LOC , who established that the actions of the CARDINAL minor rapists indeed disclosed all the elements of criminal offences . However , no criminal proceedings were opened because the suspects were minors . Meanwhile , the press learned about the events and a scandal erupted .", "It is not the first time that the attention of law - enforcement bodies has been riveted to the children of high - ranking parents . However , as a rule , such cases are abandoned at an early stage of the inquiry . Even when they are referred for trial , the general public hardly ever knows about it . Without any doubt , had the administration of the PERSON DATE camp paid attention to the facts and warned the parents in time , the investigators from [ ORG of LOC ] would have hardly been allowed to go on with the investigation . The events were , however , left to take their course and were made public .", "We must do some serious thinking here . How can it be ? A kid whose parents work as JUDGES has committed a crime ! Is it a coincidence or a pattern ? What did his parents teach him ? Perhaps they thought that the judge and the PERSON were one and the same thing , that the judge was not servant but master of the law , a superhuman ? And that his children were superhumans , too ; they could do whatever they pleased , in the knowledge that their mothers and fathers would exempt them from liability ...", "Another [ offender ] has a relative in the police force . Not an ordinary one , but a bigwig sporting star - studded epaulettes . So , is anything permitted ? If something happened , would he ' cover up ' and ' fix ' it ?", "How will these people carry on working in the courts and the police force ? Delivering judgments , sentencing men to prison terms for crimes for which their progeny could have been convicted ? Or are they already used to doing this ? After all , all these conjectures are based on real grounds and it is very likely that the case will be hushed up thanks to ' string pulling ' by the rogues ' parents .", "We were told that pressure was being put on the victim 's parents , that their physical integrity had been threatened . What is more , while our editorial board was working on that publication , we received a number of bizarre telephone calls asking us to stop the journalistic investigation and stay out of the way of the judges and their children . It is strange that none of the ' well - wishers ' who called us considered the fate of the injured child , of how he will live after what happened . Nor did they consider the fate of the underage members of the ' criminal trio ' . What will become of them ? Could it be that , having gone unpunished once , they will resume their ' sexual experiments ' in DATE ? ...", "GPE Unfortunately , because of recent amendments to LAW , the newspaper may not name the young rascals or their parents and relatives ... We will carry on investigating the matter and in a future issue we will give concrete examples of how the children of judges and police officials have escaped punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , subsequent publications in the GPE and PERSON newspapers and on the Internet gave the names and official positions of the offenders ' parents and relative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published a follow - up article , under the headline \u201c Chocolate Kids . High - ranking parents of minor rapists seek to hush up the scandal \u201d ( \u201c FAC \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438.

He wrote as follows :", "\u201c The case developed into a scandal because the parents of CARDINAL suspect were the spouses [ Mr and PERSON ] , judges in a district court of GPE , and a close relative of another , [ Mr PERSON ] , was deputy head of the regional traffic police .", "Quite naturally , these high - ranking parents were not prepared to put up with the course of events . In addition to the ethical dimension , the scandal was a potential threat to their careers and financial well being . In the beginning they attempted to portray the events as an ordinary fist fight ! With that purpose , and with the complicity of the regional administration , the prosecutor 's office ordered an additional inquiry ...", "Judging from the diligence with which all that has been done , as well as from the fact that the official newspapers were suddenly full of lengthy articles DATE wonderfully organised DATE for children , attempts are being made to exert pressure on the course of the resumed investigation .", "Most likely , this inquiry will establish that all the suspects are ' warm and fuzzy ' . Yet , the fact that the abuse did indeed take place is confirmed by the fact that , precisely because of those scandalous events , one of the little scoundrels has been placed in a detention centre for juvenile offenders pursuant to an order of ORG . It follows that the son of simple factory workers is segregated from society , while his accomplices , the children of judges and bigwigs from the police , are at liberty ! ...", "Our journalistic inquiry uncovered sensational information about [ Mr V. ] It turns out that this criminal scandal is not the first one in his family . His eldest son , ORG , has been on the list of fugitives from justice since DATE : he was suspected of assault with intent to rob . His youngest son , also a traffic police officer , caused a road accident DATE , in which a young woman was seriously injured ... But he managed to escape responsibility . And now this gloomy story involving [ Mr PERSON 's ] stepgrandson . It begs a question for the management of the regional police , who are certainly aware of these facts : how can such a person still work in the field of law enforcement in a position of leadership in the traffic police ?", "DATE the [ judicial ] qualification board will decide on the destiny of the judges [ Mr and PERSON ] . If they carry on working as judges , this again begs a question : how will these people sentence others if they were unable to bring up their own child [ properly ] ? ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON brought a civil action for defamation and disclosure of private information on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor son . They named as defendants the founders of the ORG newspaper and its journalists , as well as the applicant and the company that owned his newspaper . They sought a retraction and compensation for non - pecuniary damage . They enclosed the text of the retraction , containing an apology that they wished the applicant 's newspaper to publish .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of PERSON gave judgment . It noted that the statements accusing PERSON and PERSON son of violent acts were true because the police had found evidence of a criminal offence . The allegedly insulting statements ( \u201c little bastards \u201d , \u201c young rascals \u201d and the like ) were not actionable because they constituted value judgments not amenable to verification . The alleged breach of the duties of a journalist arising out of LAW , namely , disclosure of confidential or private information , was not actionable in civil proceedings because LAW provided for criminal or disciplinary , rather than civil , sanctions for such breaches . On the other hand , relying on LAW , the court granted the claimants ' request for a retraction of the allegation that they \u201c had attempted to interfere with the investigation \u201d because the journalists had not produced any proof of such interference . It ordered that the newspaper and the applicant publish a retraction containing an apology to PERSON and PERSON It further ordered that the applicant pay PERSON and PERSON in respect of non - pecuniary damage in the amount of MONEY ( RUB , MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He submitted , in particular , that the articles authored by him did not contain any statements accusing PERSON and PERSON of interfering with the investigation . He further complained that the order to publish a retraction containing an apology had had no basis in domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified . As regards the order to publish an apology , ORG found that it was for ORG to determine the contents of the retraction .", "CARDINAL . Mr V. , on his own behalf , and his daughter - in - law , on behalf of her son , brought a civil claim against the same defendants for defamation and disclosure of information about their private life . They sought compensation for non - pecuniary damage under LAW . They also sought a retraction and submitted a draft retraction containing an apology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the claim in part . It found that the journalists had failed to prove the allegation that PERSON ORG \u201c had interfered with the investigation \u201d , as required by LAW . It rejected as unsubstantiated , without further reasoning , the applicant 's argument that his articles had not contained any such statements . It also held the journalists liable for a violation of the claimants ' constitutional right to the inviolability of their private lives , finding as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW , if a citizen has incurred non - pecuniary damage through actions impairing his personal non - pecuniary rights ... the court may order the person responsible to compensate for the damage .", "In accordance with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , everyone has the right to the inviolability of his private life , to personal and family secrets , [ and ] to the protection of his honour and goodwill ; it is an offence to collect , keep , use or disseminate information about a person 's private life without that person 's consent .", "The court has not seen any proof that the authors of the articles published in ORG and ORG newspapers obtained consent to the dissemination of information about the private lives of [ Mr PERSON and his minor stepgrandson ] . Accordingly , [ their ] constitutional right to the inviolability of their private lives has been breached . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court ordered that the newspaper and the applicant publish a retraction containing an apology to PERSON and his family . It further ordered that the applicant pay compensation to PERSON and his daughter - in - law in the amount of RUB CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his grounds of appeal the applicant complained about ORG inconsistent approach to the issue of whether disclosure of private information was actionable in the civil proceedings . In holding the applicant responsible for dissemination of personal information , ORG had disregarded the fact that the information had been first published by another newspaper , ORG , and that from that moment it had entered the public domain . Furthermore , ORG had not identified any statements which could be construed as implying that PERSON had interfered with the investigation .", "CARDINAL .
