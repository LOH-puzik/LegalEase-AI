NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE and GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by Mr PERSON , Representative of GPE at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant held judicial office at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , in series of media interviews , accused high - ranking judicial officials of putting pressure on her in connection with a high - profile criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Judicial Qualifications Board of GPE decided that the applicant \u2019s statements had been insulting to the judiciary and had been defamatory as regards the individuals mentioned therein . It found that the applicant had thus committed a disciplinary offence and terminated her office as a judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the Judicial Qualifications Board of Moscow . It found that the applicant \u2019s statements in the media had been false , unsubstantiated and damaging to the reputation of the judiciary and to the authority of all courts of law . It also established that the applicant had publicly expressed an opinion prejudicial to the outcome of a pending criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , ruling at final instance , upheld the judgment of DATE , having confirmed the earlier findings of the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG adopted a judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in which it found that the applicant \u2019s dismissal from the judiciary had violated her right to the freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , the ORG examined the proceedings before the Judicial Qualifications Board of GPE and the ensuing judicial review . It considered that nothing in the impugned interviews would have justified the authorities\u2019 claims of disclosure of confidential information about the pending criminal case . Having noted that the applicant had publicly criticised the conduct of various officials , and had alleged that pressure on judges was common , the ORG found that she had undoubtedly raised a very important matter of public interest which had to be open to free debate in a NORP society . It further found that her allegations had not been convincingly refuted in the domestic proceedings . Even if the applicant had allowed herself a certain degree of exaggeration and generalisation , the ORG found that her statements had to be regarded as fair comment on a matter of great public importance ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also found that the disciplinary procedure which imposed a sanction on the applicant had not complied with important procedural guarantees , in particular as regards the impartiality of ORG , which had considered her appeal despite the fact that that court \u2019s President was implicated in the statements ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . The ORG finally observed that the manner in which the penalty had been imposed was capable of having a \u201c chilling effect \u201d on judges wishing to participate in public debate concerning the effectiveness of judicial institutions and held that it had been disproportionately severe .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the domestic authorities had failed to strike a fair balance between the need to protect the authority of the judiciary and the protection of the reputation or rights of others , on the one hand , and the need to protect the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression on the other .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was awarded MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of nonpecuniary damage . No award was made in respect of pecuniary damage because no claims had been made under this head , nor was an award made in respect of costs and expenses because they had not been substantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG \u2019s request for the case to be referred to ORG having been rejected , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG , asking it to quash the decision of DATE . Relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , she sought to have the proceedings concerning her dismissal reopened on the grounds of new or newly discovered circumstances and to have the case transferred to ORG for fresh examination . She argued that LAW , read in the light of LAW , required a case to be reopened if ORG had found a violation of the LAW on account of domestic judicial decisions taken in a case . She claimed that the finding of a violation of LAW as a result of her dismissal from the judiciary constituted a newly discovered circumstance within the meaning of NORP procedural law and that it bound the authorities to reconsider the merits of her case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application . In so far as relevant , it found as follows :", "\u201c ... in accordance with [ NORP ] procedural law , not [ all ] judgments [ of the ORG ] finding a violation of the ORG provide grounds for the review of a judicial decision , but only a judgment finding a violation of the LAW in the course of the adjudication of a particular case .", "The Presidium of ORG ... has clarified that a judgment of the [ Court ] finding a violation of the [ Convention ] that affects the legal standing of a citizen is considered as an independent basis for the review of the national court \u2019s judgment on the matter in relation to which the violation of the Convention was found on the grounds of newly discovered circumstances .", "In Recommendation No . R ( DATE ) CARDINAL of ORG ... it is also pointed out that the Contracting Parties are encouraged to examine their national legal systems with a view to ensuring that there exist adequate possibilities of re - examination of the case , including reopening of proceedings , in instances where the ORG has found a violation of the LAW .", "It follows that ... the function of the court deciding on whether to reopen a case on the grounds of newly discovered circumstances is not limited to automatic quashing of the judgment with reference to the [ ORG \u2019s ] judgment , but involves the precise identification of the matter examined by the [ ORG ] and its relation to the circumstances taking place in the course of the [ domestic ] adjudication of the case .", "The reason for this is that , in accordance with the general principles set out in the LAW , the exercise of supranational control by the [ ORG ] over [ domestic ] courts is not absolute , but is limited by the internationally recognised principle of respect for the autonomy of the national NORP judicial decisions .", "Accordingly , the [ ORG \u2019s ] finding of a violation of the ORG in relation to a particular applicant does not by itself constitute a basis for the review of a judgment taken by the national courts ...", "If the [ Court ] finds a violation of [ those ] provisions of the LAW that guarantee the general principles of lawfulness in the course of adjudication by national courts , this may provide grounds for the review of domestic judicial decisions in accordance with the procedure provided by law , unless an obstacle of an objective nature prevents it .", "If , on the other hand , the [ Court ] finds a violation of the LAW unrelated to the fundamental guarantees of fair trial ... it may not give grounds for review ... under any rules of procedure because the [ ORG \u2019s finding of a violation ] has been [ sufficiently ] compensated by the mere fact of [ its ] acknowledgment or by the payment by ORG the just satisfaction award ...", "The right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by LAW .", "However , there is no ... indication that the [ Court ] declared the [ applicant \u2019s ] complaint admissible under LAW .", "It is clear from the [ ORG \u2019s ] judgment of CARDINAL DATE that the question of [ whether ] the judicial decisions taken in [ her ] civil case complied with LAW was not originally the subject of the ORG \u2019s examination .", "...

[ T]he conclusions made by the [ ORG ] in paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ... are general statements concerning [ the applicant \u2019s ] freedom of expression and not her right to a fair hearing .", "It follows that the [ ORG \u2019s decision ] in the above judgment can not constitute by itself a ground for the reopening of civil proceedings ...", "In [ her ] application , [ the applicant ] also claims that under LAW undertake to abide by final judgments of the ORG in any case to which they are parties .", "However , such reference to LAW is incorrect because the review of national NORP decisions on the grounds of newly discovered circumstances does not fall [ within the mandatory conditions of enforceability ] of the [ ORG \u2019s ] judgments .", "The operative part of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ... contains no express or implicit indication that the [ domestic decision ] is subject to review .", "However , it is the operative part [ of the ORG \u2019s judgments ] that binds the High Contracting Parties under LAW .", "Accordingly [ the applicant ] is not a priori entitled to seek the review of the above judicial decision on the grounds of newly discovered circumstances within the framework of the execution of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "...", "... [ The just satisfaction award of ] QUANTITY constitutes , under the [ ORG \u2019s ] case - law , exhaustive and sufficient just satisfaction ... for the violation found under LAW because the applicant is not currently suffering , and can not suffer , any negative effects resulting from the domestic judicial decision on her freedom of expression as defined in LAW , and her right of freedom of expression is ... not limited at the moment .", "...", "The judgment of CARDINAL DATE does not disclose the existence of any facts of legal significance which [ the applicant ] had not been aware of during the proceedings in this civil case .", "The [ ORG \u2019s ] statements in the judgment as to whether the disciplinary penalty imposed on [ the applicant ] was an appropriate measure are generalisations of a hypothetical and subjective , discretionary nature ; personal opinion ; and a debating point . They therefore can not , in view of the requirement of legal certainty , constitute by themselves grounds for the review of a judicial decision .", "...", "The [ applicant \u2019s ] motion to have the case transferred to ORG for examination ... must be refused because ... the first - instance court declining its jurisdiction in favour of another court is not permitted by civil procedural law in respect of a case where a [ final ] judgment remains in force .", "...", "The reopening of the proceedings [ in order ] to review the judgment of ORG of DATE on the grounds of newly discovered circumstances and the transfer of the civil case to ORG of GPE for examination must be refused .", "This decision is subject to appeal to ORG of GPE , to be filed within DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
