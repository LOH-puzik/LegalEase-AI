On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision . He strongly contested ORG finding that the assignment to work of the persons who had belonged to ORG had not been compulsory . He submitted that the farm of his parents had been sequestered by the NORP authorities without compensation . Subsequently , the applicant and his parents had been placed in the NORP germanization camp . On account of his internment in the camp as a child the applicant was granted a veteran status by the NORP authorities . The applicant further argued that the seizure of his parents ' prosperous farm without payment of compensation had been certainly effected against their will , as had been their transfer to work on a farm in GPE .

On DATE ORG held that the complaint was partly admissible , but unfounded . Referring to LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) the court held that international public law had not established individual claims for compensation for forced labour .

The court held further that the exclusion by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of former prisoners of war from the scope of those eligible for benefits under LAW had not been discriminatory , since under LAW prisoners of war could be compelled to perform labour . In this respect the court observed that the legislator was allowed to distinguish , when awarding compensation , between victims of general hardships caused by the war and victims of particular ideological persecution by the NORP regime , especially as the funds of the ORG were limited .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the exclusion of judicial review by LAW , ORG found that LAW of LAW required that a right did in fact exist , whose alleged violation could be examined by the courts .

The above agreement further stipulated that ORG , as a partner organisation , was entrusted with determining eligibility for compensation payments in respect of all claimants who resided on the territory of GPE on DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .

However , ORG refused to give a definite answer as to whether the ORG 's decisions could be subject to judicial review in civil proceedings . It nevertheless observed that entitlement to receive a benefit from the ORG did not fall within the scope of civil law , and thus could not be raised before a civil court . In exceptional cases , such as where the claimant 's eligibility had been established but the benefit was not paid , a claim could arise under civil law .", "CARDINAL . In Resolution no .

No administrative - law relation arises between a claimant and the ORG on the basis of the aforementioned acts , and consequently the ORG is not an organ of public administration established by law to determine cases in the sphere of public administration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted Resolution no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL in response to a question of law put forward by the ORG . It revisited its earlier case - law on the interpretation of the notion of a \u201c civil case \u201d laid out in LAW in relation to claims against the ORG . ORG held that :", "\u201c The [ civil ] courts have jurisdiction in the case where a claimant \u2013 due to an unfavourable decision by the \u201c NORP - German Reconciliation \u201d Foundation \u2013 is seeking a payment [ from the ORG ] in respect of NORP persecution . \u201d", "In the reasons for its ORG found , inter alia , that :", "\u201c The procedure concerning examination of claims under the first and the second NORP fund ... may not be currently instituted . The relevant funds were allocated and the disbursement of payments has been finally concluded . ( ... )", "There is no doubt that the current state of affairs resulting from the relevant case - law , under which those persons interested in challenging before a court the ORG 's refusal to grant them a suitable payment are deprived of such a possibility , can not be accepted in the light of the binding constitutional and LAW . LAW in conjunction with LAW establishes a presumption in favour of jurisdiction of the ordinary courts which indicates \u2013 at least indirectly \u2013 that a possible jurisdiction of the administrative courts should be based on a specific statutory rule . ( ... )", "The need for extensive interpretation of the individual 's access to a court , or in other words , the right to bring an action ( the right to a court ) follows also from LAW , which stipulate that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of his civil rights and obligations . It may be assumed from the established case - law of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention guarantees to everyone the inalienable right to submit for a judicial determination any claims concerning civil rights and obligations .... Obviously , the right to a court does not denote the right to \u201c win \u201d a case , but it signifies that the filed claim should be examined by a court and determined on the merits ( judgment of ORG of DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "The results of interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure thus require us to acknowledge that the [ civil ] court has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case in the substantive sense and where no particular provision delegates its examination and determination to a different organ than an ordinary court . The [ civil ] court also has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case only in the formal sense . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
