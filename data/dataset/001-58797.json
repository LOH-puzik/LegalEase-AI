Articles similar to the CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE quoted above , accompanied by large colour photographs , were published on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , describing in detail how women had experienced their situation after allegedly failed operations and a lack of care and follow - up by PERSON Some of the articles invited women to complain to the health authorities and to institute proceedings against the doctor . CARDINAL article stated that ORG ( PERSON ) would commence an investigation , that PERSON might lose his licence to practise and that the question of a police investigation had been raised . Brief summaries of the contents of the articles may be found in the judgment of DATE of ORG ( PERSON ) quoted in paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . In an editorial of CARDINAL DATE , entitled \u201c Medical power \u201d , PERSON stated :", "\u201c It is of course with satisfaction that we see health authorities now carry out a thorough investigation of the activities which the GPE breast doctor has been performing for DATE . This is the least that one could expect . It must be in the interest of DATE the patient 's , the authorities ' and also the doctor 's DATE to have clarified whether the methods of treatment applied meet professional standards . The fact that the case has serious implications also because it has aesthetic , moral , but also basically down - to - earth economic consequences , serves to underline the need for a thorough investigation .", "It is nevertheless a puzzle that it took a whole series of newspaper articles , powerful notices and assertive journalism to make the medical health bureaucracy react . Complaints to the doctors ' own professional association have not produced results and neither the regional nor the municipal health authorities have taken any initiative before the patients , in despair , came out with their stories of suffering to PERSON . Again one wonders what is required in order to break down the strong professional ties within the medical profession and to preserve the interests of patients . In any event , it justifies the reflection that patients , over DATE , feel threatened by fear of ' reprisals ' . Irrespective of whether this fear is imaginary or real , it is telling of the relationship of power which still exists between doctors and patients .", "Breaking down the myths and building confidence are crucial conditions for the process of healing . Therefore it is important to have a full clarification of the case in all its dimensions .", "Unfortunately the initiative for this investigation does not originate from the medical milieu , but from the weakest party : the patient . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

But I should like to emphasise that all patients are informed in advance of the possible dangers and of the fact that the result of the operation is not always as successful as one might expect ' , says PERSON , who moreover underlines that CARDINAL dissatisfied patients is a relatively small number when compared to the great size of his business which he has been running over DATE ... \u201d", "According to the third applicant 's statement to ORG in the proceedings mentioned below , when approaching PERSON in connection with the above interview , she had invited him to comment on the QUANTITY women 's allegations and had informed him that they had given their consent to release him from his duty of confidentiality . He had replied that he was bound by his general duty of medical confidentiality , which applied irrespective of whether the patient had given such consent . PERSON , in those proceedings , denied the third applicant 's version of the facts , stating that he was absolutely sure that she had not informed him that the patients had lifted his duty of secrecy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON published CARDINAL articles commenting on the critical articles published DATE .", "In the first article , entitled \u201c The press \u2013 the pillory of DATE \u201d , PERSON recalled the history of witch - hunts during DATE and described PERSON coverage of the accounts by PERSON dissatisfied patients as a modern form of witch - hunt conducted by the press .

Following the publication of the articles by PERSON , CARDINAL former patients submitted complaints against PERSON to the health authorities . On DATE Mr Eskeland , the medical expert appointed to evaluate the situation , concluded that there was no reason to criticise Dr NORP 's surgical treatment of the patients . Mr PERSON stated that the complications complained of were common in surgery and were bound to occur from time to time , but were not due to shortcomings in PERSON surgery . In CARDINAL case , he criticised PERSON for having travelled abroad without informing a relatively newly operated patient . Mr PERSON observed that , in the light of the large number of patients treated by PERSON CARDINAL DATE the number of complaints had been moderate . Bearing in mind that the articles published by PERSON had invited PERSON former patients to complain , it was surprising that not more patients had done so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to take any further action , finding that PERSON had not performed improper surgery .", "CARDINAL . After the publication of the newspaper articles , PERSON received fewer patients and experienced financial difficulties . He had to close down his business in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON instituted defamation proceedings against the applicants , claiming damages . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicants to pay PERSON a total of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages and costs . The court considered that PERSON economic loss would amount to MONEY and that an assessment had to be made on a discretionary basis . It observed that , while the criticism against PERSON had been made in an unjustified manner , destroying the public 's confidence in him as a surgeon , the criticism had been caused mainly by his own conduct . The court deemed it appropriate to make an award corresponding to PERCENT less than the amounts claimed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and PERSON appealed against the judgment to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , which found for the applicants , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c After hearing the evidence , the High Court finds that the articles give an essentially correct rendering of the women 's experiences as they themselves lived through them . As witnesses , they gave the impression to some extent that the newspapers had moderated their accounts . The High Court finds them credible and finds no reason to believe that their subjective experiences are not commensurate with what objectively took place \u2013 in other words they had reasonable grounds for feeling the way they did and as described by the newspaper . ORG does not exclusively base itself on these CARDINAL women 's statements . It finds it also proven that the newspaper was contacted by a number of other women giving similar stories . Subsequently , after the article of DATE ] had been published together with an appeal by GPE to women to join in filing an action , many more women got in touch . ORG finds it established that the number of women [ who did so ] was CARDINAL . This is based mainly on statements taken from [ the second and third applicants ] and GPE , and some of these women have also appeared as witnesses before ORG and have given statements . These constitute only a minor part of all the women who contacted PERSON and GPE A total of CARDINAL dissatisfied women have given statements , as has the husband of CARDINAL woman . However , it is largely the same story that is repeated again and again in the statements : complications did occur or the result was bad and the follow - up treatment provided by PERSON was felt to be unsatisfactory and seemed rushed with little interest , some irritation and unwillingness . Several women told how PERSON seemed insensitive to their mental as well as physical pain and discomfort . Some had the feeling that PERSON would rather be finished with them after he had operated and had not organised post - operative treatment properly . Some of the women were worried that PERSON might not have given them proper post - operative treatment . What is also being repeated by many of the women is that they were struck by the fact that PERSON was keen when it came to the financial side ; he wanted payment in advance , was unwilling to take cheques , and gave no receipt unless especially asked to do so ...", "On the basis of the above the High Court finds it proven that PERSON ran his practice in such a way that many of the women who suffered complications had experiences that gave them reasonable grounds to feel themselves exposed to poor care and to feel anxiety about the treatment they were given , and in several instances had reason to feel offended by PERSON behaviour . Moreover , the High Court finds that the experiences described in the article of DATE ] are representative of those made by many other women .", "Thus the High Court finds that the QUANTITY women referred to in the article of QUANTITY May [ DATE ] had not been especially sensitive and had not had exaggerated expectations , but that their stories were sober and reasonably subjective accounts of what had happened . Having regard to the information at hand about complaints made by other women , ORG also finds that this is not simply a case of CARDINAL or CARDINAL odd exceptions . As far as PERSON is concerned , it can reasonably be established that it is a question of unsatisfactory behaviour , which occurred quite often in the cases where something happened to necessitate an extra effort after the operations . That is not to say that he behaved in an unsatisfactory way in most cases or in a particularly large number of them . It is hardly a question of more than a minority of the cases . And it must be stressed that nothing has been said to prove that there really was a failure as regards NORP 's surgical competence .", "But the fact that the unsatisfactory behaviour occurred in a number of cases must provide a basis for allowing criticism of PERSON to come to light in the newspaper . Reference is made to what has been said above about the right of the general public and the consumer to be kept informed and their right to react by staying away to be on the safe side . It should be pointed out that the people who contacted the newspaper at the outset did so as a reaction to PERSON article on DATE ] , an article which presented a picture of NORP 's business without mentioning the drawbacks . PERSON claims that , in view of the article of CARDINAL DATE , it felt obliged to let their criticism be heard , which ORG finds very understandable .", "On DATE ] , PERSON ran an article in which GPE described her own experience of treatment at PERSON clinic and urged women in a similar situation to join forces in suing the doctor . The High Court finds it proven , in the same way as for the QUANTITY women who were described on DATE , that GPE 's experiences were recounted correctly and that her subjective feelings were reasonably grounded on what had occurred . The same applies to what was stated on DATE about the experience of a ' DATE GPE lady ' . ORG is also satisfied that what was stated on DATE about telephone calls to GPE ( ' Storm of telephone calls ' ) is correct ...", "As far as the rendering of the women 's experiences is concerned , what was stated in PERSON is thus in all essentials correct . And their subjective experiences were liable to give a picture of how treatment by PERSON could turn out , not only in rare exceptional cases ...", "The striking part about the statements that PERSON has challenged is that they report in strong language on the results of treatment provided by PERSON : ' disfigurement ' , ' ruined for life ' , ' mutilated ' and the like . It is sufficiently clear that the statements are here describing the result of PERSON treatment . But there is nothing in the statements suggesting a lack of surgical ability on PERSON part . And one must assume that newspaper readers were aware that a poor result of an operation need not be due to a lack of surgical skill . It has been submitted that the use of expressions like ' ruined ' , ' was disfigured ' , etc . , brings to mind actions that are aimed at ruining and disfiguring and that the reader is therefore immediately made to believe that some person PERSON R. \u2013 is guilty of such conduct . ORG does not find that , from a linguistic point of view , the statements apply to anything other than the purely objective result .", "Another question is whether the statements are misleading , because they give the impression that the consequences were more serious than they actually were . ORG can not see that this is the case DATE especially when bearing in mind that it is the manner of reporting of the women 's subjective opinions which is at stake . ' Disfigured ' means having an ugly mark of some significance on one 's body , and in the opinion of ORG the women who use this expression according to PERSON had good reason for doing so . Much the same can be said about ' mutilated ' . Presumably , ' ruined ' must be understood as bearing a somewhat stronger expression , but must be justified in the case of women whose breasts have large scars or have become lopsided , hard , different , or tender to touch , in view of the effect this must have had , not only on the woman 's relationship with her husband but also in many other respects \u2013 one can imagine what it must mean not to be able to give one 's child or grandchild a hug because of tender or hard breasts . According to what the ORG finds established on the witness evidence , it was , amongst other elements , against the background of such results that the newspaper had used the expressions .", "While the statements thus could not be said to amount to a direct allegation that Dr NORP lacked surgical abilities , PERSON did not make it clear either that there was no lack of ability . And both the individual statements and the articles in their entirety give the impression that it is being questioned whether PERSON always provided treatment which was medically up to standard . In the light of the women 's information , however , this was a natural question to ask ; several of the women mentioned it , and anyone who reads the accounts alone would be inclined to ask that question . It can therefore not be unlawful for PERSON to air this question .", "PERSON also complains that PERSON conducted a veritable campaign and persecution against him . ORG does not consider this to be the case . In particular , the newspaper should have the right to believe that women should think twice about consulting PERSON and to write articles with this in mind ...", "In brief , the opinion of ORG can be summarised as follows :", "In PERSON practice there were a not inconsiderable number of cases of poor followup and behaviour and the like , which gave many women reasonable grounds for feeling disappointed and badly treated . The High Court bases this assessment of evidence essentially on the women 's statements and comportment in court . PERSON was entitled to write about this and to repeat the women 's subjective experiences of the treatment . The newspaper did this in a manner which in all essentials was correct . In so far as the newspaper articles might have given the impression that there could be reason to question PERSON professional ability , this was no more than a suspicion for which his behaviour gave reasonable grounds , and which it must therefore have been right to report on . If this led to financial losses for PERSON , it was because of the extremely sensitive nature of the activities he was engaged in .", "[ The applicants ] are therefore discharged from liability to pay damages , and ORG will not go into the question of the extent of PERSON financial losses .", "Moreover , ORG does not find it possible to allow the claim for non - pecuniary damage and , referring to what has been stated above , does not find that any of the coverage of PERSON by PERSON was unlawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr NORP appealed against the above judgment to ORG . In his submission , ORG judgment was in principle correct , except that no reduction should have been made of the award on grounds of shortcomings on his part . In his opinion , even if ORG assessment of the evidence concerning lack of care and follow - up were to be accepted , this could only have a marginal effect on the amount of compensation . He maintained , inter alia , that the newspaper articles had amounted to a public execution of him as a plastic surgeon , by their strong emphasis on unsuccessful operations and by giving the readers the impression that he was incompetent . Furthermore , he had not been given a proper opportunity to reply to the criticism before the publications were printed . In his view , the defendants ' conduct had been grossly negligent .", "The applicants emphasised that the impugned news coverage concerned above all the situation of quite a large number of women with whom the newspaper had been in contact , directly or indirectly , and who had complained about lack of care and follow - up after unsuccessful operations . They had also complained about a lack of information before the operations . The articles conveyed the women 's feelings and frustrations as expressed in their own words . Whether PERSON was a good or a bad surgeon had not been decisive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalget ) of ORG dismissed the appeal in so far as it concerned ORG assessment of the evidence relating to the issue of PERSON lack of care and follow - up of his patients , and allowed the appeal for the remainder to proceed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG found in favour of PERSON and awarded him amounts totalling ORG in respect of damages and costs . Mr Justice PERSON stated , inter alia , on behalf of a unanimous court :", "\u201c By way of introduction I note that newspapers , of course , have a right to emphasise questionable aspects of cosmetic surgery and to illustrate their presentation with information about unfortunate incidents . They should also be able to pinpoint critical aspects of an individual surgeon 's business and here the journalist in question must be granted a wide leeway for subjective considerations . But outright incorrect factual information of a negative character must be considered defamatory . The fact that the newspaper just repeats the accusations made by others will , according to established case - law , not in principle constitute a defence .", "Accordingly , it will be necessary to consider the individual articles in order to establish their contents in relation to the rules on defamation . In interpreting the articles one should take as a starting - point the impression which they , as a whole , will make on the ordinary reader , while attaching greater weight to the headlines and the introductions than to the text presented in normal characters . ORG considered that the particularly interested reader would read the entire news report meticulously and thereby obtain a more balanced view than the reader who only takes a cursory look at the news report . I find it difficult to attach particular importance to this consideration . Even those who read the news report as a whole would easily be influenced by value judgments in headlines etc . Furthermore , the news report addresses the general public and will thus affect the doctor 's reputation as such . Unlike ORG , I can not see that one can generally assume that readers would be aware that a bad result of an operation is not necessarily due to a lack of surgical skills ...", "The news report of CARDINAL DATE was based on the positive articles of DATE and the comments [ the newspaper ] had received from dissatisfied patients .

Further , there is a threecolumn picture of PERSON 's breasts . Connected thereto is a CARDINAL - column headline ' PERSON ( DATE ) was operated on in DATE . The stitches are still there ' . The article explains that she contacted PERSON office after the operation in order to have the stitches removed but was told to do this herself , as a pair of appropriate pincers was not available . Further , there is an article with the headline covering CARDINAL columns ' Probably no investigation ' , in which ORG is interviewed .", "In the last articles of CARDINAL May the front page contains a headline covering CARDINAL columns ' Breast doctor is being investigated ' . It is stated that , according to the acting health director , ORG would immediately contact the Chief County Physician in order to carry out a thorough investigation of PERSON and his practice , and the newspaper draws attention to the question whether the doctor may lose his licence . Inside the newspaper there is a CARDINAL - column headline related to the same operation . Furthermore , there is a similar headline ' Can not do anything ' : PERSON of ORG tells the newspaper that the association can not examine complaints about the doctor 's medical practice but only complaints which relate to the doctor 's behavioural and humane treatment of patients .", "The first question , which arises when evaluating the series of articles , is whether the criticism of PERSON may be characterised as an accusation and what its contents may be . On the one hand , PERSON maintains that he is accused of malpractice and that insufficiencies in respect of his work as a surgeon will be of central importance . The defendants maintain on the other hand that the criticism does not concern this but relates to a lack of information , care and follow - up treatment which is a part of the medical treatment . ORG found that evidence had been submitted proving that deficiencies in care and follow - up treatment had occurred . Since the appeal concerning the evaluation of evidence on this point has been refused , ORG is bound by the evaluation made by ORG .", "The articles concern the situation of women who have experienced complications after an operation or when the original operation failed . They are in despair due to the result of the treatment and complain about the reluctance and carelessness on the part of PERSON as regards rectifying what went wrong . In my opinion the articles in [ the newspaper ] appear at the same time to be a strong attack on PERSON qualifications as a cosmetic surgeon without taking sufficiently into account the usual risk of unsuccessful operations . The statements that the women were disfigured and ruined for life and the many other strong statements , in particular in the articles of DATE , which set the tone for the other articles , can hardly be understood otherwise than as referring to a great extent to the result of the treatment where the surgical element is essential . This is also how ORG , ORG and Professor PERSON understood the articles . Initially it appears that [ the newspaper ] was of the same opinion . In an editorial of CARDINAL DATE satisfaction is accordingly expressed with the fact that the health authorities would now make a thorough examination of a ' breast doctor from GPE ' in order to ' clarify whether the methods of treatment which are used comply with professional standards ' . Since it must have been apparent that the articles would completely destroy his business , it may also be questioned whether [ the newspaper 's ] series of articles concerning PERSON could be explained in any other way than that they reflected [ the newspaper 's ] opinion that the circumstances involved reckless surgical activity which ought to be brought to the attention of the public .", "In these circumstances DATE contrary to the findings of ORG \u2013 I have reached the conclusion that the articles contain an accusation against PERSON that he performed his surgical activities in a reckless way DATE an accusation which I must hold to be incorrect .", "The next question is whether the resulting defamation should , for special reasons , not be considered to be unlawful . Among other things the newspaper has referred to its particular duty to attend to the interests of consumers and to the fact that the accusation against PERSON as a whole concerning improper treatment was nevertheless to a great extent correct . However , PERSON has criticised the newspaper 's handling of the case and has furthermore referred to LAW .", "When a newspaper makes such strong criticism as in this case I consider that PERSON ought to have had the possibilities of a proper defence . No time element prevented this . When approached on DATE , PERSON could not make any statements about the concrete cases without being released by the patients themselves from his duty to maintain professional secrecy , and he did not have a duty to contact the patients himself for that purpose . I also find that [ the third applicant ] \u2013 and the newspaper DATE must be criticised for a lack of balance in the articles and for using unnecessarily strong and , to some extent , misleading expressions . That [ the third applicant ] was quoting the interviewees is no excuse for completely disregarding PERSON right to the protection of privacy . That the women had a subjective and strong emotional point of view to what they had experienced is understandable . But it is another matter to publish their statements to a large group of readers who would expect that these , at least in their essentials , covered the objective truth . Even though there is reason to give a wide scope to freedom of expression in order to enable newspapers to fulfil their function in society , I can not but reach the conclusion that the line has been overstepped . ... I see no reason to go into the issue of LAW .", "The submission that the main content of the accusation has been proven is based on ORG assessment of the evidence as far as lack of care and follow - up are concerned .", "ORG assessment of the evidence on this point can be seen from remarks spread over several pages of its judgment , especially at pp . CARDINAL to CARDINAL . On p. CARDINAL it stated :", "' On the basis of the above the High Court finds it proven that PERSON ran his practice in such a way that many of the women who suffered complications had experiences that gave them reasonable grounds to feel themselves exposed to poor care and to feel anxiety about the treatment they were given , and in several instances had reason to feel offended by PERSON behaviour . '", "Furthermore , at p. CARDINAL it held :", "' As far as PERSON is concerned , it can reasonably be established that it is a question of unsatisfactory behaviour , which occurred quite often in the cases where something happened to necessitate an extra effort after the operations . That is not to say that he behaved in an unsatisfactory way in most cases or in a particularly large number of them . It is hardly a question of more than a minority of the cases . And it must be stressed that nothing has been said to prove that there really was a failure as regards NORP 's surgical competence . '", "In these circumstances I must conclude that the essential elements of the accusations to be found in the articles concerning PERSON have not been proven , since the alleged deficiencies as regards the surgical activities , as set out in the articles , clearly overshadow the deficiencies concerning care and follow - up treatment . Furthermore , the accusations are unlawful .", "In my opinion there can be no doubt that the articles have caused considerable financial losses , in addition to non - pecuniary damage , for PERSON It would have been strange if [ his clinic ] had survived the very negative comments in the articles of [ the newspaper ] . From a commercial point of view cosmetic surgery is very sensitive to anything which might shatter the potential patients ' faith in the operating doctor . The defendants must have been aware of this .", "The calculation of PERSON loss involves many elements of uncertainty . In no circumstances could he automatically rely on continuing a thriving and profitable business as a private cosmetic surgeon for the rest of his life until reaching the age of retirement . Even a neutral , objective and , from any point of view , appropriate criticism would have been very damaging to him ...", "Dr NORP shall be granted compensation under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE [ Skadeserstatningsloven \u2013 Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ] from [ the first applicant ] in respect of damage , loss of future income and suffering . As regards the CARDINAL last points , the ORG has a wide discretion according to [ the applicable legislation ] . But also as regards the first point , PERSON own conduct may be taken into consideration ...", "... I have reached the conclusion that the compensation for the damage done , i.e. loss of income plus interest from DATE until this judgment , ought to be fixed at ORG CARDINAL . As regards the other requests for damages submitted by PERSON ... I consider that this should be fixed on an equitable basis at ORG CARDINAL .", "Compensation in respect of loss of future income is fixed at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Further , the non - pecuniary damage to be paid by [ the first applicant ] is fixed at ORG CARDINAL . When fixing reparation , regard has been had to the exceptional pressure which PERSON has endured over a long period of time due to the series of articles .", "The non - pecuniary damage to be paid by [ the second and third applicants ] is fixed at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL each . \u201d", "Finally , ORG ordered that the first applicant pay PERSON MONEY and that the second and third applicants each pay him ORG CARDINAL for his costs in the domestic proceedings , plus certain interest with respect to PERSON costs in ORG . In accordance with the latter , the first applicant paid an additional ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , and the second and third applicants each paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in interest .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP defamation law , there are CARDINAL kinds of responses to unlawful defamation , namely the imposition of a penalty under the provisions of LAW , an order under LAW declaring the defamatory allegation null and void ( mortifikasjon ) and an order under LAW DATE ( Skadeserstatningsloven \u2013 Law no .
