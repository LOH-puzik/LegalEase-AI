He is represented before the ORG by Mr R.A.U. Baron PERSON a lawyer practising in GPE .", "a. Particular circumstances of the present case", "The family of the applicant \u2019s mother belongs to the NORP nobility . Her family is entitled to carry the NORP noble title of Count ( PERSON ) . The family of the applicant \u2019s father does not belong to the NORP nobility . Following his GPE divorce , the applicant officially changed his family name to his mother \u2019s maiden name . It appears that the applicant has added \u201c PERSON as the last of his first names .", "On DATE , he requested the Minister for the ORG ( Minister PERSON ) to include him in the GPE ancestry register ( filiatieregister ) , which would entitle him to carry a noble title . However , as in the GPE nobility is only transferred through the paternal line , the Minister rejected his request on DATE . The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision was rejected by the Minister on DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( ORG ) of GPE on DATE . The applicant filed a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG .", "In an article published on DATE in the DATE \u201c ORG \u201d , it was reported that FAC , who is the formal President of ORG , and the Minister for the ORG pursue a policy of not intervening in the natural decrease of the number of persons belonging to the NORP nobility .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s case was heard before ORG . CARDINAL of its members , PERSON , repeatedly interrupted the applicant \u2019s lawyer and only displayed a negative interest in the applicant \u2019s submissions .", "On DATE , the applicant challenged ( wraking ) PERSON on grounds of bias .

ORG further noted that this difference in treatment applies equally to both men and women .", "b. Relevant domestic law", "Pursuant to the LAW on Nobility ( Wet op de Adeldom ) , and apart from the situation in which a NORP noble title is transmitted via the paternal line at birth , ennoblement can only take place by elevation ( verheffing ) or incorporation ( inlijving ) . Elevation is only possible for members of the GPE royal family . Incorporation is only possible for persons belonging to a foreign family with a recognised noble status in their country of origin and only where a request for incorporation has been made on the moment the person concerned obtains NORP nationality .", "Ennoblement takes place by LAW ) . Under the relevant provisions of NORP law governing names , noble titles and predicates form a part of a noble person \u2019s family name . The unlawful carrying of a noble title may attract consequences under NORP criminal law .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( Case no . RCARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , ORG held that noble status is to be regarded as a historically grown institute to which , since DATE , no longer any rights and freedoms pertain ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
