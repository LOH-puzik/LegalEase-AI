The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She acts on behalf of her deceased husband , Mr PERSON ( \u201c G. \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was in conflict with a number of officers of the NORP police and was allegedly persecuted by those officers for criticising them and helping alleged victims of police abuse . In DATE PERSON was allegedly abducted by the local police and a ransom was requested . Having been kept for DATE in the woods , he was released and on DATE lodged a complaint against several officers of the local police , including NORP , the Deputy Chief of the NORP police . A criminal investigation was opened but was discontinued for lack of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a subordinate of NORP , made a complaint against PERSON for resisting the legitimate orders of the police . On DATE PERSON made a complaint against NORP , PERSON and another officer for abusing their power by beating him up at his home and requested the opening of a criminal investigation . The judge examining the CARDINAL cases closed the first one for lack of evidence . The criminal investigation into PERSON \u2019s complaint was discontinued some time later .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the personnel of the local police station wrote a letter to various authorities in support of the CARDINAL officers and against GPE ( CARDINAL of the CARDINAL accused in the present case ) . The Prosecutor General found that many of the statements by the police officers in that letter were unfounded and tendentious and contained gratuitous accusations against GPE and the prosecutor who had opened the criminal investigation . There was mention of talk among the officers about possibly resorting to \u201c illegal methods of fighting \u201d the suspects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a burnt - out car was found in a forest near GPE . The police found the remains of a person in the boot of the car . A criminal investigation was opened and led to the conclusion that the victim was NORP Three persons became the prime suspects : the PERSON brothers ( GPE and PERSON ) and PERSON", "CARDINAL . According to the prosecution , the following events led to the murder of NORP on TIME to CARDINAL DATE . In DATE NORP had opened a criminal investigation against PERSON for \u201c aggravated hooliganism \u201d . The PERSON brothers and PERSON were in serious conflict with NORP On DATE NORP visited a bar in PERSON , where he met with the PERSON brothers and PERSON , was insulted by them and was hit outside the bar . They agreed to meet at TIME at a roundabout to finish the dispute .", "CARDINAL . When they met at TIME , the PERSON brothers and PERSON beat NORP and then forced him into the back of his police car and drove to a forest , followed by PERSON in his own car . In the forest , they continued beating NORP and then loaded him into the boot of his car , sprayed petrol all over it and set the car on fire .", "The applicant disputed this version of events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG acquitted all CARDINAL suspects . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bomb exploded near PERSON \u2019s house but nobody was hurt . PERSON lodged a complaint and requested measures of protection . The criminal investigation initiated at his request could not identify the bombers and was closed in DATE . ORG refused to apply measures of protection to him because he had not received any threats and there was no reason to expect a repeat of the bombing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments of DATE and DATE and ordered a full rehearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and his son were killed in their car by gunmen . The criminal investigation subsequently launched did not reveal the identities of the killers . On DATE the applicant insisted on the continuation of her late husband \u2019s retrial in order to prove his innocence . She was recognised as his legal representative and was allowed to make submissions to the courts in addition to those made by the lawyer whom she had appointed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) , the CARDINAL which examined the witnesses in the case directly ( except for ORG , the prison hospital doctor ) , found the following facts :", "CARDINAL . On DATE D.C. was taken to the local police station and questioned as a witness about the events of the night of CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE PERSON was taken to the same police station and also questioned as a witness about the same events .", "CARDINAL . They were not informed of their rights and were not assisted by lawyers . They were handcuffed while questioned . After the questioning , administrative files were opened on the basis of their alleged insults to NORP at the bar and a judge ordered their arrest for DATE as an administrative sanction . During the administrative arrest further questioning took place and other procedural steps were taken , resulting in evidence later used in the criminal case against them . In particular , during this period ( DATE ) , PERSON and GPE confessed to having murdered NORP", "CARDINAL . The court found that the initial reports which had served as a basis for the administrative arrest had been filed in breach of the proper procedures . There had been no grounds for the administrative arrest because the CARDINAL men were suspects in a criminal case and any detention should have been ordered on that basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE G. and GPE were taken to a remand centre in PERSON , where they were questioned again until DATE as witnesses and without legal assistance . They made statements accepting their guilt during the questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they were , for the first time , interviewed as suspects ( as opposed to witnesses ) , still without having their rights explained and without access to a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both GPE and PERSON were questioned for the first time in the presence of their lawyers and each confessed to having committed the crime . However , when signing the record of the questioning , each wrote that he did not accept any guilt . The same happened on DATE in respect of PERSON , who had been arrested in GPE and extradited to GPE . In his statement PERSON mentioned that PERSON and NORP had fought in the woods and had both fallen to the ground before NORP was immobilised and burned in his car . GPE noted that after taking PERSON to the hospital where she worked after TIME , they had driven back by the police station building and towards the roundabout . However , the court found that this was contradicted by the officer PERSON , who had been in a police car parked next to the police station and who had not seen any car drive past the station at that time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON lodged CARDINAL complaints about ill - treatment by the police . On DATE the investigating judge requested the prosecutor to investigate the allegations . On DATE the prosecutor answered in respect of CARDINAL complaint that the facts had not been confirmed but did not attach any documents from the investigation as required by law . There was no evidence of any investigation of the second complaint .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON was admitted to a hospital for detainees , where he was examined by PERSON on DATE . PERSON testified in court that PERSON had complained to him of ill - treatment by the police , but because there were no visible signs , this had not been recorded in the medical report . The court noted that the medical report had been drawn up DATE after the alleged ill - treatment , which prevented the verification of the allegations . However , PERSON \u2019s medical file showed that he had complained of pain in the kidneys and broken chest bones and that he had been treated for injuries to his head and leg ( \u201c post - traumatic neuritis of the right leg \u201d ) . Dr ORG testified that such damage to the leg normally appeared as a result of blows or contusions to that area . The doctor \u2019s conclusion that no chest - bone fractures had been found was not backed up by X - ray evidence as required by law . Subsequent X - ray pictures were of too poor a quality to establish whether the bones were intact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another medical examination of PERSON was carried out at the request of the investigator . While no signs of ill - treatment were found , the diagnosis was \u201c mild consequences of craniocerebral trauma with hypertonic syndrome \u201d and PERSON was advised to undergo in - patient treatment . He refused , but in DATE he had to be admitted to the hospital as a result of the head injuries and neuritis in the leg . He stayed at the hospital until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that , owing to various violations of the rules on criminal procedure , including the use of ill - treatment for the purpose of obtaining a confession , the self - incriminatory declarations made by the third suspect , PERSON , who had been arrested in GPE , could not be accepted as evidence . No proper request had been made by the GPE authorities to their NORP counterparts to question PERSON and he could not properly be questioned by the NORP authorities because he was not a NORP citizen .", "CARDINAL . The court found that in all the statements made by the suspects there was no fact of which the prosecution had not already been aware before the questioning . Furthermore , PERSON \u2019s complaint that he had been shown a video of GPE \u2019s statements , including those made during the crime scene investigation , had been made at a time when he was still a witness and had no right of access to the case file ; he was not even supposed to have known of the existence of that video recording . The court concluded that the only way for PERSON to have known about the recording was by having seen it , which confirmed his claim that he had been shown it in order to ensure that his confession concurred with those of GPE", "CARDINAL . On the basis of all the evidence , the court found that the statements made by the suspects during questioning had not been given voluntarily but had been taken from them illegally under duress and could not constitute valid evidence .", "CARDINAL . The court then turned to the witness statements . The witnesses had given evidence on CARDINAL matters : ( i ) the quarrel at the bar ; ( ii ) the existence of unfriendly relations between the accused and NORP ( motive for the crime ) ; and ( iii ) the events at TIME at the C. brothers\u2019 GPE house ( alibi for PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The court examined a number of witnesses whose written statements made at the police station about the events at the bar apparently confirmed that the accused had initiated the fight and been aggressive towards NORP A number of those witnesses declared in court that they had been threatened or otherwise forced by the police to sign witness statements , whereas they had not witnessed the events described in the statements . CARDINAL of these witnesses was DATE , who stated that under pressure from the police he had signed a false witness statement about having seen the accused \u2019s car being driven in the direction of the roundabout at TIME on the date of the crime .", "CARDINAL . The statements taken from CARDINAL other witnesses by the police in DATE were read out in court , including that of ORG who had been with C.E. and had confirmed his statement ( see the preceding paragraph ) . They referred mostly to the events at the bar . Since these witnesses were uncontactable abroad and the accused could not confront and properly challenge them , and in virtue of guarantees provided for in LAW , the court rejected their statements as evidence .", "CARDINAL . Another witness , a former colleague of NORP who had been accused by PERSON of beating him up in DATE , confirmed his earlier statements attributing the initiation of the fight to the accused . He had gone with NORP to the police station and , rather than talking about subsequently returning for any further meeting , they had agreed to go home after visiting the police station . The witness PERSON declared in court that she had seen part of a quarrel at the bar between the accused and NORP but that later ( at TIME ) , when she had been taken to work by the accused in their car , they had been calm and had not spoken about the policemen .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that not a single witness , including NORP \u2019s colleagues , had confirmed the prosecution \u2019s version that NORP and the suspects had agreed after the incident at the bar to meet at a later time near the roundabout to continue the dispute .", "CARDINAL . Some of the police officers declared that PERSON had threatened NORP with violence because of the administrative file opened against him . The court failed to see why in such circumstances and after allegedly being threatened that same night by the suspects , NORP would have agreed to return for a fight , alone and without warning anyone , including the officer on duty at the police station , and without taking his weapon from the safe .", "CARDINAL . D. \u2019s colleague , a police officer who was present during all the events at the bar , had not informed his superiors of any such meeting even though he would have been obliged to report anything suspect . Indeed , he did not confirm that such an agreement had taken place . Moreover , having called his wife from the police station , he had gone outside to be taken home by NORP in his car but had not seen NORP or his police car . He had run down the street hoping to see him , but passing by the roundabout TIME , he had not seen NORP or anyone else there .", "CARDINAL . The court \u2019s conclusion was that the incident at the bar , to the extent that it had happened , had ended there .", "CARDINAL . Other witness statements related to the alleged motives for the crime , for example , that relations between the suspects and NORP were hostile on account of the criminal file opened against PERSON and that NORP was worried about vengeance on their part . However , the court found no objective confirmation of such fears . On the contrary , NORP had declared during questioning in the case in which PERSON had accused him of abduction in DATE that he was on good terms with PERSON", "CARDINAL . In addition , while NORP had opened a criminal investigation in respect of PERSON on DATE , he had not taken any measures in relation to him before handing the case to another investigator on DATE . There was no evidence in the file suggesting that PERSON had seen the materials in the file and thus found out about D. \u2019s involvement in the case , and the case had been closed by another investigator in DATE following PERSON \u2019s admission of having committed hooliganism . The court thus did not find any reasonable motive for revenge by PERSON based on that investigation .", "CARDINAL . Other witnesses called by the prosecution not only denied the allegation that PERSON had told them about killing NORP while they were travelling in GPE , but declared that they had seen PERSON being beaten to obtain a confession from him . The court likewise rejected the evidence of a former officer from the police station in PERSON where NORP had worked to the effect that he had been told by PERSON about the murder and its details . The court found that the witness was not impartial .", "CARDINAL . Another group of witnesses testified about the events at the house of the C. brothers\u2019 parents . These witnesses ( not only the parents ) stated that they had butchered and processed a pig for TIME and then taken the meat to the market at TIME CARDINAL of them declared that they had been made to sign statements which did not entirely correspond to what they had witnessed , in particular being pressed by the police to indicate that the butchering had begun at a different time and to declare that PERSON had not been present . A meat seller at the market confirmed that at TIME he had received meat from PERSON and that , judging by its weight , the butchering had taken DATE .", "CARDINAL . Considering all the above witness statements , the court found that at TIME , the time of the murder according to the prosecution , the suspects had been at ORG GPE house and could not have been in the woods to commit the crime as alleged .", "CARDINAL . The report of the crime scene investigation , together with a video recording of the investigation , depicted each of the accused showing the place and the manner in which they had allegedly committed the crime . According to the testimony of CARDINAL of the police officers who had taken part , the investigation had been carried out on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court found a number of violations of the rules on criminal procedure in the investigation of the crime scene . In particular , the report had been signed and annexed to the case - file only at a much later stage , whereas by law , it should have been signed during or immediately after the investigation . The witnesses to the crime scene investigation confirmed that they had signed the report but that they had not been allowed near the crime scene and had seen the burnt - out car only from a distance . Contrary to legal requirements , they had not had any explanation of their rights and obligations as witnesses , they had not seen what the police had found on the scene and they had not seen the video recording of the event before signing the report and map .", "CARDINAL . In addition , while a car tyre print had been found at the crime scene , a copy had not been made . NORP \u2019s documents , found intact and \u201c conspicuously displayed \u201d nearby , had not been examined for fingerprints , even though they had a plastic cover that could have retained prints .", "CARDINAL . A piece of fabric found on a bush had been described but not located on the map and not subjected to expert analysis . The analysis of the ORG clothes which they had worn on TIME did not reveal any element suggesting that they had been at the crime scene .", "A petrol tank found at the scene had likewise not been analysed by the experts .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution had not produced to the court the video recording of the crime scene investigation . The map drawn did not indicate the exact position of a number of items and marks noted in the report as having been found at the crime scene . This made it impossible for the court to verify whether what the accused had indicated at the crime scene coincided with the map and the traces found .", "CARDINAL . The report of the investigation described the finding of a plastic tube in DATE , but no details or measurements were given . It was only on DATE that the investigator had presented as evidence a piece of plastic tubing which had allegedly been found at the crime scene and had been used for taking fuel from NORP \u2019s car in order to set the car on fire . The court rejected that evidence , along with the result of a forensic experiment that merely showed the possibility of evacuating fuel from the car \u2019s tank in that manner .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these findings , the court excluded the crime scene report as a whole from the evidence on account of the serious procedural violations .", "CARDINAL . The court examined additional facts determined during the investigation . A witness testified that he worked as a security guard in a caf\u00e9 near the roundabout and had seen a police car and another car stopping there and a fight taking place between their occupants . They had then all got back into their cars and shots had been heard . CARDINAL car had left , followed by the police car , in the direction of PERSON . He had not seen either of the CARDINAL cars return in the direction of the wood where the burnt - out car was later found .", "CARDINAL . Other witnesses confirmed in court that they had heard shots that night but could not confirm their location .", "CARDINAL . The defence claimed that , after a brief initial investigation of the shooting , including a ballistics report , the relevant evidence had been withdrawn and examined in a new criminal case , in order to prevent the examination of alternative leads in the accused \u2019s case . The court found no evidence of any ballistics report , but noted the presence of records of interviews of witnesses who had heard the shots . Moreover , a cartridge case was found in NORP \u2019s car , the origin of which had not been explained . The court concluded that initially there had been another lead in the case which had not been fully investigated .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined the evidence relating to the identification of the human remains found in the car and decided that the identity of the victim had not been established .", "CARDINAL . The court also found , from the statements of a number of witnesses , including police officers , that the assumption that the CARDINAL suspects had committed the crime had emerged immediately and remained not just the main scenario under consideration , but in fact the only one examined during the entire investigation . In the court \u2019s view , this was confirmed by the failure to examine in any detail the established fact of the shooting in the area of the roundabout .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted the general attitude of the local police officers towards the suspects displayed in their letter of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had led it to conclude that the local police had formed a strongly negative attitude towards the suspects even before the crime had been committed . Added to that was the loss to the police station in the form of the police car that had been destroyed . The court concluded that that police station should not have been involved at all in the investigation of the crime . Nonetheless , most procedural steps in the initial phase of the investigation of the case had been performed by officers from that police station .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court examined the expert reports on various items found in and around the car . It concluded that most of those reports had been filed in serious breach of the rules on criminal procedure ( notably , the presumed identity of the human remains found in the burnt - out car had already been written on the materials presented to the experts , who were under the impression that the fact had already been established ) or had been seriously undermined by the improper manner in which samples had been obtained during the crime scene investigation .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that these reports neither confirmed , nor denied the identity of the victim . The objects found in the car and identified as belonging to the alleged victim were not inseparable from him and could have been placed there . Moreover , the prosecution had given no explanation as to why those who had committed the crime , having taken measures thoroughly to destroy all traces , had left NORP \u2019s personal documents untouched in an open space nearby , \u201c conspicuously displayed \u201d with his picture attached .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that credibility could be attached to the statements by the accused that illegal forms of pressure had been used on them and to those made by some witnesses about being forced by the police to give false statements .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that the investigation had been unilateral and biased against the suspects . It found that it had not been proved that the remains in the burnt - out car belonged to the alleged victim . While it had been proved that a crime had been committed by burning the car and an unidentified person inside it , there was no evidence to show that the suspects were the perpetrators of the crime . Most of the evidence gathered was unreliable owing to breaches of criminal procedure and could not serve as a basis for a conviction . On the basis of its findings , the court acquitted all CARDINAL suspects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and adopted a new one , convicting GPE , PERSON and PERSON It did not sentence PERSON because of his death in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court recounted in detail the sequence of events as submitted by the prosecution . It then examined the parties\u2019 submissions and the material in the case file and examined CARDINAL witness ( Dr P.O. ) . The court noted the contents of the interviews of each of the accused during the investigation ( of PERSON on CARDINAL and DATE , of GPE from DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and of PERSON , without specifying any specific date in his case but rather stating that he had given genuine confessions \u201c throughout the investigation \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . It found that the CARDINAL suspects had on a number of occasions made genuine and consistent confessions in the presence of their lawyers and that PERSON had written CARDINAL of his confessions himself . GPE \u2019s confession of CARDINAL and DATE had been filmed .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that all of the above precluded the possibility of ill - treatment and that the ORG confessions had incorrectly been excluded from the evidence by the first - instance court . The suspects had changed their statements towards the end of the investigation only to avoid criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . In the court \u2019s opinion , there was no evidence of any ill - treatment of the accused . The officers questioned in that regard all denied having applied such treatment and PERSON \u2019s personal medical file from his hospital treatment in DATE did not establish any evidence of ill - treatment . PERSON did not confirm the ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . The officer who had questioned PERSON after arresting him in GPE testified to the fact that PERSON had been lawfully questioned and that he had not been subjected to any form of ill - treatment . Because PERSON had a NORP residence visa in his passport for DATE , the NORP investigating authorities had treated him as a NORP citizen and there had thus been no need for a special request by any NORP authority to that effect .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that all CARDINAL suspects had made similar statements , differing only as regards their respective roles in committing the crime . The court considered that their subsequent denial of committing the crime and the slight variations in their versions of events was an attempt to avoid criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . The crime scene investigation had been conducted in the presence of witnesses and PERSON \u2019s lawyer and was filmed . Both GPE and PERSON had been able clearly to indicate the place and the manner of NORP \u2019s killing .", "DATE . D. \u2019s wife had identified the objects found in the burnt - out car and declared that the accused had often threatened her husband and family because of a criminal investigation opened by her husband against PERSON On DATE the local police had called to inform her that her husband \u2019s corpse had been found burned in the woods , together with his keys and documents . The court found that NORP had indeed opened a criminal investigation against PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The car found at the crime scene belonged to the local police station . Blood samples from around the car coincided with the NORP \u2019s blood group . Moreover , no other disappearances had been reported during the relevant period in the region . There was no doubt in the view of ORG that the corpse found in the car was NORP", "CARDINAL . The court stated , without giving any further details , that a number of witnesses had \u201c directly and indirectly shown that the accused were connected to the crime \u201d . The statements of CARDINAL other witnesses , excluded from the evidence by the first - instance court , were declared admissible by ORG , although it did not specify why , or what those statements included .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the witness statements of PERSON and PERSON had been read in court but unlawfully excluded from the evidence by the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that the first - instance court had not given reasons for its decision to reject from the file several types of evidence . The court rejected as unproven , without giving any explanation , all the other evidence taken into account by the first - instance court in favour of the accused . It found each of the accused , including PERSON , guilty as charged and decided to discontinue the proceedings against PERSON because of his death .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court first recounted in detail the prosecution \u2019s version of events , the findings of the lower courts in the case and the arguments raised by the defence , including an alibi for the accused .", "CARDINAL . The court declared that it accepted only lawfully obtained evidence as the basis for its judgment , evidence which it found \u201c sufficient to confirm the guilt of the accused [ PERSON ] , [ GPE ] and [ PERSON ] in having committed the acts of which they are accused \u201d . It referred to the contents of the self - incriminating statements made by the accused on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and noted that these statements had been made in the presence of their lawyers . It confirmed ORG acceptance of the self - incriminating statements as the \u201c decisive evidence \u201d in the case . The accused had made similar statements ; the discrepancies relating to the role of each in committing the crime were the result of their attempt to transfer most of the guilt to the others .", "DATE . The court also found that the accused had not withdrawn their statements until DATE , when they declared that they had been ill - treated . The first - instance court :", "\u201c gave credibility to the accused \u2019s declarations , even though they had not been proved , while deciding , without any basis , that witnesses who testified that there had been no ill - treatment were interested persons and should thus have their testimony excluded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also noted the statements of several witnesses who confirmed that the quarrel at the bar had taken place , that the accused had initiated it and that they had left for the hospital , while NORP had left for the police station after CARDINAL a.m. The testimonies largely coincided , as to the time and sequence of events , with the initial statements by the accused .", "CARDINAL . The witness ORG confirmed that the accused had driven her to the hospital after TIME and confirmed the quarrel at the bar . Her statements largely coincided with those made by GPE on DATE . The witnesses ORG and ORG stated that they had seen the accused in their car and the police car driving towards the roundabout shortly after TIME", "CARDINAL . The officer who had been on duty that TIME at the police station noted that NORP and his colleague PERSON had come to the station at around QUANTITY TIME later NORP had left in the car .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON ( se paragraph CARDINAL above ) , remembered CARDINAL of the accused shouting in the PERSON language \u201c I will burn you \u201d . The officer did not speak that language but remembered the word and had later found out its meaning .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that NORP had opened a criminal investigation against PERSON , which might have constituted a motive for revenge .", "CARDINAL . The court examined various pieces of evidence which proved , in its view , that the human remains found at the crime scene were those of NORP : an expert report had found that the corpse was , in all probability , that of a man ; the blood stains found coincided with NORP \u2019s blood group ; and items found in and around the car , such as keys and documents , belonged to NORP and had been recognised by his wife .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court declared that the above and \u201c other evidence taken into account by ORG \u201d proved the accused \u2019s guilt . No further details were given .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW in force at the material time read as follows :", "\u201c Criminal proceedings can not be instituted , and those already instituted shall be discontinued :", "...", "( CARDINAL) against a deceased person , with the exception of those cases where the proceedings are necessary for the rehabilitation of the deceased ... \u201d", "\u201c ...", "Evidence obtained in violation of the present Code or not properly examined during the court hearing can not constitute the basis of a court conviction or of other procedural documents . \u201d", "\u201c ...
