POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen , was born in DATE . He resides in GPE .", "The facts of the case submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows :", "DATE the applicant served as an officer in the secret police , ORG ( LOC ) of ORG .", "On DATE all agents of the former ORG ( funkcjonariusze PERSON ) were dismissed from their service by virtue of the Act on State Security Bureau of DATE and new selection procedures were established . ORG ( uchwa\u0142a PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE provided for special selection procedure for the former agents and created both first and second - instance screening boards for this purpose .", "In DATE the first - instance screening board in ORG in its opinion about the applicant considered that he did not meet the relevant requirements , including moral standards , and would not be readmitted to the service in ORG . Consequently , on DATE the applicant was dismissed . He lodged an appeal with ORG , to no avail , as on DATE this body upheld the opinion of the first - instance board .", "Subsequently , the applicant lodged CARDINAL appeals with ORG against the opinion of the examining board . He submitted that the contested opinion was unjustified and the selection procedure was made without taking his professional skills into consideration . The applicant maintained that the fact that he was religiously indifferent had in fact been the main reason for which he obtained a negative opinion as to his further ability to serve in ORG . He further complained that the decisions of the boards did not contain any grounds .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's complaints . The court did not recognise the opinion of the screening board as the administrative decision against which an appeal to that court would lay and , consequently , found the complaints inadmissible .", "In reply to the applicant \u2019s complaints , on DATE ORG informed him that the screening boards created under LAW had ceased to work in DATE as the process of qualification and re - admission had been completed . Moreover , according to the Resolution of DATE , which did not provide for any possibility to re - open the screening proceedings , the opinions given by them were definitive and not subject to any procedure in which they could be challenged .", "By decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further requests to have his service status regularised . The court observed that the applicant had been dismissed from service automatically , i.e. ex lege , under the provisions of LAW . There was no legal basis under which he could claim that a decision be given to re - admit him to the service . Therefore his requests were inadmissible .", "In a letter of DATE ORG , in reply to the applicant \u2019s renewed request to be readmitted to the service , informed him that the DATE ORG remained in force and that the opinions given pursuant its provisions were valid . Accordingly , the Minister could not re - admit to the service any persons who in DATE had obtained negative opinions as to their ability to be readmitted to the service .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to ORG , requesting that it be examined by that court . He stated that he had been dismissed from ORG by the DATE decision , given in proceedings which did not meet the requirements of a fair hearing in that they were not adversarial . He contested the outcome of the proceedings in which he was dismissed , invoked LAW and requested that the court appraise the lawfulness of the decisions given by the first- and second - instance screening boards in DATE .", "By a letter of DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that his complaint can not be examined as he had failed to indicate in what kind of judicial proceedings it could be examined and against whom it was directed . Moreover , the legal provisions invoked by the applicant did not provide for jurisdiction of a civil court in respect of any decisions taken by the screening boards in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
