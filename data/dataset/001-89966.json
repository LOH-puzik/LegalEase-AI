Persons held in custody for TIME or more should , as far as possible , be offered TIME of outdoor exercise every day .", "b. temporary detention centres", "CARDINAL . During the visit , the ORG \u2019s delegation visited temporary detention centres in GPE , GPE , GPE , ORG and ORG Establishments of this type are used to hold CARDINAL categories of detainees : criminal suspects and persons under administrative arrest .", "Conditions of detention in the temporary detention centres visited varied from acceptable ( at ORG ) to poor ( e.g. at the PERSON and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards occupancy levels , a consultation of registers and the number of sleeping places per cell suggested that the minimum standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of living space per person , as stipulated by the PERSON on [ ORG ] , was respected as concerns criminal suspects . However , the ORG must add that this minimum standard is too low . As concerns the cells for administrative detainees , the information gathered during the visit indicated that conditions could become extremely cramped , e.g. CARDINAL detainees in a cell of CARDINAL m\u00b2 in GPE and GPE .", "All the centres visited presented deficiencies concerning the in - cell lighting and ventilation . With the exception of the GPE centre , access to natural light was poor ( small windows , sometimes - as in GPE - covered by metal shutters ) or inexistent ( e.g. in NORP ) . Artificial lighting was invariably dim , with some cells ( e.g. in GPE , NORP and NORP ) submerged in near darkness . As to ventilation , it left something to be desired at GPE and GPE .", "As to the state of repair and hygiene of the detention areas , it ranged from quite acceptable at ORG to poor at the PERSON establishment . Cells at the Temporary detention centre in GPE were in a reasonably good state of repair ; however , their level of cleanliness left something to be desired . Detention areas in GPE and NORP were dilapidated but clean .", "CARDINAL . Cells were furnished with beds or wooden sleeping platforms . The delegation noted that mattresses , sheets , pillows and blankets were available for criminal suspects at all the temporary detention centres visited ; however , this was not the case for administrative detainees .", "The delegation did not hear any complaints from persons who were - or had recently been - detained at the centres visited as regards access to a toilet . However , with the notable exception of ORG , the communal toilet and washing facilities were dilapidated and dirty .", "The centres in GPE and GPE possessed shower facilities , which could apparently be used by newly - arrived detainees ( upon recommendation of a feldsher / doctor ) and by those administrative detainees who stayed in the respective establishments for DATE . In both centres , the shower facilities were in an acceptable state of repair and cleanliness , and hot water was available . However , the only personal hygiene item that was distributed to detainees was a small piece of soap .", "CARDINAL . According to information provided by police officers in the majority of the temporary detention centres visited , detainees were offered food CARDINAL times per day , including CARDINAL hot meal . However , this was not the case at ORG , where food was only delivered once per day , reportedly due to the limited budget set aside for this purpose ( CARDINAL ORG - i.e. MONEY - per detainee per day ) . In this situation , the provision of food was to a large extent ensured by detainees\u2019 families . Detained persons without family contacts had to rely on the generosity of other detainees or individual police officers for food .", "CARDINAL . All the temporary detention centres visited possessed outdoor exercise areas , where detainees were apparently allowed to take exercise for TIME per day ( in the case of women and juveniles - for TIME per day ) . However , at FAC of ORG in GPE , the delegation was informed that detainees could be deprived of outdoor exercise as a form of punishment for violation of the centre \u2019s internal regulations .", "DATE . The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities take steps at temporary detention centres to :", "- ensure that all detainees are offered adequate living space ; the objective should be CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person ;", "- provide adequate in - cell lighting ( including access to natural light ) and ventilation ;", "- maintain the cells and common sanitary facilities in a satisfactory state of repair and hygiene ;", "- ensure that all detainees ( including those held for administrative violations ) are offered a mattress and blankets at TIME ;", "- ensure that administrative detainees are able to take a hot shower at least once DATE during their period of detention ;", "- ensure that all detainees are offered food - sufficient in quantity and quality - at normal meal times ;", "- put an end to deprivation of outdoor exercise as a disciplinary punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of the ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Conditions of detention", "a. Temporary detention centre of ORG of GPE", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention in this facility remained basically the same as those observed during DATE visit , i.e. poor . CARDINAL positive change was that persons under administrative arrest were now provided with bedding ( pursuant to Order No . CARDINAL of the Head of ORG DATE ) . Further , the delegation was informed that the food entitlement for detainees had been increased by Government decision of DATE . Otherwise , no refurbishment or major repairs had taken place since the previous visit .", "Consequently , the ORG reiterates the recommendations made in paragraph CARDINAL of the report on DATE visit , in particular as regards living space , in - cell lighting , ventilation , state of repair and hygiene . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

At DATE visit , the delegation was informed that , pursuant to LAW , dated DATE , a large - scale refurbishment programme had been initiated in all police holding areas . The ORG welcomes this . It should also be noted that a recent amendment to the [ Law on ORG ] increased the official standard of living space per detained person in police holding areas to CARDINAL m\u00b2 . This can be considered as acceptable when applied to multi - occupancy cells ; however , CARDINAL m\u00b2 is not an adequate size for a single occupancy cell .", "CARDINAL .
