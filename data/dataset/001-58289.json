The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP citizen who was born in DATE and is at present living in GPE in south - east GPE . Her application to the Commission was brought on her own behalf , on behalf of her CARDINAL minor children and on behalf of her deceased husband Dr GPE GPE who , she alleges , was killed by State security forces or with their connivance .", "CARDINAL . The facts surrounding the killing of the applicant \u2019s husband are disputed .", "CARDINAL . The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in DATE to CARDINAL below . The applicant did not reiterate her version of the circumstances surrounding the killing in her memorial to the ORG , relying on the facts as established by the ORG in its report of CARDINAL DATE and her previous submissions to the Commission .", "CARDINAL . The facts as presented by the Government are set out in paragraphs CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . A description of the material submitted to the ORG will be found in DATE below . A description of the proceedings before the domestic authorities regarding the killing of the applicant \u2019s husband , as established by the ORG is set out in DATE below .", "CARDINAL . The Commission , in order to establish the facts in view of the dispute over the circumstances surrounding the killing of the applicant \u2019s husband , conducted its own investigation pursuant to former LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the Convention . To that end , the ORG examined a series of documents submitted by both the applicant and the Government in support of their assertions and appointed CARDINAL delegates to take the evidence of witnesses at a hearing in GPE on DATE and DATE . The ORG \u2019s evaluation of the evidence and its findings are summarised in DATE below .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant \u2019s husband , Dr PERSON , was shot dead in the town of PERSON on a steep road , known as ORG ) , which runs between the public hospital and the security directorate . The applicant was on the low balcony of her hospital residence , close to the hospital gates , when she heard the sounds of automatic firing . She jumped off the balcony and ran towards PERSON . While she was running she heard another type of firing start .", "CARDINAL . The applicant saw her husband lying near the top of the steepest part of the hill , close to the security directorate , the moment she ran out of the hospital gates . She did not see anyone as she ran towards him . However , as she knelt by him , she looked up and saw CARDINAL members of the security forces standing in a line across the street near the security directorate and brandishing machine - guns , CARDINAL to QUANTITY away from her . They were dressed in plain clothes but were wearing special jackets that enabled them to carry spare ammunition . Although there were usually CARDINAL members of the security forces near the security directorate , it was not usual for them to stand together in a line . The applicant appealed to the police present at the scene to do something to catch the perpetrators but they did nothing . She ran back down to the junction with FAC ( PERSON ) , screaming for help . At the junction , she saw CARDINAL young men running along FAC and she saw them turn up the next street on the left . She warned the security force members that they were allowing the perpetrators to escape . The street on the left of FAC that the men had run into joined FAC ( Gazi Caddesi ) near the security directorate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then turned and ran back to her husband , having recalled that there was a gun in his briefcase . At that point , people ran out of the hospital to help . They took Dr GPE to the hospital where they tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him . Meanwhile , CARDINAL policemen on patrol in a vehicle had been summoned by radio and they arrived within TIME . CARDINAL of the police officers examined the scene and the third , ORG , went to the hospital , where he obtained from the applicant a description of the CARDINAL young men and of the direction in which they had fled . He informed his CARDINAL colleagues , who went in pursuit of the alleged killers but not in the direction which had been indicated by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made several efforts to make a statement to the authorities . She contacted the police but they said that the Chief of Security was not there and hung up . She also tried to speak to the Governor but without success .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Dr GPE had been taken in for questioning by the police . They had received a tip - off to the effect that he was sheltering a terrorist suspect belonging to the ORG ( Workers\u2019 ORG ) . He had been released without charge DATE .", "CARDINAL . Dr GPE took his duties as a doctor seriously and would treat anyone in need . As the only doctor in ORG for DATE , he would have been the person who produced medical reports on persons released from custody . While he generally sought to protect the applicant from anything that might worry her , he did say , on CARDINAL occasion , \u201c If we let them , they would write the reports \u201d , and he also spoke about torture . Following the killing of another doctor in PERSON on DATE , which led a third doctor to seek and obtain a transfer from the area , Dr GPE was reported in the press as having refused to talk about that incident out of fear . At the time a large number of killings were being committed in PERSON by unknown persons . There were newspaper reports alleging that many of the killings were the work of counter - guerrilla forces and it was reported that a military officer by the name of ORG had a list of names and that the people on it were killed CARDINAL by CARDINAL . Dr GPE \u2019s name was rumoured to be on this list .", "CARDINAL . Although Dr GPE had sought to reassure the applicant that he was not at risk , he had acquired a gun , with the necessary licence , DATE before his death . DATE before he was killed , Dr GPE had requested permission from the Governor to take his DATE leave . Permission had been refused , even though his leave was long overdue and other doctors had arrived in PERSON who could have replaced him .", "CARDINAL . Following the killing of Dr GPE , other doctors working at the hospital told the Governor that if the killers could not be found it was not safe for them to remain in PERSON . The Governor allegedly told them that they were safe and that Dr PERSON had been killed because he was a GPE from PERSON . The applicant requested CARDINAL of these doctors , Dr \u0130lhan , to make a statement about his conversation with the Governor but he refused , as he was frightened of the consequences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a summons to appear at the prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG DATE . She was scared before the interview and found the experience frightening . ORG , Mr PERSON , questioned the applicant about her application to the Commission and , in particular , about the power of attorney she had given to her lawyers in an accompanying document . The report that was drawn up of the interview states that the applicant was shown a power of attorney in the name of PERSON and that she denied that the signature on that document belonged to her . The power of attorney which the applicant had submitted to the Commission , however , was in her full name of PERSON . The implied threat was made by Mr PERSON that something might happen to the applicant on account of her application . PERSON also suggested that an application to the Commission was futile .", "CARDINAL . The report of the interview was not a reliable record of what had been said . Contrary to what was written in the report , the applicant did not tell Mr PERSON during the interview that about ten days after her husband \u2019s death she had been telephoned by a person called PERSON , who was from a centre in GPE and was ringing from GPE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE when PERSON was shot , there were CARDINAL officers standing guard outside the entrance to the security directorate . These police officers would not have been standing QUANTITY away from the incident and watching it , since the entrance to the security directorate was round the corner from where the shooting took place . The officers standing guard were under strict orders not to leave their posts even if they heard shooting or an explosion as that would render the security directorate vulnerable to attack .", "CARDINAL . The street into which the applicant said that she saw the CARDINAL perpetrators of her husband \u2019s killing turn from Old Bitlis Road did not come out at the security directorate building on FAC but CARDINAL blocks away from there .", "CARDINAL . Dr GPE had been happy and proud to be working for the ORG . Government officials were on good terms with him and police officers had felt free to request his help at TIME . However , investigations had shown that many killings of ORG officials or persons working for the ORG , especially in the area where the state of emergency was in force , had been committed by militants of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . There was no connection between Dr GPE \u2019s death and his having been summoned to the police station in DATE to make a statement concerning the allegation that he was hiding a terrorist . As soon as it had been established that the allegation was false , Dr GPE had been released .", "CARDINAL . Dr GPE had been refused leave because he was the deputy head consultant of the hospital and his leave would have interrupted the medical service .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of ORG at ORG in questioning the applicant on DATE had been twofold : firstly , doing so was part of his duty in relation to the preliminary criminal investigation into the death of her husband and , secondly , it was done to verify the validity of her application to the Commission . It was vital that the applicant should be asked about the authenticity of her application in view of the fact that forged statements had been submitted to the Commission in various other cases . It clearly appeared from the record of the interview , however , that the applicant had stated that she wished to pursue her application .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before the ORG the applicant and the ORG submitted a number of statements which the applicant had made to ORG in ORG and to ORG at ORG . The parties further submitted a number of plans of the area where the shooting had taken place . At the Commission \u2019s request , the Government also submitted photographs and a video film of the area .", "CARDINAL . The Government further provided copies of the incident report drawn up by QUANTITY police officers on DATE of the shooting ( DATE ) , the reports of the post - mortem examination and ballistic tests , statements taken by police officers from witnesses at the scene ( Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ) and a decision issued by PERSON public prosecutor PERSON on DATE to the effect that he had no jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The Commission repeatedly requested the Government to provide it with a copy of the complete investigation file , as it had appeared during the hearing of witnesses in GPE that the Government held more documents than had previously been submitted to ORG . The Government did not submit any other documents .", "CARDINAL . Following the shooting of Dr GPE , police inspected the scene of the incident and retrieved CARDINAL empty cartridges and CARDINAL deformed bullet . They also drew up a plan of the immediate surroundings , searched the area and noted down names of people who had been present in the area at the time of the shooting . The notes containing those names have not been kept . The incident report drawn up by CARDINAL police officers ( Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ) at TIME on DATE mentions that during the examination of the scene of the incident CARDINAL - long empty cartridges and CARDINAL deformed bullet were retrieved . According to the incident report , residents of the area had stated that those who carried out the shooting had been CARDINAL tall , thin people wearing jeans and trainers . CARDINAL of these had been wearing a yellow T - shirt and the other a white striped T - shirt . In the general examination made of the area , no individuals fitting either of the descriptions were discovered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON made a statement to the police in which he said that he had been walking behind Dr GPE on PERSON when he had heard a series of shots coming from behind them . He had thrown himself into the garden of houses on the right - hand side and had not seen the person or persons who had shot Dr GPE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL other men , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , made a statement to the police on DATE in which they related that when they were , respectively , walking towards the hospital and working in the grocer \u2019s shop on the corner of PERSON , they had heard shots and had found Dr GPE lying in a pool of blood . Following the gunshots Mr PERSON GPE had seen CARDINAL people running in the direction of FAC . Mr PERSON had not seen the person or persons who had shot Dr GPE .", "CARDINAL . A post - mortem examination of Dr GPE \u2019s body was carried out on DATE by PERSON and PERSON , both general practitioners who worked at ORG , and the public prosecutor , Mr PERSON . According to the report of this examination , CARDINAL bullet entry wounds and CARDINAL bullet exit wounds were recorded , inter alia on the nose , left ear and left forearm , to the left of the fifth vertebra , on the thumb and the right nipple and above the right knee . CARDINAL bullet was found lodged just below the skin on the inside of the left femur and removed . The cause of death was given as the injury to , and extensive bleeding in , the chest and vital internal organs . In view of the obvious cause of death , it was not considered necessary to carry out a full autopsy .", "CARDINAL . Ballistic tests on the cartridges retrieved at the scene of the incident were carried out by the regional police laboratory . A comparative examination showed up conformity in various respects indicating a single source . The cartridges and the deformed bullet were kept in the laboratory archives . The report of the examination , dated DATE , does not indicate with what kind of firearm the cartridges and bullet might have been used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor , PERSON , issued a decision to the effect that he had no jurisdiction . In view of the nature of the offence , the way it had been carried out and the existing evidence , the investigation into the incident fell within the competence of the prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG , where the case is still pending . The decision declining jurisdiction named the suspects as CARDINAL unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was summoned to appear before ORG at ORG , Mr PERSON , on DATE . According to the report of her interview with Mr PERSON , the applicant said that her husband had continually received threats from the NORP for being an official of the ORG and from ORG for not complying with NORP rules . She is also reported as saying that , approximately ten days after the incident , she received a telephone call from someone she believed was called PERSON , who invited her to come to the ORG branch of ORG . The report further states that PERSON showed the applicant a petition signed by PERSON on DATE . The applicant denied having given anybody that document ; her name was not PERSON and the signature on the document was forged . However , she confirmed that she had made an application to the Commission and that she herself had signed that .", "CARDINAL . Since the facts of the case were disputed , particularly concerning events on DATE , the Commission conducted an investigation , with the assistance of the parties , and received documentary evidence , including written statements and oral evidence taken from CARDINAL witnesses : the applicant ; Mr PERSON , Chief Public Prosecutor at ORG ; Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON \u015eahin , the QUANTITY police officers who investigated the area where the incident took place , drew up the incident report and made a sketch of the area ; and Dr PERSON , CARDINAL of the doctors who conducted the post - mortem examination .", "A further CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned but did not appear : PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , the witnesses who made statements to the police shortly after the incident ; PERSON , the second doctor who had performed the post - mortem examination ; Mr PERSON , the PERSON public prosecutor in DATE ; and Mr \u00dcnal Haney , whom the Government had identified as the public prosecutor at ORG who was in charge of the investigation at the time of the hearing of witnesses by the ORG \u2019s delegates . It appeared that Mr PERSON and PERSON were ill and that PERSON PERSON was doing his military service and was involved in exercises which prevented his presence at the hearing . The Government had been unable to locate Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON informed the ORG that he was not prepared to attend the hearing . Although Mr PERSON was said to have boarded a bus bound for GPE , he did not appear before the ORG \u2019s delegates . No explanation for his failure to attend was submitted by the ORG , despite a number of requests to that effect from the ORG .", "The ORG made a finding in its report ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that the Government had fallen short of their obligations under former LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW to furnish all necessary facilities to the Commission in its task of establishing the facts . It referred to the ORG \u2019s failure", "( i ) to provide copies of the complete investigation file ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; and", "( ii ) to secure the attendance of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In relation to the oral evidence , the Commission was aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters . It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by the witnesses appearing before its delegates .", "In a case in which there were contradictory and conflicting accounts of what actually occurred , the Commission particularly regretted the absence of a thorough domestic judicial investigation . It was aware of its own limitations as a first - instance tribunal of fact . In addition to the problems of language adverted to above , it inevitably had no detailed , direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region . Moreover , the Commission had no power to compel witnesses to appear and testify . In the present case , while CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned to appear , CARDINAL gave evidence . The lack of documentary material has already been referred to . The ORG was therefore faced with the difficult task of ascertaining the facts in the absence of potentially significant testimony and with incomplete evidence .", "The Commission \u2019s findings may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that no findings of fact had been made by domestic courts as regards the subject - matter of the applicant \u2019s complaints . ORG had accordingly based its findings on the evidence given to its delegates orally or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings . In this form of assessment the co - existence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact and , in addition , the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account ( see , mutatis mutandis , the GPE v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it was not in dispute that Dr GPE had been shot on PERSON on DATE . However , it had been presented with conflicting accounts as to the exact place on PERSON where the incident had occurred . Whereas the applicant contended that her husband had been lying fairly far up PERSON , near the security directorate , the QUANTITY policemen who investigated the scene of the incident indicated in their report and in the sketch they made that Dr GPE had been shot near the bottom of the hill . The Commission considered it doubtful that the applicant would have been able to see the body as she came out of the hospital gates , as she alleged , if he had been shot as far up PERSON as she contended .", "CARDINAL . Neither the report of the post - mortem examination nor the oral evidence given by PERSON to its delegates enabled the ORG to establish whether PERSON was shot from the front or from behind , information which could have provided an indication of the place from where the bullets had been fired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that anyone trying to escape by going up PERSON or via a side alley would have done so within sight of the members of the security forces DATE CARDINAL of them \u2013 who were standing at the top of the hill and that the perpetrators therefore could not have been concerned about the reaction of the police . The Government disputed that there would have been CARDINAL police officers as described by the applicant . They submitted that there were CARDINAL officers standing guard at the front of the security directorate , round the corner from the top of PERSON , and that they were under strict orders not to leave their post . The Commission noted that , while this state of affairs was confirmed by police officers PERSON and PERSON before its delegates , it was at odds with the situation portrayed on the photographs and the video film which , according to the ORG , corresponded to the situation on DATE of Dr GPE \u2019s death . On the photographs and the video film , CARDINAL uniformed police officers could be seen standing guard at the back of the security directorate as well .", "CARDINAL . As regards the general credibility of the applicant , the ORG found that her evidence was on the whole detailed , precise and consistent . However , even if it accepted that CARDINAL armed police officers had been present at or near the scene of the incident , the Commission considered that a finding to the effect that the killing of Dr GPE had been carried out either by these officers or with their connivance would be based more on conjecture , speculation and assumption than on reliable inference . The Commission was of the opinion that the evidence available did not allow for inferences to be drawn capable of supporting such a finding . This was so even if account was taken of the background against which the applicant submitted that the incident should be seen : her husband \u2019s arrest DATE previously on suspicion of harbouring a ORG terrorist ; the refusal of his leave ; the fact that his name was rumoured to feature on a hit list ; and the large number of civil servants being killed in PERSON by unknown assailants at the time .", "CARDINAL . In reaching the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s allegations had not been sufficiently proved , the ORG pointed out that it had not been provided with any other eyewitness evidence or evidence corroborating the applicant \u2019s account to a decisive extent . Moreover , the documentary evidence with which it had been presented was incomplete , inconsistent and on some points even contradictory .", "CARDINAL . In its evaluation of the evidence relating to the investigation into the killing of the applicant \u2019s husband , the ORG noted that there had been no thorough domestic judicial investigation . Referring to the incomplete investigation file and the failure of CARDINAL public prosecutors to appear before its delegates , the ORG further pointed out that it was only able to evaluate the investigation to the extent that information concerning that investigation had been made available . In this respect it also noted that it had not been provided with any evidence showing what , if any , inquiries had been conducted following the drawing up of the incident report by CARDINAL police officers TIME after the shooting .", "CARDINAL . In its assessment of the various investigative steps that had been taken by the domestic authorities , the ORG was particularly critical of the limited scope of the initial investigation carried out by the QUANTITY police officers who had arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting . It found the sketch map they had made to be both imprecise and uninformative . In the absence of information to the contrary , it had to assume that no photographs had been taken of the scene . The Commission was further struck by the fact that the applicant \u2019s statement had not been taken until DATE and it was not persuaded that attempts had been made to speak to her sooner . Finally , the ORG noted that only very little forensic information had been gathered and it expressed doubt as to the expertise possessed in this field by the CARDINAL physicians who had carried out the post - mortem examination .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG the applicant referred to the so - called ORG , which was first produced to the ORG in the case of GPE v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALVI , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . The report became available in DATE , after counsel had submitted the final pleadings on behalf of the applicant in the proceedings before the Commission . This confidential report was initially intended to be only for the Prime Minister , who had commissioned it on DATE from ORG within his ORG . After receiving the report in DATE , it would appear that the Prime Minister then made it available to the public , although CARDINAL pages from the body of the report and its appendices were withheld .", "CARDINAL . The introduction states that the report was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigative report . It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events that had occurred mainly in south - east GPE and which tended to confirm the existence of a tripartite relationship involving unlawful dealings between political figures , government institutions and clandestine groups .", "CARDINAL . The report analyses a series of events , such as murders carried out under orders , the killings of well - known figures or supporters of the NORP and deliberate acts by a group of \u201c informants \u201d supposedly serving the ORG . It concludes that there is a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that had been formed as a result , particularly in the drug - trafficking sphere .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . The authorities\u2019 obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public ORG offices . The complaint may be made in writing or orally . If it is made orally , the authority must make a record of it ( LAW .", "If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes , members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge ( Article CARDINAL ) . By Article CARDINAL of LAW , any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor \u2019s office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of national security prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by LAW on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local ORG ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also applies to members of the security forces under the governor \u2019s authority .", "CARDINAL . If the suspect is a member of the armed forces , the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence . Thus , if it is a \u201c military offence \u201d under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , the criminal proceedings are in principle conducted in accordance with PERSON no . CARDINAL on the establishment of courts martial and their rules of procedure . Where a member of the armed forces has been accused of an ordinary offence , it is normally the provisions of LAW which apply ( LAW and sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of Law no .

In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or with the offender \u2019s superior .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of PERSON no . CARDINAL on administrative procedure , anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may , within DATE after the alleged act was committed , claim compensation from them . If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within DATE , the victim may bring administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the authorities shall be subject to judicial review .", "\u2026", "The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures . \u201d", "That provision establishes the ORG \u2019s strict liability , which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the ORG has failed in its obligation to maintain public order , ensure public safety or protect people \u2019s lives or property , without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities . Under these rules , the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL . DATE of Legislative Decree no .
