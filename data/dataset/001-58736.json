On DATE ORG requested that the time - limit for the submission of its opinion be extended until DATE so as to enable it to carry out a thorough investigation . ORG then requested ORG to provide a preliminary opinion by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its opinion of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that the applicant did not wish to be in contact with H and her new husband and was willing to accept that the authorities act as intermediaries during an initial period of access . The applicant further considered that the initial meetings should take place in the city or town where his daughter was resident .", "CARDINAL .

The final decision in respect of custody and access was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It transpires from the documents that the intention is to organise unsupervised meetings between [ I ] and [ the applicant ] .", "On the basis of the above material I must , as an expert , oppose the meetings in question until further notice . Both supervised and , in particular , unsupervised meetings would amount to a flagrant violation of the best interests of the child and would subject [ I ] at least to a serious mental and possibly also physical danger and could damage her mental development to an extent which would be difficult to treat .", "This opinion is of a preliminary character because I am currently examining the matter [ more ] thoroughly . The examination will DATE , following which I will be prepared to submit a more detailed and more reasoned opinion . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that the meeting between him and the child fixed for DATE would not take place . H had informed ORG that she had no intention of bringing I to the meeting - place , the reason being that she feared that the child might be subjected to \u201c something harmful \u201d . ORG attempts to convince H to comply with the court order had been unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for enforcement with ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of PERSON , acting as Chief Bailiff ( ulosotonhaltija , \u00f6verexekutor ) . He referred to H 's failure to bring I to the meeting fixed for DATE . Moreover , a leading official of ORG had informed the applicant that H was keeping his paternity secret from the child .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that H would not bring the child to the meeting fixed for DATE either . This letter had been preceded by a social welfare official 's telephone calls to the applicant and PERSON The official had suggested to H that a plain - clothed police officer could attend the meeting . H had refused , indicating a wish to attend the meetings herself . When informed that this wish could be accommodated , H had retracted her consent , at least in respect of the DATE meeting . When requested to state her position in respect of the DATE meeting , H had thought her answer would remain negative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that H would not bring the child to the DATE meeting either .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant repeated his enforcement request , referring to H 's failure to bring I to the DATE meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE requested that ORG ( maistraatti , magistraten ) order her and the child 's address to be kept secret in accordance with the DATE LAW ( v\u00e4est\u00f6tietolaki , befolkningsdatalag , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . H referred to the applicant 's conviction in DATE and suspected that he was threatening the lives of her and the child . On DATE ORG ordered that the address of H and I should be kept secret for DATE . This order was later extended .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE and ORG Director and Senior ORG Officer of ORG , submitted the final opinion to ORG on the question of access . They noted H 's strong fear and suspicions in respect of the applicant and his intentions . H seemed to fear that the meetings between the applicant and his daughter would cause physical or psychological harm to the child or her new family . In the explosive situation at hand it would be difficult to organise the visits in an atmosphere which could be beneficial to the child . In the long term visits were nevertheless to be aimed at , as it was in the child 's best interests to meet her father in secure conditions and to be able to form her own opinion of his good and bad features . Regrettably , it had proved impossible to have any of the interim access arrangements enforced . This had significantly prevented the officials from forming their opinion of the applicant 's abilities to relate to his child .", "CARDINAL . A summary by ORG dated DATE indicated that , prior to drawing up the opinion of CARDINAL DATE , officials had met H CARDINAL times together with the child and once also together with the grandmother . The officials had intended to request investigations by ORG ( perheneuvola , familjer\u00e5dgivningen ) but H had already contacted a private child psychiatrist ( Dr V ) , on whose preliminary opinion she had relied early on , refusing to comply with the interim access arrangements . She had categorically refused to accept any such access , even when it had been proposed to organise the meetings at ORG in the presence of a police officer . She had feared for her own and the child 's safety and had considered that access would not be in the child 's best interests . She had not wanted any information about the child to be given to the applicant . She had referred to his criminal record , the DATE opinion on his mental health and the threats he had addressed to her family . The social welfare official had concluded that the parents ' relationship was negative and filled with hatred . The applicant had been contacted by telephone and letter as he had found it unnecessary to attend a meeting with the social welfare officials . Occasionally , he had been very aggressive and threatening towards the officials . ORG summary concluded that in the light of the information available at the time ORG had been unable to formulate any clear proposal to ORG in respect of access rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the access proceedings until DATE at the request of H. In its decision of the latter date the ORG afforded custody of the child solely to H and granted the child the right to meet with the applicant for TIME on DATE of DATE . ORG furthermore ordered H to pay the administrative fine imposed on DATE . ORG had at its disposal PERSON final opinion of CARDINAL DATE in which he had stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... I have met [ I ] twice and [ H ] , her husband and second child on CARDINAL occasions . ... [ The applicant ] refused to see me ... but spoke to me over the telephone . ...", "... [ I ] is strongly attached to her mother and her stepfather , whom she wishes to call her father .", "The conversation with [ the applicant ] was rather original . He was ... rather agitated and paranoid and unable to explain why . He refused to cooperate , although I explained that this would have been very important and in the interests of his child . Instead he threatened me with ... court proceedings and negative publicity ; ... At the beginning of the conversation he lied to me , saying that the person answering the telephone was a neighbour . His paranoia was illustrated by accusations against everyone ; everyone seemed to be wrong and to be persecuting him ; only he was right . This fits well with the impression one gets from the documents , namely that [ he ] very easily becomes aggressive and that his ability to control his impulses is very poor . These factors combined with his paranoid attitude and feeling of always being right makes him very dangerous as regards [ I ] .", "... I consider it very likely that the planned meetings between [ I ] and [ the applicant ] will seriously damage at least [ I 's ] mental development . They might also endanger her physical health . I continue to be of the opinion that [ H ] ... should not agree to any such experiments ... at the expense of the child 's future . [ The applicant ] must first show that he is able to create a secure and good relationship towards [ H ] ; only subsequently can meetings of this kind be contemplated . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the question of access ORG found as follows :", "\u201c According to the opinion of the ... ORG , [ I ] is a well - balanced child with a trusting attitude towards adults . Witness [ V ] has stated in his opinion that the tests carried out by [ GPE ] , Chief Psychologist , and [ V 's own ] psychological interviews have shown that she is well cared for and mentally balanced and that she has developed and continues to develop well ... According to [ V ] , [ I ] is a healthy and happy child . [ He ] is of the opinion that [ the applicant ] can not be granted access rights ... , since [ H ] is afraid of meeting [ him ] and [ I ] can sense that fear on the part of her custodian .", "Bearing in mind that the DATE [ I ] is a well - balanced child , who is behaving in a manner which is adequate for her age , short meetings between her and her biological father and other strangers can not be considered harmful to her , provided [ her ] custodian is able to support her mentally in connection with the meetings . There is thus no reason to prohibit access ... completely . ...", "For these reasons , ... the ORG finds that [ I ] is entitled to meet her father and to stay in contact with him . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG specified that the meetings between the applicant and I were to take place at a children 's centre in GPE ( near GPE ) , where the meetings could also be supervised . Both parties appealed against the judgment , the applicant seeking more extended access and H opposing access altogether .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed an official of ORG to act as conciliator in the enforcement proceedings . She was ordered to submit her report by CARDINAL DATE . H 's lawyer informed the conciliator that H could not be reached in DATE , since she was on holiday .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the conciliator requested to be replaced by another official , the applicant having objected to her appointment as she had been involved in drawing up ORG opinion to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed the suggested official to act as conciliator and ordered her to submit her report by DATE . H informed the conciliator that she wished the matter to be handled by her lawyer , who would be on holiday until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant repeated his enforcement request and referred to H 's failure to bring I to the DATE meeting .", "CARDINAL . In her report of CARDINAL DATE the conciliator found that conciliation had to be excluded , given the complete deadlock . H was categorically opposed to any access between I and the applicant and had refused even to discuss the matter in person with the conciliator . The applicant , for his part , was approaching the matter so aggressively and expressing such threats that it rendered any dialogue difficult . Even his telephone calls to the conciliator had been impertinent and had contained threats .", "CARDINAL . Heard in writing by ORG , H referred , inter alia , to the applicant 's criminal convictions and prison sentences as well as to the views of PERSON In his rejoinder the applicant essentially considered that such material was irrelevant for the purposes of the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request for enforcement of the initial access arrangements , noting that ORG interim order of DATE had been replaced by its final decision of DATE . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , in response to the parties ' appeal in the main proceedings concerning custody and access , made some minor changes in respect of the implementation of the access rights . Both parties sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant repeated his enforcement request , referring to H 's failure to bring I to the DATE and DATE meetings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as appellate body in the enforcement proceedings , quashed ORG decision of DATE and ordered it to reconsider the applicant 's request as comprising a request for enforcement also of the access arrangements ordered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG joined the remitted request and the applicant 's fresh request for enforcement and again heard H in writing . ORG summarised her statement , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant 's ] intention has clearly been to harass [ H ] by requesting the imposition of administrative fines . The imposition of fines would not be in the best interests of the child , since [ H 's ] financial possibility of caring [ for I ] would thereby be significantly jeopardised . The courts ' finding that the biological father 's rights are so strong that they must be given more weight than the experts ' views on the best interests of the child is astonishing . Both the social welfare officers of GPE and child psychiatrist [ V ] have been of the opinion that [ access between I and the applicant ] would not at this stage be in the best interests of the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered H , on pain of an administrative fine of FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL , to comply with the access arrangements ordered on DATE and upheld on DATE . ORG found that H had not put forward any acceptable reason for her refusal to bring I to the meetings fixed for DATE and DATE . Moreover , ORG had not suspended the enforcement of the decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG . Finally , the expert views to which H had referred , allegedly showing that enforcement would not be in the child 's best interests , had already been known to the first - instance court in the civil proceedings regarding access and custody . That material could therefore not be invoked at the enforcement stage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal in the main proceedings concerning custody and access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Chancellor of ORG ( apulaisoikeuskansleri , justitiekanslersadjointen ) found that ORG had not postponed the first set of the main proceedings unnecessarily , given the failure by H to produce the necessary blood samples and ORG requests for opinions from the social authorities .", "CARDINAL . In response to the applicant 's further request for enforcement ORG , on DATE , ordered H to pay the fine of ORG imposed in DATE and directed her to comply with the access arrangements on pain of a further fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . ORG noted that the address of the centre where the meetings were to take place had changed . However , even after H had been informed of the new address ( on DATE ) she had refused to comply with the arrangements . She could also have verified the possible supervision of the meetings by contacting the centre directly .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought fresh proceedings before ORG , seeking to obtain shared custody of I and extended access rights . H objected and sought to have the access rights revoked . She invoked her and her family 's right to respect for their private and family life within the meaning of LAW . She had now told her daughter that , being her biological father , the applicant wished to see her . The daughter , however , had allegedly not been interested in meeting him . H furthermore referred the applicant to her parents ' address in GPE , where he could send presents intended for his daughter without having to know her whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Chief Inspector P .- L.H. of ORG requested the Deputy Senior Physician of ORG to forward copies of the applicant 's patient records . Reference was made to the drafting of the ORG 's opinion to ORG in respect of his application to the Commission . According to P .- L.H. , it had transpired from the documents already obtained that the centre in question was in the possession of records pertaining to the applicant 's mental health which were of major importance to the ORG 's observations to the ORG . The request was based on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( sosiaalihuoltolaki , socialv\u00e5rdslagen , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and LAW , subsection CARDINAL ) , of the DATE LAW ( laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista , lagen om patientens st\u00e4llning och r\u00e4ttigheter , no . DATE ) . Copies of the requested records were subsequently disclosed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE a request for enforcement of access rights was to be lodged with a district court which could also order that a child be escorted to meetings for enforcement purposes . In DATE the applicant requested the GPE ORG to order such enforcement .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE Chief Inspector P .- L.H. forwarded to ORG the request of counsel for H to obtain copies of the applicant 's submissions to the Commission and the ORG 's observations in reply . H had argued that this material would be of relevance both to the enforcement proceedings and the second set of custody and access proceedings which the applicant had just initiated . ORG stated , with reference to the material obtained by ORG , that H would have good reasons to propose that ORG order a fresh conciliation and obtain a new opinion from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed CARDINAL conciliators of ORG of GPE ( GPE , Senior ORG , and ORG , a psychologist of ORG ) and ordered them to submit an opinion by DATE . The conciliators met separately with the parents and , as suggested by H , also planned on interviewing the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE in the first set of enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In their report of CARDINAL DATE the conciliators noted , inter alia , that in spite of her argument that it was important to ascertain the child 's own opinion H had refused to bring the child to a meeting with them . The applicant , for his part , had demonstrated in the course of the conciliation that he could become very aggressive . He had stressed his own intelligence and good health . In his view his current situation was simply a result of the protracted access proceedings . On this point the conciliators noted , however , that already in DATE he had been diagnosed as suffering from a mental disturbance . In his opinion the conciliators were always siding with H and the conciliation was only a means of prolonging the proceedings . He did not trust ORG or the judicial organs . He had threatened court proceedings and publicity . The conciliators continued as follows :", "\u201c It is of course natural that [ the applicant ] is frustrated ... , having tried in vain to meet his child . However , this does not ... explain such a strong aggressive behaviour . [ The applicant 's ] suspicions also showed in that he recorded all telephone conversations and [ our ] meeting . ...", "[ The applicant ] emphasised the child 's right to know who her father is and to meet him . However , the fact that [ H ] has refused to comply with the access arrangements does not change the fact that [ the applicant ] is a complete stranger to the child . [ The applicant 's ] lack of understanding is reflected , for instance , in his refusal to accept that the child could bring along a support person to the meetings , his reason being that he himself has to come to the meetings alone . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The conciliators concluded that it would be in I 's best interests that the meetings with the applicant be organised after the child had been properly prepared for them and would feel calm and safe . Otherwise the child would be under a duty to meet the applicant instead of enjoying a right to this effect .", "CARDINAL . Apart from interviewing the applicant and H the conciliators had also heard one of the previous conciliators as well as Chief Inspector ORG , the mother of H as well as the supervisor at the centre where I 's meetings with the applicant should have taken place . With reference to Chief Inspector P .- L.H. 's opinion that the conditions for the meetings should be revised , the conciliators attached a secret memorandum containing information obtained by ORG which had not been at the courts ' disposal earlier . According to the memorandum , Chief Inspector P - L.H. had obtained , while preparing the ORG 's observations on the application before the Commission , various patient records indicating that the applicant had been suffering from mental problems for DATE . When the conciliators had raised this point with the applicant , he had become very aggressive , contending that he had no such problems . The access dispute had begun to affect his nerves and his doctor had rightly been concerned about that , not about any mental problems . The applicant had again threatened court proceedings and publicity . He had refused even to consider psychiatric care or therapy . His language had been \u201c unbelievably inappropriate \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the applicant , H , CARDINAL witnesses on the applicant 's behalf and conciliator PERSON The applicant contended that he had not behaved violently in DATE . Nor was he in need of therapy , care or medication against his alleged mental problems . The witnesses on his behalf testified along the same lines . Having been unable to interview the child , conciliator PERSON found herself unable to state any view as to whether the meetings would be in the child 's best interest .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE ORG found that the testimonies by the applicant 's witnesses could not refute the medical indications relating to his mental state . Those indications did not , however , show that enforcement of the access arrangements would be contrary to the interests of the child , bearing in mind the limited access and the meeting place . The court was composed of CARDINAL presiding professional judge and CARDINAL lay members .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's request that the child be brought to the meetings . Having regard to the attitude of H , ORG found it most likely , however , that the court - ordered access would not take place despite any changes in the arrangements . The fact that the child had never met the applicant could therefore be seen as a weighty reason for ordering the child to be brought . On the other hand , such a measure could not be the right way for the child to get to know the applicant . Instead the child was to be given a possibility to get to know him gradually in conditions where she would feel that this would happen on a voluntary basis . ORG therefore concluded that there were no weighty reasons militating in favour of escorting the child to meetings and ordered that a professional supervisor as well as H and/or another person close to the child should attend the child 's meetings with the applicant for DATE . The applicant had agreed to those changes . ORG ordered H to comply with the modified arrangements on pain of a further administrative fine , this time automatically staggered in view of the special reasons at hand . The amount of the fine was FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL at the outset , to be increased by ORG for each of the CARDINAL forthcoming meetings between I and the applicant with which H would refuse to comply ( in DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore ordered that the applicant could not bring other persons with him to the meetings . Neither could he record the meetings on audiotape , let alone film and/or photograph the other persons attending the meetings , without their consent . In order to keep I 's whereabouts secret from the applicant , she and the accompanying persons would arrive at the meeting place TIME after the applicant and leave TIME before him .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally waived the administrative fine imposed on H on DATE . It noted that , whereas ORG decision of DATE could have given the impression that the meetings would be supervised , the centre where they were to be organised had informed H that the meetings would not be supervised without an explicit court order to that effect . In these circumstances H had had reason to suspect that enforcement would not be in the child 's best interests . Her refusal to bring I to those meetings had therefore been acceptable .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was upheld by ORG on DATE and leave to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , at a preparatory hearing on DATE the ORG decided to adjourn the second set of the custody and access proceedings pending receipt of fresh opinions from the social welfare boards of GPE and GPE by DATE . It found no reason to amend or revoke the access rights on an interim basis .", "CARDINAL . In its opinion of DATE ORG stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... At [ our ] meeting [ the applicant ] stated that his life situation had improved and that things were going well . He was unwilling to provide any further information to [ the social welfare officers ] , stating that he would inform the court directly of his conditions .", "[ The applicant ] called on DATE to say he was moving away from GPE ... He refused to indicate his new place of residence .", "In the light of the foregoing ORG is unable to put forward a recommendation concerning access , since there is no adequate information as to the conditions of the applicant . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG was granted an extension until DATE for the submission of its opinion . The opinion of that date stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c [ H ] was interviewed at ORG on DATE and briefly on DATE . She cancelled the [ CARDINAL ] appointments reserved for her [ DATE ] ...", "... The child has not been interviewed . [ H ] refused to bring [ I ] to ORG . Nor did she accept that [ social welfare ] officers pay a visit to her home , where the child could have been interviewed in familiar surroundings . [ H ] wishes to keep her family ( her husband and children ) outside the access dispute . ...", "H objects to any meetings between I and [ the applicant ] . In her opinion [ the applicant ] has nothing positive to give to the child . On the contrary , she fears that [ he ] will frighten [ I ] with his uncontrolled behaviour . She considers [ the applicant ] to be mentally unstable and fears physical violence on his part . ...", "H will not permit [ the applicant ] to see [ I ] until [ the child ] is ready for it and expresses a wish to that effect . If the child is ordered to be brought , [ H ] will leave home with the child . ... The child itself should have the right to decide whether or not it wishes to see its father . ...", "... The officers in charge of this investigation have not met with [ the applicant ] . In telephone conversations his behaviour has been inappropriate and threatening towards the officers of ORG . He has behaved in the same manner towards the conciliators of ORG .", "In the course of the investigation a meeting between [ I ] and her father could not be organised . Such a meeting might have produced valuable information with a view to assessing the success of future meetings . ...

In their opinion of DATE ( attached to ORG opinion ) psychiatrists GPE and ORG stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ... We met I together with her mother on DATE and the mother alone on DATE . We offered CARDINAL different appointments to [ the applicant ] but he refused to attend . ...", "We have not met the child separately and have not conducted any psychological examination , considering that this would not shed any further light on the matter .", "The investigation is incomplete , since in respect of the father it was limited to telephone calls and letters received from him . It was not possible to arrange a meeting between the ... father and the daughter or a ... meeting between the mother , the daughter and the father , since the mother did not agree to such a meeting .", "[ The applicant ] could not agree on a date for a meeting . At first he doubted whether he would be able to attend the meetings due to his studies and the long distance [ between GPE and PERSON ] . Later he stated that he would not attend the meetings unless his daughter had been interviewed at [ the ORG ] before him . When we offered ... to meet him after [ I ] 's visit ... , he refused , requiring that we arrange a meeting between him and [ I ] . ... Finally , [ he ] noted that under domestic law it was for the authorities of his place of residence to provide an opinion on his conditions .", "During the telephone conversations [ the applicant ] ... occasionally used inappropriate and aggressive language towards us . It was not possible to have a dialogue with him . [ His behaviour ] did not reflect any real understanding of the world of a DATE girl or of the feelings and reactions which she could be facing if she met him in the current extremely tense conditions .", "... A DATE child 's perception of the world is still [ that it is ] identical to that of its parents ... Accordingly , even if [ H and I 's stepfather ] were to support [ I ] in her meetings with her biological father , [ the ] internal fears and resistance she would sense in her [ de facto ] parents would place her in a situation of anxiety and contradiction .", "Subjecting the child to the very difficult disputes between its biological parents could endanger her normal mental development . ...", "... It would be very important for [ I ] that the legal battle between her biological parents cease . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant moved to PERSON towards DATE . In DATE he brought further enforcement proceedings before ORG , again referring to the exceptional circumstances which in his view required that the child be brought to the meetings . A preparatory hearing was held on DATE , by which time H and I had apparently moved to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again dismissed the applicant 's demand that the child be brought to the meetings . Neither the presiding judge nor any of the CARDINAL lay members had examined the previous enforcement request decided on DATE . ORG had again heard the applicant and H as well as psychiatrist PERSON of ORG and also based itself on ORG opinions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the opinion of ORG of DATE and ORG opinion of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for joint custody , revoked the access arrangements and upheld the secrecy order in respect of the child 's whereabouts . Having heard H orally in the applicant 's absence , ORG had become convinced that her fear of the applicant was genuine and primarily based on his assault and other offences committed in DATE , when H had been pregnant . This fear explained in a plausible manner why she had consistently refused to let I meet the applicant even under supervision . The testimony of witnesses GPE and GPE had further strengthened H 's account of her fears .", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore found it established through the testimony of PERSON that H was considering I 's best interests by keeping the child out of her disputes with the applicant . Above all , H had been physically assaulted by him during her pregnancy . Her fears relating to that incident had not been dispersed despite the passage of time . Those fears would inevitably be passed on to I and any access at her age would produce distress and confusion which could lead to a permanent depression and anxiety . Access without any risks could take place once I was able to form her own opinion , namely at the age of DATE or DATE . When telling I of her biological father , H had also stated that she did not want the child to meet with him , fearing \u201c something bad \u201d could happen . In the opinion of Dr O.H. the child would at any rate have sensed H 's fears intuitively . During the investigation the applicant had cooperated with difficulty and had questioned PERSON competence . According to PERSON , it would have been crucial to the investigation that the applicant be interviewed in the presence of ORG The telephone conversations with him had not clarified his motives for wishing to see his child .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that Dr V 's testimony had been consistent with that of PERSON and found no reason to question PERSON competence in the field . Moreover , ORG hearing of the applicant in person had strengthened the view that he was unable to distinguish between the child 's interests and his own and was perceiving the child 's access right as an obligation .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG ordered that the conciliation report and certain passages of its decision which recounted the contents of that report should be kept confidential for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant argued that since the mother 's fears dated back to his assault in DATE her fears during DATE could only be of an imaginary character , given that the CARDINAL had only met in the court room . By consistently defying the court - ordered access arrangements which had been decided and maintained in the best interests of the child H had eventually managed to have the child 's access rights revoked .
