The applicant , a member of ORG ( ORG ) , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the material time he was stationed at the PERSON headquarters and had been on sick leave since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was informed that CARDINAL of his close relatives had been taken seriously ill . After notifying the duty officers , he set out TIME for his GPE home in GPE ( GPE ) , where he stayed until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE members of ORG called at his GPE home to check that he was there . On DATE a sergeant from the same garrison rang the family home in a further check .", "On DATE the applicant rejoined his unit in Gij\u00f3n .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by a lieutenant - colonel in ORG that disciplinary proceedings had been brought against him for a minor breach of regulations , namely absence from his unit without prior leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s superior imposed a disciplinary penalty on him consisting of CARDINAL days\u2019 house arrest pursuant to sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant applied for a writ of habeas corpus . His application was dismissed by Le\u00f3n military judge no . CARDINAL on DATE . However , the judge stated in his decision that , since the applicant was on sick leave , the restrictions should be relaxed to allow him to leave the house for medical reasons , to purchase necessities and to attend religious services should he wish to do so .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged CARDINAL internal appeals with PERSON headquarters against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . These were dismissed in CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL May and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal with the ORG in which he alleged that he had been wrongly deprived of his liberty and relied , inter alia , on Articles CARDINAL ( right to liberty ) and CARDINAL ( right to a fair trial ) of the LAW . He argued that the decision to place him under house arrest had infringed his right to liberty ( LAW ) as in practice it entailed an actual deprivation of liberty .", "He also complained that the decision to deprive him of his liberty had failed to take into account the rule that penalties should not affect service and gave no indication as to how the sentence was to be served , adding that , as he was on sick leave , he had been forced to stay at home for the duration of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . In his observations , ORG asked for the appeal to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor submitted in his observations that there had been a violation of the right to liberty ( LAW ) on account of the failure to determine the conditions of the applicant \u2019s arrest . In particular , there had been no decision on how the sentence was to be served , how its execution was to be supervised or whether it was reasonable . He asked ORG to find in favour of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE and those of CARDINAL May and DATE . It ruled that it was unnecessary to include the words \u201c without affecting service \u201d in the administrative order depriving the applicant of his liberty as this was inherent in the nature of the penalty for what was only a minor breach of the regulations .", "CARDINAL . Pointing out that , in the light of ORG case - law , house arrest constituted not merely a restriction but an actual deprivation of liberty , ORG noted that by virtue of LAW there could be no deprivation of liberty other than in the circumstances and manner prescribed by law and that the disciplinary regime applied in the applicant \u2019s case was founded on a basic law ( Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) which permitted custodial sentences and designated the authorities empowered to impose such sentences and the procedure to be followed . As the military judge had stated when dismissing the application for a writ of habeas corpus , the applicant had been sentenced by the competent authority within the bounds fixed by law to a penalty prescribed by law in accordance with the established procedure . As to the complaint under LAW , the applicant had received a fair trial attended by all the necessary safeguards .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG of ORG , which dismissed his appeal in a judgment of DATE . It accepted the applicant \u2019s submission that the words \u201c without affecting service \u201d were required in all orders for house arrest for minor breaches of the regulations so as to avoid restrictions of liberty becoming deprivations of liberty . However , it considered that the additional words had not been necessary in the applicant \u2019s case as he was on sick leave .", "ORG noted that ORG had already considered the question of \u201c house arrest \u201d and ruled that it constituted an actual deprivation , not merely a restriction , of liberty , although that legal distinction had no bearing on the legitimacy of house arrest because , by virtue of LAW , military authorities , unlike their civilian counterparts , were empowered to impose penalties entailing deprivation of liberty . ORG consequently concluded that there had been no violation of LAW .", "With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW of a serious procedural defect due to a failure to give reasons for the decisions , ORG found that the impugned judicial decision contained sufficient reasons and was not arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then lodged an amparo appeal with ORG on the basis of LAW ( right to liberty ) and LAW . In a decision of DATE , which was served on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal for want of a constitutional basis , finding that the impugned decisions contained sufficient reasons and were not arbitrary . It stated :", "\u201c The appellant \u2019s amparo complaints DATE that house arrest violated his right to liberty ( LAW ) as it is not a prescribed penalty for members of ORG such as the appellant who are members of the security , not the armed , forces and that the procedure for imposing such a deprivation of liberty was not complied with \u2013 are manifestly ill - founded . The penalty for minor breaches of the regulations is laid down in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and was imposed in accordance with the statutory procedure , which is different from the procedure applicable to confinement in a disciplinary institution . Accordingly , neither the decisions imposing the penalty nor the military courts , which found that the penalty was in accordance with the law , have been guilty of any constitutional violation of the ordinary law .", "The same applies to the allegations by the applicant of a violation of LAW . He maintained that the NORP ORG \u2019s reservation in respect of that provision can not be applied to him as a member of the security forces because Basic Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL defines the disciplinary regime applicable to ORG as being that of an armed military establishment ( section CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to liberty and security . No one may be deprived of his or her liberty other than in accordance with the provisions of this LAW and in the circumstances and manner provided by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The Code of Military Justice was repealed and replaced by Basic Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on the disciplinary regime of the armed forces , which came into force on DATE and applies to both ORG and the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . When that change was made , ORG at ORG declared on CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c At the time of deposit of the instrument of ratification of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , on DATE , GPE formulated a reservation to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL to the extent to which those ORG might be incompatible with the provisions of LAW and LAW \u2013 concerning the disciplinary regime of the armed forces .", "I have the honour to inform you , for communication to the Parties to the LAW , that these provisions have been replaced by LAW no .

DATE of CARDINAL DATE on the disciplinary regime of ORG was passed \u201c to fulfil the legislative commitments and constitutional requirements adequately and without delay in order to ensure the proper functioning of ORG in the service of society \u201d ( explanatory note ) .", "The explanatory note to Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL also states :", "\u201c ... owing to the nature of ORG , an armed military institution , and therefore to the need for it to have its own disciplinary regime distinct from that of other ORG security forces , the application of the armed GPE regime to ORG must , as ORG indicated in its judgment of DATE , be regarded as a purely temporary arrangement .", "ORG stated that this situation , which is permissible for a transitional period , can not continue permanently with ORG being bound by the rules applicable to the armed forces until specific rules or arrangements are put in place . In the same judgment , ORG indicated that the establishment of disciplinary rules specific to ORG must be a priority objective that can not remain in abeyance indefinitely and that it is for the legislature ... to clarify the imprecision in the legislation concerning the disciplinary regime of ORG ... \u201d", "The relevant provisions of Law no .
