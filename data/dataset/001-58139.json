In the evidence he gave for the purposes of the prosecution against the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , airman PERSON said that he was transferred to the ORG unit in DATE , DATE after joining the air force , and was placed under the command of the second applicant in the teletyping service . On CARDINAL occasions the first and second applicants engaged him in religious discussions , reading aloud extracts from the Bible and encouraging him to accept the beliefs of ORG . The second applicant told him that some members of the sect were able to speak in foreign languages with the assistance of divine power . Whenever airman PERSON returned from leave , the second applicant asked him if he had visited ORG . The former testified that he felt obliged to take part in these discussions because the applicants were his superior officers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his statement before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , airman PERSON testified that he served in the ORG unit DATE and DATE , although he was not under the direct command of any of them .

The third applicant repeatedly asked him to visit ORG in PERSON while he was on leave , telling him that miracles took place there including the acquisition by believers of the ability to speak in foreign languages , and gave him the NORP newspaper ORG to read . The applicants were very good officers and were always polite to him , but their approaches bothered him nonetheless .", "CARDINAL . Airman PERSON was unable to give evidence at the first- instance hearing because his wife was ill , but he told ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that he had served in the same unit as the applicants , under the command of the third applicant , DATE and DATE . The applicants did not put any pressure on him to become a member of ORG . He himself approached the third applicant and asked why he was so peaceful , to which the latter replied that this was the result of reading the Gospel . When , at the suggestion of the first and third applicants , he started to read the Bible , he noticed a number of points of divergence between it and the teachings of ORG . He did not have any discussions with the applicants concerning the NORP and ORG , although he did seek their advice whenever he had any questions concerning the Bible and always found their replies convincing .

He told his father that he had met CARDINAL officers who were real NORP , unlike his father . When his parents followed him on CARDINAL of his visits to ORG , he left home and went to live in GPE .

The case - law which had grown out of section CARDINAL ( see the examples set out in the ORG \u2019s ORG v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p.

Bearing in mind that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which , to a greater or lesser extent , are vague ( ibid . , p.

CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s task is to determine whether the measures taken against the applicants were justified in principle and proportionate . In order to do this , it must weigh the requirements of the protection of the rights and liberties of others against the conduct of the applicants ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Since different factors come into the balance in relation to the proselytising of the airmen and that of the civilians , it will assess the CARDINAL matters separately .", "CARDINAL .

The measures taken against them were justified by the need to protect the prestige and effective operation of the armed forces and to protect individual soldiers from ideological coercion .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that the practice of evangelism within a superior / subordinate relationship could not without more be equated to an abuse of trust . They emphasised that the airmen were adults , able to die for their country , and that there was no evidence that the applicants had used their positions to coerce or override the wills of their subordinates . To interpret LAW so as to restrict evangelism to \u201c equals \u201d would be a severe limitation of religious freedom , both within the armed forces and in other contexts .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the interference could be justified as ensuring that the CARDINAL airmen \u2019s religious beliefs were respected , in view in particular of the special character of the relationship between a superior and a subordinate in the armed forces , which rendered the subordinate more susceptible to influence in a variety of matters including religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that it is well established that the Convention applies in principle to members of the armed forces as well as to civilians . Nevertheless , when interpreting and applying its rules in cases such as the present , it is necessary to bear in mind the particular characteristics of military life and its effects on the situation of individual members of the armed forces ( see the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and , mutatis mutandis , the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VII , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In this respect , the ORG notes that the hierarchical structures which are a feature of life in the armed forces may colour every aspect of the relations between military personnel , making it difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of an individual of superior rank or to withdraw from a conversation initiated by him . Thus , what would in the civilian world be seen as an innocuous exchange of ideas which the recipient is free to accept or reject , may , within the confines of military life , be viewed as a form of harassment or the application of undue pressure in abuse of power . It must be emphasised that not every discussion about religion or other sensitive matters between individuals of unequal rank will fall within this category . Nonetheless , where the circumstances so require , GPE may be justified in taking special measures to protect the rights and freedoms of subordinate members of the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . The ORG refers to the evidence adduced in the domestic proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "It notes that airmen PERSON and NORP testified that the applicants approached them on a number of occasions in order to persuade them to convert and to visit ORG . Mr PERSON stated that he felt obliged to take part in the discussions because the applicants were his superior officers , and PERSON ORG said that the applicants\u2019 approaches bothered him . As the Commission found , there is no evidence that the applicants used threats or inducements . Nonetheless , it appears that they were persistent in their advances and that these CARDINAL airmen felt themselves constrained and subject to a certain degree of pressure owing to the applicants\u2019 status as officers , even if this pressure was not consciously applied .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that , contrary to the evidence given by his father at first instance , airman PERSON testified before ORG that the applicants did not apply any pressure to him to become a member of ORG and that he himself initiated the religious discussions that took place between them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , ORG , having had the opportunity to assess the evidence , including Mr PERSON \u2019s demeanour and credibility , upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision that the first and third applicants had unlawfully taken advantage of the influence they had over PERSON PERSON due to their position and rank ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL above ) . The ORG , considering that the domestic courts were better placed than itself to determine the facts of the case , and taking into account the matters referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above , is of the view that Mr PERSON , like the other CARDINAL airmen , must have felt to a certain extent constrained , perhaps obliged to enter into religious discussions with the applicants , and possibly even to convert to the NORP faith .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . It follows that there has been no violation of LAW with regard to the measures taken against the first applicant for the proselytising of airmen PERSON , NORP and PERSON , those taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of airman PERSON or those taken against the third applicant for the proselytising of airmen NORP and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government reminded the ORG that under section CARDINAL , only improper proselytism is punishable . They contended that the second and third applicants had systematically exploited the family problems and psychological distress suffered by the Ba\u00eframis family and PERSON and had thus applied unlawful pressure . Furthermore , the penalties imposed on them were not particularly onerous .", "CARDINAL . The Commission , with whom the applicants agreed , considered that the circumstances leading to the conviction of the second and third applicants for proselytising the Ba\u00eframis family and PERSON were similar to those of the ORG case ( cited at paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in that the \u201c targets \u201d of the proselytism were not military personnel and the domestic courts established the defendants\u2019 guilt by reciting the words of section CARDINAL without adequately explaining in what way the methods employed by the accused had been \u201c improper \u201d . It had not been satisfactorily demonstrated that their convictions on these counts were \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that the second applicant was convicted under section CARDINAL for preaching on a single occasion to the Ba\u00eframis family and their neighbours , following an incident when he had managed to calm a member of the Ba\u00eframis family who was in a delirious state . Together with the third applicant , he was also convicted for the proselytising of PERSON , whom they had attempted to convert on a number of occasions during a period when she was experiencing marital problems ( see paragraphs DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds it of decisive significance that the civilians whom the applicants attempted to convert were not subject to pressures and constraints of the same kind as the airmen .", "With regard to the Ba\u00eframis family and their neighbours , none of the evidence indicates that they felt obliged to listen to the applicant or that his behaviour towards them was improper in any way .", "As for PERSON , it was not disputed before the domestic courts that she initially sought out the applicants in an attempt to understand the reasons behind her husband \u2019s behaviour . Whilst it is clear that during the period she was in contact with them she was in a state of distress brought on by the breakdown of her marriage , the ORG does not find it established that her mental condition was such that she was in need of any special protection from the evangelical activities of the applicants or that they applied improper pressure to her , as was demonstrated by the fact that she was able eventually to take the decision to sever all links with ORG .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . It follows that there has been a violation of LAW with regard to the measures taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of the Ba\u00eframis family and their neighbours and those taken against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that the measures taken against them had also interfered with their rights to freedom of expression , in breach of LAW , which states , as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone has the right to freedom of expression . This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority \u2026", "CARDINAL . The exercise of these freedoms , since it carries with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a NORP society , in the interests of national security , territorial integrity or public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence , or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Commission , with whom the ORG agreed , found that no separate issue arose under this provision .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to its scrutiny of this case in the context of LAW , the ORG also agrees that no separate issue arises in relation to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that they had been the victims of discrimination contrary to LAW , which provides :", "\u201c The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [ the ] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status . \u201d", "They contended that the law against proselytism was applied only to members of religious minorities in GPE , no follower of the ORG ever having been convicted of the offence under section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Government made no particular submission in relation to this complaint .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that no separate issue arose under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL taken together in relation to the measures directed against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of the civilians . As far as the measures taken against the applicants for the proselytising of the airmen were concerned , since no material was provided to substantiate the complaint under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , it reached a finding of no violation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicants alleged in their memorial that the NORP law against proselytism was applied in a discriminatory manner . However , they have not produced any evidence to suggest that an officer in the armed forces who attempted to convert his subordinates to ORG in a manner similar to that adopted by the applicants would have been treated any differently . It follows that no violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL taken together has been established in connection with the proselytising of the airmen .", "CARDINAL . Having found a violation of LAW with regard to the measures taken against the second and third applicants for the proselytising of the Ba\u00eframis family and PERSON , the ORG considers that no separate issue arises in that connection under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL taken together .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested just satisfaction under LAW , which provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention , and if the internal law of the said ORG allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure , the decision of the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought MONEY ( GRD ) each to compensate them for moral and material prejudice . This was the amount that the ORG had awarded to Mr ORG in DATE ( op . cit . , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before the ORG , the ORG submitted that , in the event of the ORG finding a violation , such finding would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . On the same occasion , the ORG \u2019s ORG commented that the fact that the domestic courts had not sought to take the ORG \u2019s case - law into account was a particular element to be taken into consideration under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that it has found violations of the LAW in respect only of the measures taken against the second applicant for the proselytising of the Ba\u00eframis family and the second and third applicants for the proselytising of PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) . The first applicant is not , therefore , entitled to any just satisfaction under LAW .", "Making its assessment on an equitable basis , it awards LAW each to Mr Mandalarides and Mr Sarandis .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also requested QUANTITY ( GBP ) to cover the legal costs and expenses of the proceedings before ORG in GPE .", "DATE . The Government considered the amount claimed to be excessive and submitted that the sum awarded should not exceed GRD CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG again notes in this context that it does not find any violation of the LAW in respect of the first applicant and that it finds in favour of the second and third applicants in connection with CARDINAL part of their complaints , namely in relation to the measures taken against them for the proselytising of civilians .", "In the light of the above , it awards to the second and third applicants part of the costs and expenses claimed , in total GBP CARDINAL , together with any value - added tax which may be payable , less the amount received by way of legal aid from ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the information available to the ORG , the relevant statutory rates of interest applicable at the date of adoption of the present judgment are PERCENT per annum in GPE and PERCENT per annum in GPE .", "Done in LANGUAGE and in LANGUAGE , and delivered at a public hearing in FAC , GPE , on DATE .", "Signed : PERSON", "President", "Signed : PERSON", "Registrar", "In accordance with LAW , the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment :", "PERSON : PERSON", "PERSON : PERSON"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "7", "9"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
