The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant gave birth to her first child in hospital in DATE without any complications . According to her , during the birth the medical personnel present were urging her to agree to undergo various kinds of medical intervention even though she had expressly stated her wish not to be subjected to any unnecessary medical treatment . She was also forced to give birth in a position she did not wish . She wanted to leave the hospital TIME after the birth as both she and the baby were healthy , but a doctor ordered her to stay in the hospital . She therefore did not leave until DATE , when she presented a letter from her paediatrician , who confirmed that she would take the child into her care .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant became pregnant for the second time with an expected delivery date in DATE . The pregnancy was free from complications and the medical examinations and tests did not indicate any problems . Since she considered that giving birth in a hospital had been stressful for her , the applicant decided to give birth at home and searched for a midwife to assist at the birth . However , she was unable to find any midwife who was willing to assist her with a home birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she wrote to her health - insurance company and to ORG ( krajsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad ) asking for help in finding a midwife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the health - insurance company replied that NORP legislation did not provide for the possibility that a public health - insurance company might cover costs arising from home births and that it therefore had no contracts with any health professionals providing such services . Moreover , prevailing expert medical opinion did not approve of home births .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG added that the midwives listed in its register of health professionals were , in any event , only allowed by law to attend births at LOC possessing the technical equipment required by Decree no . CARDINAL and not in a private home .", "CARDINAL . Not having found any health professional to assist her , the applicant gave birth to her son alone at home on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she lodged a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) claiming that she had been denied the possibility of giving birth at home with the assistance of a health professional , in violation of her right to respect for her private life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal , holding that it would be contrary to the principle of subsidiarity for it to decide on the merits of the case because the applicant had not exhausted all the available remedies , which included an action for protection of personal rights under LAW and an application for judicial review under LAW of LAW . It nevertheless expressed its doubts as to the compliance of the NORP legislation with LAW and asked the relevant parties to initiate a serious and well - informed debate about new legislation . CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL judges attached to the decision their separate opinions , in which they disagreed with the reasoning behind it . Most of them considered that ORG should have dismissed the appeal as an actio popularis and should have refrained from expressing any views on the constitutionality of the legislation concerning home births .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is the mother of CARDINAL children who were born at home in DATE and DATE with the assistance of a midwife . The midwives attended the births without any authorisation from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , before deciding to give birth at home , she had visited several hospitals which had all refused her requests to deliver the baby without any medical intervention that was not strictly required by the situation . They had also refused to agree to her wish for uninterrupted contact with the baby from the moment of birth , as the regular practice was to take the child away from the mother immediately after the birth to be weighed and measured and for further medical observation lasting for TIME .", "CARDINAL . At the time of lodging the present application , the applicant was pregnant again , with an expected delivery in DATE . The pregnancy was free from complications and she again wished to give birth at home with the assistance of a midwife . However , she was unable to find a willing midwife because of the risk of a heavy fine if medical services were provided without authorisation . The applicant asked various authorities to help find a solution to her situation .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG replied that it did not provide medical services to individual patients and that the applicant should make enquiries with GPE ( M\u011bsto Praha ) which , acting as a regional office , registered and issued authorisations to health professionals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s health - insurance company informed her that the attendance of a health professional at a home birth was not covered by public insurance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE informed the applicant that no midwife registered in GPE was authorised to assist with home births .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to a child in a maternity hospital in GPE , QUANTITY away from GPE . She had chosen that hospital because of its reputation for respecting the wishes of mothers during delivery . Nevertheless , according to her , not all her wishes had been respected . Despite the fact that both she and the child had been healthy and that no complications had occurred during the birth , the applicant had had to stay in the hospital for TIME . The newborn baby had been separated from her after the birth and before leaving the maternity hospital the remains of the child \u2019s umbilical cord had been cut off despite her wishes to the contrary .", "CARDINAL . In its bulletin no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ORG published a practice guideline which stated :", "\u201c Conducting a delivery in GPE is regarded as a healthcare provision that is provided only in a healthcare institution . Each healthcare institution must fulfil the statutory requirements ... and the requirements laid down by the relevant secondary legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u010cesk\u00e1 l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 komora ) considers a home birth to be a procedure non lege artis because of the dangers associated therewith .", "CARDINAL . Almost all births in GPE currently take place in hospital , with PERCENT of births happening at home .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaction to what has been perceived as an attempt to criminalise midwifery in some central and eastern NORP countries \u2013 in particular in GPE \u2013 the President of ORG and the President of ORG and ORG issued a joint statement on DATE in which they declared : \u201c There is strong evidence that out of hospital birth supported by a registered midwife is safe , and a preferred experience for many mothers . Women should not be denied this choice because of the lack of an adequate regulatory framework that makes it possible for midwives to practice their profession in any place that women choose to give birth . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set up an expert committee on obstetrics with the objective of studying the issue of home births . There were representatives of care recipients , midwives , physicians\u2019 associations , ORG , the ORG \u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights and public health - insurance companies . The representatives of the physicians\u2019 associations boycotted the meetings , declaring that the current state of affairs was satisfactory and that , in their view , there was no need to change anything . Subsequently , ORG removed the representatives of care recipients , midwives and the ORG \u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights , with the argument that only by changing the committee \u2019s composition in this way would it be possible for it to agree on certain conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Rada vl\u00e1dy pro rovn\u00e9 p\u0159\u00edle\u017eitosti \u017een a mu\u017e\u016f ) , an advisory body to the Government , recommended the prevention of further discrimination against women in the enjoyment of their right to a free choice of the method and circumstances of giving birth and the place of delivery . It also recommended the prevention of discrimination against midwives by permitting them to practise their profession in full through their inclusion in the public health - insurance system . The ORG also referred to the recommendations of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which monitors implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , to support its position that women should have a choice of where to give birth .", "CARDINAL . In its bulletin no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL published on DATE , which replaced the previous practice guideline of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG described the procedure for providers of healthcare services when discharging newborns into their own social environment . It stated that the recommendation of specialists was that a newborn should be discharged from the maternity hospital no sooner than TIME after birth . The new procedure allows for the discharge of the newborn from the maternity hospital QUANTITY after the birth at the request of the newborn \u2019s legal representative , provided that the latter :", "\u201c ( a ) has submitted a written withdrawal of his or her agreement to the provision of medical services to the newborn , or a written statement declaring his or her disagreement with the provision of the medical services , or alternatively such agreement or disagreement has been entered in the newborn \u2019s medical documentation ... ;", "( b ) has been demonstrably and duly informed about the possible consequences following the discharge of the newborn before TIME have elapsed since the birth ... ;", "( c ) has been duly informed DATE in the interests of the subsequent healthy development of the newborn \u2013 the NORP specialist medical associations recommend :", "CARDINAL . that a clinical examination be conducted within TIME of the discharge of the newborn ... ;", "CARDINAL . that a blood sample be taken within QUANTITY to TIME following the birth for the purposes of screening for hereditary metabolic malfunctions ... \u201d", "In the event that the newborn is hospitalised without the agreement of the legal representative in order to be given medical treatment necessary to save the child \u2019s life or to prevent serious damage to the child \u2019s health , the hospital should proceed in accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL ) . This practice guideline came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to estimated data provided by ORG in a DATE report , GPE was among the countries with the lowest perinatal mortality rate , which is defined as the number of stillbirths and deaths in DATE of life . The rate for GPE was PERCENT . In other NORP countries the figures ranged from PERCENT in GPE and GPE to PERCENT in GPE . In most NORP countries the figures were PERCENT . According to the report , perinatal mortality is an important indicator of maternal care and maternal health and nutrition ; it also reflects the quality of available obstetric and paediatric care , comparing different countries . The report recommended that , if possible , all foetuses and infants weighing CARDINAL g at birth , whether alive or dead , should be included in the statistics . The reported data regarding stillbirths were not adjusted to this effect in the study .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG on the health and care of pregnant women and babies in LOC in DATE , issued in DATE within the framework of the activities of LAW , GPE was amongst the countries with the lowest mortality rate amongst newborns in the first DATE of their life . The rate was PERCENT . The data for other included countries , mostly ORG ( GPE ) member GPE , ranged from PERCENT for GPE to PERCENT for GPE . However , if only statistics relating to babies born after DATE of pregnancy were taken into account , GPE , with a rate of PERCENT , moved closer to the average of PERCENT . The report noted that the wide variation in gestational age - specific neonatal mortality rates at CARDINAL to DATE suggested that not all births and deaths very early in the neonatal period were systematically included . Consequently , the report considered the data including only babies born after DATE of gestation more reliable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants pointed out that the above sets of data were not easily comparable across countries owing to the different definitions used . The majority of NORP countries set a weight limit of CARDINAL g for counting live births and stillborn children . In GPE , however , the practice until DATE had been that a birth was registered for statistical purposes only if the child weighed CARDINAL g.", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that NORP maternity hospitals offered highquality services during delivery that fully respected the rights and wishes of mothers . For their part , the applicants submitted testimonies from numerous mothers who had given birth in maternity hospitals during DATE and who pointed to practices that were DATE in their view \u2013 unacceptable , including the following : medical intervention during delivery without the consent of the mothers and sometimes against their explicitly expressed will , such as artificial rupture of membranes ; episiotomy ; intravenous infusion of medication for the mother ; performing the PERSON manoeuvre ( pushing with the fist or forearm the top of the uterus coinciding with a contraction and pushing by the mother during the second stage of labour ) ; performing Caesarean section without sufficient medical justification ; using techniques and medication to speed up the delivery ; separation of mothers from their babies for TIME after delivery , ignoring the mother \u2019s wishes to have immediate contact with the baby after delivery ; routinely placing healthy babies in incubators ; administering treatment to babies against the express wishes of the mother ; and forcing the mother and baby to stay in hospital for TIME after delivery even when they were both healthy . There had also been complaints of arrogant , intimidating , disrespectful and patronising behaviour on the part of the hospital staff and of a lack of privacy .", "CARDINAL . It appears that no midwife has been prosecuted in GPE for attending home births per se . Several of them have been prosecuted for alleged malpractice in connection with a delivery at home , however . The applicants referred to the cases of PERSON and PERSON , who are both well - known promoters of natural deliveries without any unnecessary medical intervention and who used to regularly conduct home deliveries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE CARDINAL ORG ( obvodn\u00ed soud ) found PERSON guilty of negligently causing the death of a baby who was stillborn . She was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE , and prohibited from practising the occupation of midwife for DATE . The culpability of PERSON was based on the fact that she had not strongly advised the mother to contact a medical facility when consulted by telephone during a labour that was already ongoing at home . She had thus given flawed advice to the mother - to - be without actually examining her . The conviction was upheld on appeal on CARDINAL DATE , although the sentence was changed to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE , and CARDINAL years\u2019 prohibition on practising as a midwife . An appeal on points of law is pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prague CARDINAL ORG found PERSON guilty of negligently causing bodily harm to a baby whose home birth she had attended and who had stopped breathing during the delivery . The baby died DATE . She was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE , prohibited from practising as a midwife for DATE , and ordered to pay CARDINAL NORP korunas ( CZK ) ( equivalent to MONEY ( EUR ) ) by way of reimbursement of the costs incurred by the insurance company in treating the child until the latter \u2019s death . According to the court , the malpractice on the part of PERSON consisted in the fact that she had not followed the standard procedures for deliveries as laid down by ORG ( \u010cesk\u00e1 l\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e1 komora ) and her conduct had thus been \u201c non lege artis \u201d . The criminal complaint was not lodged by the parents but by a hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed all the judgments in the case against PERSON on account of a violation of her right to a fair trial . It considered the conclusions of the ordinary courts as to PERSON guilt to have been too subjective and not supported by the evidence beyond any reasonable doubt , thereby violating the principle of the presumption of innocence . It stated in particular that the courts had uncritically relied on an expert opinion which they had failed to subject to thorough scrutiny . It held that DATE on the basis of the expert opinion \u2013 the courts had applied very strict liability to the conduct of PERSON in a situation where it had not been clear how she could have prevented the baby \u2019s death . Moreover , it had been established that she had tried to help the baby and had called an ambulance immediately after establishing that the baby had hypoxia . To foresee every possible complication during delivery and be able to react to it immediately , as was required of PERSON , would ultimately lead de facto to an absolute prohibition of home births . In that context ORG noted :", "\u201c ... a modern democratic ORG founded on the rule of law is based on the protection of individual and inalienable freedoms , the delimitation of which closely relates to human dignity . That freedom , which includes freedom in personal activities , is accompanied by a certain degree of acceptable risk . The right of parents to a free choice of the place and mode of delivery is limited only by the interest in the safe delivery and health of the child ; that interest can not , however , be interpreted as an unambiguous preference for deliveries in hospital . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
