De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were charged in DATE and DATE respectively of committing theft by cutting down and taking trees from a forest belonging to another person and appropriating the wood . They were tried by a professional judge , PERSON , sitting as a single judge .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant stated in his defence in the proceedings against him that he had cut down trees which had been marked for cutting or had been attacked by bark beetle in his own forest . In the course of the proceedings against the first applicant Judge PERSON examined a number of witnesses during the main hearing , inspected the place of the alleged offence and examined a number of other documents , including a sketch and a copy of the land register map . None of the witnesses testified that they had seen the first applicant cutting down trees on the injured party \u2019s plot of land . However , they testified about a number of other circumstances in relation to the charges , for example similarities in the way the trees had been cut down on the first applicant \u2019s land and on that of the injured party , traces of the transport of trees , the fact that the first applicant had regularly sold wood and that he had also cut down unmarked trees on his own land . CARDINAL of the witnesses also testified that he had seen the first applicant and another person , GPE , transporting trees over the injured party \u2019s land . Another witness , the injured party \u2019s husband , testified that PERSON had indirectly confirmed his involvement in cutting down the trees in question . PERSON , however , stated that he believed that he had only cut down marked trees on the first applicant \u2019s land . The court also appointed an expert , who estimated that the value of the allegedly stolen wood amounted to QUANTITY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of theft . In the course of the proceedings against him , Judge PERSON heard a number of witnesses at the main hearing and examined several documents , including copies of the relevant land register maps . In respect of the first charge , the second applicant maintained that he had mistakenly thought that he had been cutting down trees on his own land , whose borders had been shown to him by the former owners , GPE and GPE , who also appeared as witnesses in the proceedings . The husband of the injured party , GPE , stated that they had found out about the stolen wood DATE after the event and that neighbours had told them that the second applicant had been seen in the forest at the time , while another person , GPE , had been seen transporting the wood . He also testified that the second applicant had admitted to him that he had cut down the trees , thinking that they had belonged to his land but that they had failed to agree on how much the second applicant should pay ORG in compensation . ORG stated that he had helped the second applicant transport the wood and that he had been told by him that the land belonged to him , which ORG had found suspicious . Another witness , PERSON , stated that he had helped GPE load the truck with the wood . As to the second charge , the second applicant argued that he had had an agreement with the injured party in that case , ORG , that he could cut down trees in exchange for wine . The judge questioned the injured party , who denied the existence of such an agreement . The court also appointed an expert , who estimated that the value of the beech and hornbeam trees cut down amounted to ORG CARDINAL and that of the acacia trees at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON found the first applicant guilty of taking another \u2019s movable property with the intention of unlawfully appropriating it , and sentenced him to DATE in prison , suspended for DATE . The judge found that the applicant had cut down and taken CARDINAL oak trees in a forest without the knowledge of its owner and had appropriated wood worth EUR CARDINAL . She ordered him to either deliver to the injured party the same quantity of oak that had been taken from the forest or to pay compensation of ORG CARDINAL . She pronounced a guilty verdict and sentenced him ( izrek , hereinafter referred to as \u201c the verdict \u201d ) orally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON , again giving an oral verdict , found the second applicant guilty of taking another \u2019s movable property with the intention of unlawfully appropriating it and sentenced him to DATE in prison , suspended for DATE . She found that the second applicant had cut down and taken CARDINAL beech trees and QUANTITY hornbeams worth at least EUR CARDINAL and CARDINAL acacia trees worth at least EUR CARDINAL from land belonging to other persons . Moreover , the second applicant was ordered to pay compensation of ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively to the CARDINAL injured parties .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that Judge PERSON , when pronouncing the verdict , had also given an oral summary of the main reasons ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , however , no indication of that can be found in the records of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . After hearing the verdict both applicants gave notice of their intention to appeal , which gave rise to an obligation on the part of Judge PERSON to draw up written grounds for her verdicts ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON later retired on an unspecified date and the case files in both applicants\u2019 cases got lost . In DATE , the local court reconstituted the files .", "CARDINAL . Based on the documents contained in the restored case file , Judge PERSON delivered written grounds for the verdict pronounced by Judge PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which were served on the first applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE . In her reasoning , the judge relied on the records of the hearings , the transcript of the inspection of the location and other documents in the file . The judge did not believe the applicant \u2019s version of events and dismissed PERSON \u2019s statements as biased because he had been working for the first applicant . She also found his testimony to be in contradiction with some of the other witness statements . The court relied heavily on the finding that while PERSON had cut down the trees professionally on the applicant \u2019s land , witness testimony showed that certain trees had been cut down in an unprofessional manner on both the applicant \u2019s and the injured party \u2019s land , and that the first applicant and GPE had been seen transporting trees over the injured party \u2019s land .", "CARDINAL . The written grounds in the second applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were delivered by Judge PERSON , who also based them on the documents contained in the restored case file . They were served on his counsel on CARDINAL DATE . As to the first charge , the judge found that the second applicant \u2019s defence had not been convincing . In particular , the judge considered the statements of CARDINAL witnesses , GPE and GPE , to be unpersuasive . On the other hand , the judge relied on the statements of the injured party and her husband , supported by other evidence , for example , the expert \u2019s opinion , the statements of the witnesses PERSON and I.T and the copy of the land register map showing that GPE \u2019s land did not border on the second applicant \u2019s . As to the second charge , the court relied predominantly on the statement of the injured party , ORG , who denied that he had had an agreement with the second applicant . Other evidence , such as the expert \u2019s opinion and photographs , confirmed that ORG was indeed the owner of the land and indicated the number of trees that had been cut down .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants appealed against the judgments , raising similar arguments as those submitted to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They further alleged that the judgments should have been set aside and remitted to the first - instance court for fresh consideration . Furthermore , both applicants also appealed against the factual findings on which their convictions had been based , including the assessment of the credibility of a number of witnesses . The second applicant also complained about the assessment of the existence of intent on his part to commit the second count of theft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , ORG dismissed the ORG appeals , holding that the fact that the written grounds of the impugned judgments had been given DATE after they had been delivered orally had not rendered the judgments unlawful . The higher court emphasised that the impugned judgments had been based on facts established in adversarial proceedings and on evidence given at hearings which the applicants had been able to challenge by presenting their own versions of the events at issue . The first - instance judgments had been given orally by Judge PERSON who had presided over both PERSON hearings , had questioned the applicants and heard the witnesses . Moreover , the written grounds had disclosed on what evidence the judges providing them had relied and how they had assessed the reliability of the ORG statements . In the higher court \u2019s opinion , the written grounds had been clear and reasonable . As regards the first applicant , the higher court reassessed the evidence , including the witness statements , and came to the same conclusion as the first - instance court . As to the second applicant , the higher court noted that the first - instance court had truthfully and accurately established all the relevant facts of the case , and that it had been proven that the second applicant had intended to commit the second offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the applicants lodged applications for the protection of legality ( zahteva za varstvo zakonitosti ) with ORG , raising similar arguments as those submitted to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and referring to ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 applications for the protection of legality , holding that only the operative part of the judgment , namely the verdict , could have interfered with the rights of the parties , while the purpose of written grounds was to enable a decision to be reviewed by higher instances . As a rule , the written grounds of a judgment were given by the judge who had conducted the trial and pronounced the verdict . However , in certain situations , such as when a judge was absent for a long time or died , the law had to be interpreted as permitting another judge to give the written grounds . In such cases , the judge who wrote the judgment based it on logical reasoning and the evidence in the file . ORG found that while the principle of immediacy required that a verdict should be given by the judge who had participated in the trial , the act of writing a judgment , was not , strictly speaking , part of the trial . Moreover , if the written grounds for a judgment were not convincing , a defendant had a better chance of succeeding with his or her appeal . Having regard to those considerations , ORG took the view that the applicants\u2019 rights of defence had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the applicants lodged constitutional complaints , reiterating the arguments they had made before the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints , holding that their cases concerned neither a violation of human rights having serious consequences for them nor an important constitutional question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
