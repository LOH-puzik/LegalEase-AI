The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , Director of ORG of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and ORG , his wife , jointly owned an apartment which was registered in the wife \u2019s name . On DATE PERSON concluded a pledge agreement in favour of an insurance company , AS PERSON , by which her sister \u2019s loan of CARDINAL NORP kroons ( EEK ) ( QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) was secured by the apartment . According to the pledge agreement GPE confirmed that she was single and that no third parties had claims to the apartment . The agreement was drafted by a notary in LANGUAGE . It was confirmed in the agreement that its text had been translated by the notary from NORP into LANGUAGE prior to it being signed by the parties . It was also confirmed that the text of the agreement had been read to the parties and that it had complied with their will .", "According to the applicant , the content of the agreement had not been translated for ORG who was of NORP origin and did not understand NORP . The notary had only shown her the space for her signature . It had not been explained to her that without her husband \u2019s consent she was not entitled to conclude the pledge agreement .", "As GPE , GPE \u2019s sister , failed to repay the loan , an insurance company ORG , the legal successor of AS PERSON , lodged an action against her and ORG According to the company , the debt was EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) by that time , consisting of the original loan , interest and default interest . The insurance company \u2019s claim lodged with ORG ( PERSON ) was for EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The defendants , GPE and GPE did not appear before the court although they had received the summonses . By a default judgment of DATE ORG upheld the claim against GPE and decided that if she failed to pay the debt , GPE \u2019s apartment would have to be sold at a public auction .", "On DATE PERSON lodged a petition with ORG to set aside the default judgment , as she had been sick at the time of the hearing . On DATE she informed the court that she recognised the claim and agreed to pay the debt . She explained that together with her sister , GPE , she had pledged the apartment . The money received for that had been invested in [ an investment company ] ORG . They had been paid interest for DATE ; thereafter , the investment company had gone bankrupt . PERSON requested that she be given a possibility to repay the debt in several instalments and that the pledged apartment not be sold .", "ORG did not respond to the claim .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing . The defendants failed to appear , although they had received summonses . PERSON had asked the court to hear the case in DATE or DATE , as she had taken up employment on a ship and could thus pay the debt in the future . The court had not been informed of the cause of GPE \u2019s failure to appear .", "On the plaintiff \u2019s request , the court made a default judgment on DATE . It upheld the claim and ordered the sale of the apartment at a public auction .", "On DATE the applicant accepted the delivery of the judgments addressed to both ORG and her sister .", "On DATE the bailiff of ORG recorded and seized the flat in the presence of GPE The latter made no requests or observations .", "On DATE the apartment was sold at a public auction . PERSON , the only person who made a bid , acquired the apartment for EEK CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the market value of the apartment was EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . According to the auction record , PERSON and PERSON were present as witnesses .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action in the ORG against GPE and ORG AS . According to the statement of claim he had obtained information concerning the pledge agreement from the bailiff on DATE . He requested ORG to invalidate the pledge agreement , relying on section DATE ) of LAW ) and LAW of LAW ( General Principles ) Act ( ORG \u00fcldosa seadus ) .", "In her reply of CARDINAL DATE , GPE recognised the applicant \u2019s claim . It had been an error on the part of the notary to attest the pledge agreement without the applicant \u2019s consent .", "On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG that on DATE he had become aware of the fact that on DATE the apartment had been sold at a public auction to PERSON He argued that the sale of the apartment at public auction could not have been lawful due to the unlawfulness of the pledge agreement . Therefore , the sale of the joint property at the auction had had no basis in law . He made a reference to LAW seadustik ) . Moreover , he contended that he had unwillingly lost the possession of the apartment . Accordingly , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( NORP ) , the buyer at the auction had not become the owner of the apartment . He requested that the results of the auction be declared invalid , that his entitlement to CARDINAL of the apartment be recognised and that the apartment , which had been unlawfully repossessed , be returned .", "On DATE ORG involved PERSON in the proceedings as a defendant .", "On DATE the applicant made a request to amend the claim . He argued that the fundamental conditions of the auction had been violated , since joint property could be sold only with the consent of the joint owners . However , he had not given such consent . He relied on ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "On DATE ORG involved the ORG in the proceedings as a defendant .", "At the hearing of DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that the conduct of the auction had been in violation of law . The applicant had not been informed about the auction and he had become aware of the sale of the apartment only after the auction . According to PERSON he had been to see the apartment in TIME of the auction day . He had met the applicant who had told him that he was PERSON \u2019s husband and that PERSON would not get the apartment .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the claims in part . It found it established that the apartment had been privatised [ bought on favourable conditions from the municipality ] in DATE , when the applicant and GPE were already married . Therefore , the apartment had been in the joint ownership of the spouses . It further observed that , according to section DATE ) of LAW , movable property in the joint ownership of spouses , where it had to be entered in a register , could not be transferred or pledged without the written consent of the other spouse regardless of in which spouse \u2019s name the property had been registered . ORG concluded that there had been a substantial breach of law and declared the pledge agreement invalid , relying on , inter alia , LAW .", "The remainder of the applicant \u2019s claims were rejected by ORG . The court found that there was no legal ground to invalidate the results of the public auction as its fundamental conditions had not been violated . Nor was there any ground to recognise the applicant \u2019s entitlement to a CARDINAL legal share in the apartment , since the buyer had acquired the apartment at a public auction arranged in order to secure the execution of a court judgment . The buyer \u2019s title to the apartment was protected under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . ORG held that LAW concerning regulations with regard to joint property was not applicable in the case , since the case at issue concerned enforcement in respect of pledged property . Accordingly , LAW , a provision concerning pledged property , had to be applied . The applicant had not alleged a violation of that provision .", "In his appeal the applicant argued that it was incomprehensible that ORG , having invalidated the pledge agreement , had refused to recognise the applicant \u2019s title to the apartment . He argued that he had lost possession of the apartment against his will and , therefore , he was entitled to claim possession of the property . He was of the opinion that due to the invalidity of the pledge agreement the subsequent transactions could have no legal effect . He also raised the question of ORG responsibility in respect of the sale of the apartment , arguing that the ORG should have verified all the relevant circumstances . He noted that he had been entered into a register as GPE \u2019s husband and that the apartment in issue was his permanent place of residence . He argued that PERSON could not be considered a bona fide owner and that the conduct of the auction had been in breach of law , since it had concerned the spouses\u2019 joint property which had been pledged unlawfully .", "On DATE ORG ( Tallinna GPE ) dismissed the appeal . It found that the auction had been lawful and rejected the applicant \u2019s allegation that PERSON was entitled to claim compensation from the ORG .", "ORG noted that according to the principle of abstraction ( abstraktsiooniprintsiip ) underlying LAW , the invalidity of a contract creating obligations ( kohustustehing ) [ e.g. a sales contract or pledge agreement ] did not render invalid the transfer of property ( k\u00e4sutustehing ) . Even the transfer of property by a person who was not the owner could have legal consequences and was not inevitably invalid . Therefore , the fact that the pledge agreement had been declared invalid in this case did not mean that the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claims had to be upheld . The court could not declare the auction invalid on the grounds relied on by the applicant . Therefore , his claims concerning the recognition of his title and repossession of the property were also unfounded . Since PERSON had acquired title to the apartment at a public auction held on the basis of a court judgment , his right of ownership could not be affected by challenging the preceding transactions . The right of the holder of the pledge to have the object of the pledge sold at an auction had been confirmed by a judgment . PERSON \u2019s title was protected against the disputes between the previous owners and other persons . The arguments concerning the bad faith of the buyer were irrelevant in a case where the property was acquired at an auction . A compulsory auction could be invalidated only on grounds provided for by the law , i.e. in case a fundamental breach of law had been involved in the conduct of the auction . The applicant had not relied on any such ground in his claim . The court noted that there existed no register concerning conclusion and dissolution of marriages .", "ORG noted that the applicant had the right to lodge a claim against his wife who had concluded the pledge agreement concealing the fact that she had been married .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( NORP ) . He submitted that on the basis of ORG judgment of DATE the apartment , where he also lived , had been sold at an auction . He argued that he had become aware of that when the apartment had already been sold . On DATE ORG had declared the pledge agreement invalid . According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( General Principles ) Act , a void transaction was invalid from inception , it had not to be performed and the parties to it should return what had been received by the void transaction , or if this was not possible , they should compensate for it in money . As the judgment of DATE had been based on an invalid agreement , the judgment itself was also unlawful and invalid . Therefore , the auction sale of the apartment had also been unlawful .", "He claimed that ORG had to compensate the material damage caused to him by the unlawful judgment of DATE . Moreover , he contended that he had known nothing about the sale of the apartment . The information concerning public auctions was published only in the \u201c Official Notices \u201d ( ORG ) . CARDINAL per cent of the population was unaware of the existence of such a publication . It was published only in the NORP language , while CARDINAL of the NORP population did not know NORP . This was in violation of LAW of LAW , according to which no one should be discriminated against on the basis of language . An auction was business \u2013 that was why each inhabitant of the country had the right to be informed about it and the information should be published in several languages . Therefore , LAW , according to which everyone had the right to receive information , was violated . The applicant also argued that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was ambiguous and contrary to the LAW and international legal practice . He requested that ORG quash ORG judgment in so far as the court had recognised the lawfulness of the acquisition of the apartment by PERSON , since the acquisition that was clearly based on fraud could not be considered lawful . He further requested that the results of the auction be invalidated and that the constitutionality of the auction rules and section CARDINAL of LAW be examined . Finally , he requested that the degree of responsibility of ORG for the unlawful acts of the judge who had made the judgment of DATE be determined .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to lodge an appeal with it .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW Perekonnaseadus ) provided that movable property in the joint ownership of spouses , where it had to be entered into a register , could not be transferred or pledged without the written consent of the other spouse regardless of in which spouse \u2019s name the property was entered in the register .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( General Principles ) Act ( ORG \u00fcldosa seadus ) , a void transaction was invalid from inception , it had not to be performed and the parties to it had to return what had been received by the void transaction , or if this was not possible , they had to compensate for it in money .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( NORP ) a person who had acquired an object by delivery in good faith would not become its owner , if the owner had been deprived of possession of the object against his or her will . An exception was made in respect of objects which had been sold at a public auction . A buyer at a public auction acquired the object regardless of whether its owner had been deprived of possession against his or her will .", "LAW seadustik ) provided that the debtor and the claimant had , inter alia , the right to be present at the enforcement actions performed by the bailiff , to have access to the materials of the enforcement case file , to make statements concerning the enforcement procedure , to present opinions about the ownership and price of the property and to lodge an appeal against the bailiff \u2019s activities to the head of the enforcement department or to the court .", "Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Code the head of the enforcement department could suspend the enforcement proceedings in case a complaint concerning the activities of the bailiff had been lodged .
