These statements were not communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Chief Officer of ORG asked that disciplinary proceedings be instituted against the applicant on suspicion that he had committed a serious breach of work discipline . This suspicion was based on a criminal complaint meanwhile lodged against the applicant , his own written confession and statements of several other individuals given before the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the applicant before ORG . A hearing was held on DATE in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . At the hearing the applicant 's confession of CARDINAL DATE was read out . The applicant stated that he had been questioned by his colleagues in a police station about the case of GPE The questioning had lasted TIME , and at the end he had signed the statement because he had not wanted to be questioned any longer . The applicant further stated that he knew GPE but that he had not participated in any dealings concerning his certificate of citizenship . He also explained that immediately afterwards he had lodged an objection on his questioning with the officer on duty . In his closing arguments the applicant 's defence counsel , inter alia , objected that the statements of ORG had not been read out and that therefore the defence had no opportunity to analyse these statements because they did not know their content .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found it established that the applicant had acted as an intermediary between GPE and CARDINAL other persons in order to obtain a forged certificate of NORP citizenship for GPE and that he had passed on a sum of CARDINAL NORP Marks ( ORG ) from GPE to a certain ORG who had passed it on to a certain ORG , a clerk in the citizenship registry , asking the latter to make a forged certificate . The operative part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c PERSON ...", "is guilty", "because during DATE he took from GPE ... a sum of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL and gave it to GPE ... , so that the latter would act as a further intermediary in bribing ORG ... to issue a forged certificate of NORP citizenship in the name of GPE , which ORG did on DATE ,", "by which he committed a serious breach of work discipline under LAW paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Zakon o unutarnjim poslovima ) and section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rules on employment of the employees of ORG of GPE ,", "Owing to which a disciplinary measure under LAW of LAW", "termination of employment", "is to be applied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment was based on the applicant 's written statement of CARDINAL DATE in which he confessed and the CARDINAL other statements given to the police by GPE and GPE The applicant 's contention , that he had signed the statement under duress since he had been interviewed by his colleagues for the whole night , that the notes of the interview had been amended several times and that he had been given no right such as to make a telephone call , was dismissed . The disciplinary court ordered the applicant 's dismissal . The reasoning of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Through a request for the institution of disciplinary proceedings submitted by the Chief of ORG ... of CARDINAL DATE the defendant PERSON was charged with a serious breach of work discipline , specified as to its factual background and legal characterisation in the operative part of this judgment .", "ORG of ORG initiated proceedings by its decision ... of DATE .", "A decision by the Chief of ORG ... of CARDINAL DATE removed PERSON from his duties in ORG with effect from DATE on account of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a serious breach of work discipline by committing a criminal offence under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of GPE , and that his further service would harm the interests of the service .", "During the disciplinary proceedings the president of the court read aloud the written statement of PERSON of CARDINAL DATE .", "In his defence PERSON does not accept his written statement . He adds that he was being questioned by the police , having being called on the false pretext that he was needed in connection with some customs business . They did not secure his rights such as using the telephone and so on .", "He states that he knows GPE but that he was not present at any dealings in connection with a certificate of citizenship or the taking of any money .", "Furthermore , he retracts his written statement which he signed because he was tired of being browbeaten by his colleague policemen who questioned him , [ he wanted them ] to cease psychologically ill - treating him .", "For example , the record of the interview reads that his superior was present , which is untrue because his superior entered [ the interview room ] for TIME only and then immediately left and he did not see him again that day , nor was he present when he signed the written statement .", "He also adds that immediately after the interview he drew up a statement concerning the circumstances of the investigation and submitted it to an officer .", "In defence of defendant PERSON , his counsel PERSON pointed to grave breaches of procedure , since the statement and records of interviews with the police were admitted as evidence . He also objected that a criminal complaint against the defendant was taken as proof that he had committed [ the offence ] he has been charged with .", "After deliberations and voting ORG dismissed the objections by the defence .", "During the proceedings ORG consulted the written statements given by PERSON and recorded under no .

[ A measure of ] prohibition of entry [ on the territory of ] GPE has been applied for the period of DATE .", "After the assessment of all relevant facts established in the proceedings the panel of ORG established that the defendant PERSON is guilty of a serious breach as set out in the operative part of the judgment .", "By such conduct the defendant violated existing laws and rules of service since he had committed acts irreconcilable with the police service .", "While assessing the disciplinary measure [ to be applied ] the panel of ORG took as aggravating the fact that the defendant had already been disciplinary punished .", "In view of the above , it has been decided as set out in the operative part of the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On a subsequent appeal by the applicant against the judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG ( GPE disciplinski sud GPE unutarnjih poslova PERSON ) upheld the first instance judgment on DATE but altered the qualification of the offence finding that the act in question constituted an offence under LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL and DATE ) of LAW which refer to inappropriate conduct , rather than paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , on the ground that :", "\u201c ... no one , including the defendant , can be considered liable for a criminal offence as long as [ his or her liability ] has not been established in a final judgment ( LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint against the disciplinary courts ' judgments with ORG ( Upravni sud PERSON ) whereby he complained , inter alia , of the fact that the statements given to the police could not have served as evidence in the disciplinary proceedings against him . He also complained that he had no access to the evidence relied on by the disciplinary courts , namely the statements given by CARDINAL persons to the police . The complaint was dismissed on DATE on the ground that in the disciplinary proceedings it had been established that the applicant had committed the offence in question and that the use of the impugned statements had been correct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i.e. parallel to the institution of the disciplinary proceedings , the NORP State Attorney 's Office ( Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u PERSON ) lodged a request that an investigation be opened against the applicant and CARDINAL other individuals on a suspicion that they had acted as intermediaries between GPE and a clerk of the registry of citizens , passing a sum of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the latter in order to issue a certificate of NORP citizenship for GPE and thus committed a criminal offence under LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW in connection with LAW .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation the suspects and a witness were heard by an investigation judge . The applicant remained silent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sought that the criminal investigation against the applicant be discontinued on the ground that the statement given by GPE showed that the applicant had procured him a certificate of NORP citizenship but that he had given no money for that to the applicant . Hence , there was insufficient evidence that the applicant had committed a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigation judge of ORG discontinued the criminal investigation against the applicant owing to the above request of the ORG Attorney 's ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the reopening of the disciplinary proceedings against him . He argued in support of his request that the factual basis for disciplinary proceedings as well as the criminal proceedings was identical and as the latter had been discontinued due to lack of evidence there would likewise be no basis upon which disciplinary sanctions ought to be imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the request inadmissible , finding the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued irrelevant in respect of the decision on his disciplinary responsibility . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a complaint with ORG which was dismissed on DATE . His subsequent constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible on DATE as lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , following the dismissal of his administrative complaint in the disciplinary proceedings against him , the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as well as several supplementary submissions complaining that the disciplinary proceedings against him had been unfair . He argued , inter alia , that the disciplinary courts found that he had committed a criminal offence although he had not been convicted in the criminal proceedings against him which had been discontinued . He further argued that the statement he had made to the police was not a valid evidence under domestic law and as such should have been removed and that the statements given to the police , relied on in finding him disciplinary responsible , had never been communicated to him , nor had they been produced at the hearing before the disciplinary courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant 's complaint . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c .. the Constitutional Court finds it useful to comment on the applicant 's arguments concerning the legal nature of disciplinary proceedings .", "First and foremost , the applicant contends that the State Attorney 's ORG discontinued criminal prosecution against him for lack of evidence that he had committed a criminal offence consisting in the same acts [ as those serving as a basis ] for the judgments [ adopted ] in the disciplinary proceedings . ORG emphasises that the ground for the applicant 's [ disciplinary ] conviction and the imposed disciplinary measure was his liability for serious breaches of work discipline under LAW paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL and DATE ) of LAW , and not his liability for a criminal offence .", "Criminal and disciplinary liabilities are CARDINAL separate [ types ] of liability , which have to be established in CARDINAL entirely independent sets of proceedings with no mutual influence . Liability for serious breaches of work discipline may be established even without a decision of a criminal court , irrespective of the fact that a breach of working duty may at the same time amount to a criminal offence . [ The purpose of ] disciplinary proceedings is to establish the elements constituting a breach of work discipline . It is not necessary that at the same time the elements of a criminal offence have been satisfied , and in that respect the disciplinary liability is wider than the criminal .", "Furthermore , it is to be stressed that although disciplinary proceedings are actually [ by their nature ] criminal proceedings sui generis , they also bear strong features of the administrative proceedings .", "There is in principle a lesser risk as to the scope of possible violations of human rights in disciplinary proceedings than in criminal proceedings . Also , the consequences of disciplinary proceedings differ significantly from those of criminal proceedings . Therefore , the application of the [ rules of ] Code of Criminal Procedure in disciplinary proceedings is only subsidiary , as worded in CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Act on Civil Servants ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL ) : ' In the proceedings concerning a serious breach of official duty provisions of LAW shall be applied appropriately ... ' . Subsidiary application of LAW procedure means that its provisions are to be applied according to the nature of the disciplinary proceedings , that is to say that their application is neither obligatory in each instance nor they have to be applied literally .", "The above is applicable in respect of the exclusion of the official notes made by the police [ to be used ] as evidence in criminal proceedings . The official police notes can not serve as evidence in criminal proceedings owing to the special nature of those proceedings . However , such notes are not illegal evidence ab initio , both from the standpoint of some potential criminal proceedings or from that of disciplinary proceedings . They become illegal evidence only if actually used in criminal proceedings . Their use for other ( lawful ) purposes is not prohibited . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( Kaznenini zakon PERSON , ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE ) reads :", "( CARDINAL ) Whoever gives or promises a gift or other gain to an official in order to perform an official or another act within his or her authority which he or she should not perform or to omit an official or other act which an official is obliged to do , or who acts as an intermediary at such bribing of an official shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term from DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
