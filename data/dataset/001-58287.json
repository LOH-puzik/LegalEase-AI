That premiss , however , is weakened , and even made unsound , where statements by offenders are supported by external evidence such as medical findings . It is put even more in doubt where the explanations provided by the policemen vary significantly during the course of the proceedings ; and the presumption in favour of the police is destroyed if it is shown , as in the instant case , that the police reports do not reflect the truth .", "As to the medical findings", "The accusations made by the civil parties are supported by unequivocal medical findings . In the first place , as regards ORG , the expert Professor PERSON noted in his report of CARDINAL DATE that all the doctors who had examined him while he was in police custody had found lesions of traumatic origin on the left arm , in the left orbital region , on the scalp and on the back . On DATE further lesions were seen on the lower limbs . He added that during his examination on DATE he had again found lesions that had been described earlier and that he found others on the buttocks and on the right ankle .", "The extent of the injuries on ORG \u2019s person increased as the uninterrupted police custody continued .", "The bruising to the left eyelid , the thin linear scar QUANTITY long continuing the line of the left eyebrow , the left and right sub - orbital haematomas found on CARDINAL DATE by PERSON , and then described on DATE by PERSON as being \u2018 round the eyes\u2019 , are consistent with the punching mentioned by ORG .", "The various haematomas found on the thorax , the left and right sides and the abdomen are consistent with the punching and kicking in his statement of DATE .", "The pain in the scalp and the headaches mentioned by PERSON and PERSON are likewise of a kind to support ORG \u2019s statements , according to which his hair was pulled and he was repeatedly tapped on the head with an instrument which could have been a baseball bat .", "The haematomas found on the buttocks and the thighs could only have come from blows from a blunt instrument . Similarly , the lesions apparent on the legs , ankles and feet are consistent with the blows or crushing that ORG complained of .", "It follows from the foregoing that the objective injuries , as recorded in successive examinations , match the blows described by ORG .", "As regards PERSON , the medical certificates and the expert medical opinions attest to the reality and intensity of the blows he sustained . Further , as set out by the expert , the time that elapsed between the appearance of the objective injuries and the events in issue strongly suggests repeated small injuries .", "The scalp abrasions are absolutely consistent with his statement that on numerous occasions he was repeatedly struck on the head with a blunt instrument .", "The rectangular shape of the large haematoma on the right thigh and of the CARDINAL haematomas on the left thigh corresponds exactly to blows struck with a blunt instrument , as described by the complainant .", "As to the accounts given by the defendants", "The defendants\u2019 explanations of how the injuries found came about totally lack credibility . Moreover , on these points as on others , their explanations varied . PERSON , for instance , initially stated that he had acted as a reinforcement to arrest ORG ) but subsequently said that he was not in the street where the arrest took place but inside the hotel .", "The defendants maintain that the accusations against them are the result of orchestrated , concerted action . It should be noted at this point that throughout DATE of inquiries and judicial investigation no evidence was found to substantiate that allegation . The ORG interests differed appreciably . The successive descriptions of the ill - treatment they alleged that they had suffered do not disclose any connivance , and it should be pointed out that ORG himself was hardly ever assisted by a lawyer in the proceedings concerning drug trafficking .", "It is not without relevance to note that ORG , who had never been in police custody before , could not have made use of previous experience of it to fabricate a completely false story .", "The mere fact of ORG \u2019s arrest near his hotel , even if it is assumed to have entailed something of a struggle , can not explain either the seriousness of the injuries or their gradual onset as confirmed by the photographs in the file , seeing that , immediately afterwards , the policemen concerned did not record any suspicious signs either on their own persons or on that of ORG , signs that would have warranted a thorough medical examination , which would have been in their own interest .", "As regards PERSON , the policemen \u2019s account , according to which he had deliberately banged his head against a wall and a cupboard , is not consistent with the findings of the medical examinations .", "The expert noted that in this type of occurrence it is normal to find , at the time of the events , unequivocal injuries and even bleeding wounds , which was not the case here .", "Taken as a whole , these factors persuade the ORG that the alleged resistance to arrest was invented by the accused to justify the seriousness and location of the haematomas and the lesions found on the detainee .", "As to the reliability of the police reports", "The policemen from ORG CARDINAL , in particular PERSON , admitted in court that several reports drawn up during the detention of Selmouni and Madi in police custody contained inaccurate statements both as to times and as to the identity of those who had written them . No persuasive logical explanation of this was given to ORG PERSON , for example , drew up a report ( DCARDINAL ) on the search which he made at PERSON from TIME on DATE , and \u2018 recorded\u2019 at TIME that is to say at DATE in another report ( DCARDINAL ) that PERSON had resisted arrest , and also told the ORG that he had intervened to calm him .", "The complete unreliability of the documents drawn up by the investigators is extremely serious in that the entire functioning of the criminal justice system rests on the reliance that may be placed on the reports of senior police officers and their assistants [ officiers et agents de police judiciaire ] .", "In view of all the foregoing , the brutality of which the defendants are accused is patent and the trial court rightly held that during the proceedings they had done nothing but conceal the truth about their behaviour .", "\u2026", "As to the sentence", "The offences of which the defendants are guilty are exceptionally serious ones , and that precludes their benefiting from the provisions of the amnesty of CARDINAL DATE . They must be regarded as instances of particularly degrading treatment . Having been committed by senior officials responsible for enforcing the laws of the Republic , they must be punished firmly as such conduct can not be justified , irrespective of the personality of the offenders in their charge and the degree of their corruption and dangerousness .", "The seriousness of the offences , however , can not be compared with what it would have been if the sexual assaults had been made out against the defendants . Nor do the offences appear to have been the result of a concerted plan . In view of the part played by each , the absence of any previous criminal record and the administrative files on the defendants , the ORG considers that it must accordingly reduce the length of the prison sentences as indicated in the operative provisions of the judgment and leave it to the discretion of the GPE superiors to determine what disciplinary consequences are necessary in the case , the prison sentences being suspended , only in part as regards PERSON , whose responsibility appears greater , regard being had to his being the officer in charge .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
