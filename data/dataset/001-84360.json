Following the employer 's refusal to abide by the court order , she complained to ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) on DATE . On CARDINAL MarchCARDINAL the Ministry assured her that the employer would abide by the judgment , failing which it would take action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was re - instated on DATE .

On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE and upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the order of DATE dismissing the applicant was annulled ; at the same time she was again dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor 's Office initiated court proceedings in the applicant 's interest , seeking the annulment of the dismissal order of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the Deputy President of ORG informed the regional prosecutor about the employer 's persistent resistance and the resulting failure to properly enforce the judgment of DATE . Moreover , the prosecutor was informed of the applicant 's further dismissal on DATE . In the light of these events , the court requested the prosecutor to open a criminal investigation against the employer 's director .", "CARDINAL . The applicant continued to complain about the incomplete enforcement of the judgment of DATE . On DATE she was informed by ORG of an administrative fine imposed on the theatre director on DATE , and of the request to open a criminal investigation against him . The employer submitted to the court another order , dated DATE , annulling the applicant 's dismissal of DATE . On DATE a bailiff confirmed that the applicant had not been de facto re - instated in the specific prior position . On CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG requested the prosecutor to open a criminal investigation against the theatre director for failure to enforce the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was dismissed from the post of superior accountant . On the same date the court informed ORG employer 's persistent refusal to enforce the judgment of DATE . On an unknown date the employer presented a new order , dated DATE , in accordance with which the position of \u201c chief accountant \u201d no longer existed . On DATE the court again asked the prosecutor to initiate criminal proceedings against the theatre director . It also informed ORG employer 's failure to enforce the court judgment in the applicant 's favour in a proper manner .

On DATE the bailiff confirmed that the judgment had not been properly enforced and on DATE he asked the court to impose an administrative fine on the theatre director .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution informed the applicant that its verification revealed a failure to properly enforce the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and that the employer 's order of DATE had been challenged in court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employer adopted a new order to the effect that the position of \u201c chief accountant \u201d would no longer exist after DATE . On DATE the applicant was informed that a new order dated DATE ( \u201c the second order of CARDINAL DATE \u201d ) had been adopted , under the same number as the previous order of that date ( see paragraph DATE above ) , re - instating her in her original position as chief accountant . She was also warned that that position would end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . By another decision of the same date the court rejected the bailiff 's request to impose a fine on the theatre director .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the employer to issue an order whereby the position of chief accountant would be \u201c created in reality \u201d and reflected in the official documents ( state de personal ) since no such position allegedly existed officially , apart from her re - instatement order . She also asked to be given the necessary authorities and access to documents in order to perform her functions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE not to impose a fine on the theatre director . It ordered a re - hearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initiated new court proceedings , seeking to have the order of DATE annulled as unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to declare invalid the first order of DATE ( order no . CARDINAL , re - instating her in the position of superior accountant , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and to declare valid the other order with the same number and date ( order no . CARDINAL , re - instating her in the position of chief accountant , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and simultaneously adopted a new one , which also annulled the first order and upheld the second . On DATE the ORG quashed both judgments and ordered a full re - hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the re - instatement of the applicant in the position of chief accountant . On DATE the ORG quashed that judgment and discontinued the proceedings in respect of the annulment of the order of DATE , stating that the decision to abolish a position - taken in accordance with the relevant procedure - was an internal matter for the theatre and was not subject to judicial control . The court also ordered a re - hearing of the case in respect of the annulment of the order of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant 's de facto re - instatement and payment of her salary for the duration of her involuntary absence from work . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the discontinuation of proceedings with regard to the annulment of the order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings in respect of the annulment of the order of DATE and the de facto re - instatement of the applicant because the proceedings had been incorrectly initiated as civil proceedings , whereas they were within the competence of the administrative courts . On DATE ORG dismissed the bailiff 's proposal to fine the theatre director for failure to enforce the judgment of DATE . This latter decision was subsequently upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant inquired about the reasons for the non - enforcement of the judgment of DATE . It appears that she did not receive any reply . She repeated her request on DATE , when she was informed about the decisions of DATE . She then appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the first of the CARDINAL decisions of DATE ( regarding discontinuation of the proceedings for lack of competence ) and ordered a re - hearing of the case . The court found that the parties had not been informed about the hearing and had not been sent a copy of the decision and , further , that the case file had not been received at the registry of the lower court until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that the applicant 's re - instatement had been ordered CARDINAL times by final court judgments ( on DATE , DATE and DATE ) and that she had been properly re - instated on DATE ; it therefore dismissed her claim for re - instatement . However , the court accepted her claim for payment of salary for involuntary absence from work for the period from DATE until DATE , when she was dismissed by an order which she did not challenge . The court left unexamined her request for compensation for the effects of inflation on the late payment and her claim for non - pecuniary damage , which could be examined in separate proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that she was not informed of her employer 's order of CARDINAL DATE , had not acknowledged receipt of the order as required by law , and was thus unable to challenge it in court . The order had not been presented to the courts or to any other authority in any of the proceedings after DATE , which meant that it was fake .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly accepted the applicant 's claims and found that her employer had not paid her salary for certain periods in DATE or made mandatory social welfare payments in respect of the applicant . The court declared void the first order of DATE to re - instate the applicant , and found that the second order of DATE and with the same number remained valid . It awarded the applicant compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the amount of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) for the failure to pay a part of her salary in DATE , finding that the employer had in the meantime paid another MDL CARDINAL in salary arrears .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted medical evidence concerning several periods of in - patient hospital treatment during the proceedings and claimed that she had spent a considerable amount of money on treatment for herself and her daughter .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter from ORG to ORG , dated DATE , the applicant 's appeal was sent to ORG on DATE . That court sent the case to ORG , asking it to examine the issue of the impossibility of examining the appeal , due to the fact that that all the judges in ORG had already taken part in previous examinations of the case . On an unknown date the case was transferred to ORG . According to a certificate issued by ORG department in GPE on DATE , the applicant received MDL CARDINAL in salary arrears for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE .
