In DATE PERSON gave birth to the applicant 's son , P. In DATE during the applicant 's stay abroad , PERSON 's mother , ORG , moved out from their house and took P. with her , apparently as a result of growing tensions and disagreements in the couple . Afterwards she refused to allow the applicant to have contact with ORG , on an unspecified date , the applicant took P back to his place , without ORG 's agreement .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date PERSON filed with ORG ( s\u0105d rejonowy ) a request for limitation of the applicant 's parental responsibility for P.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court issued an interim order to place P. with his mother . It relied on P. 's age , on the fact that O. breast - fed P. and , also , on the fact that he was suffering from allergy . On the following day a court - appointed guardian assisted by a police officer arrived at the applicant 's place and after a TIME skirmish took PERSON away .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG concluded a friendly settlement as to the access arrangements . They agreed that ORG 's place of residence would be with his mother . The applicant had a right to take P. to his place at specified dates and times in DATE . Starting from DATE he was supposed to spend DATE with his son at his home . As to the exact dates of meetings in DATE the parties agreed to determine them at DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE O. refused to hand over her son to the applicant , maintaining that P. was ill at that time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant requested that a court guardian assist him in meetings with PERSON , submitting that ORG failed to comply with the settlement they had concluded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant petitioned ORG to fine O. for obstructing his contacts with P. as established in the settlement of DATE . He also requested the prosecution authorities to institute criminal proceedings against O.", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date at the requests of the applicant and NORP proceedings concerning parental responsibility were instituted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings concerning the applicant 's petition , considering that only after the completion of the parental - responsibility proceedings would it be possible to examine them . The court observed that the parties to the court settlement of DATE had not specified the dates of the applicant 's meetings with P. and that therefore the settlement was impossible to enforce . It was therefore impossible to examine the applicant 's petition to have a fine imposed on O.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to O. and , after an altercation , took his son away . Subsequently , O. informed prosecution authorities that the applicant had kidnapped P. and threatened her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent letters to ORG and the prosecution authorities informing them that he had taken over the custody of P. and would continue to exercise his parental rights until the completion of the parental - responsibility proceedings pending before ORG . He declared that O. would be able to meet her son at the applicant 's home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at ORG 's request , ordered the applicant to hand over P. to NORP within DATE . Initially , he declared his willingness to do so , but , subsequently , went into hiding together with his son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( prokurator rejonowy ) discontinued the proceedings initiated at the applicant 's request , considering that O. had not committed the criminal offence of obstructing his contacts with P. It was established that O. had ceased to comply with the terms of the DATE settlement at DATE , relying on the fact that P. had been sick at that time . She also objected to the applicant taking P. to his home as he lived far away from ORG 's residence . The applicant 's appeal against that decision was dismissed by ORG ( prokurator wojew\u00f3dzki ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the investigations instituted at ORG 's request . He considered that the applicant had not committed a criminal offence . It had been established that since DATE O. had not allowed the applicant to take his son to his home , despite the fact that P. had got better . The applicant had only been allowed brief visits at her home to see P. The applicant had informed the police and requested to be given assistance , but his efforts failed to affect the mother 's conduct . It was further pointed out that after taking away P. from his mother the applicant had informed the prosecution authorities in GPE and NORP about the incident . In the light of the fact that the applicant had full parental rights in respect of P. the prosecutor did not consider his acts a criminal offence . O. 's allegations about having been threatened by the applicant proved unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE in the course of the parental - responsibility proceedings the ORG limited the applicant 's parental rights to a right to information about his child 's health . It amended the settlement of DATE in that it decided that further contacts between the applicant and his son should take place on DATE at the mother 's home from TIME without the possibility to take P. anywhere .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the DATE settlement between the parties , to the subsequent difficulties in the applicant 's access to P. and to the fact that on DATE he had taken PERSON to his place . The court considered that although there was nothing in the case - file to suggest that the applicant 's parenting skills were insufficient and it was difficult to establish to which of the parents PERSON was more attached , the applicant 's conduct in the course of the proceedings proved his disrespect to the organs of justice and disregard of the interest of the child .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant and ORG appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG amended ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE in that it deprived the applicant of all parental rights in respect of P. It considered that he had abused his rights by making it impossible for the son to contact his mother , whereas the mother 's care at that stage of the child 's development was indispensable . The court further found that the applicant 's continuing hiding was to the child 's detriment , especially because he was apparently working and his son was taken care of by other people . It emphasised that the child had the right to decent life conditions , home and stability , of which the applicant had deprived him . The court further pointed out that the difficulties in enforcing court orders in the past could not justify the applicant 's conduct and he should have availed himself of legal remedies .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for the appointment of a legal - aid lawyer for the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal and exemption from courts costs . The court found that he ran a business and in DATE his income had reached MONEY ( ORG ) , whereas he would have to pay only a ORG CARDINAL fee for his cassation appeal and the legal fees in a case like his would not exceed LAW . The court further noted that the applicant was single and owned a plot of land with a building under construction , as well as a car . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's cassation appeal against that decision , as it was not provided for by law . On DATE ORG rejected his appeal against the latter decision .", "CARDINAL .

The court relied on the opinion prepared by CARDINAL experts , according to which the relations between the child and parents were disturbed , and because of the child 's age it was recommended that the meetings with the father would take place at the mother 's home . The experts noted that P. would not want to leave his father . They pointed out that the need to maintain PERSON 's contacts with his father existed , but that the parents did not show understanding for the needs of the child and were driven by the wish to harm each other .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed with ORG a petition in which he requested that O. be deprived of her parental rights and he be granted parental responsibility . Subsequently , he asked the court to issue an interim order to the effect that PERSON 's place of residence would be with the father .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant filed an unsuccessful request for the reopening of the proceedings terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant 's request for the enforcement of the part of the judgment given on DATE concerning his contacts with his son . The court considered that the place of residence of ORG and the son was unknown and therefore enforcement was impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's petition to deprive O. of parental responsibility for P. It noted that the applicant 's submissions as to the allegedly improper manner in which the mother looked after P. were unsubstantiated . On the contrary , the experts were of the opinion that there were strong emotional bonds between her and P. The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . In her letter of CARDINAL DATE , written in reply to the applicant 's complaint , the President of ORG of Appeal agreed with his contention that the proceedings were lengthy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police authorities informed the applicant that O. with his son had left for GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE .
