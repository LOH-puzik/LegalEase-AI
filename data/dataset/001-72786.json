GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , a NORP national , was born in DATE and when introducing the application lived in GPE .", "In an article published in a NORP DATE review on DATE a well - known historian , Professor PERSON ( thereafter \u201c W. \u201d ) made inter alia the following statements :", "\u201c ( ... ) PERSON wanted the murder of the NORP . He ordered it and certainly knew about it . Although he had not given a written order , there is evidence that he had given oral orders on several occasions . The murder of the NORP was wanted and organised from above and by ORG - activists from the bottom ( ... ) . \u201d", "In a letter of DATE the applicant wrote to Professor PERSON in reply to this article :", "\u201c ( ... ) Your statements which are false and historically unsustainable shall not stand unanswered ( ... ) .", "It is actually established that there is no indication in party programs of ORG , the ORG ( ORG ) , that the ORG and PERSON intended to murder the NORP . Anybody who \u2013 with all the means at his disposal \u2013 fostered the emigration of the NORP minority until late after the beginning of the Second World War can hardly be said to have prepared the murder of the NORP . A long time ago , the historian PERSON has publicly proposed to pay QUANTITY to any person who could prove that PERSON had ordered , for racial reasons , the murder of CARDINAL single NORP . So far , nobody has produced evidence . After the war , CARDINAL of totally immaculate officials of the ORG have attested on oath not to have known until DATE war about the murder of NORP . None of the dignitaries of ORG accused in GPE admitted to have known about the mass murder of NORP . Not even in their closing words under the gallows ! ( ... )", "The normalisation of the relation between NORP and NORP depends on the will to historical truth and requires not only that one party is blamed for the responsibility it admits but also that the other party refrains from suppressing its negative contribution to history ( ... ) . Last but not least , the normalisation requires the Jews\u2019 clear distancing from the war and post - war atrocity propaganda ( Kriegs- und ORG ) against GPE , directly or indirectly concerning the NORP .", "You , Professor PERSON , would highly contribute to this if you would abandon the false or questionable statements against GPE and seriously endeavour to become acquainted with the actual academic discourse of contemporary history . \u201d", "On DATE PERSON submitted this letter to the police . On DATE he explicitly refused to lodge an application for prosecution ( Strafantrag - see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "On DATE a police officer informed DATE whose grandparents had died in a concentration camp \u2013 about the letter and its content . On DATE , the latter lodged an application for prosecution .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of disparaging the dignity of the deceased pursuant to LAW of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . With reference to the case - law of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , it recalled that it was historically proven that the mass killing of NORP in concentration camps was planned and organised by PERSON and the ORG . Accordingly , no evidence in this respect had to be adduced , as requested by the applicant . Although the applicant had not denied the Holocaust as such , his denial of PERSON \u2019s and the ORG \u2019s responsibility in this respect was tantamount to a negative value judgment ( negatives PERSON ) . He had thereby denied the GPE extremely cruel and unique fate and accordingly disparaged the dignity of the deceased . Furthermore , as the pertinent passages of the applicant \u2019s letter did not express an opinion but had to be categorised as allegations of facts which had been proven untrue , they did not fall within the ambit of LAW of LAW which protects the freedom of opinion . Given their polemic nature , they neither fell within the ambit of LAW of LAW Basic PERSON which protects the freedom of research . In fixing the sentence , the court took into account that the applicant had been convicted in DATE respectively of disparaging the dignity of the deceased for denying the existence of gas chambers and that the letter at issue had been written during DATE .", "On DATE the NORP - F\u00fcrth Regional Court ( ORG ) dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant and ORG . According to ORG , it was not contested that the applicant had written and sent the letter to PERSON It further noted that a valid request for prosecution had been filed with the public prosecutor . Although PERSON had not lodged himself a request for prosecution , the circumstance that he had transferred the applicant \u2019s letter to the police showed that he had not considered its contents as unoffending .", "ORG considered that the extermination of the NORP in gas chambers is a clearly established historical fact . It is also common knowledge that PERSON had wanted and initiated the murder of the NORP in GPE and that the ORG had planned and organised the systematic extermination of NORP people . It was therefore not necessary to adduce the requested evidence . The applicant \u2019s allegations that none of the accused dignitaries of ORG in the GPE Trials had known of the extermination of the NORP , was absurd and monstrous and offended the NORP murdered by the NORP . The applicant \u2019s statement that the opinion expressed by PERSON was part of the war propaganda and after - war atrocity propaganda combined with the denial of PERSON \u2019s and the national Socialists\u2019 responsibility in the extermination of the NORP showed the applicant \u2019s disdain towards the NORP , the principal victims of the systematic extermination . The court concluded that statements concerning facts which had been proven untrue were not protected by LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as not disclosing any legal errors to the detriment of the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "The applicant was represented by defence counsel throughout the proceedings .", "Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides as follows :", "\u201c Anybody disparaging the dignity of the deceased shall be punishable with imprisonment not exceeding DATE or with a fine . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code determines that , with few exceptions , such an offence can only be prosecuted upon application by a relative of the victim of the offence .", "In DATE ORG established that the denial of the existence of gas chambers was an allegation of facts which had been proven untrue and that this allegation can be prohibited on account of their offending nature . In DATE ORG confirmed that the denial of the existence of gas chambers was punishable under LAW of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
