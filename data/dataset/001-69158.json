CARDINAL ) ORG found that the first to third sentences of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW as amended in DATE were , like the previous provisions , contrary to the right not to incriminate oneself which flowed from LAW and from LAW , but were saved by the ultimate sentence of that provision which had constitutional rank . In reaching that conclusion ORG examined whether the ultimate sentence of LAW was contrary to the guiding principles of the LAW , but found that this was not the case .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , provided that a fine of up to ORG CARDINAL with DATE imprisonment in default could be imposed on a person who violates the regulations of this Act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
