The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He worked as an official for the NORP customs office .", "CARDINAL . NORP Apparently in DATE , suspicions of smuggling , bribery and abuse of authority arose against the applicant and CARDINAL other person , PERSON On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG authorized the applicant \u2019s telephones to be intercepted and the data on and content of the calls to be recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG decided to open preliminary investigations on suspicion of abuse of authority ( PERSON ) and a number of offences under LAW against the applicant and , apparently , also against his co - accused . On DATE ORG of the Linz ORG again authorized an interception of the applicant \u2019s telephone lines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG introduced a bill of indictment against the applicant \u2019s co - accused PERSON On an unknown date , the proceedings against the applicant were separated from the ones against PERSON The applicant \u2019s case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG extended the preliminary investigations against the applicant to include suspicions of aggravated tax evasion and a number of further offences under LAW . On DATE the investigating judge ordered ORG for GPE ( PERSON ) to conduct investigations in respect of these offences . It appears that ORG for GPE ( PERSON ) was also involved in these investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG issued decisions to inspect the applicant \u2019s bank accounts in GPE . By letters rogatory , the judge also requested to inspect bank accounts in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date , a search had been carried out at the applicant \u2019s work place , and on DATE ORG decided to seize the evidence discovered during that search .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was suspended from his office .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE the applicant was in pre - trial detention as he allegedly tried to influence witnesses . On DATE and DATE , further decisions to inspect bank accounts were taken . On DATE the investigating judge extended the preliminary investigations against the applicant to include the suspicion of inciting a witness to give false testimony .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE an expert was appointed to give an opinion about the money flows on the applicant \u2019s accounts . The expert asked twice for an extension of the deadline for submission of the opinion , and the extensions were granted . The court urged the expert CARDINAL times for delivery of the opinion ( on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) . The opinion was eventually delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A questioning of the applicant by the investigating judge scheduled for CARDINAL DATE had to be postponed to DATE as the applicant , despite having received the expert \u2019s opinion at some time in DATE , had requested an adjournment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A report drawn up by ORG for GPE reached the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge urged ORG for GPE to submit its final report on the case . On DATE the file including the final report was submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor issued the bill of indictment , charging the applicant with abuse of authority , accepting bribes ( PERSON ) , smuggling , interference with the tobacco monopoly , having received goods for which no import duties had been paid ( PERSON ) , breaking of official seals ( GPE der GPE ) and infliction of bodily harm , all in conjunction with LAW , a provision which provides for higher penalties when offences have been committed by a civil servant abusing this position .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged objections against the bill of indictment on DATE . The objections were rejected on an unknown date .", "CARDINAL . ORG amended the bill of indictment on DATE . ORG ( PERSON ) confirmed the bill of indictment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The case was tried before ORG sitting as a panel of CARDINAL professional and CARDINAL lay judges ( PERSON ) . Hearings were held on DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The court heard the applicant , an expert on accountancy , and a number of witnesses , namely colleagues of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , the hearing was adjourned for an indefinite period in order to review the summonses of the witnesses living abroad . The summons that had been issued to those witnesses for the hearing on DATE , had been sent to ORG on DATE , and returned to the court on DATE , as the ORG could not forward them to the respective authorities without a certified translation . The reply from the ORG had been put into the file without having been shown to the presiding judge , who had assumed that the summonses had been forwarded . Only in the preparation of the hearing did the judge discover the error . Subsequently , the judge addressed a new request , via ORG , to the NORP and NORP authorities requesting them to summon the witnesses concerned . On DATE the judge scheduled a hearing for DATE , which was cancelled because none of the witnesses had appeared : It follows from the file that in some cases the NORP and NORP authorities had , despite their investigations , not been able to establish their addresses . In the other cases the authorities had not provided any reply despite repeated requests from ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged objections to the expert \u2019s opinion being read out . The opinion was discussed at the hearing of DATE , and ORG moved that the expert \u2019s opinion be supplemented . Further decisions to inspect savings and bank accounts were issued on DATE , and the court received the supplementary opinion of the expert on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The statements of the witnesses , whom the court had not been able to summon ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , were read out in the trial during the hearing on DATE . Those statements had been made by the witnesses during the pre - trial investigations in the presence of the defence counsel . During the trial , the defence counsel objected to having those statements read out .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of abuse of authority and accepting bribes . The court relied on the NORP statements . In the judgment it gave reasons why it found these statement which had been read out credible and noted that they had been partly corroborated by the statements of the witnesses heard . Moreover , it had regard to certain pieces of documentary evidence . The applicant , who was acquitted of all the other charges , including some charges of accepting bribes , was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment suspended for a DATE probationary period . When fixing the sentence , the court noted that the law provided for a prison term DATE . It went on to say :", "\u201c In fixing the sentence , the long period over which the offences were committed and the repetition of the offences were considered as aggravating circumstances . The fact that the offences were committed quite some time ago , that the accused has shown proof of good conduct in the meantime and that he previously led a lawabiding life were seen as mitigating factors ... as was the fact that the proceedings lasted a disproportionately long time , through no fault of the accused or his defence counsel .", "Given the above - mentioned mitigating and aggravating factors , a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment would appear to be proportionate to the nature and seriousness of the offence . The sentence is CARDINAL of the maximum DATE sentence ; however , in view of the aggravating circumstances , the court considered that a sentence in excess of DATE should be imposed . \u201c", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a plea of nullity and an appeal against the sentence and asked for a hearing to be held . ORG lodged an appeal against the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity pursuant to LAW , without having held a hearing . It found that the conditions laid down in Article CARDINAL ) subparagraph ( CARDINAL ) of LAW for reading out the statements of the witnesses living abroad had been met , as it had not been possible to summon these witnesses and the statements had been made in an adversarial manner at the pre - trial stage . Moreover , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s further submissions amounted to an inadmissible attempt to challenge the first instance court \u2019s assessment of evidence . The case was transferred to ORG to decide on the appeals .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , after having held a hearing in presence of the applicant and his counsel , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and partly granted ORG appeal , sentencing the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment of which DATE were suspended for a DATE probationary period . Its reasoning reads as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of the comprehensive sentencing guidelines the decision by the panel of judges ( ORG ) to impose a term of CARDINAL of the possible sentence , within the range of DATE , takes into account above all the numerous and significant mitigating factors . There is therefore no scope for further reduction ; by the same token , however , the sentence should not be increased .", "Nevertheless , the prosecuting authorities rightly point out that there are no grounds for suspending the sentence in full , not least on account of the nature of the offences , which also constitute a serious breach of official duty . Contrary to the view of the firstinstance court , it is therefore deemed necessary , if only on general crime prevention grounds ... for a portion of the sentence to be served in prison ... \u201d", "The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
