From DATE onwards the applicant , a former police officer discharged for health reasons , enjoyed disability benefits under ORG ( Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering \u2013 \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . He was allowed to earn by his own means a sum not exceeding MONEY ( NLG ) without losing his entitlement under the ORG . This he did by running a CARDINAL - man business as a trainer teaching people how to deal with stress .", "CARDINAL . The applicant states that he entered into an arrangement with an official of the competent social - security authority ( at that time called NORP ) , CARDINAL PERSON , which was intended to make possible his transition into independent self - employment without the need for additional social security benefits . He alleges that PERSON gave him the assurance that he would be permitted for a period of DATE to earn income over and above the sum of NLG CARDINAL , the purpose being to allow him to create cash reserves in case his health should deteriorate further . The agreement had been witnessed by another official , CARDINAL Mr S.", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant announced his intention to continue his business in the form of a limited liability company ( besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid ) . He wrote to the social - security authority ( re - named ORG and ORG ( Uitvoeringsinstelling sociale zekerheid voor overheid en onderwijs ; \u201c USZO \u201d ) ) asking it to confirm that this change would not affect the arrangements made during the time when he was self - employed . In the ensuing domestic proceedings the social security authorities submitted one or more letters which they stated had been sent in response , including CARDINAL dated DATE denying the applicant the confirmation sought . The applicant states that he never received any reply .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s business was transformed into a limited liability company . The shares were held by the applicant \u2019s wife . The applicant was its managing director and its only employee ; he entered its employ on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr D. , an official of the social - security authority ( by this time re - named LAW ( NORP werknemersverzekeringen ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) ) submitted an extensive investigation report implicating the applicant and his wife in suspected social - security fraud . According to the report , the applicant had defrauded the social - security system by declaring only his own income as an employee of the limited liability company but not the company \u2019s profits , which were declared as taxable income by his wife . The report included the following passage :", "\u201c It was arranged in addition that only what PERSON earned in self - employment after his discharge would be considered his residual earning capacity ( resterende verdiencapaciteit ) . The labour expert ( arbeidsdeskundige ) PERSON has stated that he discussed this extensively with PERSON , who could agree to that position and who indicated during the conversation that in DATE more growth was to be expected and that it was his intention to make his own living in self - employment with a corresponding gradual reduction to CARDINAL ( afbouw ) of the ORG benefits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision reducing the applicant \u2019s PERSON benefits with retroactive effect . On DATE ORG gave a second decision ordering the applicant to repay the excess .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged objections ( bezwaar ) against both decisions . As relevant to the case before the ORG , the applicant argued that as from DATE he had kept the competent authorities informed of developments as they occurred , withholding no information , and invoked the arrangement which he had agreed with PERSON He named PERSON as a witness .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , ORG gave a decision on DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s objections . It found that the applicant could reasonably have been aware that the total of his additional income \u2013 the sum of his salary and the profits of the limited liability company DATE was too high for him to be entitled to the full amount of his social - security benefits . The alleged arrangement to the contrary was not reflected in the case file , and in any case , whatever statements had been made ( assuming that any had been made at all ) had been made by a person lacking the requisite competence and could not bind ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal ( beroep ) with ORG ( rechtbank ) . As relevant to the case before ORG , he complained about ORG \u2019s failure to question PERSON and PERSON , which in his submission reflected a lack of due care affecting the quality of the investigation . He also submitted that PERSON had acted within his competence in making the agreement alleged .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , ORG gave judgment on DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The [ applicant ] has also stated that [ ORG ] officials had agreed with him that he would be permitted to earn unlimited income in addition to his ORG benefits for DATE . ORG has found no evidence of such an agreement in the documents available , nor is there any other reason to consider it plausible . On the contrary , it appears from the labour expert PERSON report of DATE that the [ applicant \u2019s ] income did in fact have to be taken into account . In addition , [ ORG ] answered the [ applicant ] \u2019s questions about the possibilities of obtaining income from work ( additional income ) in a letter of DATE , which letter incidentally the [ applicant ] claims not to have received . This letter states in no uncertain terms that [ ORG ] must always be informed immediately of any taking up of work and generation of income . But even without this letter it ought in reason to have been clear to the [ applicant ] that income can have an effect on the benefits . This ground of appeal therefore also fails . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal ( QUANTITY beroep ) with ORG ( ORG ) . As relevant to the case before the ORG , he again complained in his written submissions about ORG \u2019s failure to hear PERSON and PERSON as witnesses . He asked for them both to be heard as a witness in order to prove the existence of the agreement . He also prayed in aid his acquittal by the \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal , which had been given in the meantime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He did not , however , himself summon PERSON and PERSON as witnesses by registered letter or bailiff \u2019s writ .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant did not bring PERSON and PERSON along but restated his request to have them heard as witnesses . ORG decided to reopen its examination of the facts of the case in order to put an additional question to ORG . ORG replied to ORG question in writing . The applicant and ORG waived the right to a further hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE dismissing the further appeal without having heard any witnesses . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The agreement relied on by the [ applicant ] , which is denied by ORG , does not appear from the case file and no other credible case for its existence has been made out by the [ applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In response to a question by the ORG , the applicant acknowledged that he had made no attempt to summon PERSON and PERSON himself or bring them along to the hearing of either ORG or ORG , as permitted by section CARDINAL:CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Algemene wet bestuursrecht ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In parallel with the administrative proceedings outlined above , the applicant was prosecuted for social security fraud and forgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the single - judge chamber of the criminal division ( politierechter ) of the ORG convicted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to the \u2018 s - ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , ORG gave judgment on DATE acquitting the applicant . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The suspect states that he drew up a common plan with PERSON in DATE with a view to the gradual reduction to CARDINAL of the ORG benefits over DATE . The applicant further states that he made arrangements with that PERSON concerning the amount of additional income he would be allowed to earn in the said DATE period . The suspect understood these arrangements in the sense that he would in principle be allowed to earn unlimited additional income without losing his benefits .", "Prompted by the transformation of the CARDINAL - man business into CARDINAL or more limited liability companies the suspect sought confirmation from ORG that it would not matter for the arrangements made whether the provider of the income was the CARDINAL - man business or the said limited liability companies . To this end he got in touch with USZO on multiple occasions by means of letters . These letters were answered by USZO with automatised standard letters which did not address the specific situation in which the suspect found himself and which the suspect himself had raised with USZO .", "By the time this question was put by the suspect to USZO PERSON had been succeeded by PERSON The latter found no report in the USZO file of the arrangements mentioned by the suspect . It is not apparent from the file that any attempt was made to hear PERSON about the said arrangements within the framework of this criminal case .", "In view of the facts outlined above , ORG considers it plausible ( aannemelijk ) that the suspect made arrangements with PERSON in one form or another concerning the amount of permitted additional income within the framework of the gradual reduction to CARDINAL of his ORG benefits . It makes no difference that no report of any arrangements was found in the USZO file because no attempt has been made to verify the existence of these arrangements with Mr PERSON \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
