His lawyer was informed on DATE . Neither the applicant nor his lawyer attended the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG committed the applicant to stand trial in ORG on a count of involuntary homicide . ORG noted the conflicting opinions of the NORP experts who had seen the evidence in the NORP file , including the expert reports . By way of conclusion ORG stated :", "\u201c The investigation was started on a complaint of voluntary homicide . However , in the order closing the investigation the investigating judge charged PERSON with voluntary assault resulting in unintentional death . ORG and the civil party have also submitted that he should be committed for trial on that charge .", "The court finds that the medical evidence gathered in the course of the investigation suggests that ORG \u2019s death was a direct consequence of an intravenous injection of a solution that might have been ORG . The injection was contemporaneous with the death .", "In order to justify that act , PERSON has furnished conflicting and untrue accounts , stating firstly that his intention had been to help the girl to tan more quickly and subsequently to treat her for her anaemic condition . ORG does not help people to tan and at the material time ORG was a girl in perfect health , there being no reference in her medical records to any symptoms of anaemia .", "PERSON also lied about the chronology of the events when he affirmed that the injection had taken place TIME before the death . Lastly , the faked attempt to revive her and the use of mutually incompatible products on a living being can only be explained by an intention to conceal the cause of death .", "These factors taken as a whole constitute sufficient grounds for suspecting that PERSON gave the fatal injection not as a cure , but with the intention of causing death . \u201d", "ORG also issued an arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment was served on the applicant through the foreign public prosecutor \u2019s service . The applicant was summonsed on several occasions for preliminary questioning in order to establish his identity , but refused to comply with any of the summonses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against the committal order . In his written submissions he argued , inter alia , that the non bis in idem principle had been contravened and that an estoppel per rem judicatam arose , as , although LAW enabled aliens to be tried under LANGUAGE law if the victim of the crime was a NORP national , no prosecution could lie if there had been a final judgment overseas . In that connection , the applicant maintained that a discharge order had been made in his favour on DATE by the PERSON public prosecutor \u2019s office , an investigating body , and had become final with the decision of ORG of ORG of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s ground of appeal on the ground that it raised a new issue as neither the impugned judgment nor any of the procedural documents showed that the appellant had argued before ORG that the NORP judicial authorities had made a discharge order in his favour in respect of the same offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s NORP lawyer was informed that the applicant was required to appear before ORG from DATE . On DATE he applied to the President of ORG for an order for a supplementary measure to ensure that the case file contained all the documents from the NORP proceedings . The President dismissed that application by a letter of DATE in which he informed the lawyer that it was for the assize court with lawful jurisdiction in the case to determine whether such a measure was necessary .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , which was served on CARDINAL DATE , the President of ORG invited the applicant to report to the authorities within DATE . In accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , that order was published in ORG ) and displayed in the courtroom of ORG and on the front door to the town hall of the first administrative district of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to the President of ORG explaining that he was willing to attend the hearing on DATE provided that he received an assurance that he would remain at liberty throughout the duration of the trial . He said that he could not understand the conduct of the NORP authorities , who had failed throughout the investigation in GPE to take the discharge order that had been made in GPE into account . He added that it was his intention to be represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s NORP lawyer , assisted by a NORP lawyer , lodged submissions with ORG based on LAW . He sought permission to represent the applicant in his absence and to make submissions regarding various matters , namely : the existence of an estoppel per rem judicatam , a ruling on the estoppel issue by ORG acting on its own initiative , an order for an additional investigation to secure the communication of the investigation file by the NORP authorities and an examination of the scope of the discharge orders .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE delivered by ORG after it had heard ORG submissions calling for a DATE prison sentence , the applicant was found guilty of voluntary assault on his stepdaughter unintentionally causing her death and sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained in its judgment that if the applicant had reported to the authorities , it would have been able to discontinue the in absentia procedure and the applicant would have been able to make any requests that would assist in his defence when complying with that mandatory procedural requirement . It also reminded the applicant \u2019s lawyers , who were present at the hearing , that LAW prohibited representation for absent defendants and laid down that their submissions were inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In a civil judgment that was also delivered in absentia on CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered the applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG ) as reparation for non - pecuniary damage and LAW for costs and expenses . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had lodged a note to ORG in deliberations in which he had pointed out that the total lack of representation for the defence in the civil action constituted a breach of LAW . He complained in particular that he had not been informed of the heads of claim or of ORG submissions .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE made under LAW , the President of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeals against the judgments of ORG inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . A \u201c GPE \u201d warrant followed by an international warrant were issued , on dates which are not indicated in the case file , for the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the victim \u2019s father applied to ORG for an authority to execute ORG judgment ordering the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in damages . On CARDINAL DATE ORG granted that application and its decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . By a decision of DATE ORG ( ORG ) referred the case to ORG of ORG with a view to obtaining a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of LAW DATE on ORG , which lays down that judicial decisions shall not be recognised if recognition would be contrary to public policy in the ORG in which recognition is sought .", "CARDINAL . Among the reasons given by ORG for seeking a ruling was that it considered that the enforcement of the judicial decision obtained by proceedings in absentia such as those conducted in GPE might be regarded as contrary to NORP public policy , at least so far as the civil limb of the proceedings was concerned , as LAW laid down that everyone had the right to be heard ( PERSON auf rechtliches PERSON ) , and that that right incorporated the right to representation by a lawyer . Lastly , referring to LAW , ORG indicated that the decision delivered in absentia appeared to it to infringe the right to access to a court and , as regards the civil limb , the right to equality of arms .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG held : \u201c the court of the ORG in which enforcement is sought can , with respect to a defendant domiciled in that ORG and prosecuted for an intentional offence , take account , in relation to the public - policy clause in DATE the fact that the court of the ORG of origin refused to allow that person to have his defence presented unless he appeared in person \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following that judgment ORG dismissed the application by the victim \u2019s father of DATE for an order to enforce the civil judgment delivered by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE and detained pursuant to an order of the judge of ORG ( ORG ) pending the hearing of a request for his extradition . By an order of DATE the judge concerned dismissed a bail application by the applicant , despite his offer of a surety .", "However , on DATE ORG ( GPE ) quashed that order and ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release . It considered that the judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , against which there was no right of appeal under NORP law , raised a relative estoppel per rem judicatam , since the investigation could only be restarted in GPE if new evidence came to light . Once the courts in the state in which the offence had been committed had decided not to prosecute the applicant and had taken a final decision in that regard , he could not be detained for the purposes of extradition . Lastly , ORG held that LAW implementing the Schengen Agreement ( PERSON ) , which incorporates the non bis in idem principle , precluded the applicant \u2019s being retried in GPE in respect of the matters for which a final discharge order had been made in his favour in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure lays down that if the offence charged is classified by statute as a serious crime ( crime ) , the indictment division will commit the accused for trial by the assize court .", "There is an assize court in GPE and in each of the NORP d\u00e9partements . The court is composed of professional judges ( the president and CARDINAL wing members ) and a CARDINAL - person lay jury whose members are drawn by lot from a panel of CARDINAL jurors and CARDINAL substitute jurors chosen DATE by lot for jury service during the CARDINAL ordinary assize sessions held in the d\u00e9partement .", "The inquiry into the facts of a serious criminal case ( affaire criminelle ) must be conducted orally at the trial . At the end of the hearing , the court retires to decide on its verdict and sentence . LAW provides that the court must answer each of the questions contained in the operative provisions of the committal order by either \u201c yes \u201d or \u201c no \u201d and that each question must be put in the following way : \u201c Is the accused guilty of having committed such an offence ? \u201d . The votes of a majority comprising CARDINAL jurors are required for the accused to be convicted of the offence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the accused \u2019s presence at the trial , LAW lays down that the committal order , which is valid only if it contains a statement and the legal classification of the alleged offences , shall be accompanied by a warrant for the accused \u2019s arrest , specifying his or her identity . LAW provides that an accused who is on bail must surrender to custody at the latest on DATE the hearing in the assize court and that the arrest warrant shall be executed if , after being duly summonsed and without due cause , he or she fails to attend on DATE for questioning by the president of the assize court . Article CARDINAL provides for the accused to be tried in absentia if he or she can not be apprehended and does not attend the trial ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As soon as the committal order has become final and the accused , after being detained , has been transferred to the prison in the locality where the assize court will sit , the president of the assize court must , in accordance with LAW , establish the accused \u2019s identity and ensure that he or she has been duly served with the committal order . LAW also requires the president to invite the accused to choose a lawyer to assist with his or her defence ; if the accused fails to do so , the president must assign counsel to represent him or her . This is because LAW makes the accused \u2019s representation at the trial mandatory and provides that if no counsel appears on behalf of the accused , the president must on his or her own initiative assign the accused counsel . LAW lays down that if an accused refuses to appear at the trial after being summonsed to do so by a bailiff the president may order that he or she be brought before the court by force . The president may also order that the hearing shall proceed notwithstanding the accused \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the procedure for trial in absentia , the main provisions of LAW are as follows :", "\u201c If , after the committal order has been made by the indictment division , it has not proved possible to apprehend the accused or he or she has failed to report within DATE after the service of notice at his or her home to do so or the accused has absconded after reporting or being apprehended , the president of the assize court or , in his absence , the president of the court in the locality where the assize court will sit , or the judge replacing him or her , shall issue an order requiring the accused to report within a further period of DATE , failing which the accused shall be declared an outlaw , the exercise of his or her rights as a citizen shall be suspended , his or her assets shall be sequestered for the duration of the contempt , he or she shall not be entitled to take part in any court proceedings during that period , the criminal proceedings shall continue and any person knowing where the accused is to be found shall be under a duty to report that information . The order shall also contain particulars of the serious crime ( crime ) and of the arrest warrant . \u201d", "\u201c Within DATE that order shall be published in CARDINAL of the newspapers in the d\u00e9partement and displayed on the door to the accused \u2019s home , the door to the town hall in the district where the accused lives and in the courtroom of the assize court . ORG shall send an office copy of the order to the director of the ORG lands department in the locality where the accused who is in contempt resides . \u201d", "\u201c After DATE the court shall rule on the contempt issue . \u201d", "\u201c No lawyer ( avocat or avou\u00e9 ) may attend on behalf of an accused who is in contempt . However , if it is totally impossible for the accused to comply with the injunction contained in the order made pursuant to LAW , his or her close relatives or friends may explain the reason for his or her absence . \u201d", "\u201c If the court finds that due cause has been shown , it shall order a stay of the accused \u2019s trial and , if necessary , of the order for the sequestration of his or her assets for a period commensurate with the nature of the cause shown and the distance to be travelled . \u201d", "\u201c Except in those circumstances , the order committing the accused for trial before the assize court , the affidavit of service of the order requiring the person in contempt to report and the affidavits confirming that that order has been published and displayed shall be read out . After that has been done and after it has heard the submissions of ORG the court shall make an order for trial in absentia . If any of the formalities prescribed by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL have been omitted , the court shall declare the contempt procedure void and order it to be restarted from the stage where the first unlawful act occurred . Otherwise , the court shall deliver its verdict on the accusation without the assistance of the jurors and without being entitled to take into account any circumstances mitigating the guilt of the person in contempt in the event of a conviction . The court shall then decide the civil parties\u2019 claims . \u201d", "\u201c If the person in contempt is convicted , his or her assets shall , if no confiscation order has been made , remain sequestered and a sequestration account shall be delivered to the person entitled to receive it once the conviction has become irrevocable as a result of the expiry of the limitation period for purging the contempt . \u201d", "\u201c Once all the publication procedures prescribed by [ LAW ] have been carried out , the convicted person shall be subject to all the statutory disabilities . \u201d", "\u201c Persons in contempt shall not be entitled to appeal on points of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
