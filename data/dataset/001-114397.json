She was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , County Down , with ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was assaulted by her husband PERSON at their home , after they had been out drinking . She suffered a severed artery on the right side of her head , which required CARDINAL stitches . She also suffered multiple bruising and sustained a blow to her head when she fell against a banister .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintains that this was the last in a series of assaults which had been carried out by her husband in the course of DATE marriage . She made a statement to the police . The Government maintain that , in her statement , the applicant herself had accepted that , prior to DATE , she had only been subjected to emotional abuse and that it was only in DATE that the abuse turned physical . They further maintain that the applicant had not complained to the police at any time prior to the offence of DATE .", "CARDINAL PERSON was arrested and charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to LAW CARDINAL of the Offences Against the Person Act CARDINAL . He was granted bail on CARDINAL DATE and required to reside at an alternative address to the matrimonial home .", "CARDINAL . There was a reconciliation between the applicant and her husband , further to which he successfully applied to have his bail conditions varied so that he could return home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant told the police that she no longer wished PERSON to be prosecuted . Nonetheless , the police file was sent to ORG of GPE ( \u201c the PPS \u201d ) , where it was allocated to a senior public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . In light of the applicant \u2019s wish that PERSON not be prosecuted , the senior public prosecutor considered the case . The prosecutor did so according to the ORG \u2019s policy for prosecuting cases of domestic violence , which provides that cases will not automatically be stopped because the victim does not want to proceed and that , as a general rule , the ORG will prosecute cases where there is sufficient evidence and no factors preventing them from doing so .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor sought further information , including a transcript of the CARDINAL emergency telephone call , medical reports , police notebook entries , the serious crime scene log , photographs of the scene and injuries , further statements to corroborate the applicant \u2019s account , information on the current status of the relationship , and a risk assessment . Following consultation with the regional prosecutor , it was decided that the prosecution should proceed , regardless of the applicant \u2019s statement withdrawing the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The reconciliation between the applicant and her husband proved to be only temporary and , when the applicant was informed of the ORG \u2019s decision , she reinstated her complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PPS concluded that there was insufficient evidence of intention to do grievous bodily harm , as required for prosecution under section CARDINAL of LAW . The charge was therefore reduced to CARDINAL of grievous bodily harm contrary to section CARDINAL of the same LAW . The Government maintain that there was no discussion with Mr ORG \u2019s representatives regarding this decision .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appeared for arraignment before GPE ORG on DATE . He entered a plea of not guilty .", "CARDINAL . The case was then listed for mention in ORG on DATE . The Government maintain that prosecuting counsel expressly requested a meeting with the applicant to explain the nature of the section CARDINAL charge against PERSON . On DATE Mr PERSON was re - arraigned and entered a plea of guilty .", "CARDINAL . He appeared for sentencing on DATE . The sentencing judge received inter alia a victim impact report on the applicant , photographs of her injuries and the transcript of the CARDINAL telephone call . He also had before him a probation service report He also heard a plea in mitigation from Mr ORG \u2019s counsel . Counsel accepted that , had there been a record of violence , an immediate custodial sentence would have been inevitable ; however , he submitted that there was no such record in Mr PERSON \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The judge sentenced Mr PERSON to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , which was suspended for DATE . The judge \u2019s sentencing remarks were as follows :", "\u201c Now PERSON I have looked carefully at this case . It is on the face of it and remains a serious matter . Conviction under LAW carries a maximum sentence of several GPE imprisonment . Your background is a surprising one to find for someone on such a serious charge of violence . You have no criminal record , you are a man who has lived now for DATE of your life without getting into the slightest trouble ; on the contrary , you have held down a number of very significant posts in your life and the reference provided to me shows me a side of your character which is very much to your credit . Sadly the events of TIME betray a different side to your character , which perhaps only emerged with consumption of alcohol . It seems that , although I did n\u2019t choose to go into the detail too closely , so as not to cause distress to other persons in this case , in particular your wife , PERSON , it would appear that you felt upset and angry at what you perceived to be your wife \u2019s conduct on TIME in question . Both of you had had something to drink but it is your drink that I am concentrating on . It seems that you reacted to this by behaving in a cowardly and very unworthy way by striking her , by knocking her down and it appears that during the course of that she sustained an injury .", "Now it is not for me to start to speculate on why precisely this happened . It seems , again without causing undue distress to her , that your relationship maybe was not what it might have been and what one might hope in a happy marriage although it is right to say that there seems to be no previous incident of this type . Nevertheless , as a result of your behaviour and perhaps for various other reasons , your marriage has now been damaged apparently irreparably and your wife has suffered this great trauma and of course your own position is not an enviable one either . I have read the victim impact statement on PERSON , who I understand is in the court , and it clearly demonstrates ... that she has suffered considerably through your behaviour . She has now had to make major life changes . She has gained some assistance with support of the counselling into her own life . She will have to undergo what the doctor describes as a tortuous period of readjustment . Other matters are speculated upon which I do n\u2019t propose to read out in open court but in essence this ghastly affair has caused chaos in its wake for her and indeed it is right to say for you and again it sadly demonstrates to the court how drink can cause such a ORG change in some people \u2019s personality .", "When I first read these papers it seemed to me inevitable that you would go to prison : the court will not and can not tolerate violence perpetrated against women in particular and that was my first instinct . I have read carefully , however , what has been said about you , both from the reference which has been provided and which speaks very highly of your otherwise good character and your good nature . I also note carefully the report presented to the court by the highly experienced Probation Officer Ms [ B ] who has very considerable experience of this type of case and I am impressed by the fact that she says of you and I quote :", "\u2018 The defendant presents as ashamed and embarrassed with regard to the violent nature of the assault he perpetrated on his wife . The complete loss of control evidenced by PERSON on this date suggests some form of build up of pressure around the relationship and the trigger on this occasion is what is alleged to have occurred on TIME this incident.\u2019", "She says also :", "\u2018 there is little doubt from my discussion with the defendant that his remorse for perpetrating this assault is genuine . There is evidence of some distorted thinking which supports controlling an aggressive behaviour in his psyche and this could be addressed through various appropriate programmes.\u2019", "Now I understand that you have actually even before coming to court engaged in counselling and have completed a number of counselling sessions . ... Well I have to concentrate in particular on the wrong done to your wife and it is for that wrong that you appear before the court DATE faced with the very real possibility of going to prison . I thought very carefully about a number of possible ways of disposing of the case . You pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and ... you will get full credit for that . Clearly that is something that should not be lightly brushed to CARDINAL side . Very often in cases of this type the defendant will brazen it out and require the injured party to give evidence , which as we all know is a highly distressing matter for any witness but particularly when it is a crime committed within the family . You have spared your wife that and that maybe demonstrates to me in a better way than any written words can a different side to your character and supports the view of the experienced probation officer that you genuinely feel ashamed and remorseful .", "So in DATE and not without some considerable thought I have decided that the best way to deal with your case is to impose a prison sentence but not to make it immediate . I had thought about a probation order but it seems to me that you have completed a number of counselling sessions and whilst I am absolutely certain that further work with counselling might help , there is no reason why you could n\u2019t undertake that voluntarily . I do n\u2019t think it requires , in the particular circumstances that you are in , and the fact that you and your wife are now estranged , I do n\u2019t think that it requires me to do that . ... [ A]lthough I can see advantages to probation in this particular case I can not see that it is the preferred course .", "The sentence of the court therefore in this case is CARDINAL of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment to mark the seriousness of this offence and I am going to suspend the operation of that sentence for DATE . That is a long period of time longer than usual but it is a mark of the seriousness of the offence and also to give you an opportunity to put this behind you . You have already apologised . You have already indicated that you feel remorseful and it will give you and your wife , I hope , an opportunity to draw a line under this sad affair . Clearly your relationship has been seriously damaged by what has happened and you and your wife will have to rebuild your lives from a different prospectus . It will also remind you , PERSON , that if you get into any trouble in DATE I am sure it wo n\u2019t be against your wife , but if you assault anyone else in such a serious manner you will go to prison , you understand that , and I have to warn you that if you do come back before the court within DATE you may well receive this sentence together with any sentence that is thought appropriate for any future offence . I hope given your background that it is only an academic fear and with control of your drinking habits and addressing the aggression that seems to be latent with drink , which you have already started to do , that the court will not see you back again .", "I am obliged by law to consider the making of a compensation order . I have thought about this carefully in this case . I do n\u2019t think it is appropriate in this particular case I think it is a matter best left to be dealt with by the criminal injury legislation and therefore the court , as I say , imposes a sentence of DATE suspended for DATE . If you commit no offence within DATE you will hear nothing more of this . You are now free to go . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the PPS seeking their views on the sentence . A meeting was then arranged for DATE between the senior public prosecutor and the applicant ; at the meeting the prosecutor explained the reasons for the prosecution decision in the case . According to the Government , the applicant indicated that she was content with the ORG \u2019s actions but remained unhappy with the sentence . A further letter was then sent on DATE by different legal representatives , raising concerns as to the handling of the case and the information provided by the ORG . The senior public prosecutor replied on DATE , referring to the meeting of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then complained to various public bodies in GPE about the excessive leniency of the sentence but without success . In particular , by letter dated DATE , the Attorney - General stated he did not have the power to apply to have the sentence reviewed by ORG ( on the grounds that it was \u201c unduly lenient \u201d ) as that power was limited to the most serious offences ( see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought compensation for her injuries . This was initially refused by ORG , on the basis that the physical injury suffered by the applicant was not sufficiently serious to reach the minimum level of severity required and there was no evidence of a disabling mental illness . The applicant requested a review of that decision . This led the ORG to refer the applicant for examination and assessment by a psychiatrist . Following receipt of the psychiatrist \u2019s report , on DATE the ORG offered the applicant compensation of ORG CARDINAL . The applicant accepted that offer .", "CARDINAL . The offences covered by sections DATE and CARDINAL of the Offences Against the Person Act DATE are CARDINAL of the CARDINAL principal offences against the person where bodily harm is caused ( the other , less serious offence is actual bodily harm contrary to section QUANTITY ) . Section CARDINAL carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life . By virtue of ORG ( No . CARDINAL ) ( GPE ) Order CARDINAL , in GPE section CARDINAL carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . For GPE , there are no sentencing guidelines for section CARDINAL assaults in the context of domestic violence . ORG in GPE has stated that , where guidelines promulgated by ORG and GPE accord with local experience , they may be followed ( Attorney - General \u2019s Reference ( Number DATE ) ORG and others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . ORG and GPE has promulgated guidelines entitled \u201c Overarching Principles : Domestic Violence \u201d . Aggravating factors set out in the guidelines include : abuse of trust and abuse of power , violence where the victim is particularly vulnerable , where there is an impact on children , the exploitation of contact arrangements with a child in order to commit an offence , a proven history of violence or threats by the offender in a domestic setting , a history of disobedience to court orders , and where the victim is forced to leave home as a consequence of the offence . Mitigating factors include positive good character ( although good character in relation to conduct outside the home should generally be of no relevance where there is a proven pattern of behaviour ) and provocation ( although assertions of provocation should be treated with great care ) . Other factors influencing sentence include the wishes of the victim . Here , the guidelines state ( at paragraphs CARDINAL.CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c As a matter of general principle , a sentence imposed for an offence of violence should be determined by the seriousness of the offence , not by the expressed wishes of the victim .", "There are a number of reasons why it may be particularly important that this principle is observed in a case of domestic violence :", "\u2022 it is undesirable that a victim should feel a responsibility for the sentence imposed ;", "\u2022 there is a risk that a plea for mercy made by a victim will be induced by threats made by , or by a fear of , the offender ;", "\u2022 the risk of such threats will be increased if it is generally believed that the severity of the sentence may be affected by the wishes of the victim .", "Nonetheless , there may be circumstances in which the court can properly mitigate a sentence to give effect to the expressed wish of the victim that the relationship be permitted to continue . The court must , however , be confident that such a wish is genuine , and that giving effect to it will not expose the victim to a real risk of further violence . Critical conditions are likely to be the seriousness of the offence and the history of the relationship . It is vitally important that the court has up - to - date information in a pre - sentence report and victim personal statement .", "Either the offender or the victim ( or both ) may ask the court to take into consideration the interests of any children and to impose a less severe sentence . The court will wish to have regard not only to the effect on the children if the relationship is disrupted but also to the likely effect on the children of any further incidents of domestic violence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government have provided statistics on those convicted of section CARDINAL offences in GPE for DATE . The most common sentence was an immediate custodial sentence ( with the average sentences for DATE being CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ) . However , a significant proportion of offenders received suspended custodial sentences instead . For instance , in DATE , of CARDINAL offenders , CARDINAL received immediate custodial sentences and CARDINAL received suspended custodial sentences ( the remainder were given community orders , fines or conditional discharges ) .", "CARDINAL . Sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE allow the Attorney - General to apply to have sentences for certain offences reviewed by ORG . He or she may do so when a particular sentence appears to him or her to be unduly lenient . An offence under section CARDINAL does not fall within the provisions of sections CARDINAL and DATE and thus the Attorney - General can not apply to have a sentence for that offence reviewed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( GPE ) Order DATE provides civil protection for victims of domestic violence in GPE . LAW allows a court to make an \u201c occupation order \u201d , which can require a respondent to leave a house . Articles CARDINAL provide for the making of non - molestation orders . Article CARDINAL makes it an offence without a reasonable excuse to contravene a non - molestation order or , where a non - molestation order is also in force , an occupation order . The maximum penalty is a fine or CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( LAW ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) ( GPE ) Order DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG launched the above , DATE strategy in DATE . The foreword states that domestic violence is a crime and is not acceptable in any circumstances , and that the strategy focuses on preventative measures and on the provision of better protection , justice and support services for victims and their children . Initiatives include media advertising and the introduction of a free , TIME , domestic violence telephone helpline .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON the defendant pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving . He had been drinking . The victim was his friend , who had been in the car he was driving . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . When he appealed against his sentence , the victim \u2019s mother and sister supported his appeal , stating that the length of the sentence was adding to their grief . ORG reduced the sentence to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . In doing so , it observed :", "\u201c We mean no disrespect to the mother and sister of the deceased , but the opinions of the victim , or the surviving members of the family , about the appropriate level of sentence do not provide any sound basis for reassessing a sentence . If the victim feels utterly merciful towards the criminal , and some do , the crime has still been committed and must be punished as it deserves . If the victim is obsessed with vengeance , which can in reality only be assuaged by a very long sentence , as also happens , the punishment can not be made longer by the court than would otherwise be appropriate . Otherwise cases with identical features would be dealt with in widely differing ways leading to improper and unfair disparity , and even in this particular case , as the short judgment has already indicated , the views of the members of the family of the deceased are not absolutely identical .", "If carried to its logical conclusion the process would end up by imposing unfair pressures on the victims of crime or the survivors of a crime resulting in death , to play a part in the sentencing process which many of them would find painful and distasteful . This is very far removed from the court being kept properly informed of the anguish and suffering inflicted on the victims by the crime .", "In the present case , however , the ORG is concerned not with the judgment of the deceased \u2019s mother and sister about the level of sentence imposed on the applicant , but with the clear evidence , which we accept , that by its very length the sentence on [ the defendant ] is adding to the grief and anxiety which they are suffering consequent on [ the victim \u2019s ] death . When the mother and sister of the deceased and the rest of the family have already suffered so much , we do not think that these adverse consequences of this particular sentence should be disregarded .", "In mercy to them we shall reduce the sentence as far as we can , consistent with our continuing public duty to impose appropriate sentences for those who cause death by driving dangerously under the influence of drink . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
