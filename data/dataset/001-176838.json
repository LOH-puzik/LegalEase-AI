The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the premises in which the applicant ran a caf\u00e9 were searched , based on a search warrant of DATE issued by ORG . The applicant was found in a back room of the caf\u00e9 , weighing and packaging QUANTITY of cocaine , with a sum of MONEY ( ORG ) in the pockets of his trousers . He was arrested .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the GPE ORG issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant on the ground that he was strongly suspected ( dringend verd\u00e4chtig ) of commercial trafficking of a substantial amount of drugs and that there was a risk of his absconding . It considered that the applicant could face a considerable prison sentence for the offences in question , that he did not have strong ties to GPE , that he was unemployed and living on social security , and that he could easily abscond to GPE .", "CARDINAL . At a detention review hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel applied for the applicant \u2019s release on bail , stating that the applicant \u2019s family were able and willing to furnish the amount of bail to be determined by the court . DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel withdrew the application after the court indicated that bail would not be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant , charging him with CARDINAL counts of commercial trafficking of a substantial amount of drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG decided to open the trial against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL of CARDINAL counts of commercial trafficking in a substantial amount of drugs and acquitted him on the other CARDINAL counts . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered the continuation of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both the applicant and ORG lodged appeals against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision ordering his continued detention and asked for the detention order to be set aside or its execution to be stayed . He argued that there was no incentive for him to abscond . The strength of his ties to GPE rendered his absconding to GPE unlikely . He had lived in GPE for DATE , had been married for DATE , and had CARDINAL children , aged DATE . His parents and his brother also lived in GPE . His only tie to GPE , by contrast , was his GPE holiday home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG decided not to grant the applicant \u2019s appeal against the continued detention order and to refer the matter to ORG . It considered that it was possible that the applicant would be sentenced to a significant prison sentence on appeal . There was , hence , an incentive for him to abscond which was not counterbalanced by his existing social ties to GPE . In that regard , it noted that the applicant and his entire family had lived on social security since DATE , that his command of the NORP language was insufficient and that he had no prospects of employment . Considering that his wife was also a NORP national , that his children were of a young age and that his parents owned a holiday home in GPE , there was a risk that the applicant would abscond to GPE with his family . This risk could not be adequately remedied by reporting requirements or payment of security .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It limited the basis of the detention order to the count on which he had been convicted and annulled it for the CARDINAL counts on which he had been acquitted by ORG . Yet , referring to the reasoning of ORG and underlining that the applicant had no legal employment whereas he had family ties to GPE , it considered that there continued to be a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further appeal against that decision . After essentially reiterating his earlier submission as to why there was no risk of his absconding , he stated that such risk could , in any event , be remedied by imposing a less severe measure . In that regard , he proposed that his family furnish security of EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . After ORG decided not to grant the applicant \u2019s further appeal and to refer the matter to ORG , that court informed the applicant \u2019s counsel , in a letter dated DATE , that it was considering staying the execution of the detention order . It asked the applicant to clarify the offer made and requested that the necessary means be given to him by his family in a manner that allowed him to dispose freely of those means and to furnish the security himself . The lawful origin of those means had to be credibly demonstrated .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel informed ORG that the applicant \u2019s family was able and willing to furnish security of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the court and to demonstrate credibly the lawful origin of those means . The family was , however , unwilling to put the money at the applicant \u2019s disposal as they were unwilling to run the risk of having the repayment claim attached for payment against future claims the authorities might have against the applicant . He added that , if the applicant had to assume that the security would be forfeited in any event , that is to say , even if he did not abscond , because the repayment claim would be attached for payment against other claims , the security could not effectively remedy a risk of his absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal . It endorsed the assessments of ORG and ORG as to the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding and noted that the sentence the applicant risked incurring was not limited to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , for ORG had appealed against ORG judgment , seeking the applicant \u2019s conviction on the CARDINAL counts on which he had been acquitted . It stated that it would nonetheless consider staying the execution of the detention order if security were furnished . As long as the applicant \u2019s family was not willing to put the necessary means at his own disposal it was , however , not ready to do so , arguing that this unwillingness indicated that his family lacked confidence in him and concluding that the family ties appeared not to be strong enough to prevent him from risking forfeiture of the security by absconding . ORG furthermore found that there was a risk that the applicant would commit more drug - related offences if he were released from detention and also based the detention order , by way of subsidiarity , on a risk of reoffending . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judgment of DATE became final , following ORG decision to discontinue the proceedings in relation to one of the charges and the withdrawal of appeals by both the applicant and ORG .", "CARDINAL . That DATE , the GPE ORG stayed the execution of the detention order against the applicant on a number of conditions , including that either he or another person furnish security of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Upon the furnishing of that amount by another person that same day , the applicant was released from detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against ORG decision not to stay the execution of the detention order against him , lodged on DATE , for adjudication , without providing reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
