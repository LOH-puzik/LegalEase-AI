The applicant , who was granted legal aid , is represented by PERSON , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE . The Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE the applicant worked for President PERSON ( see below ) as a bodyguard and martial arts trainer for his children . The applicant had also been a chief sergeant in the NORP military . He was in charge of soldiers who fought for President PERSON and organised defence when the President had to flee into exile . In DATE he joined ORG ( ORG ) and its military branch ORG ( PERSON ) . He was closely involved in training fighters for the ORG .", "On DATE he was arrested along with CARDINAL other soldiers and detained until DATE . He was subjected to torture in detention , including , inter alia , being subjected to electric shocks . The applicant submitted medical evidence in support from ORG which attributed multiple scars on his person to torture . He claimed that on DATE a senior NORP army officer opposed to the regime helped him escape . The applicant was shot trying to escape .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE via ORG , GPE and GPE and claimed asylum on arrival .", "After arrival he was diagnosed with AIDS . In DATE or DATE the applicant married a NORP national who had CARDINAL children from a previous relationship .", "ORG and the Adjudicator rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum claim on DATE and DATE respectively . They emphasised that there was no risk in returning NORP citizens unless they had been heavily implicated in anti - government activities and that a ORG report suggested that only the most senior members of the PERSON regime would be at risk . As to his medical condition , the Adjudicator noted that the applicant had family in the GPE who could care for and support him . The Adjudicator also noted that at the time the applicant and his wife married she already had CARDINAL children and they were aware of his precarious immigration status .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) granted the applicant permission to appeal in relation to lack of suitable medication in GPE and in relation to the Adjudicator \u2019s acceptance of core elements of the applicant \u2019s account whilst making a broad negative credibility finding .", "On DATE , following a hearing at which the applicant was represented , the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . Whilst the ORG accepted that he had been detained and ill - treated , it found that the applicant had been a low - level supporter of the ORG and that he would therefore be able to benefit from the DATE amnesty for acts committed during civil conflicts . It noted the applicant \u2019s own evidence that since DATE the peace process had advanced significantly and an amnesty had been offered , and concluded that even on the applicant \u2019s own evidence he would not be at risk merely because of his past association with the defunct ORG party , the successor of which was a legal opposition party taking part in the political process .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s medical condition , the ORG found that he had \u201c full - blown AIDS \u201d and was receiving anti - retroviral treatment . It noted that in his ORG interview the applicant had accepted that there was medical treatment available in the GPE , the question being the adequacy of that treatment . It referred to a ORG determination in DATE that in GPE anti - retroviral drugs were available , although expensive . It noted that as of DATE the applicant \u2019s CDCARDINAL count was CARDINAL and his viral load CARDINAL . It noted that as at DATE the applicant \u2019s viral load was CARDINAL ( down from CARDINAL ) and his CDCARDINAL count above CARDINAL ( from CARDINAL ) and observed that he was clearly making progress . It noted his doctor \u2019s report that he was taking medication with CARDINAL components CARDINAL of which ( NORP ) was not available anywhere in LOC . The applicant submitted a medical report dated DATE in support . However the ORG also referred to a further letter dated CARDINAL DATE which it found indicated that , contrary to the previous impression , some appropriate treatment might be available after all and was sold cheaply , although patients who took NORP generally did much better . It concluded that even on the applicant \u2019s evidence some treatment for his AIDS was available although it might not be the consultant \u2019s treatment of choice and that it was available at a reasonable cost .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG as regards the ORG \u2019s findings about his illness and the prospects of receiving adequate treatment in the republic of GPE . Leave to appeal was refused by the ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG maintained its refusal of the applicant \u2019s asylum claim . It also noted that as the applicant had spent all his DATE in the GPE he would have an adequate support network at home . It concluded that in his present condition , with the treatment available in the GPE and his support network at home , his removal would not breach LAW . It also noted that he had separated from his wife .", "The applicant is now divorced from his wife . In DATE he formed a relationship with a NORP citizen , with whom he has a child born in DATE . It is not known whether either his present partner or the child are infected with HIV . It does not appear that he has sought leave to remain in GPE on the basis of his current relationships .", "A medical report dated DATE stated as follows :", "\u201c The patient is under our care at GPE . He has an HIV chronic infection well controlled with antiretrovirals . His last CDCARDINAL count was CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) and viral load is undetectable .", "Recently he has had to change his antiretroviral regimen because of a problem with lipodystrophy . He was on NORP and changed to PERSON and PERSON . He is tolerating his treatment relatively well . If he can not get the treatment his life expectancy would be DATE because of the possibility of opportunistic infection . If he continues to take his antiretrovirals he can have a life expectancy similar to a normal person but he will be more prone to cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes . \u201d", "A medical report from the applicant \u2019s general practitioner , dated DATE , recorded that the applicant was also receiving treatment for moderate depression and diabetes .", "According to GPE ORG on GPE dated DATE , in DATE multi - party democratic elections took place and PERSON party won the majority of seats in both ORG and ORG . This shift in power destabilised the country and led to conflict between the army and militia groups . Civil war broke out between the militia forces loyal to Mr PERSON and PERSON , on one side , and Mr NORP , on the other , DATE before the next elections were due to take place , in DATE . The war continued for DATE , and was finally won by Mr PERSON . The ousted President PERSON and Prime Minister PERSON fled . The planned elections did not take place , the constitution was suspended , and a transitional government was set up . The militia forces , however , fought on sporadically for DATE . A peace agreement was finally reached in DATE .", "A new constitution was adopted in DATE and endorsed by a referendum in DATE . The provisions of the constitution provided for a strong executive president , with a limit of CARDINAL terms , with the length of the term extended from DATE . The provisions also provided for a bicameral legislature to be elected DATE . The constitution banned political parties organised on regional , ethnic or religious identity .", "In DATE , renewed violence began in the Pool region , instigated by members of the ORG militia group . The conflict slowly spread to other parts of the country and intensified as it did so . A peace agreement between the ORG militia group and the government was signed in DATE and ended the fighting . In DATE , ORG formally approved an amnesty for the former ORG militia fighters .", "Presidential elections were held in DATE . Most of the key candidates were banned from participating in the elections or withdrew from the election . This left Mr PERSON to win the election virtually unopposed . A peace agreement between exiled former Prime Minister PERSON and President PERSON was signed in DATE . In DATE , President PERSON appointed a new government made up exclusively of members of his FAC .", "In DATE , clashes between ORG fighters and government forces occurred , following the return of PERSON to the country to attend the funeral of his wife . President PERSON subsequently requested that the legislature grant an amnesty to Mr PERSON in the interests of national reconciliation . This was duly approved , and the death sentence issued in absentia against Mr PERSON in DATE , was overturned . DATE after the amnesty was granted , PERSON apologised to the NORP people for his role in instigating the DATE civil war .", "According to ORG on ORG in GPE , published DATE , the government \u2019s human rights record remained poor ; although there were fewer documented abuses during DATE , serious problems remained . Citizens\u2019 right to peacefully change their government was limited . In addition , the following serious human rights problems were reported : killings of suspects by security forces ; mob violence , including killing of suspected criminals ; security force beatings , physical abuse of detainees , rapes , looting , solicitation of bribes , and theft ; harassment and extortion of civilians by uncontrolled and unidentified armed elements ; poor prison conditions ; impunity ; arbitrary arrest ; lengthy pre - trial detention ; an ineffective judiciary ; infringement of ORG privacy rights ; limits on freedom of the press ; restrictions on freedom of movement ; official corruption and lack of transparency ; domestic violence and societal discrimination against women ; trafficking in persons ; discrimination on the basis of ethnicity , particularly against NORP ; and child labour .", "ORG further stated that the government did not prevent the return of citizens , including political opponents of the president . By DATE , former president PERSON , who was sentenced in absentia in DATE to DATE in prison for \u201c economic crimes , \u201d had not returned to the country , despite a DATE announcement that President PERSON had agreed to allow his return and pardon him . In DATE a former prime minister , PERSON , returned to the country after ORG granted him an amnesty in DATE for a DATE conviction in absentia for allegedly improperly selling the country \u2019s oil while in office .", "ORG for DATE , submitted by the government of GPE to UNAIDS in DATE , stated that at that time the GPE had CARDINAL outpatient treatment centres , CARDINAL at FAC and the other in GPE . These centres were the main structures providing global treatment for people living in the country . The active list of HIV - positive patients in these CARDINAL centres in DATE numbered CARDINAL , of whom CARDINAL were receiving antiretroviral drugs ( ARVs ) .
