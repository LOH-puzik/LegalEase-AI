ORG invited observations from the authorities of GPE , who asserted that they continued to detain the applicant throughout the entirety of the proceedings , having temporarily transferred only actual custody . In their view , the LAW relating to LAW DATE and the LAW thereto of DATE did not take precedence over LAW of ORG , particularly LAW thereof ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE government , in observations received by ORG on DATE , submitted that the applicant was in the temporary custody of ORG and thus outside the jurisdiction of the host ORG . However , if an application of asylum was received , the government would consider and decide on it , \u201c whatever the result \u201d . The host ORG would , however , defer to the assessment of ORG as to whether the applicant could be returned safely to GPE ; any safety risks identified by ORG were to be resolved by it under its witness - protection programme .

ORG Victims and Witnesses Unit , in response to an order given by ORG , carried out a risk assessment on the issue of protective measures for the applicant and for certain other witnesses in a different case who had raised similar concerns . This assessment included reviewing transcripts of the applicant \u2019s testimony , evaluating the current political situation in GPE and meeting with the Director of the detention centre where the applicant had been held ( the PERSON detention centre , GPE ) . ORG concluded that following his return to GPE the applicant would not be exposed to any additional risk to his security or psychological or physical well - being as a result of his testimony before ORG . As to the specific fears which the applicant had expressed that his testimony about influential figures in the NORP government put him at risk if he returned to GPE , ORG expressed the view that the applicant \u2019s evidence did not reveal anything to the NORP authorities of which they were not aware . Moreover , \u201c the desire of [ the applicant ] to implicate the NORP authorities , and particularly President PERSON , [ was ] public knowledge \u201d .

However , LAW required the application and interpretation of the applicable law to be consistent with internationally recognised human rights . ORG had therefore first to consider the implications of the applicant \u2019s asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . It was for the GPE authorities , not for ORG , to consider the applicant \u2019s asylum request . ORG had , however , to provide a proper opportunity for the GPE authorities to do so and for the applicant to make his case . It was for the GPE authorities to decide whether it was necessary to intervene in order to take control of the applicant until such time as the asylum proceedings , and any appellate phase in those proceedings , were concluded .", "CARDINAL . ORG instructed the ORG to allow the applicant reasonable access to the lawyers representing him for the asylum request ; to submit a report on the domestic procedure to be followed in order for the GPE to be able to discharge its obligations pursuant to the asylum request before the applicant was returned to GPE ( unless asylum was granted ) ; to liaise with the NORP authorities , prior to any return of the applicant to GPE , in order to determine the extent of , and to implement , any protective measures that the Registry considered necessary , and report back accordingly ; and to monitor the position of the applicant following his return to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the GPE government requested leave to appeal against ORG decision . GPE submitted a document indicating that it took issue with the decision , which the ORG decided to treat as a request for leave to appeal . On DATE ORG granted both requests . On an unknown later date ORG decided that the grant of leave to appeal to the GPE was ultra vires and therefore improper .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG reiterated that it was for the GPE", "\u201c to decide whether , according to its national and international obligations , it [ would ] take control of the witness until such time as the asylum application and any appellate phase in those proceedings [ were ] determined \u201d .", "Furthermore ,", "\u201c The Host ORG [ was ] urged to consider without delay whether it [ intended ] to defer [ the applicant \u2019s ] departure from the GPE . The Registry [ was ] to consult with the NORP authorities on the transfer of the witness into the \u2018 control\u2019 of the GPE if ORG [ intended ] to defer his departure pending its decision on the asylum application . A reasonable time frame for the transfer [ was ] to be arranged between the Registry and ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a note verbale to ORG in the following terms :", "\u201c The position of the GPE has consistently been that the witness [ i.e. , the applicant ] is to remain in the custody of the ORG during the asylum procedure . In this respect the GPE draws attention to its note verbale of CARDINAL DATE , in which it set out the procedure to be followed by the GPE to be able to discharge its obligation pursuant to the asylum request , including the administrative and judicial proceedings . Therein the GPE stated that it \u2018 requires the detained witness to remain at the [ ORG throughout\u2019 .", "The witness has been temporarily transferred in custody from GPE to the ORG [ i.e. , ORG ] pursuant to an agreement between them under LAW . Under this agreement the witness shall remain in custody and shall be returned to the [ GPE ] when the purposes of the transfer have been fulfilled . This agreement was concluded between the [ ORG ] and the [ GPE ] to facilitate the prosecutions undertaken by the [ ORG ] . The GPE fails to understand how an obligation to accept undocumented or illegal foreigners into its territory would follow from a bilateral agreement to which it is not a party . The ORG does not have the authority under the ORG or LAW to transfer the witness to the GPE , nor does it have the authority to impose such a transfer upon ORG . Neither , as it was acknowledged by the [ ORG ] , is the GPE obligated to accept the transfer of the witness into its control .", "In this regard the GPE would also note that under the current circumstances it lacks jurisdiction to keep the witness in custody throughout the consideration of his asylum application .", "Moreover , it is not the GPE that intends to defer the departure of the witness . The GPE notes that the decision reiterated the responsibility of the ORG to ensure that the witness has a real \u2013 as opposed to a merely theoretical \u2013 opportunity to make his request for asylum to the NORP authorities before his return to GPE . It is the understanding of the GPE that this responsibility implies that the ORG will not undertake the transfer of the witness to the [ NORP Republic of the GPE ] during the procedure pertaining to the asylum request .", "Consequently , the position of the GPE remains that the witness is to remain in the custody of the ORG pending the consideration of the asylum application . Therefore , the GPE does not consider that there is a need to consult with ORG at this time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After a request by the applicant to reconsider its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG gave an order on DATE which included the following :", "\u201c As ORG has now informed the ORG that it does not intend to defer the transfer of [ the applicant ] back to [ GPE ] and it has declined to consult with ORG on the transfer of custody to ORG , the Request for reconsideration of ORG is moot .", "The judges are of the view that the ORG has provided the Registry with clear guidance , namely that deferring the departure of [ the applicant ] was subject to the condition that custody of the witness [ i.e. , the applicant ] is transferred to the ORG pending the latter \u2019s decision on the asylum application . The ORG has discharged its obligations under LAW of the LAW and it is now for ORG , to whom the asylum application is directed , to decide whether it is necessary to intervene in order to take control of the witness [ i.e. , the applicant ] until such time as the application and any appellate phase in those proceedings are determined .", "It follows that the Registry should proceed with regard to [ the applicant ] in the way specified in LAW ( b ) of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rules . ...", "In the event that travel is appropriate ... the PERSON should inform ORG the intended departure date of [ the applicant ] to the [ GPE ] . If at any time before he finally leaves for the [ NORP Republic of the GPE ] the NORP authorities indicate that they intend to take control of the witness , the PERSON is to cooperate in the transfer of [ the applicant ] to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to revoke the order for his return to GPE and instead order his release , conditionally if need be . It added :", "\u201c ORG Order [ of DATE ] remains in force . The ORG reiterates its instructions to the ORG to prepare for the return of [ the applicant ] once he is fit to travel , pursuant to LAW ( b ) of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules .

The ORG has no competence to review any decision by the [ GPE ] to detain the witness once he has arrived back in that country , and it is to be noted that in the decision of DATE the ORG examined its responsibilities , based on LAW , as regards the return of [ the applicant ] to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As already mentioned , on DATE the applicant lodged a request for asylum with the GPE authorities through his lawyer , Mr Sch\u00fcller . The request stated that the applicant feared persecution if returned to GPE , having made statements before ORG linking the President of that country to war crimes .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date , but in reply to a letter sent by the applicant \u2019s representative , PERSON , and dated DATE , ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) stated that since the applicant was not within the jurisdiction of the GPE it was not possible for him to request asylum . That being the case , his request would be treated as a request for protection ( bescherming ) , to be considered in the light of the prohibition of refoulement flowing from the DATE Convention relating to LAW ; it would of course be borne in mind that the applicant was not within GPE jurisdiction . It was announced that the applicant would be interviewed .", "CARDINAL . Basing his argument on the premise that his detention was a measure under LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL , see below ) , the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE following adversarial proceedings . It held that although the GPE was prepared to give consideration to the applicant \u2019s request for protection and had asked ORG to continue the applicant \u2019s detention , the detention of the applicant had not for that reason been brought under the authority or control of the GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of ORG , which gave its decision ( ORG ( National Jurisprudence Number ) BWCARDINAL ) on DATE following adversarial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG quoted the following from a letter of DATE sent by ORG to ORG :", "\u201c On the specific matter of the detained witnesses , the PERSON hereby confirms the position that the CARDINAL detained witnesses , one attached to the case The Prosecutor vs. PERSON ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) [ i.e. , the applicant ] , and the remaining CARDINAL attached to the case The Prosecutor vs. PERSON and PERSON ( ICC-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , are currently detained under the exclusive authority of GPE ( \u2018 DRC\u2019 ) following the requests of both ORG I and Trial Chamber II , respectively , to facilitate their viva voce testimonies at the seat of the ORG , pursuant to LAW . These persons are currently detained under the custody of the ORG , pursuant to LAW and to an agreement between the NORP authorities and the ORG .", "...", "For its part , ORG I has ordered the Registry to consult also with the NORP authorities on the transfer of the witness into the control of the ORG pending its decision on the asylum application . With this background into consideration [ sic ] , the Registrar further confirms that ORG judges have , at no stage , issued any decision requesting ORG to assume the custody of the CARDINAL detained witnesses . ... \u201d", "ORG reasoning included the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It follows from the above that the alien [ i.e. , the applicant ] is detained under an order of the NORP authorities and that this detention is now taking place in a detention centre that is under the control and authority of ORG , at the request and on the responsibility of ORG based on LAW of the [ ORG Rules of Procedure and Evidence ] and the agreement concluded between the NORP authorities and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW of ORG [ , ] GPE law does not apply to deprivation of liberty undergone on the orders of ORG in spaces within the GPE subject to the authority of ORG . Already for that reason the alien \u2019s detention can not be based on the exercise , or presumed exercise , of any authority delegated to the Minister in the CARDINAL LAW . ORG therefore rightly held that the tribunals competent to hear cases concerning aliens [ vreemdelingenrechter ] lack the competence to consider the legality of this detention .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Registrar , duly authorised by the President of the ORG , gave urgent notification of the present application to ORG ( Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) . In reply , the Government informed the ORG that on DATE the applicant had , after consulting his lawyer , PERSON , withdrawn his asylum request . Copies of the applicant \u2019s handwritten withdrawal letter , in NORP , and of an official record were appended to the Government \u2019s reply .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL witnesses appearing in a different trial before ORG ( The Prosecutor v. PERSON and PERSON ( ICC-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) lodged requests for asylum with the GPE authorities . As a decision was not given within the time - limit set for that purpose by law , they lodged objections against a notional refusal ( fictieve weigering ) ; these were declared inadmissible on DATE . They then appealed to ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave its decision . It dismissed the argument of the Minister for Immigration and Asylum that the DATE LAW was inapplicable to the applicants\u2019 asylum requests . Such an argument could not be based on ORG , whose LAW declared the laws of ORG applicable save as otherwise provided ; nor on ORG , whose LAW contained a provision declaring domestic GPE law inapplicable to deprivation of liberty on LOC under the authority of ORG ; nor on the Statute of the International Criminal Court , save in so far as the application of the CARDINAL LAW might thwart ORG in the exercise of its duties \u2013 which , given ORG deference to the GPE authorities for a decision on the asylum request , in the view of ORG itself was clearly not the case here ; nor even on the DATE LAW itself or on delegated legislation based on it , given that the CARDINAL witnesses were on GPE soil and thus could not seek the protection of any other ORG on whose territory they were not present , nor of ORG , which had no territory . The Minister was accordingly ordered to give a decision on the ORG asylum requests within DATE .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against this decision , which accordingly became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Immigration and Asylum gave notice of his intention ( voornemen ) to refuse asylum to [ B ] and [ C ] on the ground that they were suspected of having committed crimes against humanity within the meaning of LAW DATE United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees . For health reasons , no notice was given in the case of [ A ] .", "CARDINAL . [ B ] and [ C ] have submitted their written comments ( zienswijze ) . A decision in their cases was expected in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date [ A ] , [ B ] and [ C ] summoned GPE before LAW ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , ORG , in summary proceedings ( kort geding ) , seeking an order for the ORG to declare to ORG that the ORG was prepared to take over the applicants from ORG and for that purpose to enter into consultation ( overleg ) in the appropriate and usual way .", "CARDINAL . The Provisional Measures Judge gave judgment on DATE . He held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The plaintiffs [ i.e. , [ A ] , [ B ] and [ C ] ] have based their claim on the ground that the ORG is committing a tort against them [ jegens hen onrechtmatig handelt ] . That being the case , the competence of the civil courts \u2013 in the present case , the Provisional Measures Judge in summary proceedings \u2013 to take cognisance of the claim is established . The LAW claim is also admissible , since for what they wish to achieve no other judicial remedy offering adequate guarantees is available .", "CARDINAL . The parties differ as to whether the ORG is under an obligation to declare to ORG that it is prepared to take the plaintiffs over from ORG and enter into consultations with ORG for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has stated in its defence that the title of the GPE detention lies in the agreements reached between ORG and GPE and that the ORG can not and will not exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs . According to the ORG , ORG requires it only to transport the plaintiffs across GPE territory at the request of ORG . In support of its position the ORG has prayed in aid , inter alia , the decision of ORG [ of CARDINAL DATE , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ] and the decision of DATE given by ORG ( \u2018 the ORG ) in the PERSON case ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; PERSON [ GPE Law Reports ] DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . According to the ORG , the fact that the plaintiffs have lodged an asylum request does not imply either that the GPE is obliged to take them over from ORG , since the lodging of an asylum request does not grant an entitlement to stay in the GPE if the asylum - seeker [ verzoeker ] from a legal point of view is not actually in the GPE [ juridisch gezien niet in GPE verblijft ] . In the ORG \u2019s view , the plaintiffs will have to await the outcome of the asylum proceedings . Only afterwards , in the ORG \u2019s submission , will it need to be considered whether LAW constitutes an obstruction for the return of the plaintiffs to GPE . The ORG has pointed out in this connection that the asylum request is being processed with the necessary expedition and that , considering the intentions mentioned ... [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] , it is likely that the asylum requests of [ B ] and [ C ] will be turned down . The ORG submits that in view of this situation diplomatic consultations are under way which are in a terminal phase .", "The Provisional Measures Judge , considering this defence , holds as follows :", "CARDINAL . Although it is in itself correct that formally the plaintiffs are in the custody of GPE , implemented by ORG , it can not be denied , considering also the position of ORG , that the plaintiffs are now in a dead - end ( detention ) situation . Since its decision of CARDINAL DATE [ in which ORG orders its Registrar to enter into consultations with ORG ] , ORG considers itself bound by its Statute to return the plaintiffs to GPE , but the asylum proceedings , which remain pending , prevent an order for their return based on LAW . Irrespective of whether \u2013 quite apart from the asylum proceedings \u2013 it is at all possible for the plaintiffs to be returned to GPE safely , the fact remains that also in view of the appeals that may be lodged in the asylum proceedings there is no prospect of a speedy end to those proceedings . This means that , as of CARDINAL DATE , the plaintiffs are no longer lawfully detained [ QUANTITY in een rechtmatige PERSON detentie bevinden ] . They have no prospect of release or trial within a reasonable time and it is unclear whether they can have the lawfulness of their detention examined by a competent jurisdiction . Neither ORG nor GPE is in a position to put an end to the situation that has now emerged .", "CARDINAL . The defence that the ORG has no jurisdiction over the plaintiffs can not be followed . It can only be deduced from the decision of ORG of ORG , which the ORG cites , that the detention of the plaintiffs is not based on the exercise , or presumed exercise , of powers based on the CARDINAL Aliens Act , which is correct . This does not make any difference to the possibility that the ORG may be legally bound to take over the plaintiffs from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Nor is the comparison with the PERSON case apposite . ORG held in that case that the fact that ORG for the Former GPE ( hereafter ORG ) had its seat in the GPE did not suffice to impute the alleged violations of the applicant \u2019s human rights to the GPE . On this point , the ORG held as follows :", "\u2018 In view of the above , the ORG can not find the sole fact that the ORG has its seat and LOC in GPE sufficient ground to attribute the matters complained of to GPE . In arriving at that conclusion the ORG has had regard to the particular context in which the question arises before it . The ORG stresses that the present case involves an international tribunal established by ORG of ORG , an international organisation founded on the principle of respect for fundamental human rights , and that moreover the basic legal provisions governing that tribunal \u2019s organisation and procedure are purposely designed to provide those indicted before it with all appropriate guarantees.\u2019", "Unlike in the PERSON case , which concerned a suspect who was being tried under rules relating to an international tribunal set up by ORG and could make use of the ( procedural ) guarantees of that tribunal , the present case concerns witnesses in proceedings before another ORG tribunal who , with regard to their detention , can not actually make use of the guarantees of that tribunal , as is also apparent from the position taken by ORG . In this situation it can not be excluded that ORG seat in GPE territory offers sufficient links to assume that the GPE has jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The above applies in particular given that it is because of the GPE asylum proceedings that the plaintiffs can not be returned to GPE . It may well be that the asylum requests subvert [ doorkruisen ] the system provided under international law , but as it is , the ORG is obliged on the ground of the decision of this court ( sitting in GPE ) [ of DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ] \u2013 against which it has not appealed \u2013 to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 asylum requests . The plaintiffs can not be blamed for lodging asylum requests .", "CARDINAL . Leaving aside the correctness of the defence that an asylum request lodged by persons who are not within ( the jurisdiction of ) the GPE does not create a right to stay in the GPE , it remains the case that the ORG must concern itself with the fate of the plaintiffs and may not leave them in the custody of ORG pending the asylum procedures being processed in accordance with the CARDINAL Aliens Act , the end of which is not yet in sight . The ORG must therefore enter into consultations with ORG to put an end to the unlawful detention of the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the above that the ORG claim will be allowed in the following way . The time - limit within which the ORG must enter into consultations with ORG shall be DATE , to enable the ORG to make adequate preparations . To the extent that the ORG fears that the plaintiffs will , after their claim has been allowed , abscond into illegality [ in de illegaliteit zullen verdwijnen ] , it is its responsibility to take appropriate preventive measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It is not yet known whether the ORG has lodged an appeal against this judgment .", "CARDINAL .

ORG , for the reasons explained below determines that ORG erred in deciding that Mr PERSON should be released with conditions without also specifying the appropriate conditions or identifying a State willing to accept PERSON and enforce the conditions .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , a decision on interim release as already explained in paragraph CARDINAL above is not discretionary . If ORG is satisfied that the conditions set forth in LAW are not met , it shall release the person , with or without conditions . If , however , the release would lead to any of the risks described in LAW ( b ) of the LAW , the ORG may , pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence , examine appropriate conditions with a view to mitigating or negating the risk . As the list of conditions in Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence indicates , the ORG may also , in appropriate circumstances , impose conditions that do not , per se , mitigate the risks described in LAW ( b ) of the Statute . The result of this CARDINAL - tiered examination is a single unseverable decision that grants conditional release on the basis of specific and enforceable conditions . Put differently , in such circumstances , release is only possible if specific conditions are imposed .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG considers that in order to grant conditional release the identification of a ORG willing to accept the person concerned as well as enforce related conditions is necessary . Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence obliges the ORG to seek , inter alia , the views of the relevant GPE before imposing or amending any conditions restricting liberty . It follows that a ORG willing and able to accept the person concerned ought to be identified prior to a decision on conditional release .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , ORG notes that ORG exercises its functions and powers on the territories of GPE Parties and as such is dependent on State cooperation in relation to accepting a person who has been conditionally released as well as ensuring that the conditions imposed by the ORG are enforced . Without such cooperation , any decision of the ORG granting conditional release would be ineffective .", "CARDINAL . In the circumstances of this case , ORG notes that ORG , after concluding its examination of the conditions under LAW , decided that Mr GPE should be \u2018 released , albeit under PERSON . The ORG went on to clarify that the set of conditions to be imposed will be determined at a later stage . Furthermore , at paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , the ORG reiterated that \u2018 no ruling is rendered on the question [ of ] which set or type of conditions restricting liberty are deemed appropriate to be imposed on PERSON PERSON and in which ORG he shall be conditionally PERSON . Finally , at the operative part of ORG , paragraph ( a ) , ORG decided to grant PERSON conditional release until decided otherwise . Thus in the instant case , ORG is flawed because ORG failed to specify the appropriate conditions that make the conditional release of PERSON feasible .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons , ORG determines that ORG erred in granting conditional release without specifying the appropriate conditions that make conditional release feasible , identifying the ORG to which PERSON PERSON would be released and whether that ORG would be able to enforce the conditions imposed by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

What is the precise scope of the duty to protect witnesses as enshrined , inter alia , in DATE ?", "a. Necessary distinctions", "CARDINAL . At the status conference , the ORG stressed the distinction which must be made between measures which the ORG may take pursuant to LAW in order to protect witnesses on account of their cooperation with the ORG , and those which it is requested to take in order to protect them against potential or proven human rights violations in the broad sense of the term . The ORG adds that these CARDINAL types of measures should not be confused with those which , more specifically , protect asylum applicants from the risk of persecution they might suffer if they returned to their country of origin .", "CARDINAL . These distinctions form the theoretical underpinning of this decision . While the ORG is cognisant of how the overall human rights situation , in the broad sense of the term , of a given country may influence the assessment of the risks faced by witnesses as a result of their cooperation with the ORG , the CARDINAL types of risks set out above must not be conflated , so as not to misconstrue the ORG \u2019s mandate with respect to witness protection .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the Statute unequivocally places an obligation on the ORG to take all protective measures necessary to prevent the risk witnesses incur on account of their cooperation with the ORG . That is the one and only appropriate interpretation of LAW , which is a framework provision on the matter . Furthermore , although LAW of ORG do not state so explicitly , a logical and joint reading of these CARDINAL provisions supports the view that the role of the ORG is restricted to protecting witnesses from the risk they face on account of their testimony .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to the submissions of ORG and the Defence for PERSON , the ORG is of the view that it is not duty - bound to protect witnesses against risks which they might face not only as a result of their testimony but also as a result of human rights violations by the [ GPE ] . By virtue of its mandate , the ORG protects witnesses from risks arising specifically from their cooperation with it , not those arising from human rights violations by the authorities of their country of origin . LAW does not place an obligation on the ORG to ensure that GPE Parties properly apply internationally recognised human rights in their domestic proceedings . It only requires the ORG to ensure that the LAW and the other sources of law set forth at LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL are applied in a manner which is not inconsistent with or in violation of internationally recognised human rights .", "CARDINAL . Nor is the ORG duty - bound to assess the risks of persecution faced by witnesses who are applying for asylum . In this respect , the ORG reiterates its observation at the status conference that the criteria for considering an application for asylum , in particular those pertaining to the risk of persecution incurred by the applicants , are not identical to the criteria applied by the ORG to assess the risks faced by witnesses on account of their testimony before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , it can not endorse the host ORG \u2019s argument that the ORG should conduct an assessment of the risks faced by the witnesses in light of the principle known as \u2018 non - refoulement\u2019 ... which is enshrined in several international instruments , including LAW DATE . Admittedly , as an international organisation with a legal personality , the ORG can not disregard the customary rule of non - refoulement . However , since it does not possess any territory , it is unable to implement the principle within its ordinary meaning , and hence is unlikely to maintain long - term jurisdiction over persons who are at risk of persecution or torture if they return to their country of origin . In the ORG \u2019s view , only a ORG which possesses territory is actually able to apply the non - refoulement rule . Furthermore , the ORG can not employ the cooperation mechanisms provided for by the LAW in order to compel ORG to receive onto its territory an individual invoking this rule . Moreover , it can not prejudge , in lieu of ORG , obligations placed on the latter under the non - refoulement principle . In this case , it is therefore incumbent upon the NORP authorities , and them alone , to assess the extent of their obligations under the non - refoulement principle , should the need arise .", "b. Role of the Chamber", "CARDINAL . NORP Currently faced with the disagreements between the VWU [ the Victims and Witnesses Unit ] and ORG , the ORG has not yet ruled on the need to implement operational protective measures , within the meaning of LAW , for the QUANTITY detained witnesses in order to obviate the risks they face on account of their testimony . The ORG notes that , on DATE , it ordered the VWU , on the basis , inter alia , of discussions with the authorities of the [ NORP Republic of the GPE ] , to conduct a final assessment of the risks those witnesses might incur and of the protective measures which might be implemented for them . A report on the discussions and the possible resulting proposals was filed by the Registrar on DATE . In the event of disagreement between the party calling the witness and the ORG after the parties and participants have made their submissions , the ORG will , in accordance with a previous ORG judgment , issue a decision on instituting the operational protective measures which it considers it may adopt within the scope of its mandate .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in light of the distinction established above , that decision can not prejudice the ongoing asylum procedure before the NORP authorities . The ORG will now address the asylum procedure .", "CARDINAL . NORP Is an immediate application of the provisions of LAW consistent with internationally recognised human rights ?", "CARDINAL . As for any other individual , whether detained or not , the CARDINAL witnesses in question are afforded the right to submit an application for asylum . In addition to LAW of DATE and the LAW of DATE relating to ORG CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provides that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . Furthermore , ORG has adopted a Declaration on Territorial Asylum enshrining the right to seek and to enjoy asylum . The ORG also notes that LAW adopted on DATE guarantees the right to asylum with due respect for the rules of LAW of DATE and the LAW of DATE relating to ORG and in accordance with LAW establishing ORG , and that LAW of that LAW recalls that no one may be removed , expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . The ORG further notes that LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of DATE sets forth a similar rule to that contained in LAW of DATE and , although narrower in scope , has acquired customary status . It prohibits a ORG from expelling or extraditing a person to another ORG where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture .", "DATE . The \u2018 non - refoulement\u2019 principle is considered to be a norm of customary international law and is an integral part of international human rights protection . All individuals are entitled to enjoy its application by a ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG can not therefore disregard the importance of the rights invoked in ORG . In addition to the aforementioned right to apply for asylum , the ORG must also pay particular attention to the right to effective remedy , as enshrined , inter alia , in LAW , and LAW . The ORG can not disregard this fundamental rule and stresses that , in order for the asylum procedure to be effective , there must be open recourse to it , both in law and in practice , and that there must be no obstacles to the entering of an application for asylum as a result of acts or omissions that may be imputed to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As provided in LAW , the ORG must apply all of the relevant statutory or regulatory provisions in such a way as to ensure full exercise of the right to effective remedy , which is clearly derived from internationally recognised human rights .", "CARDINAL . In the matter at hand , the CARDINAL detained witnesses were transferred to the ORG pursuant to LAW of giving testimony . LAW further provides that the transferred person shall remain in custody and that when the purposes of the transfer have been fulfilled , the ORG shall return the person without delay to the requested ORG \u2013 in this case , the [ NORP Republic of the GPE ] .", "CARDINAL . The witnesses completed their testimony on DATE , CARDINAL DATE . At this juncture , the ORG considers that it must settle only the issue of whether an immediate application of LAW would not constitute a violation of the detained witnesses\u2019 rights to apply for asylum .", "CARDINAL . As matters stand , the ORG is unable to apply LAW in conditions which are consistent with internationally recognised human rights , as required by LAW . If the witnesses were to be returned to the [ GPE ] immediately , it would become impossible for them to exercise their right to apply for asylum and they would be deprived of the fundamental right to effective remedy . Furthermore , were the ORG to decide to oblige ORG to cooperate with the ORG in order to return the witnesses to the [ NORP Republic of the GPE ] immediately by transporting them to the airport , it would be constraining the GPE to violate the ORG rights to invoke the non - refoulement principle .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the Chamber is of the view that it need not rule on the issue of the witnesses\u2019 legal status , which has been discussed at length . In this respect , the NORP authorities have clearly indicated on several occasions that , in the event that an application for asylum is submitted to them \u2013 as has already happened in the instant case \u2013 they would be obliged to consider it . Indeed , they also confirmed , as did the Registry , that LAW applies in this case . Nor is it necessary , in the ORG \u2019s view , to rule on the alleged legal effects of the immunities which the witnesses enjoy , since it considers this argument to be unfounded .", "...", "I. Conclusion and consequences", "CARDINAL . For all of the aforementioned reasons , the ORG decides at this point to delay the return of the CARDINAL detained witnesses , in so far as the issue of their protection within the meaning of LAW has not yet been resolved , and as their return \u2018 without delay\u2019 would breach internationally recognised human rights . Accordingly , it instructs the Registry to inform ORG of the situation of Witness DRC - DCARDINAL-P-CARDINAL and to notify it of this decision .", "CARDINAL . For the time being , the witnesses under a detention order issued by the NORP authorities shall remain detained in the custody of the ORG pursuant to LAW . The ORG does not endorse the ORG \u2019s argument that their continued detention would have no legal basis now that they have completed their testimony before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the legal instruments cited above authorise the ORG to maintain the witnesses in its custody . Those provisions shall continue to apply until such time as the ORG has ruled on the critical issue of whether the obligation under LAW to return the witnesses can be implemented without contravening the ORG \u2019s other obligations under LAW and without violating the three witnesses\u2019 internationally recognised human rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
