NORP , lodged with ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) a private bill of indictment against the applicant , charging him with several counts of defamation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL offences of defamation under LAW of LAW and acquitted him of the remaining charges . The applicant was ordered to pay a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) , ORG CARDINAL to a charity , and to reimburse the private prosecutors ORG CARDINAL for the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court found him guilty of damaging the good name of ORG in that , DATE and DATE , through a means of mass communication , namely the Internet portal www.uczciwosc.org.pl , and by sending letters to ORG , ORG ( Krajowa PERSON i PERSON ) , the Minister of ORG , Bishop PERSON Sworc , and priests from several ORG parishes , he had made untruthful statements , in particular that S.Tar TV had been broadcasting pornographic material .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant was found guilty of disseminating , on the above - mentioned Internet site , inaccurate information about one of the journalists working for S.Tar TV , Mr G. J. , which had debased the victim in the eyes of the public and had undermined public confidence in him : public confidence was necessary for his profession . The court referred to statements published by the applicant to the effect that the victim had \u201c lacked objectivity and closely collaborated with the incompetent President of PERSON , PERSON PERSON , and his political godfather , the Civic Platform \u2019s Member of ORG , Mr A. Grad . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the applicant was convicted of disseminating , through the same Internet site , information to the effect that PERSON J. R. , another journalist employed by ORG , had provided viewers with inaccurate information , implying that the applicant had been pushing for the dismissal of the ORG President .", "CARDINAL . The fourth charge on which the applicant was convicted consisted of making statements during a session of ORG , in full knowledge that the session was being broadcast by ORG , which were inaccurate and damaging to the station \u2019s good name . The statements in question included allegations that the station had been presenting CARDINAL - sided information on city issues and had received money from the local authorities to present information in support of the latter \u2019s \u201c official line \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant was found guilty of disseminating inaccurate information aimed at debasing Mr PERSON J. and undermining public confidence in him , by stating , in the presence of CARDINAL people , that he had been responsible for manipulation of the media and was one of the greatest manipulators of cable television .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was acquitted of the charge of making statements during a session of ORG , which was broadcast by ORG , claiming that it was not objective and behaved in a totalitarian manner . The applicant was also acquitted of the charge that he had disseminated a leaflet entitled \u2018 Demonstration in Tarnow\u2019 \u201d in which he made inaccurate statements to the effect that S.Tar TV had obtained a substantial sum of ORG money following an agreement with the city council .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) allowed the appeal in part . The court acquitted the applicant of CARDINAL charges of defamation of S.Tar TV and Mr J. NORP However , the court agreed that the applicant had defamed Mr PERSON J. on two occasions , namely during the demonstration and on his Internet site . The court further decided to conditionally discontinue the proceedings for a probationary period of one year , as it had established that the guilt and social danger of the act committed by the applicant were not significant . The court ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL to a charity and the private prosecutor \u2019s costs in the proceedings , in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . In setting the payment the court took into account the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions and had regard to his financial standing .", "CARDINAL . The appeal court considered that the nature and context of the statements regarding ORG had not exceeded the boundaries of permissible criticism . The court found that the applicant had acted in the public interest , that his statements were not defamatory and that they did not therefore constitute an offence under LAW . As regards the applicant \u2019s conviction for defamation of Mr J. R. , the court quashed it and considered that there had been no evidence of an offence .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the part of the judgment which it upheld , concerning the defamation of Mr G. J. , the court established that on DATE the applicant had organised a demonstration against corruption , incompetence and poverty , which involved CARDINAL people . During the demonstration he pointed at Mr G. J. , a journalist working for ORG , who was filming the event . The description of the subsequent events as established by ORG and the latter \u2019s conclusions , read :", "... \u201c [ the applicant pointing at Mr G. J. ] described him in the following words : ... \u2019this is the person responsible for GPE ... \u2018 this person is called [ Mr PERSON [ and ] is one of the greatest information manipulators of cable TV\u2019 ... \u2018 down with [ him ] ( LANGUAGE ... Some time later , on [ his Internet site ] there appeared a notice about the demonstration which included the following statements : ... \u2018 during the demonstration local journalists , including PERSON G. J. from ORG cable TV , on account of [ the latter \u2019s ] lack of objectivity and tight collaboration with the incompetent President of ORG , PERSON PERSON , and his political godfather ORG MP , PERSON ORG , was booed ( \u201c wygwizdany \u201d ) by ORG inhabitants ... These were the statements which [ the victim ] considered defamatory .", "The legal analysis of these statements and the circumstances in which they were made allow the conclusion that the [ applicant \u2019s ] behaviour fulfilled the criteria of the offence set out in LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "In ORG assessment it is beyond doubt that the term \u2018 GPE has a highly negative connotation in the common understanding ( in the NORP reality this is also caused by the negative experiences of the mass media before CARDINAL regard to the process of transmitting information , this term means either telling direct untruths or presenting events in such a way as to make it impossible to see them as they are in reality DATE which also [ amounts to telling ] untruths .", "The same is true with regard to the term \u201c collaboration \u201d , which means direct cooperation with an imposed authority , and is linked with servility and being at the latter \u2019s disposal ...", "Thus , to make a charge against a journalist of participating in manipulation or collaboration with the city \u2019s authorities , or directly calling him an \u2018 information PERSON and stating that he was booed on account of his lack of objectivity , could indisputably debase him in the eyes of the public and undermine the public confidence necessary for his profession . ORG expects from the mass media and their representatives independence , objectivity , and a true description of those events which are interesting to the public .", "In conclusion , it is established that [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour was verbally aggressive , had features typical of a personal attack , and was obviously aimed at debasing PERSON G. J. in the estimation of those present at the demonstration .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also dismissed the applicant \u2019s submissions that his statements were a value judgment . It considered that even if they could be considered value judgments , they were not in any event supported by facts . The court established that the basis of the applicant \u2019s statement was events which had taken place during the applicant \u2019s campaign for the post of ORG \u2019s President , which had its epilogue in ORG decision of DATE . The latter court found that ORG , but not Mr PERSON , had made inaccurate statements regarding the applicant . During the election campaign ORG had broadcast a debate between the candidates ; however , every time the applicant took the floor a notice appeared to the effect that the applicant had not given permission for his views to be presented to the voters ; this was not true . In reality , the applicant had not agreed to the particular conditions for his presentation as proposed by ORG . However , PERSON was merely a camera operator and had no influence on the station \u2019s policy or on the broadcasting of the inaccurate information about the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered therefore that the applicant should have limited himself to the comment that Mr PERSON \u201c was a representative of the institution which had transmitted inaccurate information \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant from his post as Vice - President of ORG . The ORG considered that the applicant had been involved in unworthy conduct damaging its image by , in particular , insulting other people and constantly fighting and stirring up conflict . The ORG referred to several court cases in which the applicant had been involved .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Criminal Code provides :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL .
