{"ITEMID": "001-67631", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "GLOVER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , solicitor , of Messrs. PERSON and PERSON , GPE .", "The applicant was convicted at ORG in GPE on DATE of CARDINAL counts of conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs , namely ecstasy , amphetamine and cannabis resin . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment for supplying class A drugs and , concurrent thereto , DATE imprisonment for the supply of class B drugs . In connection with the sentence , ORG on DATE granted leave to appeal and reduced the individual sentences to DATE and DATE respectively , to run consecutively . Leave to appeal against conviction was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL of the issues in the case concerned the disclosure of materials held by the prosecution on which they did not intend to rely . The applicant and his co - defendants had been subject to intensive police observations at CARDINAL or more stages of the conspiracy , DATE and DATE , and at various times some of them ( but not the applicant ) were found in possession of amounts of drugs worth , variously , \u00a3 MONEY , \u00a3 MONEY , \u00a3 MONEY , \u00a3 MONEY , \u00a3 MONEY and \u00a3 MONEY ( CARDINAL ) , \u00a3 MONEY and \u00a3 MONEY . Much of the evidence was recordings of telephone calls made by defendants , and references by CARDINAL of the defendants to another . The applicant , in his defence , accepted that he knew some of the people who had been arrested in possession of drugs in the case , but contended that he had not known what was going on , and had never been involved in any way with drugs . He said that he had had business dealings with some of the people that he would not have wanted the authorities to know about . Before and during the trial , the applicant applied for disclosure of the unused material in the form of the many covertly obtained tapes of conversations and observation material not already in evidence . He maintained that he needed the information to put in context the extracts from the recordings and details of all observations relied upon by the prosecution . Rulings were made by Judge PERSON , before the trial on DATE , and by the trial judge , Judge PERSON during the trial . The rulings ( summarised by ORG ) were to the effect that :", "- the court had no power to order further primary disclosure \u2013 that was a matter for the prosecution 's judgment under LAW DATE ( \u201c CPIA \u201d ) ;", "- in the absence of any particular issue in the applicant 's defence statement in respect of which the prosecution could be shown to have reasonable cause under LAW ORG to believe that there was undisclosed prosecution material which might reasonably be expected to assist the defence case , such disclosure would not be ordered ;", "- in the circumstances it was not appropriate or necessary to order the further disclosure sought or for the trial judge to examine it or for himself to verify the prosecution 's compliance with their secondary disclosure duty , and", "- the ORG scheme of prosecution disclosure was not contrary to LAW .", "The applicant was convicted on DATE and sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment .", "Leave to appeal against conviction was refused by a single judge on DATE , and ORG heard the renewed application on DATE . Before ORG , the applicant challenged the way in which material had been withheld by the prosecution . In particular , he claimed that the prosecution was not entitled to withhold material that , when put in context with the material relied on by the prosecution , might have put the latter in a different light . ORG noted that the applicant ( unlike a co - defendant who raised similar issues ) had served a defence statement under LAW ORG which raised in general terms the nature of his defence , namely that he would contend that he know nothing of the drugs . The defence statement had also stated that he would contend that the balance of the audio recordings not already disclosed would put the conversations in their true context . Counsel for the prosecution , in reply , contended that the disclosure had complied with the scheme set up by Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG and the relevant LAW , and that the initial primary disclosure itemised CARDINAL of documents or bundles of documents drawn from a mass of documentary material running to CARDINAL of pages . The unused audio material alone amounted to over TIME of listening . He added that the defence had been served , by way of primary disclosure , with further schedules of discloseable material in the course of the trial as such material came into the police 's hands . The prosecution further contended that without identifiable issues as to what the undisclosed material might relate to , it could not properly make secondary disclosure . The prosecution also pointed out that , in order to put the conversations which were relied on in context , TIME of conversation before and after each of the incriminating passages had been included in the served audio tapes and transcripts . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c There is no power in the court to direct primary disclosure , and , even if there were , it is difficult to see how the court could approach its task without knowledge of what , if any , issues were going to be taken with the prosecution case . The scheme of the [ CPIA ] is to rely on the prosecutor at that stage to disclose to the defence any unused material which in his or her opinion might undermine the prosecution case , but not to disclose everything available regardless of any conceivable relevance .", "The machinery for testing the objectivity and adequacy of that disclosure , given the prosecution 's incomplete knowledge at that stage of what issues lie ahead , is the scheme of secondary disclosure . Once those issues are identified by the defence in a defence statement , if they are so identified , the prosecutor can then revisit his duty of disclosure , better informed than he was at the primary stage , to form a view as to what further disclosure justice requires in the form of material that might reasonably be expected to assist the defence . If , in the light of his then knowledge , he still does not make adequate disclosure , that is when the court can step in , and stay in . It can then consider the material for itself and direct further disclosure if it considers justice requires it .", "That is the machinery , and that machinery was invoked here over a number of applications in the course of the trial ; and the judges , true to the scheme of the LAW , ruled as they did . In our view , there is nothing in the machinery that violates the LAW or the jurisprudence of ORG , that is , of tying prosecution disclosure to material that is relevant to the issues of guilt or innocence . There is nothing in the ORG or ORG jurisdiction to equate the notion of a fair trial , including the requirement of the prosecution to prove its case , with the notion that the defence , while keeping its cards close to its chest , can demand sight of all the prosecution material , however irrelevant to any issue that could be guessed at .", "As to [ the ] more modest proposition that more of the audio tapes should have been disclosed to enable [ the applicant ] to put seemingly incriminating conversations into a more innocent context , it seems to us there are CARDINAL answers . First , additional context was provided as [ counsel for the prosecution ] has told us , in recorded passages before and after the incriminating words . Second , the words , in the context of what the police had seen as well as heard and the drug finds they made at or about the times of the conversations , were not seemingly incriminating , but plainly incriminating . Any innocent exchanges at other times \u2013 and no doubt there were many of them \u2013 could not have saved the passages on which the prosecution relied for the purpose of the defence . Third , it is to be remembered that these were lengthy conspiracies , punctuated by serious drug finds with which [ the applicant and a co - defendant ] visibly and audibly , in greater or less measure , were clearly involved . The patterns of their criminality were plainly established . There is , in our view , no arguable substance in this ... ground of appeal ... \u201d", "ORG then dealt with a further ground of appeal . CARDINAL alleged co - conspirators had been tried separately from the applicant and his co - defendants , and in the course of their trial , they had applied for certain prosecution disclosure . The judge ordered disclosure , and the prosecution was unwilling to comply . As a result , the prosecution offered no evidence against all the defendants in that case . The applicant , unaware of the nature of the undisclosed material that caused the collapse of the prosecution in the co - conspirators ' case , claimed that if he had been tried with the CARDINAL other men ( as might have happened ) , the result would have been an abandonment of the prosecution against him . He also claimed that evidence of events in DATE ( concerning the supply of ecstasy tablets to one of the co - conspirators ) should not have been included in the prosecution case against him . The applicant asked ORG to investigate the nature of the disclosure that the prosecution had declined to make in that case , with a view to ordering its disclosure for the applicant 's own appeal if the court considered it would have assisted his defence . ORG replied :", "\u201c We have looked at transcripts of the relevant public interest immunity hearings in question in the [ other ] proceedings and , in the absence of the [ applicant and his counsel ] , we have heard submissions about the matters referred to in them from [ counsel ] on behalf of the prosecution . [ Counsel ] was also the lawyer in charge of this prosecution and familiar with , and closely involved throughout in , the process of prosecution disclosure . Having explored the matter thoroughly with him , we are satisfied that none of the matters that led to the collapse of the prosecution in the [ other ] case in any way overflowed into or tainted the conduct of the police investigation in this case . The CARDINAL investigations , though overlapping in relation to CARDINAL or more overt acts of supply [ of drugs ] , were conducted by CARDINAL entirely separate police teams , separately directed and located , notwithstanding that institutionally they form part of ORG . Accordingly , we are satisfied that there is no arguable case for the grant of leave on this proposed ground . \u201d", "Leave to appeal against conviction was refused on DATE .", "A review of the domestic law on disclosure of evidence by the prosecution can be found in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON and PERSON ( PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , nos . ORG and ORG , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; confirmed by ORG on DATE ) . The duty of primary disclosure is contained in LAW DATE ( \u201c the CPIA \u201d ) , and requires the prosecution \u201c to disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused and which in the prosecutor 's opinion might undermine the case for the prosecution against the accused \u201d , or give a statement that there is no such material . The provision as to a defence statement is at LAW , and requires the defence , after primary disclosure under LAW , to give a defence statement to the court and prosecutor \u201c ( a ) setting out in general terms the nature of the accused 's defence , ( b ) indicating the matters on which he takes issue with the prosecution , and ( c ) setting out , in the case of each such matter , the reason why he takes issue with the prosecution . \u201d The prosecution 's duty of secondary disclosure derives from LAW , and requires the prosecution , after the accused has given a defence statement under LAW , to \u201c disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused and which might be reasonably expected to assist the accused 's defence as disclosed by the defence statement given under LAW ... \u201d , or to give a written statement that there is no such material .", "The review by the trial court of the prosecution 's disclosure ( referred to at \u00a7 DATE of the ORG 's judgment in PERSON and PERSON ) is governed by LAW ORG , which provides for the possibility of a defence application to the court for disclosure where the defence have reasonable cause to believe that there is prosecution material which might reasonably be expected to assist the defence as disclosed by the LAW statement .", "The provisions of the ORG replaced the earlier , common law rules on disclosure .", "In DATE , the Attorney General issued LAW which set out in more detail the way in which primary and secondary disclosure , and defence disclosure , should operate .", "In R v. H and R v. C ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) ORG noted that \u201c In some countries provision is made for judicial oversight of criminal investigations . That is , for better or worse , entirely contrary to NORP practice . Instead , the achievement of fairness in a trial on indictment rests above all on the correct and conscientious performance of their roles by judge , prosecuting counsel , defending counsel and jury \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
