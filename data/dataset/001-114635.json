He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was elected to ORG as a member of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In DATE he became the President of the ORG pursuant to a power - sharing agreement between the CARDINAL principal political parties .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG , in the absence of the applicant , adopted a declaration asserting the sovereignty of ORG . The ORG subsequently established ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The applicant was elected President of ORG . He remained President of ORG until DATE . He was also a member of ORG and , from DATE until DATE , he was an active member of the Presidency of the Bosnian - Serb Republic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an indictment was first issued against the applicant by ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE by ORG in GPE and transferred to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an amended indictment dated DATE the applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts , including genocide and complicity in genocide , persecution , extermination , murder , deportation and inhumane acts . Criminal responsibility was charged under ORG CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the Statute of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Prosecutor alleged that the applicant had participated , as a co - perpetrator or aider and abettor , in a joint criminal enterprise which had as its objective the permanent removal , by force or other means , of NORP and NORP from large portions of GPE through the commission of the crimes mentioned above . The crimes were alleged to have taken place in all CARDINAL municipalities of GPE DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG found the applicant responsible , pursuant to LAW , for participating in a joint criminal enterprise to achieve the permanent removal of NORP and NORP from large portions of GPE through the commission of crimes . It convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of crimes against humanity under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely persecution , extermination , murder , deportation and inhumane acts ( forcible transfer ) . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , but granted credit for the time spent in detention , which at the date of judgment amounted to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution filed an appeal against the applicant \u2019s sentence on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant filed a notice of appeal arguing that his convictions should be quashed or that a re - trial should be ordered . An amicus curiae was appointed by ORG and , on DATE , he also filed a notice of appeal arguing for the quashing of the convictions or a retrial . The appeals were heard on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed some of the grounds of appeal lodged by the applicant and by the amicus curiae . It reversed many of the applicant \u2019s convictions for persecution , extermination , murder and deportation . However , it upheld his convictions for crimes against humanity in respect of specific instances of persecution , deportation and inhumane acts ( forcible transfer ) . As to whether a retrial should be ordered , the judgment of ORG noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he convictions for the majority of crimes , of which PERSON had been found guilty , have been quashed . However , convictions for persecution , deportation and forcible transfer have been upheld , and the gravity of these crimes requires a severe and proportionate sentence . Therefore , in the circumstances of this particular case , ORG considers that it is not in the interests of justice to remit the case for further proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the various relevant factors set out in LAW ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) in determining the appropriate length of sentence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL below ) . It noted inter alia that the crimes of which the applicant had been found guilty were among the most severe crimes known to mankind . It further identified relevant aggravating and mitigating features . ORG imposed a sentence of DATE imprisonment , subject to credit for the time spent in detention , which at the date of the appeal judgment amounted to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant remained in detention in the GPE throughout the trial and appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE to serve his sentence pursuant to an order of the President of the ORG dated DATE . His transfer was governed by an agreement between ORG and GPE ( \u201c the ORG - GPE agreement on enforcement of sentences \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the terms of the agreement , GPE was bound by the duration of the sentence imposed and the conditions of imprisonment were governed by the law of GPE , subject to the supervision of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG - GPE agreement on enforcement of sentences and LAW provided that GPE was required to notify the ORG if , pursuant to its law , the applicant became eligible for early release . The decision on early release would be taken by the President of the ORG on the basis of the interests of justice and the general principles of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was notified by GPE authorities that the applicant would be eligible on DATE for consideration for release on parole licence , after having served CARDINAL of his sentence . A Seconded Probation Report dated DATE , a ORG dated DATE and a Prison Assessment for ORG dated DATE were attached to the notification . These were forwarded by the ORG to the applicant for comment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made submissions in reply , referring to the terms of ORG on the procedure for determining applications for pardon , commutation of sentence and early release ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . He emphasised that he had been acquitted of charges of extermination , murder , genocide and complicity in murder in breach of the rules and conventions of war . He referred to the sentence imposed on , and time spent in detention by , his co - accused at trial , for the purposes of comparison . He also expressed remorse for the crimes committed and indicated his willingness to co - operate with ORG . Finally , he emphasised that his behaviour while in detention had been excellent .", "CARDINAL . The President of the ORG handed down his decision on the applicant \u2019s early release on DATE . He noted at the outset that although the applicant had served CARDINAL of his sentence , it was the practice of the ORG to consider convicted persons to be eligible for early release when they had served CARDINAL of their sentences . In the applicant \u2019s case , this would be on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President examined each of the factors set out in the Practice Direction on early release in turn . As regards comparison with similarly - situated prisoners , he rejected the applicant \u2019s suggestion that the case of his co - accused supported his early release , observing that his co - accused had , unlike the applicant , entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution and had served CARDINAL of her sentence when she was released .", "CARDINAL . As regards the gravity of the applicant \u2019s crimes , the President referred to ORG finding that the convictions were among the most severe crimes known to mankind and that their gravity required a severe and proportionate sentence . He concluded that the very high gravity of the applicant \u2019s offences was a factor that weighed against his early release .", "CARDINAL . In so far as rehabilitation was concerned , the President reviewed the applicant \u2019s behaviour while in prison , his statements of remorse and the information he had provided regarding his plans post - release . He found that the applicant had demonstrated some rehabilitation , which militated in favour of his early release .", "CARDINAL . Finally , concerning cooperation with the Prosecutor , the President found the applicant \u2019s assertion that he had assisted the Prosecutor by providing documents and encouraging officials to give statements to be unsubstantiated . It could not therefore be considered a positive factor in respect of his early release . The applicant \u2019s willingness to assist post - conviction was , in the absence of any instance where his assistance had been requested , found to be a neutral factor .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While Mr. PERSON has displayed some evidence of rehabilitation , I am of the view that there remain significant factors that weigh against granting him early release . Mr. PERSON \u2019s crimes are of a very high gravity , involving a widespread displacement of the non - NORP population in GPE and GPE , which caused great suffering . Moreover , in respect of the requirement that the President shall take into account the treatment of similarly - situated prisoners , the practice of the ORG is to consider the eligibility of a convicted person only after he has served CARDINAL of his sentence ; therefore , the fact that Mr. PERSON has only recently completed serving CARDINAL of his sentence does not weigh in favour of his early release .", "CARDINAL . Taking all of the foregoing into account and having considered those factors identified in LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , I am of the view that Mr. PERSON should not be granted early release .", "CARDINAL . I note that my colleagues unanimously share my view that Mr. PERSON should be denied early release . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No appeal was possible against the President \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , section ORG ) of MONEY DATE provided that as soon as a long - term prisoner had served CARDINAL of his sentence , it would be the duty of the Secretary of ORG to release him on licence . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) defined \u201c long - term \u201d prisoner as a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of DATE or more .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provided to the Secretary of ORG an additional discretionary power to release long - term prisoners before the CARDINAL point of their sentence and provided that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) After a long - term prisoner has served CARDINAL of his sentence , the Secretary of ORG may , if recommended to do so by the [ ORG , release him on licence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under ORG ( ORG ) Order DATE the Secretary of ORG transformed his section CARDINAL discretion to release longterm prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of DATE into a duty . For those serving sentences of DATE or more , the Secretary of ORG retained his discretion to order early release after the halfway point and before CARDINAL of the sentence had been served .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL sets out factors relevant to determining the appropriate length of sentence .

They should also be realistic in the sense that they should take into account the ORG personalities and social and economic circumstances as well as the availability of resettlement programmes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Principle CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The criteria for granting conditional release should be applied so as to grant conditional release to all prisoners who are considered as meeting the minimum level of safeguards for becoming law abiding citizens . It should be incumbent on the authorities to show that a prisoner has not reached that level . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Recommendation notes :", "\u201c In a discretionary release system the most important decision to be made is which criteria will be used to determine whether a prisoner can or can not be granted release . The primary aim of these criteria should be to identify those prisoners who can be released without posing an unbearable risk to safety in the community . Whether and which of these criteria have been fulfilled will also be a relevant consideration in deciding on the conditions or supervision measures to be imposed . The personality and socio - economic circumstances of the prisoner should always be taken into account .", "The criteria should be clear and explicit so as to avoid erratic decisions or disparities in decision - making . This requirement is also in the interest of the prisoners and the staff involved in the preparation of release . The lack of clear and explicit criteria might lead to reduced confidence in the system and less motivation on the part of prisoners to participate actively in the preparation for conditional release .", "A similar lack of confidence or motivation would be produced if the criteria were felt to be unrealistic , in other words , impossible to fulfil given the prisoner \u2019s personal and social circumstances ( such as age , family situation , health , professional qualifications etc ) and the unavailability of resettlement programmes", "Care should also be taken to avoid criteria that are too closely related to the type of the offence committed , or the dangerousness of the offender at the start of his / her prison sentence . It has to be recalled that such criteria have already been used to decide on the length of the sentence and the classification and sentence plan of the prisoner . The decision to grant conditional release should be based on realistic criteria related to the present situation and prospects of the prisoner . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
