In DATE CARDINAL students sat this examination and there were CARDINAL places available . She failed the examination again in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and other students lodged a complaint with the President of the Republic alleging that PERSON no . ORG , in particular the CARDINAL binding criteria used by ORG to set the number of students allowed admission to the relevant faculty of each university ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was incompatible with LAW establishing ORG , Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CE on the recognition of professional qualifications , LAW , LAW on ORG , with regard to the principle of equality , and LAW . She further contested both the ORG \u2019s decision to impose the same limitations on private universities and the adequacy of the entrance examinations .

On DATE the first applicant made further pleadings and reiterated her request for the matter be submitted to ORG ( the \u201c ECJ \u201d ) for a preliminary ruling . Her pleadings were transmitted to ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , adopted on the basis of ORG advisory opinion delivered on DATE and notified to the first applicant on DATE , the President of the Republic rejected the complaints . The decree stipulated that , bearing in mind the human and material resources of the universities , the contested admission restrictions , allowing entrance only to the most meritorious students , were reasonable and therefore compatible with the provisions of ORG ( ORG ) invoked . Moreover , in line with the increase in society \u2019s need for qualified doctors , admissions to the faculties of medicine in DATE had increased by PERCENT . It noted that the professional examination , after a degree had been obtained , was not an academic title in itself but a ORG examination like those held in most GPE . Lastly , it dismissed the allegation that the entrance examination \u2019s content was inadequate .", "CARDINAL . The other CARDINAL applicants had been or are still working as dental technicians or hygienists for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , despite their relevant professional experience , those CARDINAL applicants failed the entrance examination to study at ORG . Any preceding and subsequent attempts were also unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON ( hereinafter \u201c the eighth applicant \u201d ) had nevertheless passed the entrance examination in DATE . However , following his failure to sit examinations for DATE on account of serious family problems ( as provided for by the relevant University Rule , under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , he lost his student status in DATE .", "CARDINAL . These applicants conceded that they had not pursued available domestic remedies , since in their view they would have been ineffective . According to the well - established jurisprudence of ORG , limited access to universities is compatible with the LAW and ORG law ( see , amongst others , the above - mentioned advisory opinion of DATE ) . The eighth applicant also argued that ORG had constantly held that subjective reasons , such as family problems ( as in his case ) , could not be considered as exceptions to the rule favouring continuity of studies . In consequence , his claim would not have been successful .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL , amending section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , introduced , for the first time , a numerus clausus ( limited access ) to both public and private NORP universities . Section PERSON ) of that PERSON provided that it was for ORG to establish those limits . However , the PERSON did not establish or set clear criteria to determine the faculties subject to restrictions , the number of available places or the selection procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , having been asked to examine the constitutionality of section PERSON ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG delivered a judgment upholding the constitutionality of that PERSON . It considered that the discretion exercised by ORG was not unfettered , since it must act according to an established legal framework . In this connection , in the absence of national legislation on the matter , ORG made reference to relevant ORG directives which aimed to ensure an adequate standard of education . The court further noted that it was for ORG to rule on the subject .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , PERSON no . ORG was enacted . It provided that ORG would establish the entrance quota of ORG , ORG on the basis of CARDINAL binding criteria : the capacity and resource potential of the universities , and society \u2019s need for a particular profession ( fabbisogno di professionalit\u00e0 del sistema sociale e produttivo ) . Based on that assessment , ORG would set the number of students allowed admission to the relevant faculty of each university .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON della ORG \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a recommendation on the criteria for admission to ORG . The ORG noted that : ( a ) in practice , the CARDINAL criteria established by the PERSON were applied on the basis of the observations of ORG and ORG , and ( b ) any data gathered would be discussed by an expert task force , composed , inter alia , of representatives from ORG and ORG and Dentists .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , ORG were acting in breach of ORG judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ORG law , in so far as the PERSON took into account not only educational standards but also data concerning occupational demand . Noting that the assessments were made with exclusive regard to the occupational demand of ORG , the ORG concluded that limiting admission to ORG amounted to an unreasonable restriction of competition in professional services . Indeed , by considering only public demand , to the exclusion of any private demand , the number of dentists was artificially reduced and dental fees were unjustifiably increased . Furthermore , the ORG disapproved of the participation of professional associations in the above - mentioned task force , in so far as their decisions might be highly influenced by their own interests .", "CARDINAL . To be admitted , candidates were required to pass a multiple - choice examination consisting of CARDINAL questions on general culture ( including international geography and history ) , biology , chemistry , mathematics and physics . The examination , based on the high school syllabus , aimed to test the candidates\u2019 aptitude for the subject matter pertaining to the faculty of their choice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant domestic courts repeatedly found that a numerus clausus and the way in which it was applied in the NORP legal framework were in accordance with both LAW and ORG legislation . Judgments in support of those findings include , inter alia : judgments no . DATE of DATE , no . CARDINAL of DATE , and no . CARDINAL of DATE of ORG ; judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ; judgment no . DATE of ORG ; judgment no . DATE of ORG of DATE ; judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ; and judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE .", "In particular , in respect of the ORG claim that the criterion related to society \u2019s need for a particular profession should not be limited to the national territory \u2013 to the exclusion of the current and imminent future needs of the entire NORP Community \u2013 ORG held , in its judgment no . DATE of DATE , that it was evident that the major determining criterion was that based on the capacity and resource potential of universities , which allowed for proper scientific training as required by ORG legislation . As had previously been upheld by ORG ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , the right to higher levels of education , even for the most meritorious students , depended on the availability of technical means and human resources , particularly in the study of sciences , which was both theoretical and practical . Indeed , ORG legislation did not ban numeri clausi . NORP directives provided for the recognition of titles and degrees based on standards of minimum studies and guarantees of a real possession of the necessary knowledge to carry out a profession . However , they left it to individual GPE to determine the instruments , means and methods to fulfil the obligations set by those directives . The criterion relating to society \u2019s need for a particular profession carried less weight than the capacity and resource criterion , and was indeed secondary . It would come into play in the unlikely event that availability was so abundant that it would be necessary to limit access to the profession to avoid saturating the market . With reference to a recommendation by ORG to limit the number of registered students ( which formed the basis of the decision on the number of places available for DATE ) , the court considered that it was to be seen as a quantitative restriction not in view of society \u2019s needs , but in the light of a need to ensure that specialised studies reached NORP standards . Given that the relevance of this criterion to the decision on the number of candidates to be registered DATE had not been proven , and because ORG law did not provide for unlimited and unconditional access to education for students , it was not necessary to refer the matter to the ECJ .", "CARDINAL .
