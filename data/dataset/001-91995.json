The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant deposited MONEY ( USD ) for DATE with a private bank \u201c ORG - AGRO \u201d ( hereafter DATE \u201c the Bank \u201d ) . Following the ORG \u2019s refusal to return the deposit , the applicant sued ORG deposit , interest and compensation for non - pecuniary damage . According to the Government , the ORG \u2019s refusal to return the deposit was caused by a major financial crisis which had occurred in GPE in DATE and which had led to the ORG \u2019s inability to return money to its CARDINAL creditors .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG adopted a programme aimed at the protection of deposits made by private individuals with private banks . In line with measures adopted , the ORG signed an agreement with ORG . Under the terms of the agreement , the ORG transferred its liabilities to ORG which , in its turn , undertook to repay deposits made in GPE dollars at the exchange rate of MONEY for MONEY . On DATE the ORG , through a division of ORG , paid the applicant MONEY ( RUB ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE found that the applicant had not consented to the liability transfer . However , taking into account that he had already been repaid a part of the deposit , ORG ordered that the ORG should repay the applicant PERSON and that it should also pay him DATE interest starting from the date of the pronouncement of the judgment . ORG dismissed the claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The judgment was not appealed against and became final on DATE . DATE the GPE bailiffs\u2019 office instituted enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG of ORG , acting on an application for a supervisory review , quashed the judgment of DATE and sent the case for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the re - examination of the applicant \u2019s action , ORG awarded him ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in main debt , interest thereon and ORG in compensation for damage . That judgment was not appealed against and became final .", "CARDINAL . By DATE over CARDINAL enforcement claims were pending against the ORG , with an additional CARDINAL claims added DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG declared a moratorium until DATE on the execution of all creditors\u2019 demands against the ORG . On DATE the management of the ORG was taken over temporarily by ORG ( hereafter DATE \u201c the ARKO \u201d ) , set up by the ORG in accordance with the Law on Restructuring of ORG ( hereafter - \u201c the Law \u201d ) . On DATE , in accordance with the PERSON , a moratorium was set for enforcement of all PERSON demands against ORG . This period was prolonged by the ARKO on DATE for DATE , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had approved the text of a tripartite friendly settlement involving ORG , the ORG and the ARKO . The text of the friendly settlement was adopted at the general meeting of ORG on DATE by a majority of votes . The friendly settlement substantially limited the ORG \u2019s liability to its creditors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found unconstitutional the legislative provision that allowed the ARKO unilaterally to extend the moratorium for DATE , and ruled that such decisions should be subject to judicial control .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG of GPE ordered that the bailiffs should discontinue the consolidated enforcement proceedings against the ORG in respect of liabilities which had arisen before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE bailiffs\u2019 office discontinued the consolidated enforcement proceeding against the ORG and returned writs of execution to the courts which had issued them . On DATE the bailiffs informed the applicant that the enforcement proceedings against the ORG had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the ARKO to confirm that he had been recognised as a creditor of the ORG and to inform him about future meetings of the ORG \u2019s creditors . On DATE the ARKO notified the applicant that he had not been registered as a creditor of the ORG . The ORG requested the applicant to send the documents showing the ORG \u2019s liability to him . The applicant fulfilled the ARKO \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant sued the ORG and ORG for damages . He claimed that the ARKO had not recognised him as a creditor of the ORG , that he had not participated in the friendly - settlement negotiations and that he had not been able to recover his money from the ORG . The applicant insisted that the respondents should repay him the ORG \u2019s debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that ORG and ARKO were responsible for the applicant \u2019s inability to obtain payment of the judgment debt and that the refusal to recognise the applicant as a ORG \u2019s creditor was unlawful . ORG ordered that the ARKO should repay the applicant PERSON of the ORG \u2019s debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ARKO informed the applicant that he had been registered as the creditor of the ORG and the terms of the friendly settlement of DATE were applicable to him although he had not been able to negotiate them . The applicant was also informed that according to the terms of the friendly settlement he would not be paid the judgment debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . ORG again confirmed that the terms of the friendly settlement could not be applied to the applicant and the fact that the draft of the settlement had been published in the press did not imply that the applicant had agreed to the terms of that document .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant applied for a supervisory review of the judgments of DATE and DATE . It appears from the case file that ORG lodged an application for a supervisory review , arguing that the judgment of DATE , upheld on appeal on DATE , was erroneous in that the applicant \u2019s claims had been accepted . The prosecutor submitted that the terms of the friendly settlement should have been applied to the applicant \u2019s claims against the ORG and thus his action against the ORG should have been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG , by way of supervisory - review proceedings , quashed the judgments of DATE and DATE and remitted the case for a fresh examination . The ORG noted that the District and Regional courts erred in assessing the facts of the case and that the terms of the friendly settlement should be applicable to the applicant because the information about the general assembly of the ORG \u2019s creditors and the draft of the friendly settlement had been published in the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made a new judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour and awarded him USD FAC , relying on the same line of arguments as in its previous judgment of CARDINAL DATE and citing the case - law of ORG . That judgment was also quashed on appeal by ORG . The case was again sent for re - examination on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE again issued the judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour , although reducing the amount of the award to USD CARDINAL.CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The judgment was quashed by ORG and the proceedings were discontinued because the ARKO had ceased to exist as a legal entity ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
