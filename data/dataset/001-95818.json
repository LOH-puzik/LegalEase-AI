The first applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated in GPE . The other applicants are ORG ( \u201c the second applicant company \u201d ) \u2013 a company incorporated in GPE and holder of PERCENT of the shares of the first applicant ; ORG ( \u201c the third applicant company \u201d ) \u2013 a company incorporated in GPE and holder of PERCENT of the shares of the first applicant ; and PERSON ( \u201c the fourth applicant \u201d ) \u2013 a NORP national born in DATE , living in GPE and holder of PERCENT of the shares of the first applicant company .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , ORG and a third company , ORG , were owners of a CARDINAL - floor building located on the main boulevard of PERSON ( \u201c the building \u201d ) . Both companies were ORG - owned and had as their only asset different parts of the building .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG decided to privatise the companies and sold their shares to a private company , U.", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the new owner of the companies transferred all parts of the building to the first applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Also in DATE the former director of the first applicant company challenged the privatisation in the courts . However , his action was dismissed by a final judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , the courts having found that the privatisation had been legal in all respects .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the fourth applicant bought CARDINAL shares in the first applicant company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant company bought the rest of the shares of the first applicant company .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant company issued CARDINAL new shares and sold them to the third applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the Prime Minister requested ORG to conduct an investigation into the lawfulness of the privatisation . On DATE the Prosecutor General informed the Prime Minister that he had verified the lawfulness of the privatisation and had found it to be \u201c in strict compliance with the legislation in force \u201d . ORG also informed the Prime Minister that the lawfulness of the privatisation had been thoroughly verified during the proceedings ending with the final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the President of GPE requested ORG to examine the possibility of challenging the privatisation of DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Prosecutor General informed President PERSON that the transaction had been lawful and that there were no grounds to challenge it . Moreover , he indicated that after the entry into force of LAW on DATE it had become impossible to bring an appeal in cassation against the final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted proceedings on behalf of the ORG in which it contested the lawfulness of the DATE privatisation of the first applicant company and of company NORP on the ground that QUANTITY concerning the sale of State- owned shares had been breached . In particular , the Prosecutor argued that the size of the down payment made by company U. was smaller than the CARDINAL provided in the regulations and that the final price offered for the shares had been too low . The Prosecutor relied on LAW as a legal basis for his action ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a consequence of the alleged illegality of the privatisation , ORG also sought the annulment of all the subsequent transfers and issues of shares as a result of which the second , third and fourth applicants had become shareholders of the first applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The applicants opposed the action and argued , inter alia , that it was time - barred and contrary to the principle of legal certainty . They submitted that the provision of LAW exonerating the Prosecutor from observing the DATE time - limit when lodging actions in the interest of the ORG was contrary to LAW and made reference to PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . They also submitted that the lawfulness of the privatisation had been confirmed by a final judgment of DATE with the power of res judicata and that they were bona fide buyers who had been discriminated against with respect to other companies which had obtained ORG property in similar conditions and whose privatisations had not been contested later by the ORG . They also challenged the presiding judge on grounds of lack of impartiality and argued that in the proceedings which had ended with the final judgment of DATE he had been successfully challenged on such grounds . However , the challenge was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of ORG in the absence of the third and fourth applicants , who had not been summoned . The court dismissed the applicants ' objection concerning the existence of a final judgment of DATE . The court did not dispute the applicants ' submission that the proceedings of DATE had had a similar subject matter ; however , it dismissed the objection on the ground that that judgment had been adopted in proceedings in which ORG had not been involved . The court also dismissed the applicants ' objection concerning LAW , arguing that according to LAW an action by the Prosecutors in the interest of the ORG could not be time - barred .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on the basis of the same arguments which were put before the first - instance court . They also complained that not all of them had had the possibility to take part in the proceedings and that the judge had lacked impartiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicants ' appeal . During the proceedings , the applicants challenged judge GPE from the panel and expressed doubts as to the manner in which the President of ORG , Judge PERSON , had composed the panel . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . ORG relied on provisions of the old Civil Code in order to dismiss the applicants ' objection concerning their status as good faith buyers . In particular , the court argued that according to the old Civil Code property obtained unlawfully from the ORG could be claimed back irrespective of the fact that it had been obtained by a bona fide buyer . However , when examining the problem of LAW , the ORG agreed with the applicants ' objection concerning DATE of the old LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Nonetheless , the court stated for the first time in the proceedings that since the Prosecutor had introduced his action after the entry into force of the new Civil Code , the rules concerning limitations in time contained in that Code should apply . ORG expressed the opinion that the ORG 's action concerned the declaration of the absolute nullity of the privatisation and that therefore , in accordance with the provisions of LAW , it could not be limited in time . ORG also dismissed the objection concerning the existence of a final judgment in respect of the same problem on the same grounds as the first - instance court and dismissed the objection concerning the non - participation of some of the applicants in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government decided to privatise the building again and an auction for the sale of the building was scheduled for DATE . It appears that the building was not sold on that date and the ORG has no information as to the subsequent development of the events .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear from the facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , that the applicants have been repaid the value of their initial investment .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW , in force at the moment of the privatisation , provide :", "A contract which is contrary to the law shall be null and void ...", "When a contract is declared null and void , each party must return to the other party everything received from it on the basis of the contract ...", "The general limitation period for protection through a court action of the rights of a [ natural ] person is DATE ; it is DATE for lawsuits between ORG organisations , collective farms and any other social organisations .", "The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period whether or not the parties request such application .", "Expiry of the limitation period prior to initiation of court proceedings constitutes a ground for rejecting the claim .", "If the competent court ... finds that the action has not commenced within the limitation period for well - founded reasons , the right in question shall be protected .", "The limitation period does not apply :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) to claims by ORG organisations regarding restitution of ORG property found in the unlawful possession of ... other organisations ... and of citizens ; \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of the new LAW , in force after DATE , read as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) The civil law does not have a retroactive character . It can not modify or suppress the conditions in which a prior legal situation was constituted or the conditions in which such a legal situation was extinguished . The new law can not alter or abolish the already created effects of a legal situation which has extinguished or is in the process of execution .", "( CARDINAL ) The absolute nullity of a legal act can be invoked by any person having an interest . The court can invoke it on its own motion ...", "( CARDINAL ) An action to declare the absolute nullity is not limited in time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case nr .
