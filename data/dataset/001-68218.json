He is represented before the ORG by Mr Ilievski , a lawyer practising in GPE ( former GPE ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is an ethnic NORP , who was residing with his family in ORG , GPE ( in the former GPE ) until his arrival in GPE in DATE .", "The applicant maintains that in DATE he was forcibly recruited as an informer for the NORP police . From DATE he helped the police to discover and learn about alleged smugglers of cigarettes , drugs and weapons , and other offenders . In DATE , when the security situation in GPE deteriorated , the applicant was directing NORP police to houses in which members of ORG ( \u201c KLA \u201d ) , political opponents of the regime , and other ethnic NORP referred to by the police as \u201c terrorists and separatists \u201d lived .", "In DATE the applicant joined the political party \u201c NORP Initiative for GPE \u201d ( \u201c DIK \u201d ) , which did not support independence for GPE and promoted tolerance towards the NORP and other ethnic minorities living in the province .", "The local NORP marked the applicant as a collaborator of the NORP and a traitor and suspected him of being a member of the \u201c Black Hand \u201d organisation ( an alleged NORP terrorist organisation , which was active in the urban parts of GPE province during the clashes between the NORP security forces and the ORG ) .", "In addition to shunning and threatening him because of his collaboration with the NORP , the NORP militants disliked the applicant because of his background - his father was a chief in the LOC police and his grandfather had been a judge of ORG - and because of his membership in ORG .", "The applicant maintains that DATE after the withdrawal of the NORP security forces from the province of GPE and the arrival of the NATO - led peacekeeping forces ( ORG ) in DATE , he was kidnapped by the ORG . He claims that he was held for DATE in an office in ORG and was questioned about his links with the NORP police . He was not ill - treated on that occasion . After his release , the applicant reported the event to the local headquarters of GPE , but they had not found the kidnappers or taken any other measures .", "DATE after that event the applicant was again kidnapped by ORG members . He was taken to the village of ORG , in the municipality of PERSON , where he was held in a cellar for DATE . In the course of his detention , the applicant was interrogated about the \u201c LOC \u201d organisation ( the applicant denied being a member of it ) , his connections and collaboration with the NORP police , and about the structure and leaders of the ORG . The applicant alleges that he was constantly kicked and beaten with an electric cable and electrically burned , with the result that he had swellings all over his body . The applicant could not bear the ill - treatment and tried to kill himself ( by slashing his veins ) , but his suicide attempt was unsuccessful . He further alleges that another police collaborator , who was tortured at the same time and place , did not survive the acts of brutality .", "The applicant managed to abscond when the vehicle in which he was to be transported to another destination overturned near the village of ORG . He then went into hiding and temporarily stayed at different places . He ultimately returned to his home town of ORG , where he was again discovered by the ORG .", "In DATE ( the applicant claims to have no recollection of the exact date ) CARDINAL ORG members attempted to assassinate him in his uncle 's house , using guns with silencers . The incident was reported to ORG and to the field delegate of ORG . Their suggestion was that the applicant should leave GPE .", "On DATE , with the assistance of a protection officer of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees , the applicant was driven to the FAC border - crossing point , where he entered the former GPE .", "Upon his arrival in the FYR of GPE , the applicant was granted the status of PERSON Person ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and was subsequently accommodated in a group centre .", "On DATE , after the ORG status for NORP expired , the applicant 's representative filed an application with ORG for Foreigners and Immigration Issues ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 - \u0421\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0430\u045a\u0430 ) , requesting that his client be granted refugee status and making mainly the allegations and complaints set out in the application to the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant 's representative obtained a memorandum from the office of the ORG in GPE , ORG of GPE , in support of the applicant 's request to be granted refugee status by the national authorities . The memorandum contained a brief statement to the effect that the applicant was regarded by the ORG as an important witness . No other supporting evidence was submitted owing ( so the applicant 's representative maintained ) to the confidentiality of proceedings before the ORG .", "By a decision of DATE ORG , following an interview with the applicant on DATE , refused his request . It held that the applicant 's statements had been intentionally false and contradictory , and no well - founded fear that the applicant would be exposed to persecution if returned to his country of origin had been established , as required by law , to justify his being granted refugee status .", "On DATE the applicant , through his representative , lodged an appeal with ORG responsible for handling administrative issues arising in the areas of internal affairs , the judiciary , ORG administration , local self - government and religious affairs ( \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043da GPE \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 , \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e , \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 , \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0434 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 ) . He maintained that the first - instance administrative body had erred in fact and failed to provide sufficient reasoning for its decision . The applicant 's representative also argued that the applicant 's case had not been comprehensively reviewed , no regard had been had to the ORG memorandum of DATE , and the decision had been based on personal prejudice against the applicant rather than on his statements and on the evidence submitted .", "On DATE ORG , upholding the reasoning given by the first - instance administrative body , dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It stated , inter alia , that after consideration of the first - instance decision , the concerns raised in the appeal and other documents in the case file , no well - founded fear of persecution of the applicant by the ORG in GPE had been established since the applicant 's statements had been assessed as lacking credibility and plausibility . It had also considered the ORG memorandum but had attached no particular weight to it because it was based on the applicant 's false statements .", "On DATE the applicant 's representative lodged a complaint with ORG ( GPE \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0430 PERSON ) , requesting the court to quash the decision of ORG and either grant the applicant refugee status or to set aside that decision and remit the case for re - examination . He maintained that although the applicant 's statements to the effect that members of the ORG had tortured him and attempted to assassinate him had not been supported by documentary evidence , the mere fact that they were detailed , disclosing the names of NORP police officers with whom he used to collaborate and the names of persons who had persecuted , tortured and attempted to kill him , should have been a sufficient ground for believing that they were true . Moreover , the credibility of the applicant 's statements should have not been questioned in view of the ORG memorandum of DATE to the effect that he was regarded as an important witness before that ORG .", "In the meanwhile on DATE , the applicant made an application to ORG , requesting that the decision of ORG of DATE should not be enforced pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG . This was actually a request by the applicant lodged under LAW not to be expelled . However , it appears that no decision was made on the application .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint on the ground that the applicant had not fulfilled the requirements of section CARDINAL of LAW or those of the DATE LAW relating to ORG as he had failed to substantiate his allegations of persecution in his country of origin . It held , in particular , that the applicant , as a national of GPE , could have enjoyed effective protection , if not in GPE , then in other parts of his country of origin . The court had regard to the applicant 's allegations that he was marked by the NORP as a collaborator of the NORP and that he had been kidnapped and his life had been threatened on account of his past collaboration with the NORP police and his membership of the ORG , but he had failed to provide evidence in support of these allegations . The court further indicated that regard had been had to the memorandum issued by the ORG but , since no other evidence had been submitted in support , it was unable to accept that memorandum as an additional reason for his fears of persecution in his country of origin .", "On DATE the applicant 's representative was served with a notice by ORG for Foreigners and Immigration Issues , stating that his client was requested to leave the country by DATE at the latest .", "In a letter of DATE to the ORG officer in GPE , the ORG Chief of Investigations , PERSON , confirmed that the applicant was a potential witness and was expected to be called to testify in future trials to be held by the ORG . Furthermore , he stated that in the light of the information available to the ORG ,", "\u201c ... It would not be safe for the applicant to be returned to GPE or GPE due to the very real expectation that his basic human rights would be under threat ... \u201d", "On DATE a request for an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL was lodged with the ORG , which granted it . By letter of DATE , the Government informed the ORG that the applicant would not be expelled and that ORG was investigating with the ORG the possibility of the applicant 's transfer to a third ORG .", "On DATE the applicant voluntarily left ORG , which is an open place , the foreigners living there having complete freedom of movement . Ever since then the applicant has been under the protection of the ORG as a potential witness and has been taken to a safe address , which is temporary . In his latest communication to the ORG , the applicant 's representative indicated that the ORG officials with whom he had made contact had stated that the applicant 's current place of residence was dictated by the needs of the ORG and the duration of his stay there was uncertain .", "The relevant provisions of ORG ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438 ) , published in issue no . CARDINAL of the \u201c Official Gazette of GPE \u201d , may be summarised as follows .", "Section CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that if an alien does not leave the ORG 's territory within the given time - limit , he shall be escorted by an official of ORG to the State border or to the embassy or consulate of his country of origin .", "Section CARDINAL stipulates that an alien shall not be expelled from the ORG 's territory if his life will thereby be put in jeopardy owing to his racial , religious or national affiliation or his political beliefs or if he runs the risk of being exposed to torture or inhuman treatment .", "Section CARDINAL provides that an alien who left his country because he was persecuted for his democratic political convictions and actions , cultural or scientific activities or because of his national , racial or religious affiliation can be granted refugee status ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
