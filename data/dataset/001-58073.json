Russo;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant has been in custody since DATE in connection with various criminal proceedings brought against him on suspicion of his having taken part in the activities of the terrorist organisation known as \" Prima linea \" .", "CARDINAL . When he lodged his application with the Commission on DATE , there were CARDINAL prosecutions pending against PERSON . The first of these ended in a judgment of ORG of DATE , which became final on DATE . The court sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY for aiding and abetting aggravated armed robbery , aiding and abetting aggravated theft , aiding and abetting the handling of stolen goods and unlawful possession of weapons . The second trial ended in a judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , which became final on DATE . The court sentenced him to DATE , DATE imprisonment for murder , aggravated armed robbery , treasonable conspiracy , membership of an armed organisation and other offences . The third trial , at ORG , ended in a judgment of DATE , which became final on DATE . The court imposed a sentence of DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY for armed robbery and other offences . ORG of the applicant 's correspondence during his detention in FAC", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( magistrato di sorveglianza ) at GPE , where PERSON had been in custody since DATE , decided under LAW of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that his correspondence and that of other prisoners in the special unit of ORG should be censored for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law lodged against that order on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , the GPE judge responsible for the execution of sentences renewed the censorship DATE , in DATE , DATE and on DATE and DATE and DATE . The reasons given for these decisions were , firstly , that the monitoring of the applicant 's correspondence and that of the other prisoners concerned had made it possible to discover differences of opinion within the group of former terrorists and to prevent confrontations and acts of vengeance and , secondly , that there was a danger that the applicant would use the mail to commit offences or prejudice public order or safety .", "CARDINAL . It is not contested that the following letters were inspected : ( a ) a letter of CARDINAL DATE from the applicant to the lawyer Mr PERSON ; ( b ) a registered letter of DATE from the applicant to the lawyer Mr PERSON ; ( c ) a letter of CARDINAL DATE from the applicant to Mr PERSON ; and ( d ) letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE from the applicant to Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant challenged the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in the Turin Sentence Execution Court ( tribunale di sorveglianza ) . On DATE that court declared his appeal inadmissible on the ground that the relevant NORP PERSON did not provide any remedy in respect of such decisions in view of their administrative nature . The court 's decision was served on PERSON on DATE , and on DATE he appealed on points of law . In a pleading of CARDINAL DATE his counsel argued , in particular , that the possibility of appealing to ORG against decisions to impose censorship was provided for in NORP legislation . He also maintained that the measure in issue , applied \" collectively \" to a group of prisoners , irrespective of the individual circumstances of each , was absolutely unjustified and that the delay in forwarding to him , after it had been inspected , the applicant 's letter informing him of the receipt of the court 's decision rejecting his appeal had impeded the exercise of the rights of the defence . ORG , however , did not forward the appeal and other procedural documents to ORG , but set the matter down for hearing on DATE , when it rejected the appeal , holding it to be essentially identical with the earlier one it had dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer asked the court to forward the appeal to ORG , which alone was competent to rule on an appeal that had been made direct to it .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards , on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the GPE judge responsible for the execution of sentences renewed the order that PERSON correspondence should be censored . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer lodged a fresh appeal on points of law with ORG . On CARDINAL DATE the court declared inadmissible \" the appeal against the decision declaring the appeal inadmissible \" and did not forward the appeal to ORG . B. The applicant 's continued detention", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to FAC .", "CARDINAL . In a report drawn up by the prison management in DATE , it was stated that the applicant 's behaviour towards the staff and his attitude towards his past had shown some improvement . On DATE , taking the view that this progress was not sufficient , ORG dismissed an application by PERSON to be given semi - custodial treatment instead of being kept in detention . From DATE , however , the applicant was granted short periods of prison leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of CARDINAL reports of DATE and DATE which indicated further , substantial progress , the court ordered that the applicant should be given semi - custodial treatment .", "CARDINAL . LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \" Law no . CARDINAL \" ) , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , provides that power in the matter of censorship of prisoners ' correspondence vests in the judge dealing with the case - whether an investigating judge or a trial judge - up to the decision at first instance and in the judge responsible for the execution of sentences thereafter . The judge may order censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence in a reasoned decision ; this provision , however , does not specify the cases in which such a decision may be taken .", "CARDINAL . The censorship of which the applicant complains consists , in particular , in all mail being intercepted and read by either the judicial authority that has ordered the censorship or the prison governor or prison staff designated by him , and in the stamping of letters for the purpose of showing that they have been inspected . Censorship can not extend to deleting words or sentences , but the judicial authority can order that CARDINAL or more letters shall not be handed over ; in that case , the prisoner must immediately be informed of the fact . This latter measure can also be ordered temporarily by the prison governor , who must , however , notify the judicial authority of his action .", "CARDINAL . LAW forbids the seizure or any form of control of the correspondence between a prisoner and his lawyer , provided that the correspondence is recognisable as such and unless the judicial authority has well - founded reasons to believe that the correspondence constitutes the substance of the offence . Similarly , by LAW transitional provisions of LAW , the rules on the censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence that are laid down in PERSON no . CARDINAL and Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE do not apply to correspondence between the prisoner and his lawyer . It follows , among other things , that the only authority that may order censorship of that correspondence , and then solely in the case mentioned above , is the judge or court dealing with the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held on several occasions that the measure in issue is an administrative act and has also stated that NORP law does not provide any remedy in respect of it ; in particular , censorship can not be the subject of an appeal on points of law , since it does not affect the prisoner 's personal freedom ( Court of Cassation , judgments ORG .
