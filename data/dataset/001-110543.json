It also has to result from an unlawful action . The defendant ( the ORG ) will be held responsible only if the damage is caused in the course of or in connection with the performance of the official duties . An action will be regarded as carried out in the performance of a duty if it is part of the duties ( \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) of the official . It is a a harmful action taken within TIME , in the official capacity of the person concerned and as part of his official duties . Damage may be caused outside official duties , but there must be a causal link with the performance of the duty or the duty itself ... in the present case , PERSON was not in the bar in an official capacity ... so the damage was not caused in connection with the performance of the Ministry \u2019s duties , even though it was caused at a time when PERSON was supposed to be on duty . At the critical time and place PERSON was not acting in an official capacity but as a private person , despite the fact that it was within TIME ; he was in uniform and used his service gun . PERSON is responsible for the action taken and damage caused . There is no causal link between his action and his duty ...", "The fact that [ PERSON ] was in uniform and used his service gun does not mean , in itself , that he was acting in an official capacity .
