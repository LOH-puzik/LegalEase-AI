The judgment noted that the sentence served should not exceed the maximum term provided for in LAW of DATE . In order to determine which criminal law was applicable ( LAW of DATE , which was applicable at the material time , or LAW ) , the Audiencia Nacional considered that the more lenient law was the DATE LAW , because of the maximum term of sentence provided for in its LAW , in conjunction with its LAW ( reduction of sentence for work done ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In all , the terms of imprisonment to which the applicant was sentenced amounted to over DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held in preventive detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE she began to serve her sentence after conviction .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL November CARDINAL the Audiencia Nacional notified the applicant that the legal and chronological links between the crimes of which she had been convicted made it possible to group them together as provided for in LAW in conjunction with LAW , which had been in force when the offences were committed . The Audiencia Nacional combined all the applicant \u2019s prison sentences together and fixed the total term of imprisonment to be served at DATE .", "CARDINAL .

At such time , all of the sentences comprised in the total sentence to be served [ condena ] shall have been extinguished . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

As that was the applicant \u2019s case , the date of her release would be changed accordingly .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal ( s\u00faplica ) . She argued , inter alia , that the application of ORG judgment was in breach of the principle of non - retroactivity of criminal law provisions less favourable to the accused .

By a decision of DATE the Audiencia Nacional rejected the appeal and noted that it was not a matter of limits on prison sentences , but rather of how to apply reductions of sentence in order to determine the date of the prisoner \u2019s release . Such reductions were to be calculated in relation to each sentence individually . Concerning the principle of non - retroactivity , the Audiencia Nacional considered that it had not been breached because the criminal law applied in this case had been in force at the time of its application .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG considered that the combining of sentences in application of LAW of LAW of DATE and LAW concerned not the \u201c execution \u201d but the fixing of the sentence , and that its application was accordingly a matter for the convicting judge , not the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( CARDINAL ) ORG affirmed that the maximum term of imprisonment ( DATE ) provided for in LAW of DATE was just like a new sentence \u2013 resulting from but independent of the others \u2013 to which prison benefits provided for by law , such as release on licence and remission of sentence , applied \u201d ( point CARDINAL of the reasoning ) . ORG referred to LAW of DATE , according to which the combining of CARDINAL custodial sentences into CARDINAL was considered as a new sentence for the purposes of the application of release on licence .", "CARDINAL . That approach continued to be adopted after the entry into force of LAW of DATE as regards the legal maximum term to be served under LAW thereof ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

A similar approach was followed in the judgment of DATE ( DATE ) , in which ORG , in the same terms , reiterated that the maximum term of imprisonment to be served \u201c is just like a new sentence \u2013 resulting from but independent of the others \u2013 to which prison benefits provided for by law , such as release on licence must be applied , subject to the exceptions provided for in Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE \u201d ( point CARDINAL of the reasoning ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG departed from this case - law , however , in judgment DATE , of DATE , in which it established what is known as the \u201c Parot doctrine \u201d . ORG held that reductions of ORG sentences should be applied to each sentence individually , not to the maximum sentence of DATE imprisonment provided for in LAW of DATE . The relevant parts of ORG reasoning read as follows :", "\u201c ... a joint interpretation of rules CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE leads us to consider that the DATE maximum term does not become a new sentence , distinct from those successively imposed on the convict , or another sentence resulting from all the previous ones , but is the maximum term of imprisonment a prisoner should serve . The reasons that lead us to this interpretation are : ( a ) first , from a purely literal point of view , LAW by no means considers the maximum term of DATE as a new sentence to which any reductions to which the prisoner is entitled should apply , quite simply because it says no such thing ; ( b ) on the contrary , the penalty ( pena ) and the resulting term of imprisonment to be served ( condena ) are CARDINAL different things ; the wording used in the Criminal Code refers to the resulting limit as the \u201c maximum term to be served \u201d ( condena ) , establishing the different lengths of that \u201c maximum term to be served \u201d ( condena ) in relation to each of the respective \u201c sentences \u201d imposed , and calculated in CARDINAL different ways , by taking the different sentences in order of gravity , in accordance with the first rule , until CARDINAL of the CARDINAL maximum limits provided for is attained ( CARDINAL times the length of the heaviest sentence pronounced or , in any event , DATE ) ; ( c ) this interpretation is also suggested by the wording of the LAW , since after completing the successive sentences as mentioned , the prisoner will stop \u2018 discharging [ that is , serving ] the remaining ones [ in the prescribed order ] as soon as the sentences already served reach the requisite maximum length , which may on no account exceed DATE ... ( e ) and from a teleological point of view , it would not be logical , simply because of the aggregation of sentences , for a copious criminal record to be reduced to a single new sentence of DATE , with the effect that an individual who has committed a single offence is treated , without justification , in the same way as someone convicted of multiple offences , as is the case here . Indeed , there is no logic in applying this rule in such a way that committing CARDINAL murder is punished in the same way as committing CARDINAL murders ; ( f ) were application for a pardon to be made , it could not apply to the resulting total term to be served ( condena ) , but rather to CARDINAL , several or all of the different sentences imposed ; in such a case it is for the court that pronounced the sentence to decide , and not the judicial body responsible for applying the limit ( DATE ) , which shows that the sentences are different ; and in any event , the first rule of Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE states how , in such a case , to verify the successive completion of the sentences \u201c when the previous ones have been extinguished by pardon \u201d ; ( g ) and to conclude this reasoning , from a procedural point of view LAW clearly states that it is a matter of fixing the maximum limit of the sentences pronounced ( in the plural , in keeping with the wording of the law ) , \u201c in order to determine the maximum length of these sentences \u201d ( the wording is very clear ) .", "Which is why the term \u201c aggregate of the sentences to be served [ condenas ] \u201d is very misleading and inappropriate . The sentences are not merged into CARDINAL , but the serving of multiple sentences is limited by law to a certain maximum term . Consequently , the prisoner serves the different sentences , with their respective specificities and with all the benefits to which he is entitled . That being so , for the extinction of the sentences successively served , the reduction of sentences for work done may be applied in conformity with LAW .", "Thus , the method for the discharge of the total term to be served [ condena ] is as follows : it begins with the heaviest sentences imposed . The relevant benefits and remissions are applied to each of the sentences the prisoner is serving . When the first [ sentence ] has been served , the prisoner begins to serve the next one and so on , until the limits provided for in LAW of DATE have been reached . At this stage , all of the sentences comprised in the total term to be served [ condena ] will have been extinguished .", "For example , in the case of an individual given CARDINAL prison sentences , DATE , DATE and DATE . The second rule of Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ... limits the actual term to be served to CARDINAL times the most serious sentence or a maximum of DATE imprisonment . In this case , it would be the maximum term of DATE . The successive serving of the sentences ( the total term to be served ) begins with the first sentence , which is the longest one ( DATE in this case ) . If [ the prisoner ] were granted a DATE remission for whatever reason , he would have served that sentence after DATE imprisonment , and the sentence would be extinguished ; next , [ the prisoner ] would start to serve the next longest sentence ( DATE ) , and with a remission of DATE that sentence will have been served after DATE . MONEY = CARDINAL . [ The prisoner ] would not have to serve any other sentence , any remaining sentences being extinguished , as provided for in the applicable Criminal Code , once those already imposed cover that maximum , which may not exceed DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In that judgment ORG considered that there was no well - established case - law on the specific question of the interpretation of LAW in relation to LAW . It referred to a single precedent , its judgment of DATE in which it considered that the maximum duration provided for in LAW of DATE was \u201c just like a new , independent sentence \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , ORG departed from that interpretation , pointing out that that decision , which it considered an isolated one , could not be relied on as a precedent in so far as it had never been applied in a constant manner as required under LAW of LAW . Even assuming that that decision could have been considered as a precedent , the court reiterated that the principle of equality before the law ( LAW ) did not preclude departures from the case - law , provided that sufficient reasons were given . Furthermore , the principle that the law should not be applied retroactively ( LAW ) was not meant to apply to case - law .", "CARDINAL . A dissenting opinion was appended to judgment DATE by CARDINAL judges . They considered that the sentences imposed successively were transformed or combined into another sentence of the same kind , but different in so far as it combined the various sentences into one . They called it \u201c the sentence to be served \u201d , that is to say the CARDINAL resulting from the application of the limit fixed in LAW of DATE , which effectively extinguished the sentences that went beyond that limit . This new \u201c unit of punishment \u201d was the term the prisoner had to serve , to which remission for work done should be applied . Remissions should therefore be applied to the sentences imposed , but only once they had been processed in conformity with the rules on the consecutive serving of sentences . The dissenting judges also pointed out that for the purposes of determining the most lenient criminal law following the entry into force of LAW of DATE , all NORP courts , including ORG ( agreements adopted at the Plenary sessions on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) , had agreed to the principle that reductions of sentence should be applied to the sentence resulting from the application of LAW of LAW of DATE ( the DATE limit ) . In application of that criterion no fewer than sixteen people convicted of terrorism had recently had their sentences reduced for work done although they had each been given prison sentences of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judges considered that the method applied by the majority was not provided for in LAW of DATE and therefore amounted to retroactive implicit application of the new LAW as modified by institutional law CARDINAL/CARDINAL on measures for the full and effective execution of sentences ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This new interpretation was also contra reo , constituted a policy of full execution of sentences alien to LAW of DATE , could be a source of inequalities and was contrary to the case - law of ORG ( judgments of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Lastly , the dissenting judges considered that criminal policy reasons could on no account justify such a departure from the principle of legality , even in the case of an unrepentant terrorist murderer .", "CARDINAL . In a series of judgments of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled on several amparo appeals lodged by convicts to whom the \u201c GPE doctrine \u201d had been applied . In CARDINAL cases ( DATE , DATE ) it allowed the appeals for violation of the right to effective judicial protection ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ) and the right to liberty ( LAW ) . ORG considered that the new method of calculating remission following ORG departure in DATE from its earlier case - law was in contradiction with the earlier final judicial decisions in the NORP cases . In those earlier firm and final decisions , in order to determine which was the most lenient criminal law applicable ( LAW of DATE or that of DATE ) , the courts had based themselves on the principle that the reductions of sentence for work done provided for in LAW of DATE should be applied to the DATE maximum sentence , not to each sentence individually . In so doing they had reached the conclusion that the regime of LAW of DATE , with its reductions of sentence for work done , was more favourable to the appellants than LAW . In a third case ( appeal no . DATE ) , ORG found in the appellant \u2019s favour for violation of the right to effective judicial protection ( LAW ) , considering that the Audiencia Nacional had changed the date of the prisoner \u2019s final release , thereby disregarding its own firm and final judicial decision given DATE . In these CARDINAL cases ORG pointed out that the right to effective judicial protection included the right not to have final judicial decisions overruled ( the \u201c intangibility \u201d of final judicial decisions ) .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL other cases ORG dismissed the amparo appeals on the merits , finding that the decisions by which the ordinary courts had set the appellants\u2019 final dates of release in application of the departure from precedent in DATE had not contravened any final judicial decision concerning them .", "CARDINAL . Both in the judgments in the appellants\u2019 favour ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and in those against them ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ORG dismissed the complaints under LAW ( principle of legality ) , considering that the question of the calculation of remission for work done concerned the execution of the sentence and on no account the application of a harsher sentence than that provided for in the applicable criminal law , or a sentence exceeding the limit allowed by law . It cited the case - law of ORG according to which a distinction was to be made , for the purposes of LAW , between measures constituting a \u201c penalty \u201d and measures relating to the \u201c execution \u201d of a penalty ( PERSON GPE , no . ORG , \u00a7 DATE , DATE , and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
