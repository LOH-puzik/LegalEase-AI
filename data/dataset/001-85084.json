At that last hearing , the accused , Mr DATE , who had initially called a number of witnesses in the context of his offer to adduce evidence , finally refrained from relying on the veracity of the defamatory comments and used the defence of good faith .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG acquitted the CARDINAL defendants .

The court then considered that CARDINAL of the offending passages were not defamatory . As regards the judicial investigation being \u201c rocambolesque \u201d ( farcical ) , the court observed that this adjective was derived from \u201c Rocambole \u201d , the name of a character featuring in serialised novels by ORG , and that it was used to describe a farcical situation , full of extraordinary ins and outs , as one might find in those novels . After noting that Mr Matagrin had , in a number of letters , contrary to the various statements given during the proceedings , denied using that term , but had not questioned the good faith of the journalist who wrote the article , the court found that the offending word was unquestionably polemical in nature but did not constitute in itself an attack on the honour and reputation of judges and that , whilst the expression undermined the image of a dispassionate judicial system , it was an example of polemical language falling within the free democratic debate surrounding judicial life that the judiciary could not oppose , unless CARDINAL were to prohibit any criticism about the course of a judicial investigation . The reference to an \u201c accumulation of anomalies \u201d was found not to be related to the person in charge of the judicial investigation but to the anomalies identified in the case file and strongly conveyed the dissatisfaction of the civil parties . As to the \u201c slowness attributable to the investigating judges \u201d , the court considered that this criticism fell squarely within the public debate on the functioning of the judicial system and on its sluggishness , adding as follows :", "\u201c ... judges have to accept free public scrutiny , and more specifically that of parties to proceedings and of the press , vis - \u00e0 - vis their action , provided that criticism \u2013 harsh though it may be DATE does not contain any precise accusation impugning their intellectual honesty , professional integrity or devotion to public service . In the present case there can be no serious charge \u2013 to the extent of falling within the scope of criminal law \u2013 on account of the reproduction of a complaint against judges for being slow that was made at a press conference held DATE after the discovery of Mr GPE \u2019s body , and during which the judge \u2019s widow lamented that she still had no idea how or why her husband had died . \u201d", "Accordingly , the only passage regarded as manifestly damaging to the judges\u2019 honour and reputation was the one that concerned the civil party \u2019s complaint that \u201c the judges had shown bias \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court accepted the applicants\u2019 defence of good faith , having regard to the CARDINAL conditions to be satisfied ( pursuit of legitimate aim , absence of personal animosity , use of prudent and dispassionate language , requisite quality and seriousness of investigation ) , considering that the newspaper , by reporting on the criticism of the judicial investigation into the death of Judge GPE , had simply been fulfilling its mission to inform the public . The court unequivocally recognised the legitimacy of the aim pursued ( interest for public opinion , publicising of request for inspection by judicial inspectorate ) and the absence of personal animosity . As regards the use of prudent and dispassionate language , the court , in view of the blatant antagonism between the civil parties and the investigating judges , remarked upon the vehemence of the comments , but considered that the journalist had taken the necessary distance by using the conditional tense in the only passage recognised as defamatory . Finally , as regards the last requirement , the court found that , by refraining from approving the offending expressions reported and by taking the requisite distance , the newspaper had avoided creating any confusion in readers\u2019 minds between the speaker \u2019s original comments and the analysis by that newspaper .", "CARDINAL . In submissions filed with ORG of ORG , on an appeal by the applicants , the civil parties relied on the CARDINAL allegations already examined and sought recognition that they were defamatory . They further complained that the court had failed to impugn the lack of prudent and dispassionate language , in so far as journalists were supposed to convey objective and documented information and as they had a duty of preliminary investigation in order to ensure the reliability and accuracy of their information . The public prosecutor , for his part , left the matter to the discretion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing set down for DATE , ORG adjourned the case until a hearing of DATE . In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG , presided over by Judge PERSON ( with Judges PERSON and PERSON also on the bench ) , partly set aside the judgment of acquittal , finding defamatory , in addition to the allegation of bias on the part of the judges , the accusation that the \u201c conduct of the GPE investigation had been \u2018 ORG ( rocambolesque ) \u201d , and ruling as follows :", "\u201c It appears from the examination of witnesses before the court and from the attestation provided by PERSON , ORG and Prosecutors [ Association professionnelle des magistrats ] , that he had used this word in a quite different formulation , which had not reflected an unequivocal desire to denounce his colleagues\u2019 manner of investigation .", "That being said , the adjective \u2018 ORG [ rocambolesque ] , when applied to the manner in which a judicial investigation was conducted , went beyond the context of a simple debate since its aim was to denounce a practice that was unconventional and bizarre , of course alluding to the adventures of an unscrupulous and scheming character who lived by his wits , but above all implying that the judicial investigation had been flying in the face of common sense , without any rationality . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the allegations concerning an \u201c accumulation of anomalies \u201d and \u201c slow judges \u201d , the court endorsed the grounds adopted by the court below and upheld the judgment in that respect .", "CARDINAL . ORG also set aside the judgment appealed against in so far as it had admitted the first applicant \u2019s defence of good faith , finding as follows :", "\u201c As to the defence of good faith", "... The parties agree that the newspaper ORG was pursuing a legitimate aim in informing its readers about a press conference on a subject that had taken on a national dimension on account of its developments ; furthermore , [ the investigating judges ] have never claimed that the article \u2019s author showed any personal animosity towards them .", "In addition , it should be observed , first of all , that LAW of LAW provides , with regard to the freedom to hold opinions and the freedom to impart information , that the exercise of those freedoms may be subject to certain formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties .", "In the present case , the relative \u2018 inexperience\u2019 alleged by the journalist , claiming that reporting on court cases was not her strong point , can not seriously be argued since she had already dealt with this subject .", "The author clearly preferred not to report on the subject in the form of an interview and opted for a compromise solution involving the use of inverted commas , which considerably facilitated her task .", "She had a duty to assess the full impact of the most suggestive terms used , such as \u2018 GPE and \u2018 ORG , and of their visual prominence in the article .", "She was not unaware of the fact that the criminal case about which the press conference was held had entered into a phase of acute conflict , involving a particularly serious attack on the investigating judges ; in choosing a certain manner of informing her readers , albeit indirectly , about the status of an ongoing judicial investigation of a particularly sensitive nature , the journalist had a duty to take certain precautions and to carry out a particularly serious investigation , since she could not have been unaware of the aim pursued by the civil parties .", "In particular , by distorting PERSON comments , to give them a completely different emphasis , the author of the article acted irresponsibly .", "Moreover , she can not seriously claim not to have managed to get in contact with the CARDINAL judges concerned : PERSON , an investigating judge \u2019s assistant , has stated that she can not remember any call from the journalist . In any event , the journalist , who had some knowledge about judicial issues , was under an obligation , in view of the deadline for the paper to go to press , to gather various items of information beforehand , even before the press conference , and also to indicate in her article that , in DATE , she would ensure that the persons thus criticised had the opportunity to reply .", "By choosing , as to the form , to report it by adopting a style other than that of an interview , the author could not have been unaware that the parts of the article not placed between inverted commas could be attributed to her .", "Contrary to the reasoning given on this point by the courts below , the impugned article does not strike a balance between the respective positions . To be sure , by failing to ask either the public prosecutor \u2019s office or the main parties concerned about the factors that might have affected the progress of the investigation , the journalist logically did not put herself in a position to strike such a balance , in particular as in the presentation of the article \u2019s paragraphs a significant amount of space was left for the positions of other judges representing their unions .", "This flagrant breach of the duty to ensure accuracy , seriousness and prudence , with mistakes in the dates , can not be justified by the alleged urgency . The publication director , being well - informed about issues of society , had an obligation to scrutinise the article more stringently , especially as he was aware of the author \u2019s relative lack of experience . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
