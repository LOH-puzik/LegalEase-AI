The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG . At the material time the applicant held a pilot licence and was undergoing aviation training .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant used the services of a company , PERSON ( the name of this company was subsequently changed , but it will be referred to hereinafter as \u201c KD.C. \u201d or \u201c the company \u201d ) . PERSON held PERCENT of the shares in the company ( he was its sole owner ) and he was also its sole board member . The company provided private flights and organised private pilot training courses . ORG had issued the company with a registration certificate for the provision of private pilot training courses .", "CARDINAL . The company did not provide commercial flights , therefore it fell outside the scope of the Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers on Procedures Regarding the Issuing of an Air Operator \u2019s Certificate for Aerial Work ( CARDINAL DATE ) , and was not certified by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON organised a private flight from GPE to ORG using a multi - engine aircraft , a ORG PA-CARDINAL with a maximum allowed mass of QUANTITY . The applicant and CARDINAL other people boarded the aircraft as passengers . The applicant occupied the front seat of the aircraft , next to the pilot , GPE , and maintained radio communication with the air traffic control service .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the pilot , GPE , lost control of the aircraft and it crashed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a result , the pilot died and all passengers sustained serious injuries .", "CARDINAL . According to a forensic medical examination , the applicant suffered serious , life - threatening injuries . He permanently lost the vision in his right eye and sustained other permanent damage to his health . He underwent treatment in GPE and abroad .", "After rehabilitation , the applicant was able to continue working as an aviation specialist , but under certain limitations . He was not permitted to operate an aircraft independently and was required to undergo medical checks more often than other aviation specialists .", "CARDINAL . Following the accident on DATE officials from ORG ( Transporta nelaimes gad\u012bjumu un incidentu izmekl\u0113\u0161anas birojs , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , whose main task was to establish the circumstances of an accident , went to the scene of the accident and carried out an investigation .", "CARDINAL . According to the TAIIB \u2019s final report of DATE , on DATE of the accident , when operating in cloudy weather , GPE , the pilot , made a series of chaotic manoeuvres , as a result of which the aircraft , which was CARDINAL from the ground , lost altitude . The attempts to stabilise it were unsuccessful . As a consequence of hitting the ground and damaging its tank , the aircraft caught fire .", "CARDINAL . The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the accident was \u201c human error \u201d ( cilv\u0113ka faktors ) , namely GPE having insufficient skills and experience to independently operate a multi - engine aircraft in accordance with instrumental flight rules and , in particular , to operate a ORG aircraft . The pilot had not obtained authorisation from ORG to fly that particular type of aircraft . In particular , PERSON had started the \u201c differences training programme \u201d for the ORG aircraft on DATE , but had not finished it . Nevertheless , on DATE he had flown without sufficient qualifications .", "CARDINAL . The final report indicated several aspects which had contributed to the accident , such as unfavourable weather conditions with poor visibility , and the \u201c unsafe supervision \u201d ( nedro\u0161a uzraudz\u012bba ) carried out by ORG \u201c [ to ensure ] that the aviation legislation and visual flight rules were complied with \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to PERSON , the company which owned the aircraft , the investigation concluded that it had not followed up on the pilot \u2019s differences training programme and its outcome . On DATE of the accident the company had not checked whether the pilot \u2019s documents complied with the requirements of the legislation , and it had unjustifiably ( nepamatoti ) handed over the aircraft to him and verbally authorised him to fly .", "CARDINAL . The above report , inter alia , addressed to ORG CARDINAL recommendations concerning flight safety . The second recommendation advised ORG to impose a duty on aircraft owners to set up a procedure for aircraft handovers which would prevent pilots from operating a flight without a licence and would contain confirmation of an appropriate qualification certificate issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation was opened into the aircraft accident . In the course of the investigation the police gathered evidence , ordered that forensic examinations be carried out , and interviewed numerous witnesses , including various aviation specialists .", "CARDINAL . Questioned as a witness , PERSON stated that he himself had no experience of operating aircrafts , and that GPE had been the company \u2019s de facto associate , although legally he had had no contractual relationship with the company ; PERSON also stated that he had had no doubts that GPE had had sufficient qualifications , because he had undergone the necessary training and obtaining a certificate had only been a formality . It had been supposed that GPE would at all times be accompanied by a more experienced instructor during the training flights . On DATE of the accident GPE had a telephone conversation with GPE and the latter informed him that he had finished his \u201c instruction \u201d and would soon be starting a flight . Only afterwards did GPE find out that another aeroplane had returned to the same airport owing to bad weather conditions .", "CARDINAL . The investigation revealed that ORG had undertaken to fly the aircraft even though he lacked the requisite skills , which had caused the accident in question . On DATE the proceedings with regard to GPE were terminated due to his death .", "CARDINAL . The material in the criminal case contained a letter from the LAW dated DATE which stated , inter alia , that at the material time the legislative acts regulating aviation safety in GPE had not provided for a procedure setting out how to hand over an aircraft for a general aviation flight .", "CARDINAL . This was further confirmed in a statement given by a ORG official during the investigation , that in general aviation , unlike in commercial aviation , there were no established ( nebija sak\u0101rtots ) regulations regarding an aircraft owner \u2019s responsibility in relation to a specific flight and a pilot \u2019s skills . Therefore the recommendations of the TAIIB were adopted to address that issue within the existing system ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . During the investigation , an official of ORG testified that in commercial aviation , the question of an operator \u2019s responsibility with regard to the qualifications and rights of a pilot was sufficiently regulated , however this regulation did not apply to general aviation flights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution indicted GPE for negligence in the performance of his professional duties ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) and violation of air traffic safety or operation regulations ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The prosecution alleged that GPE had handed over the aircraft to GPE knowing that the latter lacked the requisite permit and skills to operate it . On DATE the prosecution referred the case for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found GPE guilty on both counts . It established that GPE had not applied any measures to verify ORG qualifications . He had given the aircraft to the pilot knowing that the latter lacked the appropriate authorisation and had permitted him to fly . PERSON was given a suspended prison sentence of DATE . He was also ordered to pay the applicant CARDINAL NORP lati ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as an appellate court , quashed the above judgment and acquitted PERSON In the appeal proceedings , GPE testified that in his telephone conversation with GPE on DATE they had agreed that GPE would not fly , owing to the bad weather conditions . He explained the inconsistency in relation to his pretrial testimony ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as follows . Firstly , he had been a witness at that stage . Secondly , he had been interviewed in LANGUAGE , which was not his mother tongue , and he had not been as fluent as was necessary . He had no doubt that PERSON was responsible for the accident , and he could not envisage also being charged in criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . With regard to negligence in the performance of his professional duties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court deemed that neither the indictment nor the first - instance judgment had shown what professional duties in particular GPE had neglected . Also , not being an aviation specialist , he could not have been regarded as a \u201c special subject \u201d for the purposes of this section of LAW ( an organisation \u2019s responsible employee ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the alleged violation of air traffic safety or operation regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the appellate court concluded that it had not been established precisely what regulations GPE had violated and by what conduct in particular . Besides , section CARDINAL of the Criminal Law required that the prohibited conduct be committed by a transport employee , which GPE was not .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court indicated that , even though DATE could not be held criminally liable , PERSON had an obligation to provide compensation for the damage sustained by the victim , and therefore the applicant had rights to seek damages in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecutor submitted appeals against the appellate court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG endorsed the appeal court \u2019s findings that it had not been shown that PERSON had committed the requisite actus reus . The ORG confirmed that DATE \u2019s actions did not contain the necessary elements of a crime under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stated that the prosecution should not have relied on certain provisions of LAW , LAW , ORG and ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the GPE Convention \u201d ) . Those provisions were applicable when determining the civil and not criminal liability of an aircraft owner . In accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG , a pilot was prohibited from performing his functions in the event that he had not acquired the appropriate qualifications . The above provision had been binding upon the pilot and not GPE The ORG also stated that only on DATE had Part II of ORG DATE to ORG , Seventh Edition , come into force , making provision for the liability of an aircraft owner and a pilot ; before that date the Chicago Convention provided the responsibility only of the pilot ( see also paragraph CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , at the material time , no legislation had provided for a procedure for handing over an aircraft to a pilot , designating a person responsible for verifying pilots\u2019 training , or checking flight planning and implementation . Only subsequent to the accident in question had recommendations been issued to ORG on the preparation of statutes relevant to flight safety . As of DATE , section CARDINAL of ORG had provided that an aircraft owner or operator was not allowed to hand over an aircraft to a person lacking the appropriate qualifications and insurance cover ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim for damages against PERSON ( the company which owned the aircraft ) , PERSON ( the sole owner and board member of the company ) , and the insurance company . In the claim , inter alia , the applicant relied on DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . In the meantime , by a final decision of ORG of DATE , PERSON was declared bankrupt ( maks\u0101tnesp\u0113j\u012bgs ) upon application by CARDINAL of its creditors and respective proceedings were started with retrospective effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as a court of first instance , dismissed the claim in full on the grounds that the defendants had not committed unlawful actions ( prettiesiska darb\u012bba ) . There was no dispute that GPE had agreed to the pilot starting a \u201c differences training programme \u201d for the ORG aircraft with a flight instructor , PERSON However , there was no evidence that on DATE PERSON had allowed the pilot to operate this aircraft carrying CARDINAL passengers . On the contrary , the instructor and another witness ( FAC ) had testified that it had been planned that the pilot would operate the aircraft with the flight instructor , who had not arrived at the airport to take the flight on that date because of the bad weather conditions . The pilot had been informed of the bad weather conditions and the fact that the flight instructor would not arrive for the flight .", "By referring to the investigation carried out by the ORG , ORG noted that the primary reason for the accident was \u201c human error \u201d on the part of the pilot , and that the lack of sufficient procedure in relation to handing over an aircraft had contributed to the accident , but was not the sole cause of it . Moreover , the applicant had occupied the front seat of the aircraft , next to the pilot , and had maintained radio communication . Taking into account that he was a pilot himself and that he had received information about the unfavourable weather conditions , he could have avoided any damage by choosing not to fly in such circumstances .", "By referring to the second recommendation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court concluded that , at the material time , there had been no obligation for aircraft owners to verify the qualifications and health of pilots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , acting as an appellate court , dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim in full on the following grounds .", "CARDINAL . With regard to PERSON , the civil proceedings were terminated because the company had ceased to exist ( on DATE it had been excluded from ORG ) and there was no legal successor .", "CARDINAL . Next , the appellate court found that DATE could not be held liable under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW for the damage sustained by the applicant . By referring to the investigation carried out by the LAW , the appellate court also noted that the primary cause of the accident had been \u201c human error \u201d on the part of the pilot . While the lack of a sufficient procedure in relation to handing over the aircraft had contributed to the accident , there was no causal link between the accident and the actions of GPE , who managed the company .", "The appellate court also referred to the conclusions made in the criminal proceedings to the effect that GPE was not liable for the flight operated by the pilot , and the fact that he had been acquitted . Moreover , the appellate court referred to evidence given to the first - instance court and concluded that on DATE PERSON had not allowed the pilot to operate the aircraft independently and that the pilot \u2019s course of action ( to operate the aircraft independently ) had been arbitrary and unlawful . It had been planned that the pilot would operate the aircraft with the flight instructor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In the light of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , the owner of the aircraft was the company and not PERSON Thus , the latter could not be held responsible under LAW . In so far as the applicant referred to LAW , this was inapplicable , because it only provided for the responsibility of a pilot - in - command and , from DATE , the responsibility of an owner ; GPE was neither a pilot nor an owner .", "Neither could GPE be held liable under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because the pilot had not been an employee of the company . Nor could he be held liable under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Referring to the conclusions made in the criminal proceedings , the appellate court held that GPE had not engaged in any unlawful ( prettiesiska ) or liable ( vainojama ) activity . Therefore , he could not be required to pay damages to the applicant . There was no doubt that the aircraft was a source of dangerous activity , but PERSON was not its owner . Instead , PERSON was the owner of the aircraft , therefore it was liable for loss caused by the source of dangerous activity .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court also refused to hold GPE liable as a board member of the company . It concluded that , under the relevant provisions of LAW , board members were liable for damage caused to a company . In the present case , the company had not incurred any losses because it had not provided compensation for any damage sustained by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the appellate court dismissed the claim against the insurance company . In the judgment , it stated that the aircraft accident fell outside the terms of the aircraft \u2019s insurance , which provided that compensation was not awarded if an accident was caused by a pilot who had no right to operate an aircraft . In the present case , the pilot had not had a permit to operate the aircraft in question .", "CARDINAL . In a preparatory meeting on CARDINAL DATE the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant in the case against PERSON , GPE and the insurance company .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE addressed to the Government regarding the accident in question , ORG stated :", "\u201c As regards the responsibility of the aircraft owner , we note that the legislative acts [ at the material time ] provided that the owner of an aircraft was responsible for ensuring the maintenance of the aircraft \u2019s airworthiness , but not its safe operation during a flight , which was the pilot \u2019s responsibility . In particular , in accordance with ORG ( ORG ) No DATE on the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products , parts and appliances , and on the approval of organisations and personnel involved in these tasks , under PERSON I ( Part M ) M.A. CARDINAL ( a ) , the owner is responsible for the continuing airworthiness of an aircraft and shall ensure that no flight takes place unless : the aircraft is maintained in an airworthy condition ; and any operational and emergency equipment fitted is correctly installed and serviceable or clearly identified as unserviceable ; and the airworthiness certificate remains valid ; and the maintenance of the aircraft is performed in accordance with the approved maintenance programme . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
