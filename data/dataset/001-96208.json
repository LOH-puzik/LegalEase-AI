However , ORG refused to give a definite answer as to whether the ORG \u2019s decisions could be subject to judicial review in civil proceedings . It nevertheless observed that entitlement to receive a benefit from the ORG did not fall within the scope of civil law , and thus could not be raised before a civil court .

No administrative - law relation arises between a claimant and the ORG on the basis of the aforementioned acts , and consequently the ORG is not an organ of public administration established by law to determine cases in the sphere of public administration . \u201d", "On DATE ORG adopted Resolution no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL in response to a question of law put forward by the ORG . It revisited its earlier case - law on the interpretation of the notion of a \u201c civil case \u201d laid out in LAW in relation to claims against the ORG . ORG held that :", "\u201c The [ civil ] courts have jurisdiction in the case where a claimant \u2013 due to an unfavourable decision by the \u201c NORP - German Reconciliation \u201d Foundation \u2013 is seeking a payment [ from the ORG ] in respect of NORP persecution . \u201d", "In the reasons for its ORG found , inter alia , that :", "\u201c The procedure concerning examination of claims under the first and the second NORP fund ... may not be currently instituted .

( ... )", "There is no doubt that the current state of affairs resulting from the relevant case - law , under which those persons interested in challenging before a court the ORG \u2019s refusal to grant them a suitable payment are deprived of such a possibility , can not be accepted in the light of the binding constitutional and LAW . LAW in conjunction with LAW establishes a presumption in favour of jurisdiction of the ordinary courts which indicates \u2013 at least indirectly \u2013 that a possible jurisdiction of the administrative courts should be based on a specific statutory rule . ( ... )", "The need for extensive interpretation of the individual \u2019s access to a court , or in other words , the right to bring an action ( the right to a court ) follows also from LAW , which stipulate that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of his civil rights and obligations . It may be assumed from the established case - law of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention guarantees to everyone the inalienable right to submit for a judicial determination any claims concerning civil rights and obligations .... Obviously , the right to a court does not denote the right to \u201c win \u201d a case , but it signifies that the filed claim should be examined by a court and determined on the merits ( judgment of ORG of DATE , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "The results of interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure thus require us to acknowledge that the [ civil ] court has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case in the substantive sense and where no particular provision delegates its examination and determination to a different organ than an ordinary court . The [ civil ] court also has jurisdiction where a case has the features of a civil case only in the formal sense . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
