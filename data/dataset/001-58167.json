However , the NORP district authority did not want PERSON to take over as defence counsel under the legal aid scheme and refused his request on CARDINAL DATE on the ground that there were no reasons to dismiss the lawyer to whom the case had been assigned until then .

On DATE the ORG published a summary of a press communiqu\u00e9 issued by the applicant in reply to the public prosecutor \u2019s statement .

The applicant also quoted the following passage from a letter he had received from another lawyer : \u201c The situation in PERSON is far from satisfactory ... What makes it even worse is the fact that the judicial authorities know what is going on in PERSON and even make indirect allusions to the situation . \u201d In conclusion , PERSON called on ORG and ORG to look into the case .", "CARDINAL .

This was dismissed by ORG ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE , on the ground , among others , that the prefect had subsequently validly extended PERSON pre - trial detention , so that PERSON no longer had standing to bring an action challenging the conditions of his arrest . It noted , however , that after his arrest PERSON should have been brought , not before a district clerk , but before the prefect himself , the only person who could be considered a judge or other officer for the purposes of LAW . It therefore ordered that its decision should be brought to the attention of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , which was the prefect \u2019s supervisory authority ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rde \u00fcber die Rechtsanw\u00e4lte ) informed PERSON that his conduct raised certain ethical questions , relating in particular to the need for discretion ( PERSON ) with regard to pending proceedings and to covert publicity , and asked him what he had to say on the matter .", "In a letter of DATE which he communicated to the press , the applicant replied that he had acted only in the general interest and in that of his client .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prefect had lodged a complaint ( ORG ) with ORG and asked for disciplinary proceedings to be brought against PERSON . He asserted that by his statements the latter had not only slandered the prefect and his CARDINAL district clerks but had also been guilty of a serious breach of lawyers\u2019 professional ethics ( ORG ) by spreading false accusations through the media rather than making use of the available legal remedies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG brought disciplinary proceedings against the applicant .", "On DATE , pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) of the GPE of GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it fined him MONEY ( CHF ) for a breach of professional ethics ( PERSON und Standespflichten ) .", "In its decision ORG observed in particular that the applicant had omitted to refer his complaints DATE which were serious \u2013 in the first place to the public prosecutor \u2019s office or ORG , which were the relevant supervisory bodies for the district authority . He had therefore failed to observe the discretion which lawyers were required to maintain , in public , with regard to pending proceedings . In addition , he had engaged in covert publicity ( versteckte Reklame ) and cheap showmanship ( Effekthascherei ) , thus demonstrating that he was more concerned about his own public profile than about the merits of the case . In any event , ORG statements to the press always had to be not only of real public interest ( reelles \u00f6ffentliches ORG ) but also objective and moderate in tone ( objektiv in der Darstellung und sachlich i m Ton ) .", "But the tone of a number of passages in PERSON statements to the press left something to be desired . For example he had said : \u201c I wo n\u2019t let those gentlemen make a fool of me any longer \u201d and \u201c I demand \u2026 a thorough investigation of the case by an impartial commission of inquiry from outside the canton \u201d and also \u201c So the only recourse left to me is to take the matter to the press . \u201d This last statement was not even true , since at that time PERSON had not even applied to the relevant supervisory bodies for the district authority , nor had he tried exercising the ordinary legal remedies . He had thus disparaged not only the NORP district authority but all the GPE \u2019s judicial authorities , which was incompatible with a lawyer \u2019s professional ethics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a public - law appeal against the above decision . This was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "It observed that lawyers enjoyed considerable freedom to criticise the judicial authorities , provided that this was done according to the correct procedures , and in the first place in the course of representing and defending their clients . When , however , a lawyer appealed to public opinion , he was under a duty , like any other person employed in the service of justice , to refrain from any conduct inconducive to the proper administration thereof . LAW also enunciated the principle that interference could be justified if its purpose was to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary . Admittedly , there might be circumstances in which the public interest required alleged violations of constitutional or human rights to be made public . In order to determine whether that was the case , it was necessary to ascertain how obvious the alleged violations were , whether pending proceedings were likely to be influenced , whether the available remedies had been exercised and in what form the criticism had been made .", "In the instant case PERSON had been punished not so much for denouncing human rights violations as for the way in which he had done so . When considering the case ORG had indeed taken into account the fact that one of the complaints raised by the applicant , concerning the fact that Mr S. had been brought before a district clerk rather than the prefect , had subsequently been upheld by ORG . However , Mr PERSON \u2019s other criticisms DATE which were likely to influence pending proceedings \u2013 had been found by ORG to be unjustified . Furthermore , ORG had ruled that the applicant had not employed the right tone in his criticism and that he had made untrue allegations . It had given sufficient grounds for its decision and the applicant had not adduced any convincing counter - arguments .", "CARDINAL .
