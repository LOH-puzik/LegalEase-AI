ORG has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination ( DATE , II CZ CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a further series of decisions ORG considered that it would be unfair for the legally - aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within DATE counted from DATE of service of the judgment on the party . The parties waiting for legal - aid services can not be held at fault for shortcomings in the system . A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it . A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within DATE from the date on which the legalaid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal ( DATE , II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by ORG DATE , PERSON ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ) ;", "CARDINAL .

The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to ORG for legally - aided parties genuine and effective . Hence , the beginning of the timelimit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases . The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
