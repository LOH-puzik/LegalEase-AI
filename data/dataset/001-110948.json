THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-5 - Compensation)", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr Galib Myumyum Emin , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and as far as the ORG is aware now lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in the GPE in DATE . He never obtained legal residence . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) decided to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on the applicant pursuant to the provisions of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) as he had been convicted of a serious criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison on DATE . That same day the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ; the successor to the Minister for ORG ) ordered the applicant to be taken into GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) with a view to his expulsion from the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the applicant appealed the decision to take him into NORP detention to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from GPE detention on DATE but informed ORG that he wanted to pursue his appeal in order to obtain compensation . In support of his appeal , the applicant argued inter alia that the exclusion order imposed on him had in the meantime become based on incorrect grounds as GPE had since joined ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and the criteria for imposing an exclusion order on ORG citizens were more stringent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that the Deputy Minister had neglected to initiate activities to expel the applicant from the GPE while he was still in prison following his criminal conviction . Furthermore , ORG considered that the Deputy Minister had not assessed , at the time the decision was taken to place the applicant in GPE detention , whether the criteria in force for imposing an exclusion order applied to the applicant . For these reasons ORG held that the applicant \u2019s GPE detention had been unlawful from the outset . ORG however declined to award compensation to the applicant as he had been convicted of a serious criminal offence and an exclusion order had also been imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a further appeal with ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON ) against the decision of ORG not to award him compensation even though his GPE detention had been declared unlawful from the start .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared the appeal inadmissible since , pursuant to article CARDINAL sub d of LAW , no further appeal lay against a refusal to award compensation .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Aliens Act ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If ORG orders the lifting of a measure deprivative of liberty , or if the deprivation of liberty is lifted even before the request for the lifting of that measure is considered , it may grant the alien compensation at ORG expense . Damage shall include non - pecuniary damage . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In so far as the above provision proves insufficient or inappropriate to the purpose , it is also possible for former detainees to seek compensation for a wrongful act , or tort , on the part of public authority ( onrechtmatige overheidsdaad ) by taking civil proceedings against the ORG and claiming compensation for damages based on the argument that the detention in question constituted a wrongful act within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code . Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A person who commits a wrongful act ( onrechtmatige daad ) against another which is attributable to him , must repair the damage suffered by the other in consequence .", "CARDINAL . Except where there is a ground of justification , the following acts are deemed to be wrongful : the violation of a right , and an act or omission violating a duty imposed by law or a rule of unwritten law pertaining to proper social conduct .", "CARDINAL . A wrongdoer is responsible for the commission of a wrongful act if it is due to his fault or to a cause for which he is accountable by law or pursuant to generally accepted principles ( de in het verkeer geldende opvatting ) . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-5"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
