In LANGUAGE law , a litigant must bear his own costs unless the court otherwise orders . An award of costs lies within the discretion of the court but , as a general rule and in the absence of special factors , \" costs follow the event \" : the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay to his opponent the latter \u2019s costs , although the actual amount recoverable will be assessed by the court and will very rarely cover the full expenditure . There is jurisdiction to award costs against a successful party but it is exercisable only in the most exceptional circumstances ( see PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An order by consent made by an NORP court is not a contract , but it is sufficient evidence of the contract upon which it is based . Such an order , like the contract which it evidences , is not necessarily to be read literally but is to be construed in the light of any admissible evidence of surrounding circumstances , including evidence as to the nature of the dispute compromised by the order ( per Mr. Justice PERSON and , on appeal , per Lord Justice PERSON in ORG and ORG [ DATE ] ORG , vol .
