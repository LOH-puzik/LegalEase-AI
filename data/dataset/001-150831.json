NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant owns all the shares in CARDINAL limited liability companies . Apparently , in spite of their being limited liability companies , he was the only person running them .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the tax authorities carried out a tax inspection in the first company and concluded that it had failed to declare and pay a considerable amount of tax and that it had , inter alia , paid salaries off the books and undertaken other fraudulent activities . It appeared that the company had been operating entirely on the black market .", "CARDINAL . The tax authorities carried out a tax inspection in the second company after the police investigation concerning the applicant \u2019s activities had been concluded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities imposed additional tax and tax surcharges ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) on the applicant for DATE as they found that the applicant had withdrawn cash from the second company which the tax authorities considered as disguised dividends .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities imposed additional taxes and tax surcharges on the applicant for DATE as they found that the applicant had also withdrawn cash from the first company which was considered as disguised dividends .", "CARDINAL . The applicant apparently did not appeal against those decisions . The period set for appeal in tax matters is DATE counted from the beginning of the calendar year following DATE when the initial taxation decision was made . Therefore , the taxation concerning DATE became final on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local tax office requested the police to investigate the applicant \u2019s activities in relation to the first company . On DATE the applicant was arrested . On DATE a police investigation into the applicant \u2019s actions in the second company was initiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for , inter alia , aggravated accounting offence ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 kirjanpitorikos , grovt bokf\u00f6ringsbrott ) and aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) concerning his activities as the owner of the CARDINAL companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) delivered its judgment . The applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , alleging that CARDINAL of the lay judges sitting in the case had been partial . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . However , on DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments . The case was referred back to ORG for a new examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor repeated the charges . CARDINAL counts concerned the applicant \u2019s activity in the first company from DATE and CARDINAL counts concerned the applicant \u2019s activity in the second company from DATE . According to the charges , the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had failed to submit a tax declaration for both companies and , consequently , no income tax had been paid or imposed on the companies . On another count of aggravated tax fraud the applicant was accused of not declaring the salaries paid and , consequently , the taxes and social security payments had been too low . The tax authorities joined the charges and presented a compensation claim totalling approximately the amount of avoided taxes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , inter alia , of CARDINAL counts of aggravated tax fraud for having failed to submit a tax declaration for the CARDINAL companies in question for DATE . He was sentenced to imprisonment for DATE and DATE and ordered , together with another convicted person , to pay the tax authorities CARDINAL ( ORG ) plus interest in compensation . The court also ordered an extended forfeiture of the proceeds of crime . In addition , the applicant was banned from undertaking business activities for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , requesting that ORG judgment be partly quashed and that a part of the charges be dismissed . He admitted some of the charges . The applicant relied also on the principle of ne bis in idem and the ORG \u2019s case - law in that respect with regard to the aggravated tax fraud and the tax surcharges imposed on him in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG upheld ORG judgment . It considered that , as the prosecutor had pressed charges for the first time on DATE and the tax surcharges were imposed only after that date , the ne bis in idem principle could not prevent the examination of charges .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having examined the question of extended forfeiture of the proceeds of crime and quashed a part of it , upheld ORG judgment otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( laki verotusmenettelyst\u00e4 , lagen om beskattningsf\u00f6rfarande , Act no . DATE , as amended by Act no . DATE ) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given incomplete , misleading or false information to the tax authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied , the taxpayer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with additional tax and a tax surcharge .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen , as amended by Acts no . DATE and no .

If by the tax fraud ( CARDINAL ) considerable financial benefit is sought or ( CARDINAL ) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole , the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its precedent case ORG which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud . In that case it found , inter alia , that even though a final judgment in a taxation case , in which tax surcharges had been imposed , prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter , such preventive effect could not be applied to pending cases ( lis pendens ) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa . However , in DATE ORG reversed its line of interpretation , finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter ( PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) entered into force on DATE . According to the LAW , the tax authorities can , when making a tax decision , assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police . The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge . If they have not reported the matter to the police , a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision . If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges , they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless , after imposing the tax surcharges , they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts . If the tax authorities have reported the matter to the police , tax surcharges can , as a rule , no longer be imposed . The purpose of the LAW is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in CARDINAL set of proceedings . The LAW does not , however , contain any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
