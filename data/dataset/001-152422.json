BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2-1 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , daughter and mother , were born respectively in DATE and DATE and live in PERSON . Mr PERSON , the victim of the police action in question , was a young GPE man : the first applicant \u2019s father and the second applicant \u2019s unmarried partner .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Late in TIME of CARDINAL August CARDINAL , while driving in the centre of PERSON , PERSON noticed CARDINAL individuals who were trying to open the doors of a parked lorry . Mr PERSON was one of these men . PERSON called the police . Shortly afterwards , CARDINAL on - duty police officers from ORG , Chief PERSON and M , who at that time had been responding to another call , received information from the central office that CARDINAL \u201c gypsies \u201d had been seen breaking into a lorry and the officers drove immediately to the scene .", "CARDINAL . When the police car , apparently with its siren on , approached the lorry , the CARDINAL men started running . The officers followed by car . When the street became narrower , they got out of the car and separated , with Chief PERSON chasing PERSON while Sergeant M followed the other CARDINAL men , whom he was unable to catch . Chief PERSON caught up with Mr LOC by the side of the street , close to a parked car . A short fight followed , and QUANTITY shots were fired . CARDINAL of the bullets , fired at very close range , entered the left back of Mr LOC \u2019s head and exited through the right side of his forehead . An ambulance was called and PERSON was taken to a hospital where his death was registered at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal investigation ( VII-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was opened against Chief Sergeant S to establish whether he caused Mr PERSON \u2019s death as a result of a disproportionate reaction to an attack ( LAW : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At this stage no charge was brought against him .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy was carried out on Mr PERSON \u2019s body on DATE . In his report the forensic pathologist determined that death had resulted from a severe cerebral trauma and ensuing cardiovascular insufficiency . The trauma was caused by a transitory gunshot : the entry wound was located on the left side of the back of PERSON head and the exit wound on the right side of the forehead towards the temporal bone . The shot was fired from a distance close to point - blank range . The expert noted that , as the head could move in different directions , on the basis of the route of the bullet it was difficult to establish the dynamic position of the victim \u2019s body in relation to the gun at the moment of shooting . He also noted several bruises on the right side of PERSON face , his right hand and both knees , which he concluded had in all probability resulted from DATE to the ground after the shooting .", "CARDINAL . The pathologist also examined Chief PERSON He noted a reddishpink bruise on his right hand , measuring QUANTITY long , and another bruise measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY on his right side . The pathologist concluded that the injuries could have been inflicted in the manner described by the police officer , namely when he was trying to knock the knife from Mr PERSON \u2019s hand and during the struggle for the gun .", "CARDINAL . An inspection of the scene was carried out at TIME on DATE by a military investigator in the presence of CARDINAL certifying witnesses . There was no subsequent day - light examination . The investigator examined the bonnet of the car next to which Mr PERSON \u2019s body was found and noted a dent of QUANTITY located at QUANTITY from the front left corner and QUANTITY from the front right corner as well as a bullet hole measuring QUANTITY situated at QUANTITY from the front left corner and QUANTITY from the front right corner of the bonnet ; blood stains on the bonnet and on the ground next to the car ; and another dent with freshly peeling paint on the metal wall of the building to the left of the car . Photographs were taken of the dent and the bullet hole on the bonnet but these were not preserved as physical evidence , nor were impressions made of the dents and bullet holes . The vehicle was not taken away for examination and its owner , a security firm , repaired and sold it before the investigation was formally completed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator found a handgun on the ground under the bonnet of the parked car . The safety lever was lifted and there was CARDINAL bullet in the barrel and CARDINAL in the magazine . The investigator found and retrieved CARDINAL spent cartridge case , on the other side of the street , CARDINAL to QUANTITY from the parked car where Mr PERSON was shot , but no bullets . During the subsequent stages of the investigation proceedings the initial number of cartridges in the officer \u2019s gun was not clarified , nor was it determined how many shots were fired , including whether a warning shot was fired . The statements of the Chief Sergeant S were contradictory on this subject . In his testimony of CARDINAL DATE he S stated that he had started with CARDINAL cartridges in his handgun but on DATE he changed his testimony , maintaining that he had had CARDINAL cartridges .", "CARDINAL . A fingerprint report of CARDINAL DATE did not record any traces of fingerprints on the handgun suitable for examination . The report on the acetone - drenched swabs of Chief PERSON \u2019s hands of CARDINAL DATE found no traces of gunpowder residue . The expert report on Chief PERSON \u2019s handgun of CARDINAL DATE concluded , inter alia , that it had been in good condition and would have discharged a shot only after the trigger was pulled .", "CARDINAL . During the inspection of the scene of the killing which took place in TIME of CARDINAL DATE , the investigating officer found a folding knife , with an QUANTITY blade and a QUANTITY metal handle . The protocol of the search stated that it was found on the bonnet of a car parked across the street from the death scene but it did not state whether the blade was open when it was found . It seems that no steps were taken to check for fingerprints on the knife or to determine its ownership . A mobile telephone was found in a stone vase near the scene of the shooting , but the subsequent investigation did not determine who owned it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator questioned Chief PERSON , his colleague Chief Sergeant M and the CARDINAL security guards who had been standing in the vicinity of the scene at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . Questioned in TIME of CARDINAL DATE , Chief PERSON stated that PERSON had been running with his arms open wide while trying to escape . As the sergeant caught up to him , PERSON had stopped and turned round . At this point Chief PERSON noticed that he held a knife , but it was dark and he could not see it well . Mr PERSON swung at the sergeant with his left hand , and the officer tried in vain to knock the knife away . Mr PERSON then grasped him tightly with both hands behind his back , while reaching for the handgun , which was in the officer \u2019s unbuttoned holster at his waist . The CARDINAL men had fought briefly for possession of the gun . Chief PERSON stated that he felt strongly afraid : it was dark , the other man had his hand on the officer \u2019s loaded gun and was armed with a knife . The officer could not remember the exact position of their bodies in the fight that ensued for the gun and at the moment when the shots were fired , nor could he remember how many shots were involved . He had been expecting the man to shoot or stab him at any moment .", "CARDINAL . Questioned later , Chief PERSON stated that after the first shot was fired he panicked and could not remember what happened . In his subsequent statements he explained that he had been stabbed on earlier occasions while on duty , which had made him particularly fearful of knives . He was not even aware who actually pulled the trigger and at CARDINAL moment he had feared that he had been shot , rather than Mr Mihaylov .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the subsequent proceedings the only testimony about the detail of the fight remained that of Chief PERSON The other officer involved in the chase , Chief Sergeant M , and some other eye witnesses were also questioned in TIME of CARDINAL DATE . Chief Sergeant M stated that he telephoned Chief PERSON when he lost sight of the other CARDINAL suspects , to discuss how to proceed . Chief PERSON asked him to come to him immediately . When he arrived at the site there were a lot of people and he saw a man taken away by ambulance . Chief PERSON \u2019s handgun was beneath a car and there was a blood stain on the ground next to the car . His colleague was extremely upset and told him that he had done the worst . There was a pocket knife on the bonnet of another car nearby .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events , CARDINAL employees of a private security company , ORG , ORG and ORG , were chatting in front of their office , which was in a building adjacent to the street where PERSON was shot . They were interviewed on CARDINAL occasions and their statements were inconsistent , both in respect of each man \u2019s previous statements and the statements given by the other men . Their statements varied as regards whether they heard a warning shot , how many shots were fired and whether they saw a knife in Mr LOC \u2019s hand . Some of them remembered the officer warning Mr LOC from a distance to stop and lie down . All of them stated that the events unfolded within TIME and that they could not see what exactly happened when the police officer came into contact with Mr PERSON because it was dark . None of them had seen a knife or a gun in the hands of Mr PERSON or Chief PERSON in this short time , although they saw them afterwards . They agreed that when Chief PERSON , who had fallen to the ground with Mr PERSON , stood up , he was holding a knife , which he threw and which fell on the bonnet of a car parked on the other side of the street . The officer had been very upset , and appeared to be in a state of shock , waving his arms around , pacing up and down and repeatedly proclaiming : \u201c What did I do ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . Later in the proceedings it transpired that there was a camera installed above the entrance door of the security company building , facing the street . The car next to which the shooting took place was parked on the opposite side of the street , at a short distance from where the men were standing . In his testimony of CARDINAL DATE , ORG stated that on TIME of the incident the security camera installed above the entrance to the building in which they worked had been broken . Another witness stated that the camera did not record footage , but only monitored the street outside , and was used by the TIME shift security guards to observe the firm \u2019s vehicles . The guard on duty on TIME of the shooting was ORG . He was standing outside with the other CARDINAL witnesses . There was also a dispatcher whose desk was below the monitor screen , but according to ORG she could not see it . During his interview of the same day EK stated that he could not remember which dispatcher was on duty that night and that at that time the dispatchers employed by the firm were all new employees of the company . The camera was not inspected and none of the other employees of the firm were interviewed on this point during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating officer completed his work on case - file VII-CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In his findings on the facts he described the unfolding events in detail as follows :", "\u201c On DATE the operator on duty at the district police station of ORG Chief PERSON , a witness , took a call from a private person PERSON who reported that CARDINAL men were preparing to commit theft from a lorry parked on PERSON Street . The lorry belonged to ORG \u2013 it was left parked in the street with its signal lights on by ORG , who worked as a supplier for ORG The operator dispatched patrol officers Chief PERSON and Chief PERSON to the location in question . When the patrol vehicle approached the lorry on PERSON Street the CARDINAL men who were around and inside the lorry attempted to escape and started running in the direction of the town centre . The patrol vehicle followed them along PERSON Street when CARDINAL of the men ran towards the town centre and CARDINAL ran towards FAC . Chief PERSON went in pursuit of the CARDINAL men running towards the town centre and Chief PERSON followed the man who had gone in the direction of FAC ; PERSON fired a warning shot in the air \u2013 using a \u2018 ORG bullet . On DATE FAC in proximity to FAC , and in front of building No . CARDINAL Chief PERSON caught up to the running man who while running had a mobile telephone in one of his hands and a pocket knife in the other . At TIME PERSON had already put his Makarov KT CARDINAL pistol into the holster on his hip so that he could run faster , and at the time there was a live bullet in the barrel of the pistol after the firing of the warning shot . PERSON was wearing a uniform , he had got off a police vehicle bearing insignia , he had shouted to the running man \u2018 Stop ! Police ! Get down on the ground!\u2019 but the man had not stopped running . In front of the building on FAC stopped running , turned to face the police officer and swung at him with his hand which held a pocket knife . PERSON saw the blade in the street light and blocked the hand of the man . Without letting go of the knife , ORG threw himself on VS , grabbed him around his waist while holding his arms , and attempted to take the gun out of PERSON \u2019s holster . PERSON took hold of ORG \u2019s hand which was holding the gun , and then BM pushed VS onto the bonnet of an Opel with number plates ORG which was parked nearby . As he was falling , PERSON managed to extricate himself from under PERSON , while PERSON kept holding on to his gun with one of his hands , and holding the knife in the other . At the same time PERSON had both his hands on ORG \u2019s hand with which he was trying to take the gun out of the holster . BM had managed to take out the gun while PERSON held his hand \u2013 as a shot was fired and the bullet hit the metal wall of the building of FAC . The direction of that shot was to the side and away from the place of the incident , which means that this shot was not fired as a warning shot . After the shooting , because of the fear for his life which he had experienced , PERSON was in a state of extreme stress and he was not able to recollect the events in detail . The struggle between the CARDINAL was observed by CARDINAL witnesses : ORG , ORG and ORG who were standing in front of the building at FAC No . CARDINAL and who did not interfere . Their testimonies confirm that ORG had stopped running and had started to wrestle with VS . However , because of the stress , the dim light and the speed of the events the witnesses can not recall details about the manner in which ORG was shot and the position of the CARDINAL men \u2019s bodies in relation to one another at the time of the shooting . From the appearance and the location of the gun wound on ORG \u2019s head and the gunshot hole found in the bonnet of ORG , it is evident that after the first shot was fired , PERSON had managed to regain possession of the gun and shoot him in the head at close range . After the shooting VS was in a state of shock : he dropped the gun on the ground , he was moving erratically , he was bending down to ORG who was lying on the ground , he took the knife from ORG \u2019s hand and threw it onto the bonnet of Opel C CARDINAL \u041f\u0425. At this moment Chief PERSON was in the town centre and he placed a call to VS \u2019s mobile ; PERSON told him that trouble had occurred and ORG called the operator to dispatch support . PERSON , the operator on duty , sent a patrol vehicle and an ambulance . BM was taken to the hospital in PERSON where in spite of the medical assistance he passed away from a traumatic head injury followed by shock and coma that led to irreversible heart and lung failure .", "In his DATE of service with ORG Chief PERSON has never been disciplined ; he was awarded CARDINAL times . The man who was killed , ORG , had committed a large number of offences . He has been registered for CARDINAL thefts and CARDINAL robberies . He was convicted CARDINAL times for the following crimes : .... \u201d", "Based on these findings , the investigator proposed to the prosecutor to discontinue the investigation since he considered that Chief PERSON had acted in self - defence within the meaning of Article DATE of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , which in his view meant that the acts of the police were not liable to prosecution . He further indicated that \u201c even if there was no danger to the officer \u2019s life , Chief PERSON was authorised to use a firearm in such circumstances , although he did not do so until his life was threatened \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG counsel requested access to the investigation file . On DATE a prosecutor from the GPE military prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the request , on the grounds that at this stage the applicants were not participating in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of DATE the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings against Chief PERSON , stating that the officer had shot Mr LOC but that this had not constituted an offence . In reaching his conclusion , the prosecutor found it established that , when running , Mr PERSON had been holding a mobile telephone in one hand and a knife in the other . At some point he had stopped abruptly , had turned around and had swung at the officer with the knife . When the officer had tried to knock away the knife , PERSON had wrestled with him , tried to reach the officer \u2019s handgun , and pushed him onto the bonnet of the car . A short struggle for the gun had followed and one shot had been fired accidentally . Following that , according to the prosecutor , the officer had managed to get hold of the gun and shoot PERSON . As the victim had still been holding the knife , the police officer took it from his hands and threw it away . In the prosecutor \u2019s view PERSON attacked the officer in order to avoid arrest and also to help his accomplices , who at that time were running away with a cassette player stolen from the lorry .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this account of the facts , the prosecutor reached the following conclusions . First , he concluded that PERSON had attacked Chief PERSON Secondly , the reaction of the police officer , who had shot Mr PERSON , had not been disproportionate to the attack . Chief PERSON had acted in self - defence against a much younger man who had been holding a knife . Because of the weak light and the speed of the events , the circumstances of the shooting and the position of the bodies could not be established . Thirdly , once Chief PERSON identified himself as a police officer and fired a warning shot he was entitled under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) to use force to arrest PERSON , even if it had not been necessary to act in self - defence . The prosecutor also noted that Chief PERSON had never been disciplined but had been commended a number of times and that Mr PERSON had been known to the police and had been convicted CARDINAL times . The fact that Mr Mihaylov held the knife in his left hand and that he must have used the same hand to grasp the gun of the officer , who was facing him , was not given attention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicants\u2019 counsel \u2019s appeal , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decree , finding that the prosecutor \u2019s account of the events was based on arbitrary and contradictory assumptions rather than on established facts ; the interviews of the witnesses had been formalistic and their statements were vague and contradictory . In particular , the prosecutor had failed to establish the number of shots fired , the position of the CARDINAL bodies at the time of the fatal shooting , the trajectory of the bullet and the position of the victim \u2019s head in relation to the barrel of the gun . The court also noted that the prosecutor had failed to give reasons for his conclusions regarding the applicability of the rules on self - defence or LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In view of those shortcomings the court remitted the case and instructed the prosecutor to re - interview the eyewitnesses ; if possible , to find and interview other witnesses ; to have prepared a medicalballistics report in order to establish , in particular , the position of the bodies and the trajectory of the bullet ; and to organise a reconstruction of the events in order to verify the ORG statements .", "CARDINAL . NORP In execution of the court \u2019s instructions , on DATE the investigator commissioned a medical - ballistics report . The authors of the report made no mention of the bullet hole in the car bonnet and concluded that they could not determine the exact position of the CARDINAL bodies at the time of the shooting . They found that at the moment of the shooting the gun was almost touching the back left side of Mr PERSON \u2019s head , and that it had been pointing upwards and slightly to the right .", "CARDINAL . The investigator questioned Chief PERSON on DATE . Relying on his status as a witness , the sergeant refused to take part in a reconstruction , claiming that he had received threats from the NORP community in PERSON . On DATE the investigator was discharged from the case for his failure to comply with the court \u2019s directions and a new investigator was appointed . The new investigator questioned the CARDINAL security guard eyewitnesses on DATE and DATE and he questioned Chief PERSON on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE and DATE . Chief PERSON maintained that he had acted in self - defence and in accordance with the rules governing the use of force . He was in shock and unable to remember the exact positions of himself and PERSON when the latter was shot .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of DATE the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings on the grounds that the police officer had not committed an offence . The applicants again sought judicial review . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decree and remitted the case for further investigation . The court stated that the investigative authorities had failed to comply with the court \u2019s previous directions and had thus obstructed the investigation . It noted again that the interviews of the witnesses had been formalistic , that their statements were contradictory and that the investigative authorities had failed to organise a reconstruction or confrontations in order to clarify the facts . The court noted that the forensic evidence suggested that at the moment of the shooting Mr PERSON had been facing the bonnet of the car . Also , the investigative authorities had never established the exact number of cartridges fired and the statements of Chief PERSON were inconsistent on this point . The court further noted that the experts who had carried out the medical - ballistics report had failed to discuss the bullet hole in the car bonnet . Furthermore , the investigative authorities had failed to inspect the knife and to analyse the circumstances surrounding its use or to inspect the mobile telephone and its whereabouts at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . Following the remittal , the investigator re - questioned the security guards . They stated that they had only vague memories of the incident and refused to participate in a reconstruction . Chief PERSON again refused to give a further statement or to participate in a reconstruction . The fingerprint expert report on the knife of DATE found no fingerprints suitable for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 counsel examined the investigation file and requested the collection of additional evidence , namely that steps be taken to seek out other witnesses ; that the certifying witnesses who had participated in the inspection of the crime scene early in the morning following the incident be questioned ; that the CARDINAL police officers be re - interviewed with a view to clarifying whether they had followed a preliminary plan for the arrest of PERSON and his companions ; that an additional medical - ballistics report be prepared to clarify the position of the bodies , in particular whether PERSON had been neutralised at the moment of the fatal shooting , and the number of cartridges in the handgun as it had not been clear how many shots had been fired in total . She also demanded the inspection of the security camera , installed above the entrance of the building opposite the site of the shooting ; a reconstruction of the events ; and an identification by PERSON family of the knife found at the scene . On DATE these requests were rejected by the prosecutor on the grounds that they were aimed at delaying the proceedings . The prosecutor noted , inter alia , that any video recordings made by the camera belonging to the security firm would not qualify as evidence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings since he considered that Chief PERSON had not committed an offence . In relation to the court \u2019s instructions regarding further inquiries , the prosecutor stated that , despite efforts made , no other eyewitnesses had been identified ; the inspection of the knife had not revealed any new evidence ; it had been impossible to establish the owner of the mobile telephone ; and that a reconstruction of the events would have been futile as Chief Sergeant S refused to take part owing to a justified fear of violence from the relatives of the victim and members of the NORP community . The prosecutor stated that when the fight had started Chief PERSON and PERSON had fallen on the bonnet of the car . The prosecutor did not come to any conclusion as to whether PERSON had been holding the knife when the fatal shot was fired , but noted only that at that moment the officer had been very afraid . The prosecutor reproduced the legal conclusions on the rules of self - defence under LAW , contained in the decree of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Relying on unspecified information about injuries inflicted on Chief PERSON during earlier police operations , the prosecutor concluded that the latter should not be punished because he had acted in a state of acute fear .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the decree , claiming , inter alia , that the authorities , influenced by their prejudice towards GPE , had conducted only a formalistic investigation . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG quashed the decree and remitted the case to the prosecutor . It held that the investigative authorities had failed to comply with the instructions given by the court in previous decisions and that they had intentionally protracted the investigation and failed to employ any meaningful efforts to establish the truth . The court noted , inter alia , that the exact circumstances of the fight and the shooting had not been established ; that no reconstruction had been organised and no valid reasons given for this omission ; and that the authorities had also failed to conduct confrontations , inspections of the knife and the mobile telephone or to order an additional medical - ballistics report .", "CARDINAL . Following the remittal by ORG , on DATE the investigator arranged for an inspection of the knife , but this failed to determine whether the blade had been open or closed at the time of the shooting . A further medical - ballistics report , dated DATE , made no reference to the bullet hole in the bonnet of the car and concluded that it was impossible to establish the exact position of the bodies at the time of the shooting . The investigator also requested Chief PERSON to take part in confrontations with ORG and ORG , and a reconstruction , but the Chief Sergeant refused to participate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 counsel repeated her earlier requests for additional investigative measures . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the criminal proceedings . He repeated verbatim the reasoning given in the decree of DATE , but added as an additional ground that Chief PERSON had been suffering from fear and confusion and that in these circumstances , as a matter of domestic law , there had been no excess of force . The applicants sought judicial review . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decree and remitted the case for further investigation . The court stated that despite the numerous remittals the prosecutor had repeatedly failed to comply with the court \u2019s instructions and that the actions of the authorities and the measures employed had been a parody of an investigation , revealing unwillingness to collect the evidence and establish the truth .", "CARDINAL . Following the remittal the investigator questioned the CARDINAL security guards , Chief Sergeant M and CARDINAL additional witnesses , as requested by the applicants . During the interview of ORG on DATE , the investigator in CARDINAL question referred to Mr Mihaylov as \u201c the gypsy \u201d . On DATE the investigator organised a reconstruction of the events . Chief PERSON did not take part , relying on his capacity as a witness . A further ballistics report dated DATE found , in particular , that on the basis of photographs it had not been possible to establish the morphology , character and orientation of the bullet hole and thus the exact position of the bodies at the time of the shooting . Meanwhile , it appears that around this time the prosecutor in charge of the investigation stated that he disagreed with the court \u2019s instructions and requested to be allowed to withdraw from the case . It appears that this request was not granted , as he continued working on the case .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of DATE the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings finding , as before , that the police officer had shot Mr PERSON to defend himself from the latter \u2019s attack and that the use of force had , in any case , been justified under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) once the police officer had asked PERSON to stop and had fired a warning shot . The prosecutor noted , in support of his finding of self - defence , that an offender with a criminal record had attempted to attack a police officer , who had never been disciplined and who had received awards . The applicants sought judicial review , contending , inter alia , that the authorities had not bothered to carry out an effective investigation because of PERSON ethnicity and low social status . ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decree . Upon the appeal of the applicants , in a decision of DATE , ORG set aside the lower court \u2019s decision . ORG raised serious doubts in respect of the prosecutor \u2019s impartiality . It further noted the prosecutor \u2019s failure to establish who had fired the fatal shot and in what circumstances . The court also held that on the basis of the evidence collected , namely the NORP testimony that the shooting had taken place on the car \u2019s bonnet and the conclusions of the medical - ballistics report about the channel of the wound , it was clear that at the moment of the lethal shooting Mr PERSON had been facing the bonnet of the car and the police officer had fired from behind . Thus the court found that immediately before the shooting the police officer had had full control over the victim , the use of force had not been necessary and there was sufficient evidence that the police officer had intentionally killed Mr LOC . The court remitted the case , instructing the prosecutor to bring charges against the sergeant for murder as well as to discharge anybody who had demonstrated partiality from working on the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a newly - appointed prosecutor laid charges against Chief PERSON for causing death as a result of a disproportionate reaction to an attack . However , DATE , in a decree of DATE , the prosecutor discontinued the criminal proceedings against Chief PERSON , using almost identical reasoning to that in the decree of DATE , with some additional findings , some of which appeared contradictory . For example , at CARDINAL point in the decree the prosecutor found that Mr PERSON had dropped the knife before he had reached for the sergeant \u2019s handgun , but subsequently he found that Mr PERSON had dropped the knife at the moment the fatal shot was fired . The prosecutor also referred to the police officer \u2019s fear of knives as justification for using force . Chief PERSON had claimed in his testimony of CARDINAL DATE that he had developed a fear of knives after he was stabbed while making another arrest DATE before the incident with PERSON . No assessment of the police officer \u2019s psychological condition or his fitness to perform his duties at the material time was mentioned in the decree . In the report , the prosecutor advanced CARDINAL different justifications for the use of force , namely , the justified use of force to make an arrest ; self - defence ; and the excessive use of force due to fear . No attempt was made to reconcile these CARDINAL theories .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought judicial review . In a decision of DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decree and remitted the case for further investigation . The court considered ill - founded the prosecutor \u2019s conclusions that Mr PERSON had been holding a knife when he had turned to the sergeant and that at the beginning of the fight Mr LOC had pushed the sergeant onto the bonnet of the car . The court found that the officer had had full control over Mr PERSON and that the use of force had been excessive . The court also noted the failure of the investigative authorities to comply with previous judicial directions .", "CARDINAL . Following the remittal , the prosecutor interviewed CARDINAL witnesses who stated that Chief PERSON had been injured before , in DATE and DATE , during police operations . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the criminal proceedings . This time the prosecutor maintained that PERSON had dropped the knife before reaching for the handgun . He further held that the fight had taken place next to the car and not on its bonnet and that PERSON had fallen on the bonnet after he had been shot . Following an appeal by the applicants , on DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decree and again remitted the case for further investigation . Chief PERSON appealed against the decision . In his appeal he did not claim to have acted in self - defence but instead claimed that it had been an accidental killing , falling under LAW . The prosecutor also challenged the decision . His appeal was rejected in a decision of ORG on DATE . In a decree of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor discontinued the proceedings for the eighth time , stating that Mr PERSON had been holding a knife when he attacked the officer and that he had pushed the officer onto the bonnet of the car , dropping the knife and reaching for the handgun , and that after the shooting the officer had taken the knife and had thrown it away . The applicants sought judicial review . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court granted the appeal and remitted the case , finding that the court \u2019s earlier instructions had not been complied with , that no additional investigation had been conducted , and that the prosecutor had based his conclusions on contradictory facts .", "CARDINAL . Chief PERSON challenged the court \u2019s decision before ORG and reiterated his claim that the shooting had been an accident . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decree . The court endorsed the conclusions of the prosecutor on the facts . It found that the police officer had been faced with a real and imminent attack by the victim which was not interrupted until the CARDINAL shots were fired . The police officer had acted in self - defence and had not , therefore , committed an offence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
