SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , a NORP citizen born in DATE , resides in GPE ( GPE of GPE ) . On DATE , after he had been hiding from the police for some time , he gave himself up .", "He was at once brought before the GPE District Attorney ( GPE ) . The latter heard Mr. PERSON without his lawyer being present and then , on DATE , made an order directing that Mr. PERSON be placed in detention on remand ( ORG ) . The District Attorney strongly suspected that the applicant had committed or attempted to commit several offences of aggravated theft and feared that he might suppress evidence ( DATE , sub - paragraph a ) , of LAW , hereinafter referred to as ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON lodged an appeal ( PERSON ) against the above - mentioned order but it was dismissed by ORG ( Staatsanwalt ) on DATE . ORG , adopting the grounds relied on by the District Attorney , stated that the investigations had not been completed and that there was reason to believe that the applicant , who had no fixed abode in GPE , might abscond .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON filed a \" public - law appeal \" with ORG , alleging that ORG decision was contrary to LAW CARDINAL ( c ) and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . He described as arbitrary the statement that he might suppress evidence and questioned whether the District Attorney was an \" officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power \" , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG ) rejected the appeal . It accepted that there were reasons to believe that the applicant might suppress evidence if he were released . It also considered that , since the circumstances clearly gave rise to a suspicion that the applicant had committed thefts , there was no violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article QUANTITY ) . As regards Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , ORG , having noted that there was a difference of opinion amongst legal writers over the interpretation of this provision , stated :", "\" The main criterion for classifying a given activity as \u2018 judicial\u2019 is the independence which the bodies acting in that capacity enjoy vis - \u00e0 - vis other ORG authorities and other persons entrusted with functions relating to the administration of justice as well as vis - \u00e0 - vis institutions and organisations in the public sector ...", "However , the text of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW demonstrates that it does not see the attributes of a judge or judicial independence in terms of the principle of separation of powers .... The only possible interpretation of this LAW is that even bodies which are administrative by reason of their position meet the Convention \u2019s requirements to the extent that they exercise judicial functions , that is act independently when giving decisions in that capacity . Thus , according to LAW ( article CARDINAL ) ... , what is above all decisive is not the place held in the organisation of the ORG but rather the function to be exercised . In other words , that provision does not in principle preclude the simultaneous exercise by CARDINAL and the same person of different functions , namely functions relating to investigation as well as functions in other areas of the administration of criminal justice ... \"", "In support of this interpretation , ORG pointed out that , unlike paragraph CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) , paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) uses the word \" court \" . A further argument was derived from Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) :", "\" There is good reason to suppose that , had the authors of the ORG wished to confer on an accused such an extensive guarantee as regards the independence and impartiality of the competent authority , they would have utilised in LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) wording identical to that in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) \" , namely \" an independent and impartial tribunal \" .", "Turning to the powers of the District Attorney , ORG noted that he is both an investigating authority ( Ermittlungs- PERSON ) , under the supervision of ORG , and - in cases before a single judge or ORG \u2013 a prosecuting authority . In the present case , the District Attorney had acted as an investigating authority in which capacity DATE stop required him to be equally thorough in gathering evidence in favour of and evidence against the accused . From this ORG concluded :", "\" It is of little consequence that the District Attorney is incorporated in the administrative hierarchy and thus constitutes an administrative authority by reason of his position in the organisation of the ORG .... At the investigation stage , he in fact fulfils a judicial function and exercises no administrative activity .... Moreover , the rule on the election of ORG by the people ... shows that the legislature wished to secure for this body a measure of independence vis - \u00e0 - vis the executive and the administration even as regards the procedure for appointment .", "This view is not contradicted by the fact that , during the investigation , LOC ORG may receive from ORG directives concerning either the exercise of his activities in general or a specific case ( opening , conduct and closure of the investigation ) .... What is decisive is that , when acting as a supervisory body during the investigation , ORG as well is carrying out a judicial function of investigation ; it is only if and when the case is sent for trial that that ORG assumes its role of prosecutor and thereby becomes a party to the proceedings . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of ORG ( Anklagekammer ) of the GPE of ORG ( Obergericht ) decided that Mr. PERSON should remain in detention until the following DATE The applicant appealed without success , firstly to FAC , which confirmed the President \u2019s order on DATE , and then to ORG , which dismissed his \" public - law appeal \" on DATE .", "Mr. PERSON \u2019s detention on remand had in the meantime been prolonged pursuant to LAW . He was eventually released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In view of the gravity of the charges against the applicant ( thefts to a value of DATE ) the GPE of ORG had jurisdiction in the matter ; the indictment therefore had to be drawn up by ORG which represented the prosecuting authorities at the trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The investigation , on the other hand , had been conducted by an GPE Attorney .", "On DATE , ORG imposed on Mr. PERSON a sentence , suspended for DATE , of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for professional theft as a member of a gang ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE of GPE is divided into CARDINAL districts , each of which has a ORG with CARDINAL or more Attorneys . At the relevant time , the status and powers of ORG were laid down in LAW of DATE ( PERSON , hereinafter referred to as ORG ) ; an LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , has since replaced , and in substance re - enacted the provisions of , LAW .", "CARDINAL . Ordinary District Attorneys are elected by universal suffrage for a term of office fixed by LAW at DATE ( section CARDINAL ORG ) and increased by LAW to DATE . Although any citizen may stand for election , candidates are most often lawyers who have completed university studies and received practical training in the courts , industry , the civil service or the legal profession . If necessary , ORG appoints GPE for a specified period ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The District Attorney is subordinate to ORG who in turn comes under the authority of ORG and ORG ( NORP ) of the GPE of GPE . The District Attorney is the prosecuting authority before the single judge in criminal matters and before FAC in cases concerning petty offences and misdemeanours ; before the higher Cantonal courts ( ORG and ORG - section CARDINAL ORG ) , this function is performed by ORG . The District Attorney also has power to issue a punishment order ( NORP ) if the accused has admitted his guilt and if a fine ( GPE ) or a prison sentence of not DATE is deemed sufficient ( LAW ) ; however , the person concerned is entitled to enter an objection ( ORG ) to the punishment order , as is ORG ( Article CARDINAL StPO ) .", "CARDINAL . The investigation of criminal cases comes within the competence of the prosecuting authorities ( section CARDINAL ORG ) . The District Attorney conducts the investigation except in those cases where it is entrusted by law to ORG or a judge ( LAW ) . The LOC Attorney may issue a warrant for arrest ( MONEY CARDINAL ORG ) , the grounds for which he must indicate ; he has to hear an arrested suspect within TIME ( FAC ) . During this first interrogation , at which the suspect \u2019s lawyer is not normally present , the suspect must be clearly informed of the reasons prompting the suspicions held against him ( Article CARDINAL ORG ) and of the existence of a right of appeal against the warrant ( DATE Circular from ORG ) . Directive no . CARDINAL ( Collection of Circulars from ORG to ORG , DATE - Sammlung der ORG der Staatsanwaltschaft an die Bezirksanwaltschaften von CARDINAL ) specifies that this interrogation is not to be considered as a pure formality . Under Directive no . DATE , the District Attorney is prohibited from delegating his power to interrogate to subordinate officials .", "CARDINAL . Detention on remand ordered by LOC may not exceed DATE ; this period may be extended by the President of ORG or , in cases coming within the jurisdiction of ORG , the President of ORG ( Article CARDINAL ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The District Attorney remains under the control of ORG as regards both the opening and the conduct of the investigation . ORG is authorised to issue directives to him ( LAW ) and must be kept informed of every serious offence ( Directive no . CARDINAL ) . ORG or ORG of the GPE of GPE may request ORG to submit a report on the opening and the conduct of criminal proceedings ( NORP ) and may give him special orders and instructions ( besondere PERSON und Weisungen - Article QUANTITY StPO ) . A report must be made to ORG whenever proceedings having political significance are instituted ( LAW ) .", "In addition , ORG ( erster FAC ) carries out inspections DATE ; their sole purpose is the expedition of proceedings .", "For DATE now , ORG in practice receive no special orders or instructions from ORG concerning their powers of placing individuals in detention .", "Once the investigation is closed , any District Attorney contemplating the release of an accused must so inform ORG if the prosecution falls within the latter \u2019s competence ( Directive no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Assuming that the prosecution has not been discontinued , LOC , or ORG , becomes a party to the criminal proceedings ; when drawing up the indictment , he must however take into account items in the accused \u2019s favour and not confine himself to stressing items that tell against him ( LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
