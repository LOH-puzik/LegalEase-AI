He was represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The applicant died on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE PERSON , the applicant \u2019s spouse , informed ORG her wish to continue the application in her late husband \u2019s stead . She authorised PERSON to represent her in the proceedings .

In DATE the applicant learned that the company , whose premises were located partly at DATE same street QUANTITY away , used in its address the same street number as their house had . In addition , the same address was used by several other companies which leased LOC from the pharmaceutical company in issue .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s son sought redress from both the Mayor of GPE and the company \u2019s management . He also requested the company to remove its information and advertisement board located in front of his house . On DATE the company \u2019s representatives replied that they were interested in solving the problem and that they had asked ORG in GPE for assistance .", "On DATE the GPE decided , with reference to sections QUANTITY , to assign street number CARDINAL to the house in which the applicant and his family lived . The document indicated that the decision was to be delivered to the house owner and to ORG in GPE . It contained no information as to the availability of any remedy . In a separate letter with DATE and addressed to the house owner ORG stated that the house should normally have street number CARDINAL . However , according to the relevant documents , the same street number had been assigned to the pharmaceutical company whose LOC were located in the same street . It resulted from the fact that the company \u2019s LOC had had street number CARDINAL from the moment of its establishment while further buildings had been built in the street subsequently without any change in the numbering . Given the position and activities of the company , ORG decided to assign a different street number to the house of the applicant \u2019s son . The company was to bear any costs related to the change of the number plate attached to the house .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s son that its employees would come to his house , on DATE , with a view to resolving the problem of the company \u2019s advertisement board .", "The applicant and his wife continued to be regularly disturbed throughout DATE by a large number of persons who thought that the above company or other companies which leased the latter \u2019s LOC ( and thus had the same street address ) had their offices there .", "In DATE the applicant complained of the situation to the Mayor of GPE . On DATE ORG sent copies of the above documents dated DATE together with a certificate that the inhabitants of the house had their permanent address at GPE street DATE . As the applicant continued insisting that the house should have street number CARDINAL , the Mayor of GPE decided to allocate street number ORG to the house in DATE . The documents submitted to the ORG indicate that the applicant \u2019s son and the members of his family had also registered their permanent address in the house at that time .", "Despite that change the applicant and his wife were regularly disturbed by persons looking for CARDINAL of the companies whose address was at GPE street CARDINAL . Such encounters sometimes resulted in misunderstandings and conflicts , for example with employment seekers . As a result , the health of the applicant and his wife deteriorated . In particular , the applicant submitted medical certificates according to which his wife had been undergoing long - term psychiatric treatment since DATE . Both the applicant and his wife underwent treatment in a sanatorium .", "On DATE the applicant asked ORG to express its opinion as to whether ORG had proceeded in an appropriate manner from the point of view of respecting the rights of the persons living in the house and whether the company concerned had violated the rights of those persons .", "In a letter of DATE , a constitutional judge informed the applicant that individuals could initiate proceedings before ORG under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW only .

He stated that that number had originally been attached to their house and that he would not abandon the claim that it still belonged to them . The Mayor explained that the company had had street number CARDINAL in its address from the moment of its establishment . The municipality accepted that a change in the company \u2019s address would result in disproportionately high costs . The decision adopted in DATE to allocate street number CARDINAL to the house of the applicant \u2019s son seemed to be the most appropriate solution . The Mayor expressed the view that if the applicant \u2019s family had accepted the proposed solution including the placement of an additional board announcing where the company \u2019s LOC were situated , the problem would have been resolved . A lawyer whom the TV team consulted advised the applicant to indicate visibly on the house street number CARDINAL allocated by the municipality .
