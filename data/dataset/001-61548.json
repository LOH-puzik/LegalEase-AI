FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 14+8 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life;Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Baka;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP citizen who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON , near GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant married in DATE . She and her husband had CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE or DATE the applicant 's husband left the matrimonial home and moved in with his mistress . In DATE the applicant petitioned for divorce .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the NORP tribunal de grande instance ruled on the divorce petition . It found , firstly , that a reading of the submitted documents had not established that the applicant 's membership of the GPE 's Witnesses had been the cause of the break - down in the couple 's relationship , but that it had been attested that her husband had left the matrimonial home to live with his mistress , and had also prevented the applicant from working in the pizzeria they ran . Accordingly , it granted the divorce , attributing fault to the husband alone .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the children , the court decided that they would reside with their mother in GPE and that parental responsibility would be exercised jointly . The father was to have visiting and residence rights on an unrestricted basis and , in the absence of agreement , during the whole of the children 's school holidays , provided that he collected them himself and escorted them back to their mother 's home . It set the amount of the father 's maintenance payments at MONEY ( ORG ) per DATE and per child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment . She asked to be given access for DATE during the children 's DATE and DATE during the DATE and GPE holidays . She also renewed her request for a complementary allowance . In her pleadings in reply , the applicant complained that her ex - husband had not returned the children to her at DATE and had enrolled them in a school in FAC , where he lived with his new companion . She submitted that the father had influenced the children so that they would express a wish to live with him ; she filed statements and photographs intended to show that she was bringing up her children with great care and that they were allowed to take part freely in any activity that interested them . She requested that a social inquiry report be drawn up .", "CARDINAL . The N\u00eemes Court of Appeal delivered judgment on DATE . It upheld the judgment with regard to the divorce pronouncement and awarded the applicant a complementary allowance of ORG DATE for DATE . With regard to the children 's place of residence , the court found as follows :", "\u201c The CARDINAL under - age children , C. , aged DATE , and PERSON , aged DATE , currently live with their father in GPE , where they attend school .", "This is a de facto situation which has been brought about by the father , who , contrary to the provisions of the appealed judgment , failed to return the children to their mother 's home at DATE .", "In justifying his behaviour , NORP claims that he has acted in the children 's interests , in order to remove them from the detrimental influence of their mother and her circle , who oblige them to practice the religion known as ' the Jehovah 's Witnesses ' .", "Furthermore , NORP has submitted a letter from child C. , expressing the latter 's wish to remain with his father , together with a medical certificate drawn up by Doctor NORP , a psychiatrist , on DATE , which states that child C. ' experiences his mother 's prohibitions , via the NORP 's Witnesses , as distressing and frustrating ' and that ' child PERSON suffers from the religious constraints imposed on him and expressed a wish to live in GPE with his father as far back as DATE .", "Finally , numerous other witness statements testified to the children 's expressed wish not to return to GPE .", "ORG does not deny that she is a GPE 's Witness or that the CARDINAL children were being brought up in accordance with the precepts of this religion .", "Admittedly , she has submitted numerous statements attesting to her affection for her children and showing that she provides for their well - being , and has filed group photographs in which her children appear happy .", "Taken together , however , the submitted documents are not inconsistent with the arguments of NORP , who does not wish to deny the mother 's maternal attributes but restricts himself to criticising the strict upbringing received by the children on account of their mother 's religious convictions .", "The rules regarding child - rearing imposed by the GPE 's Witnesses on their followers ' children are open to criticism mainly on account of their strictness and intolerance and the obligation on children to proselytise .", "It is in the children 's interests to be free from the constraints and prohibitions imposed by a religion whose structure resembles that of a sect .", "There is no reason to order a social inquiry report which , in the present circumstances , would serve only to unsettle the children .", "In the light of the above analysis , the ORG considers that , contrary to the lower court 's decision , the CARDINAL under - age children 's place of residence should be their father 's home , but that parental responsibility should continue to be exercised jointly .", "Should no agreement be reached [ between the parents ] , ORG will enjoy free right of access and the right to have the children to stay :", "\u2013 for the whole of the DATE and All Saints holidays ;", "\u2013 for DATE during DATE ;", "\u2013 for CARDINAL of the LOC and DATE holidays , when it will be for the mother to collect the children from the father 's home and for the latter to collect them from the mother 's home ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . In particular , she complained that ORG had reversed the first - instance judgment on the central ground that the rules regarding child - rearing imposed by the GPE 's Witnesses on their followers ' children were open to criticism mainly on account of their strictness and intolerance and the obligation on children to proselytise ; in so deciding , it had done no more than apply a general and abstract ground and had failed to investigate whether , in reality , the children 's upbringing was disrupted to an extent that justified changing their place of residence . She considered that this value judgment on the way in which she practised her religion , taken in abstracto , did not justify the court 's decision . She added that the manner in which the court had asserted that it was in the children 's interests to be free from the constraints and prohibitions imposed by a religion whose structure resembled a sect had been just as abstract . She also complained that ORG had refused to grant her request for a social inquiry report . Referring to freedom of conscience and religion and to the rules of a fair hearing , she relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE . After summarising the grounds of ORG judgment , it ruled as follows :", "\u201c It is apparent from these findings and considerations that ORG , which replied to the submissions without inconsistency , was not obliged to order a social inquiry report and did not interfere with PERSON freedom of conscience , ruled , on the basis of the evidence which it alone is empowered to assess , that the children 's interests required that their father 's home be established as their habitual place of residence ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW provide :", "\u201c Parental responsibility shall be exercised jointly by both parents . Failing an agreement or where the court considers that such an agreement goes against the child 's interests , the court shall designate the parent with whom the children shall habitually reside .", "Where it is necessary in the interests of the child , the court may confer parental responsibility on CARDINAL of the CARDINAL parents .", "On their own initiative or at the court 's request , the parents may submit their observations on the arrangements for exercising parental responsibility . \u201d", "\u201c Prior to any interlocutory or final decision setting out the arrangements for the exercise of parental responsibility and visiting rights , or entrusting the children to a third party , the court may instruct any qualified person to draw up a social inquiry report . The aim of this document is to gather information on the family 's material and moral situation , the conditions in which the children live and are brought up , and the measures which should be taken in their interests .", "If CARDINAL of the spouses disputes the conclusions of the social inquiry report , he or she may request a second expert opinion .", "The social inquiry report may not be used in the divorce proceedings . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
