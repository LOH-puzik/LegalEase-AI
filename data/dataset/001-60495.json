{"ITEMID": "001-60495", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF OLIVIEIRA v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P4-2;No separate issue under Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON ( PERSON ) of GPE , relying on section CARDINAL of GPE ( PERSON ) as in force at the relevant time , imposed a prohibition order ( verwijderingsbevel ) on the applicant to the effect that the latter would not be allowed to enter a particular area , the so - called emergency area , of the city centre for DATE . The following events were referred to in the PERSON 's decision as having led to this order being issued .", "( i ) It transpired from police reports that on DATE ( twice ) , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant had either overtly used hard drugs or had had hard drugs in his possession in streets situated in the emergency area and that on each of those occasions he had been ordered to leave the area for TIME .", "( ii ) On DATE the applicant had been heard by the police about his conduct and he had been told that he would either have to desist from such acts , which disturbed public order ( openbare orde ) , or stay away from the area . The applicant had further been informed that , if he committed such acts again in the near future , the PERSON would be requested to impose a DATE prohibition order on him . The applicant had told the police that , as well as preparing and using drugs in the area concerned , he also met his friends there .", "( iii ) On DATE the applicant had nevertheless overtly used hard drugs on CARDINAL of the streets in the emergency area . He had once again been ordered to leave the area for TIME and the police had subsequently requested the PERSON to impose a DATE prohibition order on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of the PERSON , the applicant would again commit acts disturbing public order in the near future . In this context , the PERSON took account of the kind of conduct involved , namely acts seriously disturbing public order , the repetition and continuity of this conduct , the statement of the applicant , the short period of time within which the acts concerned had been observed and the fact that the applicant had continued his disruptive behaviour despite the TIME prohibition orders imposed on him and the warning given by the police . Finally , the PERSON noted that neither the applicant 's home nor his place of work were situated in the area concerned .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against the PERSON 's prohibition order . He submitted , inter alia , that the PERSON ought only to make use of the emergency powers granted him by LAW in exceptional situations . As the PERSON had been issuing TIME prohibition orders since DATE and DATE ones since DATE , it could no longer be argued that an exceptional situation prevailed . Moreover , the PERSON had had sufficient time to ensure that the emergency measures were enacted in a general municipal by - law ( Algemene Politie Verordening ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also stated that the prohibition order , which in his opinion constituted a criminal sanction , interfered with his right to liberty of movement and violated the principle of proportionality . In this connection , he argued that he had always complied with the prohibition orders imposed on him for a duration of TIME and that he therefore failed to understand why a prohibition order for DATE had been called for all of a sudden .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before an advisory committee . At this hearing the representative of the PERSON stated that , in DATE , CARDINAL TIME prohibition orders ( compared with CARDINAL in DATE ) and CARDINAL DATE prohibition orders ( compared with CARDINAL in DATE ) had been issued against people dealing in or using drugs or committing acts related to those activities . The representative further stated that it was intended to enact the power to issue prohibition orders in a general municipal by - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the committee advised the PERSON to dismiss the objection and to maintain the prohibition order . It considered , inter alia , that the disruption of public order in the area concerned was still such as to constitute an exceptional situation within the meaning of LAW . In view of the seriousness and scale of the problems involved , the committee found it unlikely that public order could be adequately maintained by normal methods and that for that reason the PERSON was entitled to use the powers granted him under section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the fact that the applicant had , within a short period of time , regularly committed acts which had disturbed public order and that the TIME prohibition orders which had been issued had not prevented him from doing so , the committee further found that the imposition of a prohibition order for a duration of DATE had not been unreasonable . It did not agree with the applicant that the impugned measure constituted a penalty , as it had been taken in order to maintain public order . The committee finally found that the interference with the applicant 's right to liberty of movement had been justified .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON dismissed the applicant 's objection , adopting as his own the reasoning applied by the advisory committee .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the PERSON 's decision with ORG ( GPE rechtspraak ) of FAC on DATE . In his appeal , which he detailed in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , he raised the same complaints as he had before the PERSON . In his written observations of DATE the PERSON referred to the report drawn up by the advisory committee . A hearing took place before ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) , the successor to ORG , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c LAW provides that everyone lawfully within the territory of a ORG shall have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence . According to the third paragraph of that provision , this right shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law , are necessary to protect national security , public order , public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others , and are consistent with the other rights recognised in that LAW . An almost identical provision is contained in LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "Section CARDINAL , first paragraph , of GPE confers on the PERSON emergency powers which should be used only in exceptional situations . Such exceptional situations include riotous movements , gatherings or other disturbances of public order , serious calamities , and also a serious fear of the development thereof .", "Contrary to what the party seeking review has argued , the issuing of orders in the situations set out in section CARDINAL of GPE does not run counter to the above - mentioned treaty provisions , since the latter provide for the possibility of restricting the rights concerned by ' law ' \u2013 a term which includes an order issued by the LAW pursuant to the law \u2013 for the protection of public order .", "Section CARDINAL of GPE is a legal provision intended for situations where ordinary means are insufficient for restoring and maintaining public order .", "In the opinion of the ORG these ordinary means may be considered insufficient in the present case and there was , at the time of the decision appealed against , an exceptional situation . It is relevant in this context that at the time of the decision appealed against it was not possible to solve the problem in question through a municipal regulation . There was not at that time \u2013 and there is not now \u2013 any relevant provision in a municipal by - law , nor is any other sufficient legal means available .", "On the basis of the case file and the submissions made at the hearing , in addition to the number of TIME and DATE orders that have been issued in the area concerned , the ORG finds that the appropriate staff and means available to the defendant were inadequate to counter the difficult situation arising from breaches of public order resulting from the behaviour of drug addicts as described in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . This leads the ORG to hold that it can not be stated that the defendant could not reasonably make use of the powers granted him by CARDINAL of LAW .", "The ORG would , however , express the following reservations .", "It can not see why , if the situation described above should continue , the possibility of issuing DATE prohibition orders should not be provided for in a by - law enacted by ORG . From the point of view of legal certainty and legitimacy of action by public authority , a regulation provided by a municipal by - law seems preferable to a measure based on the defendant 's emergency powers . It appears from the case file that the defendant had already prepared the draft of an appropriate provision , which , however , was never incorporated into ORG because the method used at present , which was decided on in consultation between the defendant , the police and the prosecuting authorities [ verweerder , politie en justitie ] with regard to the DATE prohibition orders , was considered extraordinarily effective . The ORG is , however , of the opinion that the presumed effectiveness of an emergency measure coupled with the prosecuting policy of the prosecution authorities [ Openbaar Ministerie ] do not constitute a reason not to make appropriate provision at the municipal level . The ORG considers that the defendant , in assessing whether there is an exceptional situation within the meaning of CARDINAL of LAW ( now section CARDINAL of GPE ) , may , in principle , no longer rely on the lack of an appropriate provision in a municipal by - law , in view of the length of time this drugs - related nuisance [ drugsoverlast ] has already prevailed , causing it to display structural aspects , if the possibility of issuing DATE prohibition orders is not now provided for in a by - law enacted by ORG within a reasonable time . \u201d", "This decision was published , with a learned comment , in ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the proceedings described above , the applicant was convicted by a single - judge ORG ( politierechter ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on DATE of having intentionally failed to comply on DATE with the prohibition order imposed by the PERSON on DATE . Under LAW ( PERSON ) , this failure constituted a criminal offence . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . Following an appeal to ORG ( gerechtshof ) , which also convicted the applicant , an appeal on points of law was lodged with ORG ( PERSON ) . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The criminal proceedings against the applicant do not form part of the case before the Court .", "CARDINAL . At the material time section CARDINAL of GPE ( PERSON ) provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In case of a riotous movement , gathering or other disturbance of public order or of serious calamities , as well as in case of a well - founded fear of the development thereof , the PERSON is empowered to issue all orders which he deems necessary for the maintenance of public order or the limitation of general danger .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , in its relevant parts , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Any person who intentionally fails to comply with an order or demand made in accordance with a statutory regulation by an official charged with supervisory powers or by an official responsible for the detection or investigation of criminal offences or duly authorised for this purpose , and any person who intentionally obstructs , hinders or thwarts any act carried out by such an official in the implementation of any statutory regulation , shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a secondcategory fine .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP If the offender commits the indictable offence within DATE of a previous conviction for such an offence having become final , the term of imprisonment may be increased by CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the GPE , the PERSON of a town or city is appointed by the Queen ( section CARDINAL of the former LAW ) . Municipal regulations , such as general municipal by - laws , are adopted by ORG ( section CARDINAL of the former GPE ) which is elected by those inhabitants of the town or city who are eligible to vote in elections for ORG of ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON of GPE informed ORG ( NORP ) of the GPE police that , in view of the situation in the city centre , ORG and police officers acting on the PERSON 's behalf would be able to issue orders , based on LAW as in force at the time , for people to leave a particular area within the city centre and not to return to it for TIME .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON extended the area of the city centre where these orders could be issued by a letter of DATE . Subsequently , by a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON also empowered ORG and his officers to order people to leave the designated area for DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON amended this instruction , replacing the discretion of the police officers to issue TIME prohibition orders by a strict order to do so in specified circumstances . This letter contains the following passage :", "\u201c In so acting I have considered that the designated city centre area exerts a continuing attraction on persons addicted to , and/or dealing in , hard drugs . The attendant behaviour disrupts public order , causes considerable nuisance and constitutes an incessant threat to public life . In these circumstances [ in dit verband ] , I judge the situation to constitute an exceptional situation within the meaning of section CARDINAL of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON 's instructions were further amended by a letter of CARDINAL DATE under the terms of which DATE prohibition orders could no longer be issued by the police on behalf of the PERSON but only by the PERSON himself .", "CARDINAL . A DATE prohibition order could be imposed on a person if in DATE CARDINAL proc\u00e8s - verbaux or other reports had been drawn up by the police concerning acts committed by him which had disturbed public order , such as , inter alia :", "( i ) the possession and use on the public highway of addictive substances appearing in Annex CARDINAL to LAW ( PERSON ; concerns hard drugs ) ;", "( ii ) dealing on the public highway in addictive substances appearing in LAW to LAW ;", "( iii ) overt possession of knives or other banned objects in so far as this constituted a criminal offence under the General Municipal By - Law or LAW ( LOC en GPE ) ;", "( iv ) committing the offence defined in LAW where the order not complied with was an TIME prohibition order ;", "( v ) acts of violence , thefts from cars on or along the public highway , overt selling of stolen goods on or along the public highway , in so far as there was a connection between these offences and hard drugs .", "CARDINAL . On the occasion of a fourth proc\u00e8s - verbal being drawn up against him , the person concerned would be heard by a police sergeant about his disruptive behaviour and the reason for his ( continued ) presence in the emergency area . The police sergeant would issue a warning to the effect that if in the near future the person concerned again disrupted public order , the police would request the PERSON to impose a DATE prohibition order .", "CARDINAL . It is undisputed that the aforementioned PERSON 's letters were neither published nor laid open to public inspection and that the PERSON 's instructions were not otherwise made public .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG Beslissingen ( ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , the President of ORG of GPE held as follows :", "\u201c As ORG has held in previous decisions , section CARDINAL of GPE \u2013 paraphrased DATE confers on the PERSON emergency powers which should be used only in exceptional situations . Such exceptional situations include riotous movements , gatherings or other disturbances of public order , serious calamities , and also a serious fear of the development thereof . Thus , provision has been made by law for situations in which it may definitely be expected that ordinary measures will be insufficient for restoring and maintaining public order .", "It must now first be examined whether in the present case there was a situation of the kind aimed at by the aforementioned section CARDINAL , first paragraph .", "In so doing , we will consider the undisputed statement made by the respondent party at the hearing concerning the situation in the ( old ) city centre of GPE :", "' The old city centre of GPE is known internationally and nationally as a centre for the trade in hard drugs . It continues to attract large numbers of addicts . The doings and dealings of addicts and dealers generally cause serious nuisance : overt use and dealing , intimidating group behaviour , threats to passers - by ( frequently with knives ) , shouting , raving , fights , robberies ( frequently with knives ) , thefts , receiving stolen property , etc . The old city centre has many functions ; an important one is that of being a residential and commercial area . However , the situation threatens all the time to become unbearable .", "The extent to which matters have deteriorated for the residents is again apparent from the desperate protests which took place at DATE . These protests ended , for the time being , at a meeting of ORG which was attended by a crowd of people .", "The NORP , PERSON , FAC and QUANTITY Hoogstraat are part of the crisis area . PERSON ( FAC , the Nieuwe and Oude Hoogstraat are the prolongation of the NORP ) constitutes the entrance to the old city centre . In this part of the town , all manner of soft drugs , but especially hard drugs , are for sale , in small or large amounts : hashish , cocaine , amphetamines , ORG , heroin and other mindaltering substances . In this area especially , street dealers go about more than elsewhere in the city centre peddling fake hard drugs .", "The presence of the dealers and large numbers of addicts , with the attendant criminality , seriously affect the area .", "As a result , among other things , of the strong protests of local residents , a special project team of the police was active in LOC for DATE from DATE . Its actions were directed in particular towards the bridge between FAC and the Oude Hoogstraat , the so - called pills bridge . This bridge was occupied by representatives of a new phenomenon , namely , multiple drugs use .", "The project team set itself the primary task of restoring public order . During the action , there were CARDINAL ! arrests , CARDINAL of knives were seized and CARDINAL of prohibition orders were issued . '", "Noting all this , we are of the provisional opinion that an emergency situation of the kind referred to in section CARDINAL , first paragraph , of GPE was rightly found to exist . The respondent was therefore entitled to issue the disputed orders . \u201d", "Similarly , in a decision of DATE ( PERSON ( Summary Proceedings Law Reports ) DATE , no .

In a judgment of DATE ( PERSON , no . CARDINAL ) , which related to a criminal prosecution under LAW for failure to comply with an TIME prohibition order , ORG ( PERSON ) accepted that the PERSON 's powers under section CARDINAL of the former GPE were intended only for exceptional situations . It held , however , that the mere fact that DATE had passed since the PERSON had declared an emergency situation \u2013 the case related to the PERSON 's instruction of CARDINAL DATE was not sufficient per se to justify the conclusion that an exceptional situation no longer existed . It also held , in the same judgment , that LAW did not apply to TIME prohibition orders because such orders were not given by way of penal sanction but were in the nature of a measure aimed at preserving public order . Nor did such orders violate LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention , since they were \u201c in accordance with law \u201d and \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d for \u201c the maintenance of ordre public \u201d .
