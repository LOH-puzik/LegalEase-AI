The applicant , who was born on DATE in GPE , was abandoned by her mother at birth .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was placed first in an orphanage and subsequently with the PERSON family . When she was DATE she was adopted by PERSON and PERSON under the simple adoption ( affiliazione ) procedure , by a decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , after learning that she had been adopted , the applicant asked her adoptive parents to tell her who her birth parents were , but did not receive an answer . On an unspecified date she discovered that a young girl living in her village , who had been born on DATE as her , had been abandoned and subsequently adopted by another family under the simple adoption procedure . The applicant suspected that she was her twin sister . The adoptive parents of the CARDINAL girls prohibited any contact between them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that she had had a very difficult childhood because she had been unable to find out her origins .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested information about her origins from ORG , in accordance with CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( LAW : \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , the regulations governing simple adoption having been repealed by that PERSON . ORG gave the applicant her birth certificate , on which her birth mother \u2019s name did not appear because she had not agreed to have her identity disclosed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG , under LAW no . CARDINAL , seeking rectification of her birth certificate . On CARDINAL DATE the court declined jurisdiction and dismissed the application on the ground that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Law no . CARDINAL provided that where persons aged over CARDINAL were seeking access to information about their birth parents the court with the appropriate jurisdiction was ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG . On DATE the court dismissed her application on the ground that , under section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG , she was prohibited from gaining access to information about her origins because her mother , at the time of the applicant \u2019s birth , had not agreed to have her identity disclosed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which dismissed her appeal by a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court observed , in particular , that ORG had stressed the fact that the applicant \u2019s birth mother had requested to keep her identity secret and that it had therefore correctly applied section PERSON ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , even though the applicant had been adopted under a simple adoption order , as simple adoption did nevertheless create a family status . ORG found that section PERSON ) was designed to guarantee respect for the mother \u2019s wishes . The prohibition on allowing the applicant access to information about her origins also served a public interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , one of the parents may decide not to recognise his or her child . In order to exercise that right , the mother must , at the time of the birth , request the hospital to keep her identity secret . In such a case a medical file containing medical information about the mother and child is drawn up . Only the child \u2019s general practitioner may have access to the file , with the permission of the child \u2019s guardian .", "CARDINAL . Simple adoption ( affiliazione ) was created in DATE in order to provide assistance to abandoned or parentless children aged DATE . Unlike full adoption , this did not create an effective family relationship and the person being adopted did not have to be childless ; however , he or she did have to be aged DATE . A simple adoption order could be requested by : the person with whom the child had been placed , ORG , or the person who had been raising the child on their own initiative .", "CARDINAL . The Articles of the Civil Code providing for simple adoption were repealed as a result of the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( subsequently revised by Law no . DATE and by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL guarantees the right to keep a child \u2019s origins secret in the absence of express authorisation by the judicial authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . MONEY , a mother who decides not to keep her child can give birth in a hospital and at the same time remain anonymous on the declaration of birth . That anonymity lasts DATE , after which access to the birth certificate becomes possible .", "CARDINAL . An adoption order , once issued by the court , is sent to the register office so that a note can be made in the margin of the birth certificate . Any copies of the adopted child \u2019s civil - status certificates must be issued with only the new family name shown and must bear no mention of the biological father or mother or any annotation regarding the adoption . However , where the registrar is expressly so authorised by the court , he or she may disclose this information .", "CARDINAL . Adopted children may have access to information about their origins and the identity of their birth parents on reaching DATE . Where there are compelling and proven reasons relating to their physical and mental health , they may obtain that information on their majority . An application is lodged with the family court of their place of residence , which gives its decision after assessing the particular situation and hearing any persons whom it deems it necessary to hear .", "CARDINAL . Access to the information is refused where the birth mother has not recognised the child at birth and where CARDINAL of the birth parents has declared their wish not to be named on the birth certificate or has given their consent to the adoption subject to remaining anonymous .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG held that withholding information about a child \u2019s origins without first verifying whether the mother still did not wish to be identified was compatible with ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed , in particular , that section NORP ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL aimed to protect mothers who \u2013 in difficult circumstances \u2013 decided not to keep their child , by allowing them the possibility of giving birth in a hospital and at the same time remaining anonymous on the declaration of birth . In the court \u2019s view , the mother could thus give birth in good conditions and was prevented from taking an irreversible decision . That possibility would be jeopardised if , under that provision , the mother were also to know that she might DATE be called upon by the judicial authority to confirm or waive her decision .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides : \u201c Appeals to ORG in cases of violations of the law are always admissible against judgments or measures affecting personal freedom pronounced by the ordinary or special courts \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A government bill on access to personal origins has been before ORG DATE . The bill has CARDINAL main objectives :", "i ) to permit and make provision for a procedure whereby confidentiality can be waived without calling into question the legal consequences of the decision initially taken by the mother ;", "ii ) to make a waiver of confidentiality subject to the express agreement of the mother and child .", "Under the provisions of the bill , anyone aged CARDINAL or over who has been adopted and not recognised at birth may apply to the family court for access to information about their origins , subject to the mother \u2019s agreement . Where the child seeks to discover his or her origins , the family court will take steps to find the mother and obtain her consent to waive confidentiality while respecting her private life . Where the mother has died and where the father has died or can not be identified , the court will obtain information about their identity and any medical data that may disclose the existence of any transmissible hereditary diseases .", "CARDINAL . Whilst the system of anonymous or secret births would appear to exist in a minority of countries in LOC , it is not exceptional . In addition to GPE , where for DATE the positive law has provided for a system of anonymous births , other national legislations , which are relatively recent as they have been drafted during DATE , also provide for births in such conditions ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "In GPE the system of anonymous births tends to resemble that of secret births , like the practice in GPE where the secrecy of the birth mother \u2019s identity is temporary , rather than definitive , as access to the relevant information is delayed .", "CARDINAL . The situation of children born anonymously or secretly is comparable to that of children who find it difficult , or even impossible , to gain access to their biological origins . The omission of the name of CARDINAL or other or of both parents may sometimes be provided for by law , but this is very rare ( GPE , GPE , GPE ) . Usually factual circumstances will prevent the registrar from fully completing the child \u2019s birth certificate ; court proceedings are brought to determine paternity / maternity and may be available to persons other than the child alone . Notwithstanding the fact that such actions may not necessarily be effective in the particular circumstances , their very existence , allowing research to be done into personal ties maintained by a child with his birth family , provides a safeguard for the interested persons .", "CARDINAL . It should further be pointed out that the practice of abandoning children continues in modern forms : there is an undeniable increase in the number of \u201c windows \u201d or \u201c baby hatches \u201d reminiscent of foundling wheels in DATE . It is practically and materially impossible for the child to gain access to information about his or her birth family ; the register of births will give a \u201c fictitious \u201d name to the child that bears no connection to that of its birth parents . The circumstances of the birth may be only partially secret ( GPE , GPE ) , but this will then necessarily mean that some data is available . Legal proceedings are generally available for children searching for their birth mother ( GPE , GPE , the former GPE ) or mothers who may be searching for their child ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of full adoption , the child will often lose all contact with its birth family ; the new parent - child relationship will totally erase any ties that may have existed during the child \u2019s previous life with other adults ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the former GPE ) . Access to the birth certificate is sometimes possible from DATE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) . The child may be authorised to gain access to a wider range of information ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) , which often presupposes bringing legal proceedings whereby the competing interests may be examined .", "CARDINAL . GPE and GPE have set up a mechanism making it easier for adopted persons to gain access to records about their adoption that goes a long way towards reconciling the right to information of the adopted child and respect for the private and family life of the mother or , more broadly , the birth family ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
