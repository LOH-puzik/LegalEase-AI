NORP The applicant community was at the time of the events complained of a registered religious community established in GPE under LAW DATE . Since DATE it has had the status of a religious society , a status conferred by statute .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant community wished to employ a couple , GPE and GPE , who were both ministers belonging to ORG of Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses ( ORG der PERSON ) and who were LANGUAGE speaking citizens of the GPE , for the benefit of its LANGUAGE speaking members in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to obtain a residence permit ( PERSON ) or a settlement permit ( Niederlassungsbewilligung ) , the couple had to have a work permit or be able to show that they were not subject to the provisions of ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . On DATE the applicant community therefore applied to ORG Arbeitsmarktservice ) in GPE for a declaratory decision that the pastoral work the couple would exercise was exempt from the provisions of LAW . It submitted that , since the entry into force of LAW DATE , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW had to be understood as referring to all persons doing pastoral work for religious communities and not only as referring to ministers of recognised churches and religious societies . In any event , it submitted that the tasks which would be assigned to GPE and GPE would not constitute employment within the terms of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application and , on DATE , an appeal panel of ORG confirmed the decision . Both authorities found that only ministers performing pastoral duties belonging to a recognised religious society were exempt from the provisions of LAW , but not members of a registered religious community , which was the status of the applicant community . In addition , the boards held that pastoral work had the typical features of employment within the meaning of LAW , as it was exercised within a hierarchical structure , subject to the instructions of a superior and involved economic dependence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant community filed a complaint with ORG , in which it argued that the decisions of the administrative authorities had violated its rights under LAW CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that any employment contracts the applicant community concluded with aliens concerning pastoral work as ministers would be subject to the provisions of LAW , because the exemption in section CARDINAL ) of LAW only applied to churches or religious societies recognised by law .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that even though the pastoral work of ministers clearly fell within the scope of protection of Article CARDINAL , which also comprised the conclusion of employment contracts by a religious group with persons engaging in such activities , and even though labour - market regulations , in particular the employment of aliens , might constitute an interference with the rights protected by DATE , such interference was justified under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . The difference between the employment of foreigners as ministers performing pastoral work by a religious society and employment by a registered religious community made by LAW was in conformity with LAW . Through recognition as a religious society , that religious group acquired a legal status , more closely defined in LAW , which would allow it to participate in the shaping of public life in GPE an PERSON \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON teilzunehmen ) . As this status could , and indeed had to , be granted to all churches and religious societies provided the conditions established by law were met , the distinction between recognised religious societies and other communities did not give rise to doubts as to its constitutionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint , which had been transferred to it . The applicant community argued that section CARDINAL ) of LAW was discriminatory . However , ORG found that this matter had been exhaustively examined by ORG in its above decision . This decision was served on the applicant community \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant community received a donation .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE PERSON ) ordered the applicant community to pay inheritance and gift tax in the amount of PERCENT on the sum received . It found that the applicant community could not rely on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the ORG and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which provided an exemption from tax liability for certain donations to religious institutions , because this tax privilege was reserved to churches and religious societies recognised by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant community appealed . It argued that , as a result of the entry into force of LAW on DATE , the exemption from tax liability under LAW ) of LAW also extended to registered religious communities such as itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal . It noted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW clearly referred to religious societies and there was no doubt that this did not mean a registered religious community . Referring to the caselaw of ORG , in particular its decision of DATE ( see above ) , it found that the difference in treatment between religious societies and religious communities was in accordance with LAW . Further , none of the other exemption clauses under this provision applied to the applicant community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant community filed a complaint with ORG , arguing that the impugned decision had violated its right to equal treatment , right to the peaceful enjoyment of its property and right not to be discriminated against on the basis of religion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to deal with the complaint for a lack of prospects of success , considering that insofar as the applicant community \u2019s complaints concerned matters of constitutional law they had been sufficiently dealt with in its previous caselaw .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request by the applicant community , it remitted the case to ORG . On DATE the applicant community supplemented its complaint before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as unfounded . It found that the applicant community was not a religious society and could not , therefore , rely on a privilege reserved to such an institution . Moreover , it was also not a charitable institution ( gemeinn\u00fctzige K\u00f6rperschaft ) within the meaning of LAW , as charitable goals were only those which consisted of promoting the interests of the general public ( nur solche GPE durch deren Erf\u00fcllung die GPE gef\u00f6rdert wird ) . As the applicant community , according to its constitutional documents , essentially addressed its activities to its members alone , it addressed itself to a more restricted group than the general public .", "CARDINAL .
