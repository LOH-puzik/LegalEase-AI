Since I was appointed as a member ( Chairperson ) of ORG in charge of the implementation of Resolution DATE ) , I have been able to meet these CARDINAL symbolic prisoners on CARDINAL occasions ( except for LOC ) , as well as their lawyers . I already visited them when I was Rapporteur for accession DATE . I have been of the opinion for a long time , as is also the view of the experts , that they are undoubtedly political prisoners . ...", "CARDINAL . The trial of PERSON is also proceeding chaotically . The last sitting in his trial , scheduled for DATE , has been postponed on account of the main judge 's indisposition , and no new date has been announced . ...", "CARDINAL . We believe that these retrials , which in reality are appeals disguised as new trials , fall short , as far as the procedure is concerned , of the expectations expressed by the ORG in its last report on political prisoners in GPE . The judicial investigation should have been started again from the beginning , and the accusations made against the defendants should not be lifted purely and simply from the previous trials , since the former judgments are currently still in force and consequently the QUANTITY prisoners do not benefit from the presumption of innocence . Moreover , since these trials are being held in prison ( in GPE , far from GPE ) , it is not easy for people to attend . Finally , in some cases , witnesses called by the defence were refused by the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The [ defendant is ] locked up in a cage under strict supervision . ...", "The location of the trials is very difficult to access . The PERSON prison is TIME away from GPE , and there is no public transport to get there . Each time , the judges , lawyers , families of prisoners and audience have to travel TIME to get to the prison and use their own means of transport , which is very costly .", "Conditions of access are those of a prison . Only people who have been authorized by the President of ORG can attend hearings . CARDINAL controls are carried out before entering the courtroom . Cell phones are confiscated at the entrance , and handed back at the end of session .", "According to the Minister of ORG , [ hearing is ] public , since any person who wishes to attend can [ do so ] and even \u201c international organisations \u201d have been allowed in . In practice , the press and families often have to protest outside the courtroom because they are not allowed in .", "Journalists are carefully selected .
