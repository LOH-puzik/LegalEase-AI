The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He explained that he sought in all of his work to promote a rapprochement between NORP and NORP .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In its issue of CARDINAL DATE , the newspaper ORG published an article written by the applicant , entitled \u201c The obscurity of error \u201d concerning the papal encyclical \u201c The Splendour of Truth \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , which had been published at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the association ORG against Racism and for PERSON for the NORP and ORG ( ORG g\u00e9n\u00e9rale contre le racisme et pour le respect de l'identit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise et chr\u00e9tienne ( AGRIF ) ) brought proceedings before ORG against Mr P. Tesson , publishing director of the newspaper , the applicant and the newspaper ORG , as author , accomplice and the entity civilly liable respectively , alleging that , through publication of the above - mentioned article , they had made racially defamatory statements against the NORP community , an offence punishable under section DATE , second paragraph , of the Freedom of the Press Act of DATE . In particular , they referred to the following passages :", "\u201c ORG sets itself up as the sole keeper of divine truth ... It strongly proclaims the fulfilment of FAC in the New , and the superiority of the latter ...", "... Many NORP have acknowledged that scriptural anti - Judaism and the doctrine of the ' fulfilment ' [ accomplissement ] of LAW in the New led to anti - Semitism and prepared the ground in which the idea and implementation [ accomplissement ] of FAC took seed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the objections of invalidity raised by the applicant and , inter alia , committed the case for trial . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found established the offence of publicly defaming a group of persons on the ground of membership of a religion , in this case the NORP community . The publishing director and the applicant were both ordered to pay a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found the ORG 's civil application admissible and ordered the publishing director and the applicant , jointly and severally , to pay the association MONEY in damages and FRF CARDINAL in application of LAW . In addition , the court ordered that its decision be published , at the defendants ' expense up to ORG CARDINAL , in a national newspaper . In its judgment , it stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ORG , which is described as holding , exclusively and in error , divine truth , is accused of proclaiming its attachment to the doctrine of the fulfilment of FAC in LAW , a doctrine that was reaffirmed in the encyclical ' The Splendour of Truth ' . It is also stated that anti - Judaism in the Scriptures and this doctrine of fulfilment ' led to anti - Semitism and prepared the ground in which the idea and implementation of FAC took seed ' .", "Thus , according to the author of the text , not only the idea , but even the implementation of the massacres and horrors committed at FAC , the symbol of the NORP extermination camps , was a direct extension of CARDINAL of the core doctrines of the NORP faith , namely the doctrine of the fulfilment of LAW in the New , and thus directly engages the responsibility of NORP and , more generally , NORP .", "Such a statement clearly undermines the honour and character of NORP and , more specifically , the NORP community , and is covered by the provisions of section CARDINAL , second paragraph , of the [ Freedom of the Press Act ] of CARDINAL DATE .", "... the causal link between membership of a religion and the events imputed by the impugned remarks is certainly present in this case : it is because they adhere to a religion that has allegedly displayed anti - Semitism in its past and because they acknowledge the status of the papal encyclical and the doctrine of fulfilment asserted in it that NORP and NORP are accused of bearing some responsibility for the FAC massacres .", "... Even if the defendant was entitled to condemn ORG 's historical NORP and to alert the reader to any new expression or resurgence of that sentiment , by pointing out that , historically , the various NORP churches have sometimes accepted or even encouraged the idea of ' the teaching of contempt ' with regard to the NORP people , who are described as deicidal , he nevertheless had no right , when the new papal encyclical was published reaffirming the doctrine of ' fulfilment ' , to use extreme terms and , through a process of generalisation , to hold the NORP community responsible for the NORP massacres at FAC .", "The witnesses questioned at the hearing , at the defendant 's request and in support of his allegation of good faith , all claimed that NORP , a racist and biological doctrine , was totally unconnected to the historical anti - NORP of NORP and the doctrine of ' fulfilment ' , which concerns the full realisation of the law of God 's old alliance with his people in the new alliance born of GPE 's sacrifice .", "Finally , the confusion made between , on the CARDINAL hand , NORP anti - NORP and the encyclical ' The Splendour of Truth ' , which Mr PERSON furthermore refrained from commenting on during the hearing , and , on the other hand , the persecution of the NORP in FAC , reflects personal animosity on the part of the defendant and resentment towards the NORP community which lack good faith , since the disputed statements go well beyond theoretical and theological discussion .", "In this regard , the ORG notes the deliberate use of the same word ' accomplissement ' to describe the organisation of the massacres in FAC and the doctrine reaffirmed by the Pope in his encyclical .", "It follows from these elements as a whole that proof of the defendant 's good faith has not been provided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG upheld , in so far as it concerned the applicant , the judgment of DATE and overturned the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . ORG acquitted the applicant and dismissed the civil party 's claims against him . In particular , it held that :", "\u201c ... in his article , PERSON criticises the encyclical ' The Splendour of Truth ' for , in essence , enshrining within the body of theological principles the doctrine of the ' fulfilment ' of LAW in the New , a doctrine he considered to contain the seeds of anti - Semitism ; this criticism is expressed unambiguously in the penultimate paragraph of the article ... ;", "... the contention in PERSON statements may be summarised as follows : certain principles of the NORP religion are tainted with anti - Semitism and contributed to the Holocaust ;", "... the ORG is fully aware of the reactions such an article could evoke within the NORP community , even if the author claims to be reflecting the opinion of ' many NORP ' ;", "... nonetheless , ... in criticising the encyclical ' The Splendour of Truth ' so strongly , PERSON opened a discussion that was both theological and historical on the scope of certain religious principles and on the origins of the Holocaust ; given that it concerns exclusively doctrinal debate , the argument put forward by this author is not , as a matter of law , a specific fact that could amount to defamation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed on points of law . In a judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG , \u201c but only in so far as it concerned the civil action , all other provisions being expressly upheld \u201d . It remitted the case to ORG . ORG stated :", "\u201c ... by ruling in this way , although the impugned statements imputed incitement to anti - Semitism and responsibility for the massacres committed at FAC to the NORP community , ORG did not give a legal basis to its decision ;", "The judgment falls to be quashed , but only in respect of the civil action ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , ruling on the civil claims and following ORG analysis , upheld the judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE in so far as they concerned the applicant . ORG made a new award of ORG CARDINAL to the AGRIF on the basis of LAW . It also ordered that the following statement be published , at the defendant 's expense , in a national newspaper of the civil party 's choice :", "\u201c By a judgment of DATE , ORG ordered PERSON , journalist , to pay ORG and for Respect for the NORP and ORG ( ORG ) CARDINAL FRANC ( CARDINAL ) in damages , on the ground that he had committed the offence of public defamation against a group of persons on account of their membership of a religion , in the instant case the NORP community , through his publication of ... an article entitled ' As regards the PERSON \u201c The Splendour of Truth \u201d , The obscurity of error ... ' \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment , ORG noted , inter alia :", "\u201c ... The defendant is wrong in denying that he accused NORP and , more generally , NORP of being responsible for the NORP massacres ; it is of little importance that this responsibility is viewed in a more or less long - term perspective , given the use of the expression ' prepared the ground ' ;", "It emerges , after analysis of the documents submitted , that neither the PERSON nor the [ NORP ] Church of GPE alleges the direct responsibility of NORP in the extermination at FAC ;", "Thus , on account of their membership of a religion , NORP are indeed victims of the offence of defamation ;", "... the virulence of the article 's general tone , the parallel made between the ' doctrine of fulfilment ' and the ' implementation of Auschwitz ' and even the use of this last word , which is sufficient in itself to evoke both genocide and the extermination of opponents of the NORP regime , rule out the possibility of the author 's good faith ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on points of law . As part of the single argument set out in support of his appeal , he referred to LAW and claimed that his objective and sincere statements had not been unnecessarily polemical and malicious and that they had not therefore failed to meet the requirements of good faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... ORG is satisfied from the wording of the judgment appealed against and analysis of the evidence in the case file that ORG , in ruling that the defendant was excluded from the benefit of a finding of good faith , relied on grounds which were sufficient and free of contradictions , answered the submissions made to it and analysed the particular circumstances relied on by the defendant ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The published article read :", "\u201c As regards the encyclical ' The Splendour of Truth '", "The obscurity of error ...", "PERSON new encyclical , ' ORG , concerns the basis of moral theology from the perspective of NORP teaching . It is intended to provide the faithful with answers to the questions put to PERSON by a young man in a New Testament parable : What good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?", "Unfortunately , from the point of view of other religions and from the NORP perspective , the PERSON 's text is based on CARDINAL types of assertion :", "CARDINAL . ORG sets itself up as the sole keeper of divine truth and assumes the ' duty ' of disseminating its doctrine as the sole universal teaching .", "CARDINAL . It strongly proclaims the fulfilment of LAW in the New and the superiority of the latter , a doctrine which propagates ' the teaching of contempt ' for the NORP , long since condemned by PERSON as an element in the development of anti - Semitism .", "According to PERSON , ' the task of authentically interpreting the word of God ... has been entrusted only to those charged with the ORG 's living PERSON ' , which is consequently empowered to state that some theological and even philosophical affirmations are ' incompatible with revealed truth ' . ORG is said to possess ' a light and a power capable of answering even the most controversial and complex questions ' .", "Non - NORP are viewed with disdain : ' ... whatever goodness and truth is found in them is considered by the ORG as a preparation for the Gospel . '", "The passing away of NORP religious tradition is asserted with the same arrogance .", "The PERSON , which the ORG labels ' old ' , merely prefigures NORP perfection . The Mosaic Decalogue is ' a promise and sign of LAW . PERSON is the ' new PERSON ' . The Law of PERSON is only a ' figure of the true law ' , ' an image of the truth ' . PERSON came down from GPE carrying ' tablets of stone ' in his hands . The apostles carried ' the Holy Spirit in their hearts ' . NORP law is ' written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts ' . The prescriptions imparted by God in LAW attained their perfection in the New ' .", "For the old law was incomplete . Admittedly , it had a pedagogical function . But it was unable to give the ' righteousness ' it demanded : only the new law gives grace , it ' is not content to say what must be done ' , but also gives the power to ' do what is true ' .", "We find here ideas which were already explored in the voluminous ' Catechism of the Catholic Church ' of DATE . As in that unfortunate catechism , a few arrows are also fired , in line with NORP tradition , at the ORG . The faithful are called to take ' great care ... not to allow themselves to be tainted by the attitude of the Pharisee ' , which , in DATE , is expressed in adapting the moral norm to one 's own capacities and personal interests , that is , in rejecting the very idea of a moral norm .", "One must wonder how NORP and the NORP religious authorities would ' appreciate ' an equivalent NORP attack on LAW .", "CARDINAL must also wonder how the NORP pontiff reconciles his encyclical with the exhortation in the ' CARDINAL Points of PERSON ' and with the requirement envisaged in the first draft of the declaration on the NORP at FAC II , calling on NORP not to teach anything that would vilify the NORP and their doctrine .", "Many NORP have acknowledged that scriptural anti - Judaism and the doctrine of the ' fulfilment ' [ accomplissement ] of LAW in the New led to anti - Semitism and prepared the ground in which the idea and implementation [ accomplissement ] of FAC took seed .", "No consideration is given to this by ORG in DATE . In proclaiming the splendour of truth , it perseveres in obscurity and error . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's statements contribute to a recurrent debate of ideas between historians , theologians and religious authorities . The CARDINAL most recent Popes , PERSON and PERSON , as well as the hierarchy of ORG , have discussed the possibility that the manner in which the NORP are presented in the New Testament contributed to creating hostility against them . In particular , reference is made to LAW of DATE , which emphasises ORG historical responsibility towards the NORP people ; the speech given on DATE by PERSON during a colloquy on the \u201c Roots of Anti - Judaism in the LOC \u201d ; or , more recently , the book The NORP People and their ORG in the Christian Bible , published in DATE by ORG under the direction of Cardinal PERSON \u2013 in its preface , the latter writes with regard to the PERSON that \u201c in the light of what has happened , what ought to emerge now is a new respect for the NORP interpretation of the Old Testament \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
