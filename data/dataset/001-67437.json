He claimed that he was persecuted for political reasons in GPE . ORG appointed a legal representative for the applicant and interviewed him about his reasons for asylum .", "On DATE the NORP Secret Police ( PERSON referred to as \u201c NORP \u201d ) submitted certain information regarding the applicant to ORG and objected to his being granted asylum in GPE in light of that information . Following this , on DATE , ORG noted that it transpired from the information provided by ORG that the applicant had withheld important information and it decided to transfer the matter to the Government of GPE for DATE ) but that the assessment made by ORG , which ORG found no reason to question , pointed in a completely different direction . Thus , it considered that the balancing of these CARDINAL conflicting interests had to be made by the Government .", "On DATE ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , in a submission to the Government , stated that it shared the opinion of ORG that the ORG should decide on the application .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant 's request and ordered his immediate expulsion from GPE 's own statements , were such that he could be considered as a refugee according to LAW . However , relying on the information submitted by ORG , the ORG considered it established that he had held a leading position in an organisation which had been involved in terrorist acts and that he could be considered responsible for this organisation 's activities . Thus , for reasons of national security , he should be refused protection in GPE . Furthermore , ORG had received a guarantee from ORG of GPE that the applicant would be afforded a fair trial in GPE and that he would not be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment or punishment of any kind or be sentenced to death . For this reason , the Government found that the applicant could be expelled to GPE without facing the risk of being treated contrary to LAW or any other international treaty .

It would appear that , now , he has been granted access to most of the material , though not to all of it .", "On DATE , ORG adopted its concluding observations regarding GPE 's fifth periodic report to ORG ) . In paragraph CARDINAL of these observations , the ORG expressed concern at cases of expulsion of asylum seekers suspected of terrorism to their country of origin . In this respect the ORG requested additional information concerning the judicial procedures which the applicant and CARDINAL other person expelled at the same time to GPE were facing or might face . ORG replied to this request on DATE and submitted a further update on DATE in which the Government , inter alia , stated that ORG , although dismissing the allegation of torture as unfounded , had agreed to undertake an investigation into the matter . The modalities for such an investigation were being discussed . ORG also stated that they continued to have regular contact with the applicant although he had now been released .", "Further , following a visit to GPE in DATE , ORG for Human Rights , in his report dated DATE , mentioned the circumstances of the applicant 's case and his expulsion from GPE , noting that it highlighted the challenges that the fight against terrorism had created for the protection of human rights ( GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . He recommended ORG to \u201c [ a]dopt the necessary legislative and policy changes in order to ensure that the rights contained in LAW and CARDINAL of LAW are respected in relation to asylum - seekers who are considered to raise concerns of national security . \u201d ( ibid . , \u00a7 DATE , point CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the applicant 's NORP lawyer faxed an incomplete application form to the ORG in which he briefly stated the reasons for lodging a complaint on behalf of his client against GPE .

Further , under part III , \u201c statements of alleged violations \u201d , he claimed that GPE had violated his client 's rights under LAW , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention and under LAW No . CARDINAL , noting that the reasons for these allegations would be expanded upon in a separate document . He added that he requested respite to do so , within a reasonable time after ORG had delivered its decision , and that due to problems of secrecy ( because of the national security interest ) it was difficult for him to submit a complete application at that time ; the application form was submitted in order to comply with the DATE rule . Furthermore , under part LAW , V and VII of the form , he noted that \u201c it will be completed \u201d .", "The Registry replied by letter of DATE , acknowledging receipt of the fax and the original of the application form and stated that the ORG \u201c awaits further documents in the matter \u201d . The case was assigned application number CARDINAL/CARDINAL but was not allocated to a decision body , as no copies of national decisions or documents had been submitted .", "On DATE the file was destroyed as no further news had been received from the applicant 's lawyer for DATE .", "Not until DATE , DATE and DATE after receipt of his first fax , did the ORG hear from the lawyer again . He then submitted a signed power of attorney and a request that he be granted respite until DATE to file further documents .", "As the file had been destroyed , the ORG opened a new file under the current case number and , on DATE , sent an introductory letter to the lawyer .", "On DATE the lawyer contacted the ORG , asking how it was possible that the case - file had been destroyed without his being informed about it beforehand and providing a brief explanation of the situation . After being requested to submit the reasons for his extensive silence in writing to the ORG , the lawyer , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , complied with this request ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
