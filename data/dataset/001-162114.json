On DATE CARDINAL of the landowners , acting on his own and the remaining heirs\u2019 behalf , concluded an agreement ( akt marr\u00ebveshje ) with the applicant \u2019s company , according to which the latter would secure finance for the privatisation of fuel tanks and installations located on the landowners\u2019 plot of land , in respect of which they would exercise their right of first refusal ( e drejta e parablerjes ) at the time of privatisation . In return , the landowners would transfer ownership rights to the applicant \u2019s company upon privatisation .

On DATE the same landowner , again acting on his own and the remaining heirs\u2019 behalf , concluded a similar agreement ( akt marr\u00ebveshje ) with the applicant \u2019s company for the privatisation of the fuel tanks and installations , the difference being that some objects would remain the landowners\u2019 property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same landowner , again acting on his own and the remaining heirs\u2019 behalf , concluded a notarised sales contract with the applicant for the sale of almost all of the fuel tanks and installations for MONEY ( ORG ) , which , according to the contract , was paid by the applicant to the landowners . On DATE ORG issued a property certificate ( v\u00ebrtetim pron\u00ebsie \u2013 Ipoteka ) , according to which the applicant had registered title to the petrol station fuel tanks and installations ( mortgage register entry no .

The agreements contained no details as to the purpose of the loan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the landowners instituted proceedings against the applicant seeking the annulment of the agreements and contract concluded DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .

Following remittals of the case , on DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings ( pushimin e \u00e7\u00ebshtjes ) as the landowners had failed to attend court without good reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the landowners instituted a fresh set of proceedings against the applicant seeking the annulment of the agreements and contract concluded DATE . The claim was signed by only their lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the landowners requested ORG to obtain and process all documents from the case - file concerning the first set of proceedings , including the powers of attorney . The court accepted this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of a criminal complaint he had lodged with the district prosecutor \u2019s office against the landowners alleging forgery of documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant , having regard to the number of previous requests that had been rejected , challenged the bench .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the presiding judge of the bench withdrew from the case , given the applicant \u2019s repeated requests for withdrawal . On DATE the President of ORG set aside the withdrawal , finding that it did not contain any of the grounds stipulated in DATE of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a counterclaim requesting the court to decide the requests he had already submitted for the withdrawal of the bench . According to the counterclaim , the landowners had not authorised their lawyer to represent them in the proceedings and their claim was time - barred . Furthermore , the loan agreements were fictitious and their conclusion with CARDINAL of the landowners could not have a bearing on the sales contract of the fuel tanks and installations . The applicant argued that a number of factors pointed to his having lawful property rights over the fuel tanks and installations , such as the fact that all the agreements and contracts were lawful and valid , the property had been registered in his name , he had represented the landowners in the domestic proceedings and he had taken legal action to defend their interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the agreements and contracts null and void ( absolute nullity ) . It found them to be fictitious on the grounds that they had been concluded at a time when the said property in question was being administered by the ORG , no property rights having been transferred to the landowners . In accordance with the law , the installations had been privatised at no cost , because their value was PERCENT of the land \u2019s value . Furthermore , no joint company had been set up by the applicant and landowners and no money had been lent to the applicant in accordance with the loan agreements . They had been concluded with a view to having an assurance for the execution of the sales contract , in which the sale price was the same . Despite the property certificate ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , the fact that no actions had been effected pursuant to the agreements and contracts and that no legal consequences had resulted for the parties , ORG concluded that the agreements were fictitious in accordance with LAW . It further ordered that the entry of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in the immovable property register be erased .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the ORG bench was biased because disciplinary proceedings had been instituted for the dismissal of the presiding judge of the bench for breaches of law . In this connection , the withdrawal of the presiding judge of the bench had not been accepted by the President of ORG and his CARDINAL requests for the withdrawal of the bench were rejected , no such mention having been made in the hearing records . The applicant further submitted that the claim had been brought outside the statutory time - limit , and had been signed by only the lawyer and not the landowners , the power of attorney dating back to DATE and being limited in time and scope , and that the facts of the claim were unrelated . He also objected to the fact that his counterclaims of CARDINAL DATE and DATE had not been admitted to the case - file . Moreover , he contended that ORG had not accepted any of the CARDINAL requests for pieces of evidence he had produced , and had made findings in excess of the requests contained in the object of the claim . He argued that CARDINAL hearings had been held DATE and DATE , without the landowners providing any good reason for their non - appearance to supplement the claim . In his view , his spouse , who was a co - owner , should have been invited to attend the hearings . Finally , he claimed that the contracts had been concluded in complete conformity with the domestic law and that there had been no need to summon witnesses . In this connection , the landowners had confirmed the applicant \u2019s ownership of the plot of land by way of specific powers of attorney , while the applicant had lodged numerous procedural requests , applications and appeals and had attended hearings to defend his and their property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the bench in the light of the previous decisions given against him . On the same date he requested that CARDINAL items of evidence and CARDINAL procedural requests absent from the case - file before ORG be readmitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that CARDINAL additional items of evidence be admitted to the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy President of ORG requested PERSON to appoint CARDINAL judges from other appellate courts to hear the case , since all of its judges had sat in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG , following a decision taken by ORG ( \u201c HCJ \u201d ) , informed ORG that CARDINAL judges of ORG would hear the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the new composition of the bench , submitting that the HCJ should appoint judges from other ordinary appellate courts instead of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges , upheld ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It transpires that the applicant had withdrawn the request for the exemption of the bench from hearing the case , and that the court had partially reopened the judicial examination and accepted new items of evidence as produced by him . ORG held that the objects mentioned in the agreements and contracts of DATE were , at the time of the judgment , being administered by the ORG and that their ownership had not yet been transferred to the landowners . Consequently , those contracts and agreements were fictitious under LAW ) of LAW and were of no legal effect . It rejected all of the applicant \u2019s arguments as unfounded and held that he had failed to adduce evidence to object to or challenge the NORP claim , which was supported by the documents contained in the case - file . According to ORG , a claim requesting absolute nullity was not subject to a statutory limitation period .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge of the bench , judge ORG , dissented . In a separate opinion , he stated that the claim had not been signed by the landowners . The evidence in the case - file was not capable of demonstrating that the agreements were fictitious , since the parties\u2019 intentions had been real and lawful . As a result , the landowners did not have legal standing to bring the claim as they could not prove that there had been a breach of a substantial right ( e drejta materiale ) . Their claim was time - barred and the courts had failed to take into account the statutory limitation period . The evidence produced by the applicant showed that the landowners , by virtue of powers of attorney or other documents issued DATE , had appointed the applicant to act as their representative . This pointed to the fact that the parties had wished their transactions to have legal effect and this , in itself , contradicted the fictitious nature of the agreements and contracts . In his view , the court had rejected all of the applicant \u2019s requests without giving any reasons in the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , raising CARDINAL grounds of appeal . In addition to maintaining the same complaints he had raised before ORG , he alleged that the composition of ORG had not been drawn by lots and that ORG had not been a \u201c tribunal established by law \u201d as it had been composed of military judges . He claimed that his requests for the withdrawal of ORG judges had not been examined and that his requests for the admission of numerous items of evidence had not been processed by ORG . He further objected to the lower courts\u2019 application and interpretation of the domestic law since , in his view , he had been authorised by the landowners to act as their representative , had lodged various appeals and other procedural requests and followed the judicial proceedings with the landowners , had requested the enforcement of final decisions on his and the NORP behalf and had sought the criminal prosecution of third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to stay execution of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE pending the outcome of the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible in accordance with LAW ( no valid grounds of appeal ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an CARDINAL page constitutional appeal . On DATE he supplemented it with a CARDINAL - page memorandum . In addition to maintaining the same grounds of appeal he had raised before the lower courts , the applicant also complained of a lack of reasoning in ORG decision and about the length of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that judges ORG and ORG withdraw from the appeal on the grounds that they had rejected a previous constitutional appeal lodged by him on DATE in relation to another unrelated set of proceedings . On DATE he requested that judge V.T withdraw from the appeal on the grounds that she had been on the bench that had decided against him in another appeal in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE rejecting his appeal . It found nothing to suggest a lack of impartiality on the part of ORG bench and that , even though some of the judges had heard previous appeals lodged by the applicant with ORG , those appeals concerned different facts , parties and sets of proceedings . It dismissed the remaining complaints , finding that they related to the assessment of facts and the outcome of the proceedings , which was within the lower courts\u2019 jurisdiction ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
