Several times during the proceedings ORG had to wait for the case file to be returned by ORG in GPE , where it had been sent for the examination of the appeals submitted by the applicant and his co - accused against ORG refusals to release them on bail .

On DATE the court ordered the applicant \u2019s temporary admission to hospital and adjourned the hearing . The parties disagreed over the reasons for this adjournment . The applicant submits that the absence of several witnesses was decisive , whereas the Government maintain that the only reason was the applicant \u2019s state of health , as the medical experts considered that he was not well enough to participate in the hearing .", "CARDINAL .

ORG refusal to release the applicant was confirmed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW detention on remand was mandatory for everyone accused of a crime punishable by DATE imprisonment , the only exception being where it was clear beyond doubt that there was no danger of the accused \u2019s absconding or re - offending . In ORG view such would only be the case where , for example , the accused was seriously ill , elderly or in any other condition which excluded the danger of his or her absconding or re - offending . Since the applicant was charged with a crime punishable by more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment and as no special circumstances excluding the danger of his absconding or re - offending had been established , there were no grounds for ordering his release on bail . ORG referred to its practice on the matter .", "ORG further refused to consider the applicant \u2019s contention that the evidence against him was weak . It found that it had no jurisdiction to do so in connection with a bail application . Its only task was to examine whether the conditions for detention on remand under LAW had been met .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again applied for his release on bail on DATE . That application was dismissed by ORG on DATE . On appeal , ORG refusal to release the applicant was upheld by ORG sitting in private on DATE , upon receipt of the prosecutor \u2019s observations which had not been communicated to the applicant . ORG stated that the applicant could only be released if there existed unequivocal evidence establishing beyond all doubt that there was no danger of his absconding , re - offending or obstructing the investigation . However , no such evidence was available in the applicant \u2019s case .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request , submitted on an unspecified date , to annul or revise its previous decision concerning his detention on remand . Addressing the applicant \u2019s argument that the material in the case indicated that he had not committed a crime , the court stated that it was not open to it to analyse the evidence in the criminal proceedings . The lawfulness of the detention was to be gauged on the basis of the accusation against the applicant . The only other element to be examined was whether or not there existed exceptional circumstances demonstrating beyond all doubt that there was not even a hypothetical danger of his absconding , re - offending or obstructing the investigation . However the court had already found that no such circumstances existed .", "CARDINAL . A further request for release on bail , submitted on DATE , was refused by ORG on DATE as there had been no change in the circumstances .", "At the hearing on DATE before ORG the applicant made an oral request for release . This was refused that DATE . The court stated that there had been no change of circumstances and that the law did not lay down a time - limit for detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal to ORG against the decision of DATE . DATE , on DATE , the applicant also appealed in person . The appeals were submitted through ORG , in accordance with the established practice . The grounds for appeal were , inter alia , that all evidence in the criminal case had already been examined and that therefore there was no danger of the applicant \u2019s perverting the course of justice . Furthermore , there was no danger of his absconding , as he had been abroad when the investigation had started and had returned voluntarily . He had never been convicted of a criminal offence , had a family and a permanent residence . The applicant also stated that the length of his detention violated the ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE delivered in private ORG , before transmitting the appeals of CARDINAL and DATE to ORG , confirmed its refusal of DATE to release the applicant . ORG stated inter alia that the applicant \u2019s arguments could not , under the settled practice of ORG , serve as a basis for a decision to release him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeals of CARDINAL and DATE were transmitted to ORG on DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged a further appeal against ORG refusal to release him . It was joined to the CARDINAL earlier appeals .", "DATE . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG lodged written submissions on the appeals with ORG , inviting it to dismiss them . The submissions were not communicated to the applicant .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals . It found that under LAW the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was justified and that the case before it did not come within the exception provided by LAW .", "The court also stated that the length of the proceedings and the question whether the accusations were well - founded were irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further application for release on bail . At that time he was on hunger strike which he had commenced on DATE to protest against his continuing detention on remand .", "The presiding judge noted on DATE that the court could not hear the appeal as CARDINAL of the lay judges had been taken ill .", "At the hearing of CARDINAL and DATE the applicant renewed his application .", "ORG heard medical experts who had examined the applicant and it dismissed his application of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers lodged an appeal against the decision of DATE .", "On DATE , before transmitting the appeal to ORG , ORG sitting in private confirmed its decision of DATE .

On DATE the appeal was transmitted to ORG .", "On DATE a prosecutor of ORG submitted written observations to ORG , inviting it to dismiss the appeal . The comments were not communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sitting in private dismissed the appeal . It stated , inter alia , that the danger of absconding , re - offending and perverting the course of justice was presumed in view of the gravity of the crime with which the applicant was charged . The applicant \u2019s health problems , which could be dealt with at the place of detention , and the length of his detention despite its inevitable negative consequences did not affect that finding . The court further considered that the applicant \u2019s complaints under the Convention were unfounded . In particular , the applicant was wrong to consider that certain provisions of LAW were contrary to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has stated that it is not open to the courts , when examining an appeal against detention on remand , to inquire whether there exists sufficient evidence to support the charges against the detainee .
