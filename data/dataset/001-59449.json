The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , is a retired ski instructor and mountain guide living in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( ORG ) consulted the case file of the financial manager , P. It was noted that DATE the applicant had made investments with P. and his companies . However , these amounts had not been declared in the taxation periods between PERSON and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In view of this , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Bezirkssteuerkommission ) instituted tax - evasion proceedings ( PERSON ) in respect of the applicant \u2019s federal taxes . He was requested to submit all the documents which he had concerning these companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant admitted that he had \u201c in fact made investments with P. and his companies from DATE and that he had not properly declared the income in his personal tax return \u201d . However , the applicant did not submit the requested documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again asked to declare the source of the income , amounting to MONEY ( CHF ) , which he had invested with P. The applicant did not reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to issue an assessment to supplementary tax ( ORG ) on the interest derived from the income which the applicant had invested with P. in DATE . In letters dated DATE and DATE , the applicant was informed of the assessment of his taxes ( NORP ) and of the supplementary tax due .", "CARDINAL . Following an intervention of ORG , the President of ORG withdrew the supplementary tax decision in CARDINAL letters dated DATE and DATE . At the same time the President again requested the applicant to explain the source of the invested income . A further such request was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant not having reacted to any of these requests , ORG kantonale PERSON die direkte PERSON ) imposed on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE a disciplinary fine ( GPE ) of CHF MONEY . It relied on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decree of ORG on the imposition of a direct federal tax ( Bundesratsbeschluss \u00fcber die Erhebung einer direkten PERSON ) . The applicant duly paid the fine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG again admonished the applicant as he still had not submitted the required information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant replied that , in his view , the decision to impose supplementary taxes on him had acquired legal force ( Rechtskraft ) on DATE and DATE , so that he was not obliged to provide further information .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , on CARDINAL DATE ORG imposed a second disciplinary fine , of CHF MONEY , on the applicant in respect of federal taxes , based on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decree of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG imposed a third disciplinary fine , of CHF MONEY , in respect of cantonal taxes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the second disciplinary fine , imposed on DATE , was dismissed by ORG ( Steuerrekurskommission ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision , ORG found that the applicant had intentionally not complied with the order of the tax authorities to provide information . However , according to LAW , persons liable to pay taxes were obliged to cooperate with the tax authorities , in particular to submit accounts , documents and other receipts in their possession which could be of relevance when determining the taxes . Moreover , the decision to impose supplementary taxes on the applicant had not acquired legal force as it had been withdrawn on CARDINAL and DATE by the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an administrative - law appeal with ORG in which he complained , inter alia , LAW that as an accused he should not be obliged to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant also filed an objection against the third disciplinary fine , imposed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , although the proceedings before the competent district court ( LOC ) were suspended pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative - law appeal , the decision being served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG considered it undisputed that the applicant had made investments with ORG and his companies which he , the applicant , had not declared . The tax authorities had not been in a position to assume that the means invested stemmed from income and assets which had already been taxed . They had therefore quite correctly asked the applicant to demonstrate the source of these moneys .", "CARDINAL . ORG then recapitulated the relevant case - law . Tax - evasion proceedings constituted true criminal proceedings in respect of which the procedural guarantees , including those of LAW , applied . Thus , the offence of tax evasion led to a fine which had to be paid in addition to the taxes evaded . The fine constituted a sanction which had both preventive and repressive functions ; its amount was CARDINAL times the amount of the taxes evaded and it had the same effect for the person concerned as a criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , in ORG opinion the obligation to pay a supplementary tax did not amount to a criminal sanction . The supplementary tax was not separate in nature from the original tax debt ; rather , it was an additional tax resulting from an examination of the tax assessment of the person concerned and serving to bring in outstanding taxes . As such , it had no punitive function . The judgment continued :", "\u201c even though the supplementary tax is not a criminal sanction within the meaning of LAW , the tax will be determined in tax - evasion proceedings in respect of which the guarantees of criminal procedure will apply . The question thus arises whether the person who has to pay taxes may be obliged , in the tax - evasion proceedings and with a view to the determination of the supplementary tax , to supply information on his financial circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then reiterated the principle of tax proceedings , according to which the burden of proof fell on the tax authorities to demonstrate that a person had not declared certain taxable income . It could not be said that the person concerned was obliged to incriminate himself . Rather , the person had merely to provide information as to the source of untaxed income which the tax authorities already knew existed . If in such a situation the person concerned had the right to remain silent , the entire tax system would be called into question . The regular tax - assessment proceedings would then have to be conducted according to the principles of criminal proceedings . The right to remain silent would complicate control , or even render it impossible . This could not be the purpose of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , there were a number of provisions in criminal law obliging a person to act in a particular way so as to enable the authorities to obtain his conviction . Reference was made in particular to lorries which had to be equipped with a tachograph recording speed and driving TIME . If there was an accident , the lorry driver was obliged to hand over the device . Similarly , a motorist might be obliged to submit to a blood or a urine test , and he would be punished if he refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted an essential difference from PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , namely , that in that case the tax authorities believed that certain documents existed although they were not certain of the fact . In the present case , the authorities were aware of the income which the applicant had invested . The purpose of their intervention was to ascertain whether this income itself stemmed from income or assets which had been duly taxed . All the applicant had to do was to explain the source of this income . In fact , he should have done so during the regular tax - assessment proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG referred to ORG v. GPE , according to which presumptions of fact and law were compatible with LAW as long as they were confined within reasonable limits and the rights of the defence were maintained ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . TIME , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that there was no breach of the applicant \u2019s right to the presumption of innocence or of his right not to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the cantonal authorities imposed a fourth fine , of CHF MONEY , on the applicant , although this fine never acquired legal force .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG decision of DATE , an agreement was reached between the applicant and the cantonal tax authorities on CARDINAL DATE which closed all tax and criminal tax proceedings for DATE until DATE . On the one hand , the agreement fixed the amount to be paid by the applicant , namely a total sum of CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , including a fine amounting , after reduction by CARDINAL , to CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . On the other hand , it was agreed that all pending proceedings were cancelled , including the proceedings concerning disciplinary fines ; and that the fine already paid was to be deducted from the total amount of taxes and criminal penalties . Finally , the agreement stated :", "\u201c ... the proceedings which are already pending before the GPE organs of ORG against the decision of ORG on account of a disciplinary fine will not be affected by this agreement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Supplementary - tax proceedings ( Nachsteuerverfahren ) serve the purpose of imposing a supplementary tax ( ORG ) where certain taxes have not been duly paid . Tax - evasion proceedings ( PERSON ) may lead , in addition to the supplementary tax , to a fine the amount of which will depend on the amount of the tax evaded .", "CARDINAL . ORG decree of DATE on the imposition of a direct federal tax in force at the relevant time referred in its Part CARDINAL to \u201c contraventions \u201d ( Widerhandlungen ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL in Part CARDINAL concerned \u201c tax evasion \u201d and provided for liability to a fine . For instance , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL concerned persons who evaded taxes by not filling in the tax return correctly . Article CARDINAL bis concerned \u201c tax and inventory fraud \u201d ( Steuer- und Inventarbetrug ) and provided for liability to a fine or to imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decree stated :", "\u201c A person ... liable to pay taxes or to give information who contravenes , intentionally or negligently , the official decisions and orders made pursuant to this Decree , in particular as to :", "\u2013 handing in a tax return ;", "\u2013 submitting or presenting accounts , preparing or submitting vouchers and other receipts ;", "\u2013 complying with a summons or a prohibition to act ;", "\u2013 giving information ; or", "\u2013 making payments and furnishing securities ;", "will be fined MONEY .
