CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the Managing Director of the company ORG and in that capacity he obtained a number of loans from PERSON . Each time a loan was agreed , both parties entered into a written agreement which provided that the loan would become payable to Dr GPE with PERCENT interest at DATE . Each time the applicant received a loan , he issued a personal post - dated cheque in Dr LOC \u2019s favour for the sum due at the end of DATE period . The amount included both the capital and the interest . When the various cheques became payable , PERSON did not cash them , but instead , entered into new agreements with the applicant whereby the sums due were referred to as \u201c capital loaned \u201d , again attracting PERCENT interest . The old agreements and cheques were cancelled by the new agreements .", "In DATE , the parties decided to merge the numerous agreements and , when all sums fell due , they were added together to form the basis of CARDINAL further agreements : the first , dated DATE , showed the capital at QUANTITY ( ORG ) . The second , dated DATE , showed the capital at CARDINAL ORG . The new agreements provided for the reimbursement of the capital , plus interest at PERCENT , at DATE and were supported by CARDINAL new post - dated personal cheques of the applicant . These cheques were presented to the applicant \u2019s bank and were both dishonoured . On DATE , PERSON filed a private prosecution before ORG of GPE against the applicant pursuant to LAW of FAC .", "At the material time in DATE , a criminal offence was deemed to have been committed under Section CARDINAL(A)CARDINAL where a cheque was dishonoured due to a lack of funds in the drawer \u2019s bank account . LAW provided that no offence was committed if the bearer of the cheque had no \u201c actionable right \u201d against the drawer .", "On DATE ORG of GPE acquitted the applicant . In particular , it accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that subsection CARDINAL of Section CARDINAL(A ) applied in the case since the agreements under which the cheques were issued were illegal under NORP law ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Contract Law Cap.CARDINAL ) . In fact , PERSON had charged interest above PERCENT per year allowed by law , namely PERCENT ( PERCENT DATE ) . This being so , Dr LOC had no right of action against the applicant .", "On DATE PERSON appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and convicted the applicant , sentencing him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . ORG held that ORG had misinterpreted LAW . According to ORG , the correct meaning of that provision was that \u201c the cheque must have the necessary characteristics of a cheque as these are referred to in ORG Law \u201d , \u201c the complainant must be the legal bearer of the cheque \u201d and the trial court should not have examined the civil aspect of the agreement between the parties which led to the issue of the post - dated cheques .", "Following that decision , ORG passed a retroactive amendment to LAW ) , which came into force on DATE . The amendment provided that Section CARDINAL(A ) did not apply to any cheques which were issued under an illegal transaction . Furthermore , it provided that the amending PERSON was to apply to all pending cases .", "Since the applicant \u2019s case was still pending , as regards the imposition of sentence , the issue was raised before ORG on DATE . The applicant applied for a halt to the judgment , pursuant to LAW of LAW . On DATE ORG held that the amending law did not apply to the applicant \u2019s case .", "The applicant served DATE of the sentence and was released after a pardon .", "Section CARDINAL(A)CARDINAL of LAW provides that a person is guilty of a criminal offence carrying a sentence of imprisonment not DATE , if he draws a cheque , which on being presented to the issuing bank within a reasonable time from the date on which it becomes payable , it is not discharged owing to the lack of available funds of its drawer and the latter fails to discharge payment within DATE as from the time he acquires knowledge of that fact .", "Section CARDINAL states that the provisions of Section CARDINAL(A)CARDINAL are not applicable with regard to any cheque on which no actionable right ensues against its drawer .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Contract Law Cap.CARDINAL provides that \u201c an agreement made without consideration is void ... \u201d . In the case of Loizou v. ORG , judgment of DATE ) , the defendant raised before the first instance court the defence of LAW , claiming inter alia that the complainant had no right of action against him because the agreement under which the cheque was issued was made without consideration . The court examined the contract between the parties and decided that , on the facts of the case , consideration was given and therefore the contract between the parties was valid and enforceable , giving rise to a right of action . Consequently , the defence failed and the defendant was convicted . The same question was raised on appeal and ORG found that the first instance court examined this matter extensively and that it correctly concluded that consideration was given for the issuing of the relevant cheque . After referring to the facts relating to this matter ORG added the following : \u201c We also note that the relevant provision refers to an \u201c actionable right \u201d , and not to a good basis or arguable action . We are therefore of the view that the judgment of the first instance court is impeccable and the appeal against conviction is rejected \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL of the Contract Law Cap.CARDINAL provides that \u201c if the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it or to rescind or alter it , the original contract need not be performed \u201d . In the case of ORG and ORG v. the Police ( ORG , judgment of DATE ) , the defendant claimed under LAW that the contract under which the cheque was issued had been rescinded and that the parties had entered into a new contract . He contended that since the cheque was issued under the first contract which was rendered unenforceable by virtue of the new one , no right of action existed against him under the former . ORG examined the first contract and , having found that it was indeed rescinded and replaced , upheld the defence under Section CARDINAL(A)CARDINAL and acquitted the defendant . No right of action existed under the first contract ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
