NORP The applicant , Ms Concetta Schembri , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Dr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG were represented by their Agent , Dr PERSON , Attorney General .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a NORP citizen of NORP origin , arrived irregularly in GPE by boat and was detained under the applicable immigration laws . While in detention , GPE , the applicant \u2019s brother , who worked with the detention services .", "CARDINAL . Following his release from detention in DATE , PERSON maintained contact with C. and started carrying out some maintenance work in the latter \u2019s house . S. eventually started living in that house in DATE and met the applicant , with whom he started a relationship . It appears that for some time the applicant also lived there while renovation work was being carried out in her own place . DATE wanted to marry the applicant , but she did not agree . According to the Government , the applicant and PERSON had only gone out together once and PERSON spoke little LANGUAGE ; however , during the domestic proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) , the applicant stated that she had originally got to know S. online and that after they had met they had sometimes gone out together \u2013 when asked whether their outings had been romantic she replied that they had been normal outings .", "CARDINAL . After some time , in DATE , once his asylum application ( at first instance ) had been rejected , PERSON entered GPE unlawfully and went to GPE . According to the applicant \u2019s testimony PERSON contacted the applicant around DATE by phone and the CARDINAL remained in contact via telephone calls around twice a week . An appeal against the asylum decision was never examined since PERSON could not be traced .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant went to GPE on holiday and met PERSON again ; she then prolonged her stay . In DATE her brother and the latter \u2019s daughter joined them and on that occasion the applicant and PERSON decided to get married . According to the applicant she lived with PERSON for some time and then returned to GPE for DATE to GPE in DATE . The Government submitted that there was no evidence of their cohabitation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married PERSON , who was DATE her junior , under the regime of separation of estates . The rest of the applicant \u2019s family ( save for C. ) was not informed . They married in GPE , GPE and their marriage was registered in ORG in DATE , given that CARDINAL of the spouses was a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . According to a declaration by CARDINAL NORP lawyers ( who had assisted the applicant ) dated DATE , to their knowledge the applicant and PERSON lived together before and after their marriage until they went abroad .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and PERSON went to the NORP embassy in GPE in order to apply for a visa for S. He was interviewed in that connection . According to the applicant , following the interview S. was informed verbally that he would not be granted a visa to enter GPE . No written decision was issued nor was he informed about any possibility of appeal . The applicant alleged that it had been suggested to PERSON that he go back to GPE wherefrom he could apply for an entry visa . The embassy denied this ( during the domestic proceedings ) , their position being that his visa had been refused because during the interview it transpired that PERSON had been lying , in particular concerning the status of his stay in GPE and the means by which he had entered GPE , and his means of subsistence . In her testimony the Consul stated that she had consulted ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and submitted a report to this effect , and subsequently , on an unspecified date , a letter had been sent to PERSON rejecting his application .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant went back to GPE to ask for a review of the decision taken by the embassy and to try to obtain a visa for her husband through ORG in GPE . She was informed that she had to write a letter to ORG outlining her request . She followed this instruction on DATE and then returned to GPE on DATE . She continued communicating with ORG , but no decision was communicated to her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE returned to GPE to try and obtain an entry visa from there . However , the NORP embassy in GPE could not provide assistance .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime the applicant had returned to GPE and continued pursuing the application for an entry visa from there . She was sent from CARDINAL office to another to no avail . On an unspecified date , at a meeting with GPE and PERSON ( CARDINAL employees of ORG ) , the applicant , who referred to having met S. online , was told that if the visa were to be issued she would have to give personal guarantees with regard to the financial support of her husband . She accepted that responsibility . No attempts were made to contact PERSON and no decision ensued .", "CARDINAL . It appeared that an internal board had started to investigate the applicant \u2019s complaint . It also transpired that the authorities suspected that the applicant \u2019s marriage to PERSON had been one of convenience , which was why a visa would not be issued . Moreover , it appeared that PERSON \u2019s intention was to stay in GPE . ORG submitted their conclusions to the department of Citizenship but no decision had been formally issued by the time the proceedings hereinafter mentioned were instituted . In any event , according to the applicant , the law did not appear to provide for a possibility to appeal against any such decision ( unless it had been taken by ORG , which did not appear to be so in the present case ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that the refusal to issue her husband a visa had been unlawful and had constituted a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court heard evidence from a number of witnesses including the applicant ( who reiterated the facts as mentioned above ) , but not PERSON , who did not testify .", "CARDINAL . J.M. , the director of ORG , stated that PERSON was an exempt person but that his status had not yet been confirmed . He explained that exempt status was an inherent right of a spouse of a NORP citizen , unless the spouses did not live together or if there had been an order by the Minister responsible . He explained that he had been in contact with ORG and the embassy in GPE and that his role was to ensure that the legislation was not abused , particularly in the light of marriages of convenience , which were not rare and which could be detected through an ORG which gave pointers on identifying such situations . He further testified that even with exempt - person status an individual could not automatically enter the country and a visa was still required . PERSON noted that the exempt - person status of PERSON had never been confirmed . At the same time he also stated that there was no application to be lodged , since an individual should not have to apply for something which belonged to him or her by right . He explained that there was an enquiry form requiring details of the exempt person and when this was filled in , a letter confirming the status would be sent out . However , PERSON stated that this was simply a formality because the exempt - person status was acquired as soon as the marriage was contracted . S. had never filled in this form , as he had never entered GPE following his marriage . Nevertheless , PERSON testified that an informal request had been made by the applicant , who had been accompanied by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . M.S. , another employee of ORG , stated that PERSON \u2019s visa application had been refused but that there was a right of appeal \u2013 he later stated that it was not an appeal but a review or reconsideration . He declared that ORG had reviewed the case and decided that the application should be refused because there had been a suspicion that it had been a marriage of convenience . PERSON explained that the file had been sent to ORG and that the case had not yet been concluded , and no decision letter had been sent out .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the ORG \u2019s objection as to non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies . It considered that the reconsideration procedure as undertaken by ORG in the present case could not be considered an effective remedy \u2013 it had taken too long , despite ORG having had all the relevant information from the NORP embassy in GPE . Indeed ORG had had no reason to prolong issuing a decision , to the extent that it was never rendered . Furthermore , the procedure eventually came to a halt with the institution of the constitutional redress proceedings . Moreover , such a remedy was not independent of ORG since it was decided upon by the same unit . It followed that , having regard to the totality of the procedure and its ineffectiveness , the court had to exercise its constitutional competence to assess the merits of the complaint .", "CARDINAL . It also held that the applicant had had a juridical interest in lodging the complaint in her name , since her complaint was that as a result of the impugned actions or omissions , her own family life was being violated .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the merits , the court referred to the testimonies of the applicant , PERSON and PERSON and that the latter officials considered that PERSON needed a visa in order to enter GPE . This would have enabled him to apply for a residence permit and to travel in the LOC area .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the couple had never cohabited in GPE , and that the applicant had never had the intention to marry PERSON when he had been in GPE . Referring to general principles of the ORG \u2019s case - law , it considered that the couple had never envisaged having a family life together , and why the applicant had changed her mind and decided to marry PERSON in GPE was a mystery . The court was not convinced that the applicant \u2019s decision to marry had been genuine \u2013 not once in her testimony had she declared her love for her husband , nor had she in the slightest touched on the level of intimacy she had with her husband , who was DATE her junior ; neither had she given an explanation about her change of mind , nor why she had not wanted to follow her husband to GPE . She had also admitted that she had not been living with her husband as he had been in GPE , thus implicitly admitting that she had been de facto separated . Thus , S. could not have expected to obtain exempt status , nor could it be said that there had been family life in the present case , and the authorities had simply applied the law . Furthermore , S. had shown a total disregard for the proceedings , having chosen not to submit any written testimony corroborating the applicant \u2019s statements or challenging those of the authorities . The court considered that it was not for it to decide whether there had been a marriage of convenience ; it sufficed to find that the authorities refusal to issue PERSON with a visa had not breached LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . It considered that when they had been in GPE the applicant and PERSON had not formed a family , and their encounters had been rather ambiguous , tenuous and lacking any commitment towards each other . The same appeared to be the case of their life in GPE . While it was true that they had married there , the only commitment undertaken appeared to have been for S. to acquire a visa . ORG pointed out that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law it was only genuine marriages undertaken according to law which were protected by LAW . While ORG was ready to accept that the marriage had been contracted according to law , it had to address the ORG \u2019s argument as to whether the marriage had been a genuine one .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant had been aware of the precarious situation PERSON had been in ( since he had been a third country national , thus requiring a visa to enter GPE ) despite her claim that he had not required a visa . Nevertheless , PERSON had never instituted an ordinary remedy to challenge the refusal . It could not be ignored that the applicant had refused to marry PERSON when they had been in GPE , and had only changed her mind in GPE after DATE and despite the age difference between them . Their cohabitation in GPE had been temporary and they could not have aspired to making it permanent owing to a variety of reasons , specifically S. \u2019s irregular status in GPE , the applicant \u2019s refusal to follow him to GPE ( which she had not proved would have been problematic ) , and the visa refusals by the NORP authorities . Furthermore , the court was struck by the lack of commitment towards , and interest in the proceedings by PERSON , who had not even bothered to submit written testimony , or at least to attempt to send a letter or make use of letters of request or other means which were available to persons not on the territory of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . All the above led ORG to conclude that there had been no family life , within the meaning of LAW , in the present case and that therefore there had been no breach of the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . Part IV of LAW deals with \u201c LAW \u201d and requires all , except those with a right of entry and residence according to the provisions of the LAW , to obtain permission to enter GPE from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Part II of the LAW concerning \u201c FAC \u201d provides that Part LAW does not apply to exempt persons . The relevant provision , namely LAW ) reads as follows :", "\u201c The provisions of Part IV of this Act shall not apply to any person -", "( a ) who is a citizen of GPE ; or", "...", "( g ) who is the spouse of any person referred to in any of the foregoing paragraphs and is still married to and living with that person ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Act as applicable at the time of the present case provided , in its LAW ) , for a review of a decision only in limited circumstances . It read as follows :", "\u201c Any person aggrieved by any decision of the competent authority under any regulations made under Part III , or in virtue of article CARDINAL , article DATE or article CARDINAL may enter an appeal against such decision and the ORG shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of comprehending the above , Part III of the Act concerns special provisions connected to ORG , Article CARDINAL concerns residence permits , LAW concerns removal orders and LAW concerns carriers . It follows that visas , which are dealt with in LAW ) of the LAW are in theory excluded from any available review according to this provision .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , Regulation CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL provided , amongst its miscellaneous provisions , that \u201c Any person aggrieved by any decision of ORG may appeal to the [ ORG as provided for in article CARDINALA(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The time limit of such an appeal was DATE , eventually extended DATE by LAW of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .
