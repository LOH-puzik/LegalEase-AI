The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE ) . On DATE he married a woman with whom he had CARDINAL children , a boy and a girl , born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left the household , the children remaining with their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife introduced a petition for legal separation from the applicant . She sought , inter alia , custody of the children , to which the applicant did not disagree .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife were legally separated . The judge ( batlle ) reviewing the petition at first instance ( \u201c the separation judge \u201d ) granted custody of the children to their mother and set up a contact schedule governing the applicant \u2019s contact with his children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the course of proceedings for the adoption of interim measures , the separation judge granted a motion made by the applicant \u2019s wife to immediately and provisionally suspend the contact schedule until the production of a psychological report by an impartial expert . In taking this decision , the separation judge relied on : several criminal claims introduced by the applicant \u2019s wife against the applicant that suggested extremely troubled relations between the parents that were negatively affecting their children ; a psychological report submitted by the applicant \u2019s wife , according to which the troubled relationship between the parents was damaging the mental stability of their son ; and a brief submitted by the public prosecutor , in which he proposed conducting a psychological test on both children before giving the applicant access to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the separation judge confirmed his previous decision of DATE . The judge relied on a psychological report issued by an impartial expert at his request and on the brief submitted by the public prosecutor in concluding that the contact schedule should remain suspended . The applicant was nonetheless allowed to maintain telephone contact with his children and his wife was warned that she had to facilitate this contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife filed a petition for divorce . She also sought custody of the children and that , pending the conclusion of the divorce proceedings , the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment remain suspended . For his part , the applicant agreed with the petition for divorce but also sought custody of the children . He also applied for an interim order restoring the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment in respect of his daughter and establishing a contact schedule under the supervision of a judge and professionals appointed for that purpose in respect of his son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the separation judge to have the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment restored in respect of his daughter and a contact schedule operating under the supervision of a judge and professionals appointed for that purpose established in respect of his son . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife opposed the application . On DATE the public prosecutor argued for the restoration of the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge handling the couple \u2019s divorce ( \u201c the divorce judge \u201d ) dismissed both the applicant \u2019s request for interim measures and his wife \u2019s request to have the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment suspended pending the rendition of a judgment of divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the separation judge ruled on the application of DATE . He restored the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment in respect of the applicant \u2019s daughter and appointed a psychologist to carry out a psychotherapeutic examination and , if necessary , individualised treatment of both parents and their son with a view to restoring the contact schedule between father and son . In this connection , the judge instructed both the applicant and his wife to deposit MONEY ( ORG ) each within DATE in security for the cost of the examination . Should the applicant or his wife fail to comply , the judge would order that measures be taken to have the decision enforced .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife appealed against the decision of DATE before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Justice partially reversed the separation judge \u2019s decision . It struck down the appointment of the psychologist but upheld the remainder of the decision . The court stated that , the interim measures having expired , the contact schedule set up by the separation judgment should be restored , without prejudice to the possible interim measures regarding parent - child contact that the divorce judge could order pending the rendition of a judgment of divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the separation judge for enforcement of the decisions of DATE and DATE . The applicant \u2019s wife opposed the application and sought to have the enforcement of those decisions suspended until a judgment of divorce had been delivered . The public prosecutor proposed the suspension of the contact schedule until a psychological examination of both parents and their children had been performed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the separation judge relied on a psychologist \u2019s report dated DATE to provisionally suspend the contact schedule set up by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and appointed a psychologist with a view to its eventual restoration . According to the psychologist \u2019s report , contact between the applicant and the children was not desirable until comprehensive treatment of the children had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision . He sought to have the decision of DATE reversed and that of DATE applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE was still pending , the judgment of divorce was issued . The divorce judge granted custody of the children to their mother and set up a contact schedule governing the applicant \u2019s contact with the children which was to remain suspended pending the decision of a psychologist , who would be appointed by the court upon enforcement of the judgment . The psychologist was to carry out treatment of the children and , if appropriate , the parents , with a view to restoring contact between the children and their father . The judge relied on several psychological reports that advised against immediate contact between son and father and on the son \u2019s testimony , in which he had expressed his desire not to have contact with his father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the divorce judgment , seeking to have it partially reversed . He accepted custody of his son being awarded to his former wife . However , he sought to have the requirement of psychological treatment removed and an award of custody of his daughter in his favour . In the alternative , he requested that a contact schedule conforming to that of the separation judgment be established in respect of his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court of Justice decided upon the appeal submitted by the applicant against the provisional suspension of the contact schedule ordered by the separation judge on DATE . The court stated that since a judgment of divorce had already been delivered , the separation judgment should be set aside and the content of the divorce judgment enforced . Accordingly , ORG expressly deprived the separation judge \u2019s decision of DATE of any effect .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then lodged a request for clarification with ORG . He requested from the court to clarify whether the decision it had delivered on DATE in separation proceedings should be enforced having regard to the fact that the divorce judgment of DATE was not yet final nor enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for clarification . It stated that the applicant \u2019s request had exceeded the scope of a request for clarification of a judgment , and that the judgment in the applicant \u2019s appeal had been clear in any event . It considered he was instead requesting a judicial pronouncement as to the procedural effects of his appeal against the divorce judgment that had set up a contact schedule . This notwithstanding , the court went on to state that pending an appeal with suspensive effect , if this was the case , against a divorce judgment , the content of such a judgment would not be enforceable , but added that previous decisions adopted in separation proceedings would not be enforceable either . In fact , ORG stated :", "\u201c ... the suspensive effect of the appeal ... makes it necessary to await the decision of this ORG before applying the measures established by the judgment appealed against , if that judgment is upheld , or those established by that of this ORG , if the [ divorce ] judgment delivered by the [ first - instance ] judge is reversed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an appeal for the annulment of the proceedings , citing LAW ( the right to court proceedings ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the applicant \u2019s right to court proceedings had not been infringed by the decision of DATE , as the court had arrived at the only possible conclusion in the light of the rules of procedure in force . The relevant procedural rules forbade the enforcement of decisions being appealed against with suspensive effect and of decisions rendered in separation proceedings when a judgment of divorce had already been rendered in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ( recurso d\u2019empara ) with ORG , founding the appeal on his right to court proceedings and to a fair hearing . He contended that the impossibility of enforcing the decision of DATE , already final , while an appeal was still pending in the divorce proceedings , had denied him a fair hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided on the applicant \u2019s appeal against the divorce judgment of DATE . The court dismissed all of the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal , instead upholding the judgment in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal inadmissible as devoid of constitutional content . ORG stated that the decisions of ORG had not been arbitrary and that that court had clearly and logically stated that the legal situation would not be definitely settled until the appeal lodged by the applicant against the judgment of divorce had been decided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a final appeal ( recurso de s\u00faplica ) with ORG , which was dismissed on DATE in a decision served on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
