SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG At the time of the events giving rise to this case , Mr. PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , was a student and resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG During refresher courses ( PERSON ) organised in DATE and DATE as part of ordinary military obligations , he was subjected to CARDINAL and CARDINAL days\u2019 strict arrest for refusing to comply with Article CARDINAL bis of the service regulations , relating to hair - cuts .", "CARDINAL . ORG Shortly before DATE refresher course , the applicant received a registered letter from his unit commander instructing him to report for the course with a regulation hair - cut . He nevertheless presented himself on CARDINAL DATE with his hair longer than authorised and refused to obey the officer \u2019s verbal order to have it cut .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ( auditeur militaire ) drew up a \" bill of indictment \" ( PERSON ) against Mr. PERSON , charging him with repeated insubordination and , subsidiarily , failure to observe service regulations ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , at the close of a public hearing , ORG no . CARDINAL delivered in public a judgment sentencing the applicant to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for the CARDINAL offences .", "Mr. PERSON \u2019s defence counsel had unsuccessfully requested ORG to decline jurisdiction on the ground that it lacked the independence and impartiality required by LAW ; he had also applied , in vain , for a supplementary enquiry into the futility , or indeed abusive nature , of the regulations on hair - cuts .", "A copy of the decision was sent to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Having been duly informed by the grand juge ( President of ORG ) that he could appeal on points of law within TIME from delivery of the judgment , Mr. PERSON had immediately given notice of appeal to the Registrar ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE - \" LAW \" ) .", "On DATE , within the prescribed period of DATE from service of the judgment , the applicant filed a memorial containing a \" final \" statement ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) of his grounds of appeal .", "He submitted that the decision appealed against had infringed the law ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , of LAW ) by applying regulations that were incompatible with LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW ; that ORG had not been composed in the manner prescribed by law ( ibid . , no . CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges being substitutes for the ordinary judges and the grand juge having been appointed by ORG ( auditeur en chef ) ; that ORG had erred in not declining jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits ( ibid . , no . CARDINAL ) , since the military courts were not tribunals within the meaning of LAW ) ; and that the refusal to order a supplementary enquiry had prejudiced the defence on decisive points ( ibid . , no . CARDINAL ) concerning the application of LAW article CARDINAL) and in particular paragraph CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) thereof .", "Mr. PERSON also drew the attention of ORG to the fact that it was not consonant with LAW ) to conduct proceedings entirely in writing ; he therefore requested it to hold CARDINAL hearing and to pronounce its judgment publicly .", "CARDINAL . ORG The grand juge transmitted the appeal to ORG , in his capacity as respondent ; the latter was entitled to \" submit his observations \" within DATE ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) , but chose not to do so .", "The grand juge afterwards sent the appeal and the papers in the case , without appending \" his report on the matters in dispute \" ( ibid . ) , to the Chief Military Prosecutor .", "The latter forwarded the documents to ORG . He could himself have filed observations if he had thought fit , but - like ORG and the grand juge - he confined himself to submitting that the appeal should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG The President of ORG requested a judge whom he had designated from amongst his colleagues to draft a report containing a reasoned proposal . This document was circulated , together with the papers in the case , amongst the other members . On DATE , ORG deliberated on the matter in camera and dismissed the appeal . It thus did not rule on the merits of the case ; according to the provisions then in force ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) , it could have done so only if the judgment had been quashed and the sole ground for the quashing had been misapplication of the law . This power ORG no longer enjoys ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The operative provisions of the judgment were immediately served on Mr. PERSON in writing . He received the full text on DATE ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) . The reasons covered CARDINAL pages and concerned mainly Mr. PERSON \u2019s submissions as to the incompatibility of the DATE Act with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL) of the LAW . As to the composition of ORG , the judgment stated that the substitute judges had the same legal status as the ordinary judges , and that ORG had not infringed the law by appointing the grand juge - who had the status of an ordinary judge - to sit on the case , the ordinary president being unable to take part as he had had to deal with the matter at a previous stage as Military Prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the time of the facts giving rise to the present case , military criminal procedure was governed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As regards the public character of the proceedings , this LAW drew a distinction according to the level of the court concerned .", "ORG , which heard military - law cases at first instance , were required to give their decisions after holding public hearings and to pronounce their judgments in open court .", "On the other hand , proceedings before ORG were conducted entirely in writing and its judgments were not delivered in public . Concerning the latter point , section CARDINAL of the Act laid down merely that \" an extract \" of the judgment had to be communicated to ORG , the accused and the grand juge .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW was repealed by ORG of DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , which entered into force on DATE .", "The existing system was maintained for proceedings before ORG , and was extended to ORG which were set up by the same statute .", "As regards ORG , LAW provides that \" There shall be no oral hearings \" ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . The LAW did , however , make CARDINAL innovations : in future , ORG was to deliver judgment in open court ( sections CARDINAL para . CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) and could in no circumstances itself rule on the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG As was also the case in the past , the judgments of ORG are collected together DATE in a provisional form ( roneotyped ) . Anyone who can establish an interest may consult or obtain a copy of the full text on application to ORG or the military court registries .", "If judgments contain features that are novel or of importance for the interpretation of the law , they are subsequently published in printed form .", "The PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE appeared in DATE in volume CARDINAL ( covering DATE ) of the judgments of ORG , under the number CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
