The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG laid charges of large - scale fraud against the applicant . On DATE the prosecutor ordered his detention on remand in connection with those charges . He also issued a search and arrest warrant in respect of the applicant . Subsequently , on an unspecified date the prosecution received information that the applicant had left GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor stayed the investigation due to the fact that the applicant was abroad . On DATE he issued an international search and arrest warrant for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities extradited the applicant to GPE where he was placed in police custody . On DATE ORG ordered his detention on remand on suspicion of large - scale fraud . His detention was subsequently prolonged on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with large - scale fraud to the detriment of ORG . There were CARDINAL other defendants in the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG held hearings on the following dates : CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of his original trial , the applicant lodged numerous unsuccessful applications for release and appealed DATE likewise unsuccessfully DATE against refusals to lift the detention . In his applications , he argued that his detention was excessive and had , for all practical purposes , amounted to serving a prison sentence . He asked the courts to release him either on bail or under police supervision , or to accept a guarantee from a responsible person or persons who would undertake to ensure his presence at trial , or to order him to surrender his passport , or to subject his release to all those conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court gave judgment . It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and a fine . The court further ordered that the period spent by him in pre - trial detention from DATE up to the date of his conviction be set off against the sentence imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an appeal lodged by the applicant , ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . The subsequent proceedings were conducted only against CARDINAL defendants , including the applicant , as the third defendant had not appealed against the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG joined the proceedings in question to the other set of proceedings . The number of defendants increased to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The retrial was to begin on DATE but was adjourned since CARDINAL of the defendants had to undergo a psychiatric examination . The next hearing scheduled for CARDINAL DATE had to be adjourned due to the illness of a lay judge . ORG held the first retrial hearing on DATE . Subsequent hearings were held on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's application for release on bail or under police supervision , or under guarantee by a responsible person or under the condition that he surrender his passport . The court found that there was a considerable likelihood that he had committed the offence with which he had been charged . The court further noted that the applicant had already been detained on remand for DATE but it considered that , given that he had previously been sought under an international arrest warrant and that he was liable to a severe penalty , there was a real risk that he might obstruct the proper conduct of the trial . In the court 's view , that risk justified his being kept in custody . That decision was upheld on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention pending trial until DATE . The applicant appealed , invoking , inter alia , LAW . He submitted that his right to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial was not respected . He also maintained that his detention was so excessive that it amounted in reality to serving a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested order . Repeating the grounds previously given for the applicant 's detention , the court stressed that he had already evaded justice and an international arrest warrant had had to be issued . It considered that the trial had not progressed because of his conduct . In the court 's opinion , those circumstances clearly indicated that there was a considerable risk that the applicant , if released , might again upset the proper conduct of the proceedings . Lastly , the court noted that he faced an exceptionally heavy sentence , which had already been shown by the severity of the penalty originally imposed at first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an application for release on bail or subject to other guarantees or conditions . The court repeated the grounds previously invoked , attaching particular importance to the fact that he had earlier absconded and had already been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . In view of the severity of the sentence to which he was liable , the court considered that neither bail , nor police supervision nor any other guarantee would secure the proper course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE , repeating the grounds mentioned in the previous decisions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , maintaining , among other things , that there was no legal basis for keeping him in custody and that , pursuant to LAW , his detention could have been prolonged only by ORG because it had exceeded the maximum statutory period of DATE laid down in paragraph CARDINAL of that provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It stressed that both the fact that the applicant had earlier evaded justice and the nature of his , in the court 's words , \u201c criminal relations \u201d with certain witnesses involved in the case , indicated that detention was the only preventive measure which would effectively secure the proper course of the trial . As regards the legal basis for his detention , the court pointed out DATE as had already been mentioned in the previous detention decisions DATE his detention continued on the grounds listed in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the DATE Code as there was a risk that he might obstruct the proper course of the trial and a heavy penalty was likely to be imposed on him . Lastly , as to the question of which court was competent to prolong his detention , ORG stated that the applicant had misconstrued Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 QUANTITY CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Code . That provision , the court added , indeed imposed a statutory time - limit of DATE on pre - trial detention and laid down that only ORG could prolong it beyond that term . However , that rule applied only as long as there had been no conviction at first instance . Since the applicant had already been convicted at first instance , no time - limit for detention applied to his case , even though his original conviction had subsequently been quashed on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a further application for release filed by the applicant in DATE . It reiterated the grounds invoked in the previous detention decisions and added that , in the light of the material before it , there was a considerable likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's subsequent application for release . It recalled that it had already ruled on numerous occasions on his detention . Noting that the applicant had not adduced any new relevant circumstances , the court found it unnecessary to address his arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It considered that the material gathered in the case justified the opinion that the applicant had committed the offence in question . It observed that a severe penalty ( DATE imprisonment ) might be imposed on him . Stressing that the applicant had evaded justice at the initial stage of the proceedings , the court also pointed out that his detention served the purpose of securing the proper conduct of the trial . Furthermore , the court found it necessary to extend his detention until DATE because DATE were approaching , which , for all practical purposes , meant that the examination of the case would be postponed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's further application for release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings conducted against him before the courts in GPE , including the proceedings at issue , be transferred to other courts . On DATE his request was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It reiterated all the grounds previously given for his detention . The applicant 's appeal , based on LAW , was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . Upon the applicant 's appeal , ORG reduced the prolongation to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE . It further held that he could be released if he put up bail of PLN CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision . It ordered that the applicant should be released on condition that he put up bail of ORG MONEY by DATE . ORG further placed the applicant under police supervision and imposed on him a prohibition on leaving the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's release as he had paid the bail . He was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of large - scale fraud and breach of official secrecy . It sentenced him to a cumulative sentence of DATE imprisonment and a fine . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG amended ORG judgment by reducing the applicant 's cumulative sentence to DATE imprisonment . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL .
