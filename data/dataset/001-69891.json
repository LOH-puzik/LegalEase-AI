The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . She arrived in GPE on DATE , aged DATE and DATE , with PERSON , a NORP national of NORP origin . She had a passport and a tourist visa .", "CARDINAL . It had been agreed that she would work at PERSON home until the cost of her air ticket had been reimbursed and that PERSON would attend to her immigration status and find her a place at school . In reality , the applicant became an unpaid housemaid for PERSON and PERSON and her passport was taken from her .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , PERSON lent \u201d the applicant to PERSON and PERSON , who had CARDINAL small children , so that she could assist the pregnant PERSON with household work . PERSON also had another daughter from a first marriage who stayed with her during DATE . The applicant lived at Mr and PERSON home , her father having given his consent .", "CARDINAL . On her return from the maternity hospital , PERSON told the applicant that she had decided to keep her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently became a general housemaid for PERSON and PERSON She worked DATE , without a day off , and was occasionally and exceptionally authorised to go out on DATE to attend mass . Her DATE began at TIME , when she had to get up and prepare breakfast , dress the children , take them to nursery school or their recreational activities , look after the baby , do the housework and wash and iron clothes .", "In TIME she prepared dinner , looked after the older children , did the washing up and went to bed at TIME In addition , she had to clean a studio flat , in the same building , which Mr B. had made into an office .", "The applicant slept on a mattress on the floor in the baby 's room ; she had to look after him if he woke up .", "CARDINAL . She was never paid , except by PERSON mother , who gave her CARDINAL or MONEY ( ORG ) notes .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was able to escape with the help of a NORP national who took her in for DATE . She looked after the latter 's CARDINAL children , was given appropriate accommodation and food , and received FRF CARDINAL per month .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in obedience to her paternal uncle , who had been in contact with Mr and PERSON , she returned to the couple , who had undertaken to put her immigration status in order . However , the situation remained unchanged : the applicant continued to carry out household tasks and look after the couple 's children . She slept on a mattress on the floor of the children 's bedroom , then on a folding bed , and wore second - hand clothes . Her immigration status had still not been regularised , she was not paid and did not attend school .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant managed to recover her passport , which she entrusted to an acquaintance of PERSON and PERSON also confided in a neighbour , who alerted ORG ( Comit\u00e9 contre l'esclavage moderne ) , which in turn filed a complaint with the prosecutor 's office concerning the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police raided Mr and PERSON home .", "CARDINAL . The couple were prosecuted on charges of having obtained from DATE the performance of services without payment or in exchange for payment that was manifestly disproportionate to the work carried out , by taking advantage of that person 's vulnerability or state of dependence ; with having subjected an individual to working and living conditions that were incompatible with human dignity by taking advantage of her vulnerability or state of dependence ; and with having employed and maintained in their service an alien who was not in possession of a work permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance delivered its judgment .", "CARDINAL . It found that the applicant 's vulnerability and dependence in her relationship with Mr and PERSON was proved by the fact that she was unlawfully resident in GPE , was aware of that fact and feared arrest , that PERSON and PERSON nurtured that fear while promising to secure her leave to remain \u2013 a claim that was confirmed by her uncle and her father \u2013 and by the fact that she had no resources , no friends and almost no family to help her .", "CARDINAL . As to the failure to provide any or adequate remuneration , the court noted that it had been established that the young woman had remained with PERSON and PERSON for DATE , was not a member of their family , could not be regarded as a foreign au pair who had to be registered and given free time in order to improve her language skills , was kept busy DATE with housework , did not go to school and was not training for a profession and that , had she not been in their service , PERSON and PERSON would have been obliged to employ another person , given the amount of work created by the presence of CARDINAL children in the home .", "It therefore concluded that the offence laid down in LAW of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) was made out .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also found it established that PERSON and PERSON were employing an alien who was not in possession of a work permit .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the parties had submitted differing accounts concerning the allegations that the working and living conditions were incompatible with human dignity .", "It found that the applicant clearly worked TIME and did not enjoy a day off as such , although she was given permission to attend mass . It noted that a person who remained at home with CARDINAL children necessarily began his or her work TIME and finished TIME , but had moments of respite during DATE ; however , the scale of PERSON involvement in this work had not been established .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that , while it seemed established that employment regulations had not been observed in respect of working hours and rest time , this did not suffice to consider that the working conditions were incompatible with human dignity , which would have implied , for example , a furious pace , frequent insults and harassment , the need for particular physical strength that was disproportionate to the employee 's constitution and having to work in unhealthy LOC , which had not been the case in this instance .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant 's accommodation , the court noted that PERSON and PERSON , who were well - off , had not seen fit to set aside an area for the applicant 's personal use and that , although this situation was regrettable and indicated their lack of consideration for her , her living conditions could not be held to infringe human dignity , given that a number of people , especially in the GPE region , did not have their own rooms . Accommodation which infringed human dignity implied an unhygienic , unheated room , with no possibility of looking after one 's basic hygiene , or LOC which were so far below the applicable norms that occupation would be dangerous .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the court found that the offence laid down in Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) had not been made out .", "Nonetheless , the judges concluded that the offences of which PERSON and PERSON were convicted were incontestably serious and were to be severely punished , particularly as the couple considered that they had treated the applicant quite properly .", "Accordingly , they sentenced them to DATE imprisonment each , of which DATE were suspended , imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ordered them to pay , jointly and severally , FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant in damages . In addition , PERSON and PERSON forfeited their civic , civil and family rights for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave an interlocutory judgment ordering further investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it delivered its judgment on the merits .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the additional investigation had made it possible to confirm that the applicant had arrived in GPE aged DATE and DATE , in possession of a passport and a DATE tourist visa . During the period that she lived with PERSON , from DATE , she had been employed by the latter , firstly , to do housework , cook and look after her child , and , secondly , in the latter 's clothing business , where she also did the cleaning and returned to the rails clothes that customers had tried on , without remuneration .", "CARDINAL . Around DATE the applicant had spent DATE at Mr and PERSON home , shortly before PERSON gave birth to her fourth child . She travelled by underground to PERSON and PERSON home DATE and returned to PERSON house in TIME to sleep .", "CARDINAL . In DATE she was \u201c lent \u201d to PERSON and PERSON , and stayed in their home until DATE , when she left for PERSON home , where she was remunerated for her work and given accommodation . She had returned to PERSON and PERSON in DATE on her uncle 's advice .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that it had been established that the applicant was an illegal immigrant and had not received any real remuneration .", "Further , it noted that it appeared that the applicant was proficient in NORP , which she had learnt in her own country .", "In addition , she had learnt to find her way around GPE in order , initially , to go from PERSON home to the latter 's business LOC , and later to travel to LOC , where PERSON lived , and finally to return to Mr and PERSON home .", "CARDINAL . She had a degree of independence , since she took the children to the locations where their educational and sports activities were held , and subsequently collected them . She was also able to attend a NORP service in a church near PERSON and PERSON home . In addition , she left the house to go shopping , since it was on one of those occasions that she had met PERSON and agreed with her to go to the latter 's home .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further noted that the applicant had had an opportunity to contact her uncle by telephone outside Mr and PERSON home and to pay for calls from a telephone box . She had met her father and her uncle and had never complained about her situation .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , PERSON mother confirmed that the applicant spoke good LANGUAGE and that she was in the habit of giving her small sums of money for family celebrations . She had frequently had the applicant and her grandchildren to stay in her country house and had never heard her complain of ill - treatment or contempt , although she had been free to express her views .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's uncle stated that she was free , among other things , to leave the house and call him from a telephone box , that she was appropriately dressed , in good health and always had some money , which could not have come from anyone but PERSON and PERSON He had offered to give her money , but she had never asked for any . He added that he had raised this question with PERSON , who had told him that a certain amount was set aside DATE in order to build up a nest egg for the applicant , which would be given to her when she left , and that the girl was aware of this arrangement .", "He stated that , on the basis of what he had been able to observe and conclude from his conversations with the applicant and with PERSON , the girl had not been kept as a slave in the home in which she lived .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled that the additional investigations and hearings had shown that , while it did appear that the applicant had not been paid or that the payment was clearly disproportionate to the amount of work carried out ( although the defendants ' intention to create a nest egg that would be handed over to her on departure had not been seriously disputed ) , in contrast , the existence of working or living conditions that were incompatible with human dignity had not been established .", "It also considered that it had not been established that the applicant was in a state of vulnerability or dependence since , by taking advantage of her ability to come and go at will , contacting her family at any time , leaving PERSON and PERSON home for a considerable period and returning without coercion , the girl had , in spite of her youth , shown an undeniable form of independence , and vulnerability could not be established merely on the basis that she was an alien .", "Accordingly , ORG acquitted the defendants on all the charges against them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment . No appeal was lodged by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG , the public prosecutor attached to ORG wrote :", "\u201c In your letter of DATE you asked me to inform you whether the public prosecution office under my direction has lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment delivered on DATE by ORG of the court which heard the appeal in the criminal proceedings against PERSON and PERSON", "ORG decision to acquit the defendants of the CARDINAL offences of insufficiently remunerating a person in a vulnerable position and subjecting a person in a vulnerable or dependent state to demeaning working conditions was based on an assessment of elements of pure fact .", "Since ORG considers that such assessments come within the unfettered discretion of the trial courts , an appeal on points of law could not be effectively argued .", "That is why I have not made use of that remedy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE . It ruled as follows :", "\u201c All judgments must contain reasons justifying the decision reached ; giving inadequate or contradictory reasons is tantamount to giving no reasons .", "After an investigation into the situation of [ the applicant ] , a young NORP national whom they had employed and lodged in their home since she was DATE , PERSON and PERSON were directly summoned before the criminal court for , firstly , taking advantage of a person 's vulnerability or dependent state to obtain services without payment or any adequate payment , contrary to LAW and , secondly , for subjecting that person to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity , contrary to LAW .", "In acquitting the defendants of the CARDINAL above - mentioned offences and dismissing the civil party 's claims in connection therewith , the appeal court , having noted that [ the applicant ] was a foreign minor , without a residence or work permit and without resources , nonetheless stated that her state of vulnerability and dependence , a common constituent element of the alleged offences , had not been established , given that the girl enjoyed a certain freedom of movement and that vulnerability could not be established merely on the basis that she was an alien .", "Furthermore , in finding that the offence defined in LAW of LAW had not been made out , the court added that ' it does appear that the applicant has not been paid or that the payment was clearly disproportionate to the amount of work carried out ( although the defendants ' intention to build up a nest egg that would be handed over to her on departure has not been seriously disputed ) ' .", "Finally , in acquitting the defendants of the offence set out in LAW , the courts found that subjection to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity ' had not been established ' .", "However , in ruling in this way , with reasons that were inadequate and ineffective with regard to the victim 's state of vulnerability and dependence and contradictory with regard to her remuneration , and without specifying the factual elements which established that her working conditions were compatible with human dignity , ORG failed to draw from its findings the legal conclusions that were required in the light of LAW of LAW and did not justify its decision in the light of LAW of that Code .", "The judgment must therefore be quashed .", "For these reasons ,", "[ ORG ] quashes the above - mentioned judgment of ORG dated DATE but only in respect of the provisions dismissing the civil party 's requests for compensation in respect of the offences provided for in Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , all other provisions being expressly maintained , and instructs that the case be remitted , in accordance with the law , for a rehearing of the matters in respect of which this appeal has been allowed . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG , to which the case was subsequently referred , delivered its judgment on DATE .
