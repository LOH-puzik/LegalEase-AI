The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in NORP and NORP", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is married to the second applicant and the third applicant to the fourth applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant suffers from fallopian - tube - related infertility ( eileiterbedingter PERSON ) . The second applicant , her husband , is also infertile .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant suffers from agonadism ( PERSON ) , which means that she does not produce ova at all . Thus she is completely infertile but has a fully developed uterus . The fourth applicant , her husband , in contrast to the second applicant , can produce sperm fit for procreation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and third applicants lodged an application ( PERSON ) with ORG ) for a review of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz - see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued before ORG that they were directly affected by the above provisions . The first applicant submitted that she could not conceive a child by natural means ; thus the only way open to her and her husband would be in vitro fertilisation using sperm from a donor . That medical technique was , however , ruled out by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The third applicant submitted that she was also infertile . Suffering from agonadism , she did not produce ova at all . Thus , the only way open to her of conceiving a child was to resort to a medical technique of artificial procreation referred to as heterologous embryotransfer , which would entail implanting into her uterus an embryo conceived with ova from a donor and sperm from the fourth applicant . However , that method was not allowed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first and third applicants argued before ORG that the impossibility of using the above - mentioned medical techniques for medically assisted conception was a breach of their rights under LAW . They also relied on LAW , which guarantees equal treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a public hearing in which the first applicant , assisted by counsel , participated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on the first and third ORG request . ORG found that their request was partly admissible in so far as the wording concerned their specific case . In this respect , it found that the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW , which prohibited the use of certain procreation techniques , was directly applicable to the applicants\u2019 case without it being necessary for a decision by a court or administrative authority to be taken .", "CARDINAL . As regards the merits of their complaints ORG considered that LAW was applicable in the applicants\u2019 case . Although no case - law of ORG existed on the matter , it was evident , in ORG view , that the decision of spouses or a cohabiting couple to conceive a child and make use of medically assisted procreation techniques to that end fell within the sphere of protection under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The impugned provisions of LAW interfered with the exercise of this freedom in so far as they limited the scope of permitted medical techniques of artificial procreation . As for the justification of such an interference , ORG observed that the legislature , when enacting LAW , had tried to find a solution by balancing the conflicting interests of human dignity , the right to procreation and the well - being of children . Thus , it had enacted as leading features of the legislation that , in principle , only homologous methods \u2013 such as using ova and sperm from the spouses or the cohabiting couple itself \u2013 would be allowed and only methods which did not involve a particularly sophisticated technique and were not too far removed from natural means of conception . The aim was to avoid the forming of unusual personal relations such as a child having more than one biological mother ( a genetic mother and CARDINAL carrying the child ) and to avoid the risk of exploitation of women .", "CARDINAL . The use of in vitro fertilisation as opposed to natural procreation raised serious issues as to the well - being of children thus conceived , their health and their rights , and also touched upon the ethical and moral values of society and entailed the risk of commercialisation and selective reproduction ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Applying the principle of proportionality under LAW , however , such concerns could not lead to a total ban on all possible medically assisted procreation techniques , as the extent to which public interests were concerned depended to a large extent on whether a heterologous or homologous technique was used .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the legislator had not overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to member GPE when it established the permissibility of homologous methods as a rule and insemination using donor sperm as an exception . This compromise reflected the current state of medical science and the consensus in society . It did not mean , however , that these criteria were not subject to developments which the legislator would have to take into account in the future .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legislator had also not neglected the interests of men and women who had to avail themselves of artificial procreation techniques . Besides strictly homologous techniques it had accepted insemination using sperm from donors . Such a technique had been known and used for a long time and would not bring about unusual family relationships . Further , the use of these techniques was not restricted to married couples but also included cohabiting couples . In so far , however , as homologous techniques were not sufficient for the conception of a child the interests of the individuals concerned ran counter to the above - mentioned public interest .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that for the legislator to prohibit heterologous techniques , while accepting as lawful only homologous techniques , was in accordance with the prohibition of discrimination as contained in the principle of equality . The difference in treatment between the CARDINAL techniques was justified because , as pointed out above , the same objections could not be raised against the homologous method as against the heterologous one . As a consequence the legislator was not bound to apply strictly identical regulations to both . Also , the fact that insemination with donor sperm was allowed while ova donation was not did not raise a discrimination issue because again , as pointed out above , there was no risk of creating unusual relationships which might adversely affect the well - being of a future child as there was with heterologous insemination .", "CARDINAL . Since the impugned provisions of LAW were in line with LAW and the principle of equality under LAW , there had also been no breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision was served on the first and third applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz , ORG DATE ) regulates the use of medical techniques for inducing conception of a child by means other than copulation ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . These methods comprise : ( i ) introduction of sperm into the reproductive organs of a woman , ( ii ) unification of ovum and sperm outside the body of a woman , ( iii ) introduction of viable cells into the uterus or fallopian tube of a woman and ( iv ) introduction of ovum cells or ovum cells with sperm into the uterus or fallopian tube of a woman ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Medically assisted procreation is allowed only within a marriage or a relationship similar to marriage , and may only be carried out if every other possible and reasonable treatment aimed at inducing pregnancy through intercourse has failed or has no reasonable chance of success ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , only ova and sperm from spouses or from persons living in a relationship similar to marriage ( GPE ) may be used for the purpose of medically assisted procreation . In exceptional circumstances , sperm from a third person may be used for artificial insemination when introducing sperm into the reproductive organs of a woman ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . In all other circumstances , and in particular for the purpose of in vitro fertilisation , the use of sperm by donors is prohibited .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ova or viable cells may only be used for the woman from whom they originate . Thus ova donation is always prohibited .", "CARDINAL . The further provisions of LAW stipulate , inter alia , that medically assisted procreation may only be carried out by specialised physicians and in specially equipped hospitals or surgeries ( section CARDINAL ) and with the express and written consent of the spouses or cohabiting persons ( section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE LAW was supplemented by LAW Fertilisation Treatment ( FAC ein Fonds zur Finanzierung der In - vitro - ORG eingerichtet wird \u2013 ORG I No . DATE ) in order to subsidise in DATE vitro fertilisation treatment allowed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the material available to the ORG , including the document \u201c Medically - assisted ORG and ORG on the ORG in GPE \u201d ( ORG , DATE ) and the replies by the member ORG to ORG on ORG LAW ( ORG , DATE ) , it would appear that ORG treatment is regulated by primary or secondary legislation in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE such treatment is governed by clinical practice , professional guidelines , royal or administrative decree or general constitutional principles .", "CARDINAL . The study in particular sets out the position of domestic law as regards CARDINAL different artificial procreation techniques : artificial insemination within a couple , in vitro fertilisation within a couple , artificial insemination by sperm donor , ova donation , ova and sperm donation , embryo donation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( an in vitro fertilization procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg ) .", "CARDINAL . As far as can be seen , sperm donation is currently prohibited only in CARDINAL countries : GPE , GPE and GPE , which all ban heterologous assisted fertilisation as a whole . Countries allowing sperm donation do not generally distinguish in their regulations between the use of sperm for artificial insemination and for in vitro fertilisation . As regards the donation of ova , it is prohibited in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , in addition to the CARDINAL countries mentioned above . Since GPE in practice allows donation of sperm only for non - in vitro fertilisation , the legal situation is quite similar to the situation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a number of countries , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , where the matter is not regulated , the donation of both sperm and ova is used in practice .", "CARDINAL . A comparison between ORG study of DATE and a survey conducted by ORG of DATE shows that in the field of medically assisted procreation legal provisions are developing quickly . In GPE , GPE and GPE sperm and ova donation , which was previously prohibited , is now allowed since the entry into force of new legal provisions in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . In GPE sperm donation for in vitro fertilisation has been allowed since DATE , but not ova donation .", "CARDINAL . Principle CARDINAL of the principles adopted by the ad hoc committee of experts on progress in the biomedical sciences , the expert body within ORG which preceded the present ORG ( ORG , DATE ) , states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In principle , in vitro fertilisation shall be effected using gametes of the members of the couple . The same rule shall apply to any other procedure that involves ova or in vitro or embryos in vitro . However , in exceptional cases defined by the member states , the use of gametes of donors may be permitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of DATE does not deal with the question of donation of gametes , but forbids to use a medically assisted reproduction technique to choose the sex of a child . Its Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c The use of techniques of medically assisted procreation shall not be allowed for the purpose of choosing a future child \u2019s sex , except where serious hereditary sex - related disease is to be avoided . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
