The exhibition , entitled \" Fri - Art CARDINAL \" , was held as part of the celebrations of the CARDINALth anniversary of the GPE of GPE \u2019s entry into ORG .

It also ordered that the confiscated paintings should be deposited in ORG of the GPE of GPE for safekeeping . At the hearing on DATE , it had heard evidence from Mr. PERSON , the curator of the PERSON in GPE , as to PERSON artistic qualities .", "In its judgment , the court pointed out first of all that \" the law [ did ] not define obscenity for the purposes of LAW [ LAW ] and the concept [ had ] to be clarified by means of interpretation , having regard to the intent and purpose of the enactment as well as to its place in the legislation and in the overall legal system \" . After referring to ORG case - law on the subject , it said among other things :", "\" In the instant case , although Mr. PERSON \u2019s CARDINAL works are not sexually arousing to a person of ordinary sensitivity , they are undoubtedly repugnant at the very least . The overall impression is of persons giving free rein to licentiousness and even perversion . The subjects - sodomy , fellatio , bestiality , the erect penis - are obviously morally offensive to the vast majority of the population . Although allowance has to be made for changes in the moral climate , even for the worse , what we have here would revolutionise it . Comment on the confiscated works is superfluous ; their vulgarity is plain to see and needs no elaborating upon .", "...", "Nor can a person of ordinary sensitivity be expected to go behind what is actually depicted and make a second assessment of the picture independently of what he can actually see . To do that he would have to be accompanied to exhibitions by a procession of sexologists , psychologists , art theorists or ethnologists in order to have explained to him that what he saw was in reality what he wrongly thought he saw .", "Lastly , the comparisons with the works of PERSON and PERSON are specious . Apart from the fact that they contain no depictions of the kind in PERSON \u2019s paintings , no valid comparison can be made with history - of - art or cultural collections in which sexuality has a place ... , but without lapsing into crudity . Even with an artistic aim , crude sexuality is not worthy of protection ... . Nor are comparisons with civilisations foreign to western civilisation valid . \"", "On the question whether to order the destruction of the pictures under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court said :", "\" Not without misgivings , the court will not order the destruction of the CARDINAL works .", "The artistic merit of the CARDINAL works exhibited in GPE is admittedly less obvious than is supposed by the witness Ammann , who nevertheless said that the paintings PERSON exhibited in GPE were more \u2018 ORG . The court would not disagree . PERSON is undoubtedly an artist of some accomplishment , particularly in the matter of composition and in the use of colour , even though the works seized in GPE appear rather scamped .", "Nonetheless , the court , deferring to the art critic \u2019s opinion while not sharing it , and concurring with the relevant findings of ORG in the PERSON judgment ( ORG CARDINAL IV CARDINAL et seq . ) , takes the view that in order to withhold the CARDINAL paintings from the general public - to \u2018 destroy\u2019 them - it is sufficient to place them in a museum , whose curator will be required to make them available only to a few serious specialists capable of taking an exclusively artistic or cultural interest in them as opposed to a prurient interest . ORG of the GPE of GPE meets the requirements for preventing any further breach of LAW . The CARDINAL confiscated paintings will be deposited there . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG All the applicants appealed on points of law on DATE ; in particular , they challenged the trial court \u2019s interpretation as regards the obscenity of the relevant paintings . For example , it was argued by PERSON ( in pleadings of CARDINAL DATE ) that something which was obscene sought directly to arouse sexual passion , and that this had to be its purpose , with the essential aim of pandering to man \u2019s lowest instincts or else for pecuniary gain . This , it was alleged , was never the case \" where artistic or scientific endeavour [ was ] the primary consideration \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting as a court of cassation , dismissed the appeals on DATE .", "Referring to ORG case - law , it acknowledged that \" in the recent past , and still DATE , the public \u2019s general views on morality and social mores , which vary at different times and in different places , have changed in a way which enables things to be seen more objectively and naturally \" . The trial court had to take account of this change , but that did not mean that it had to show complete permissiveness , which would leave no scope for the application of LAW .", "As for works of art , they did not in themselves have any privileged status . At most they might escape destruction despite their obscenity . Their creators nonetheless fell within the thrust of LAW , \" since that statutory provision as a whole [ was ] designed to protect public morals , even in the sphere of the fine arts \" . That being so , the court could dispense with deciding the question whether the pictures complained of were the outcome of \" artistic ideas , though even then , intention [ was ] CARDINAL thing and realisation of it another \" .", "Like the trial court , the appellate court found that PERSON paintings aroused \" repugnance and disgust \" :", "\" These are not works which , in treating a particular subject or scene , allude to sexual activity more or less discreetly . They place it in the foreground , depicting it not in the embrace of man and woman but in vulgar images of sodomy , fellatio between males , bestiality , erect penises and masturbation . Sexual activity is the main , not to say sole , ingredient of all CARDINAL paintings , and neither the appellants\u2019 explanations nor the witness Mr. PERSON \u2019s learned - seeming but wholly unpersuasive remarks can alter that fact . To go into detail , however distasteful it may be , CARDINAL of the paintings contains CARDINAL erect members . All the persons depicted are entirely naked and CARDINAL of them is engaging simultaneously in various sexual practices with CARDINAL other males and an animal . He is kneeling down and not only sodomising the animal but holding its erect penis in another animal \u2019s mouth . At the same time he is having the lower part of his back - his buttocks , even - fondled by another male , whose erect penis a third male is holding towards the first male \u2019s mouth . The animal being sodomised has its tongue extended towards the buttocks of a fourth male , whose penis is likewise erect . Even the ORG tongues ( especially in the smallest painting ) are more suggestive , in shape and aspect , of erect male organs than of tongues . Sexual activity is crudely and vulgarly portrayed for its own sake and not as a consequence of any idea informing the work . Lastly , it should be pointed out that the paintings are large ... , with the result that their crudeness and vulgarity are all the more offensive .", "The court is likewise unconvinced by the appellants\u2019 contention that the paintings are symbolical . What counts is their face value , their effect on the observer , not some abstraction utterly unconnected with the visible image or which glosses over it . Furthermore , the important thing is not the artist \u2019s meaning or purported meaning but the objective effect of the image on the observer ... .", "Not much of the argument in the appeal was directed to the issues of intention or of awareness of obscenity , nor indeed could it have been . In particular , an author is aware of a publication \u2019s obscenity when he knows it deals with sexual matters and that any written or pictorial allusion to such matters is likely , in the light of generally accepted views , grossly to offend the average reader \u2019s or observer \u2019s natural sense of decency and propriety . That was plainly so here , as the evidence at the trial confirmed . ... Indeed , several of the defendants admitted that the paintings had shocked them . It should be noted that even someone insensible to obscenity is capable of realising that it may disturb others . As the trial court pointed out , the defendants at the very least acted recklessly .", "Lastly , it is immaterial that similar works have allegedly been exhibited elsewhere ; the CARDINAL paintings in issue do not on that account cease to be obscene , as the trial court rightly held them to be ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicants lodged an application for a declaration of nullity ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde ) with ORG . They sought to have the judgment of DATE set aside and the case remitted with a view to their acquittal and the return of the confiscated paintings or , in the alternative , merely the return of the paintings .", "In their submission , ORG had wrongly interpreted LAW ; in particular , it had taken no account of the scope of the freedom of artistic expression , guaranteed inter alia in LAW ) of the LAW . Mr. PERSON , CARDINAL of the most distinguished experts on modern art , had confirmed that these were works of note . Similar pictures by PERSON , moreover , had been exhibited in GPE in DATE and it had not occurred to anyone to regard them as being obscene .", "As to the \" publication \" of obscene items , which was prohibited under LAW , this was a relative concept . It should be possible to show in an exhibition pictures which , if they were displayed in the market - place , would fall foul of Article CARDINAL ; people interested in the arts ought to have an opportunity to acquaint themselves with all the trends in contemporary article Visitors to an exhibition of contemporary art like \" Fri - Art CARDINAL \" should expect to be faced with modern works that might be incomprehensible . If they did not like the paintings in issue , they were free to look away from them and pass them by ; there was no need for the protection of the criminal law . It was not for the court to undertake indirect censorship of the arts . On a strict construction of Article CARDINAL - that is , CARDINAL which , having regard to the fundamental right to freedom of artistic expression , left it to art - lovers to decide for themselves what they wanted to see - , the applicants should be acquitted .", "Confiscation of the disputed paintings , they submitted , could only be ordered if they represented a danger to public order such that returning them could not be justified - and that was a matter the court of cassation had not considered . Since the pictures had been openly on display for DATE without giving rise to any protests , it was difficult to see how such a danger was made out . PERSON would certainly not show his paintings in GPE in the near future . On the other hand , they could be shown without any difficulty elsewhere , as was proved by his exhibition in GPE in DATE . It was consequently out of all proportion to deprive him of them .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE for the following reasons :", "\" The decided cases show that for the purposes of LAW , any item is obscene which offends , in a manner that is difficult to accept , the sense of sexual propriety ; the effect of the obscenity may be to arouse a normal person sexually or to disgust or repel him . ... The test of obscenity to be applied by the court is whether the overall impression of the item or work causes moral offence to a person of ordinary sensitivity ...", "The paintings in issue show an orgy of unnatural sexual practices ( sodomy , bestiality , petting ) , which is crudely depicted in large format ; they are liable grossly to offend the sense of sexual propriety of persons of ordinary sensitivity . The artistic licence relied on by the appellant can not in any way alter that conclusion in the instant case .", "The content and scope of constitutional freedoms are determined on the basis of the federal law currently in force . This applies inter alia to freedom of the press , freedom of opinion and artistic freedom ; under LAW [ of LAW ] , ORG is bound by federal enactments ... In the field of artistic creation [ it ] has held that works of art per se do not enjoy any special status ... A work of art is not obscene , however , if the artist contrives to present subjects of a sexual nature in an artistic form such that their offensiveness is toned down and ceases to predominate ... In reaching its decision , the criminal court does not have to view the work through an art critic \u2019s spectacles ( which would often ill become it ) but must decide whether the work is liable to offend the unsuspecting visitor .", "Expert opinion as to the artistic merit of the work in issue is therefore irrelevant at this stage , though it might be relevant to the decision as to what action to take in order to prevent fresh offences ( destruction or seizure of the item ; Art . CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL CC ... ) .", "ORG duly scrutinised the paintings for a predominantly aesthetic element . Having regard in particular to the number of sexual features in each of the CARDINAL ( CARDINAL of them , for instance , contains CARDINAL erect members ) , it decided that the emphasis was on sexuality in its offensive forms and that this was the predominant , not to say sole , ingredient of the items in dispute . ORG of ORG agrees . The overall impression created by PERSON \u2019s paintings is such as to be morally offensive to a person of normal sensitivity . ORG finding that they were obscene was accordingly not in breach of federal law .", "The appellants maintained that the publication element of the offences was lacking . They are wrong .", "The obscene paintings were on display in an exhibition open to the public which had been advertised on posters and in the press . There was no condition of admission to \u2018 DATE , such as an age - limit . The paintings in dispute were thus made accessible to an indeterminate number of people , which is the criterion of publicity for the purposes of LAW ... \"", "Finally , ORG of ORG declared the alternative application for return of the paintings to be inadmissible as it had not first been made before the cantonal courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the NORP ORG granted an application made by PERSON on DATE and ordered the return of the paintings .", "On the basis that it had been requested in effect to reconsider the confiscation order it had made in DATE , the court held that it had to decide whether the order could stand \" DATE \" . Hence , the reasons for its decision were as follows :", "\" In NORP law , confiscation is a preventive measure in rem . This is already clear from the legislative text , which classifies LAW under the heading \u2018 other MONEY - the heading in the margin for ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL ORG - and not under the subsidiary penalties prescribed in Articles CARDINAL ...", "The confiscation of items or assets may admittedly constitute a serious interference with property rights . It must be proportionate and a more lenient order may thus be justified where it achieves the desired aim . Confiscation remains however the rule . It should be departed from only where a more lenient order achieves the desired aim ... In this case , when the confiscation order was made in DATE , the statutory provision ( LAW ) would normally have required the destruction of the paintings . Giving a reasoned decision , the court preferred a more lenient measure which achieved the aim of security , whilst complying with the principle of proportionality ... . The measure itself should remain in force only as long as the statutory requirements are satisfied ... .", "It is true that the LAW makes no provision for an order under LAW to be subsequently discharged or varied . The legislature probably did not address itself to this question at the time , whereas provision was made whereby other measures , which were admittedly much more serious because they restricted personal liberty , could be re - examined by a court of its own motion ( Articles DATE ORG ) . It does not follow that discharge or variation is completely illegal . ORG has , moreover , held that a measure should not remain in force where the circumstances justifying it cease to obtain ... .", "Accordingly , the view must be taken that an order confiscating a work of art may subsequently be discharged or varied , either because the confiscated item is no longer dangerous and a measure is no longer required , or because the necessary degree of security may be achieved by another more lenient measure ( judgment of ORG of DATE , in the PERSON case ) .", "Judgments concerning freedom of expression and its scope often refer to LAW ( article DATE , article CARDINAL ) [ of the Convention ] .", "In this area , the decisions of the ORG authorities have a direct influence on the NORP legal system , by way of strengthening individual liberties and judicial safeguards ...", "In this case , where the applicant has availed himself of the possibility of applying for the return of his paintings , the court must consider whether the grounds on which it made the confiscation order in the first place , which restricted PERSON freedom of expression , are still valid .", "While the restriction was necessary in a NORP society in DATE and was justified by the need to safeguard and protect morality and the rights of others , the court considers , admittedly with some hesitation , that the order may now be discharged . It should be noted that the confiscation measure was not absolute but merely of indeterminate duration , which left room to apply for a reconsideration .", "It appears to the court that the preventive measure has now fulfilled its function , namely to ensure that such paintings are not exhibited in public again without any precautions . Those convicted have themselves admitted that the paintings could shock people . Once the order has achieved its aim , there is no reason why it should continue in force .", "Accordingly , the artist is entitled to have his works returned to him .", "It is not necessary to attach any obligations to this decision . If PERSON decided to exhibit the CARDINAL paintings again elsewhere , he knows that he would be running the risk of further action by the courts under LAW .", "Finally , it appears that by exhibiting CARDINAL provocative paintings in a former seminary in DATE , PERSON deliberately intended to draw attention to himself and the organisers . Since then he has become known for more \u2018 ORG works , to use the terms of the art critic who gave evidence in DATE . Having achieved a certain repute , he may find it unnecessary to shock by resorting to vulgarity .

In this case , the exhibition of the painting in a museum would at present clearly be unobjectionable in the context of LAW . However , even if the picture were to be returned unconditionally , the likelihood of misuse must be regarded as minimal because PERSON , who deliberately set out , by means of a provocative exhibition , to draw attention to himself as a painter and to his ideas and works , has since died . There is no reason to believe that the applicants have any intention of using the picture to offend other people \u2019s religious sensibilities . At any rate , the picture would not lend itself to such a purpose ( LAW ) sufficiently to permit the DATE confiscation order to stand ... . Any danger of that kind arising from the picture is no longer serious enough to justify action under LAW .
