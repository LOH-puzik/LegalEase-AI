The most solemn and significant religious meeting for ORG , their families and supporters , known as the DATE celebration of FAC Evening Meal , was scheduled to begin at TIME , after sundown on DATE . CARDINAL people , including the CARDINAL applicants , gathered for the service .", "CARDINAL . At TIME police officers , led by the chief of the FAC police station , arrived in substantial numbers at the building . The building was cordoned off by the police units whose deployment included ten police vehicles , QUANTITY minibuses , an armed unit of ORG ( ORG ) and CARDINAL of other officers in uniform .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police chief went on stage , took over the microphone and announced that the meeting was unlawful and that the participants were to disperse . Those in attendance complied with the order . The police officers segregated the male individuals from the rest of the group and made them stand in the corridor behind the hall . CARDINAL male members of the congregation were escorted into the minibuses waiting outside .

On DATE the ORG gave judgment , making the following findings of fact :", "\u201c It was established that the NORP ] and CARDINAL fellow believers ... had gathered for a service of worship on DATE in the assembly hall ... The service was stopped by police officers of the FAC police station who declared the meeting illegal and demanded that the hall be vacated . PERSON , PERSON , PERSON PERSON and Mr Anorov were detained and escorted to the NORP police station to give statements .", "These circumstances , including the curtailment of the religious service ... were confirmed by the representative of [ the FAC police station ] . His arguments that the plaintiffs were not detained , but went of their own accord , are unfounded . The fact of detention is corroborated by the testimonies of witnesses ... the entries in the register of persons detained or escorted to the police station ... which read that the plaintiffs were escorted to the police station [ for the reasons contained in ] report no . PERSON , and the written statements of the detainees . Records of the detention and escorting to the police station were not compiled . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the police had lawfully stopped the service of worship :", "\u201c Pursuant to section QUANTITY and CARDINAL of LAW ... religious organisations shall conduct religious services ... in religious buildings ... and in other places provided to religious organisations for such purposes ...", "In other cases , public religious services ... shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure established for conducting meetings , marches and demonstrations .", "The assembly hall of ORG ... does not meet the requirements established by the above - mentioned legal provisions for buildings , structures and other places provided for conducting religious rites by religious organisations . That is , since the plaintiffs belong to a religious organisation , the public religious service [ they held ] in a secular establishment should have been carried out in accordance with the procedure established by LAW , as provided for by LAW ...", "As follows from the statements of the plaintiffs , they are not members of ORG of Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses \u2013 the religious organisation whose activity was banned in GPE by the judgment of ORG dated DATE and they exercise their right to freedom of religion ... having united not as a religious organisation but as the ORG and GPE religious groups . In light of the above , the court considers that , in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW , only premises provided for the use of the religious group by its members could be used for conducting services of worship ...", "The court considers that the actions of the police officers in stopping the religious ritual in the building of ORG ... in which CARDINAL people were participating , without having observed the [ notification ] procedure for conducting meetings , marches and demonstrations , were well grounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG considered that the police officers had acted unlawfully in detaining the applicants :", "\u201c In accordance with LAW , violations of the established procedure for organising or conducting meetings , marches and demonstrations is a ground for instituting administrative offence proceedings . However , as follows from the testimony of [ the representative of the police station ] , no elements of an administrative offence were established in the actions of the plaintiffs and no records of an administrative violation , detention , escorting to the police station and administrative arrest were compiled . That is , there were no grounds for detaining [ the plaintiffs ] or escorting them to the police station . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG summarily rejected the remainder of the claims :", "\u201c The claims concerning the removal of religious literature and passports , the photographing [ of the applicants ] or impediments caused to counsel are unsubstantiated . The applicants\u2019 and their ORG statements in that connection are contradictory , thus making it impossible to establish the relevant facts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal , submitting that ORG had misinterpreted the law in that the LOC for the service of worship had been legally provided under a rental contract entered into by ORG of GPE \u2019s Witnesses , a registered legal entity , of which the local religious groups were structural divisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment in the part concerning the finding of unlawfulness in the actions of the police :", "\u201c It appears from the register of persons detained or escorted to the police station that the plaintiffs were taken to the police station to give statements ... and spent TIME at the police station , which can not be considered as detention .", "Thus , the actions of the police patrol unit of the FAC police station in escorting the plaintiffs to the police station were carried out within the framework of LAW , and there is no basis for pronouncing unlawful their actions in stopping the unlawful religious service and escorting the plaintiffs to the police station for the purposes of taking their statements and inspecting [ their ] identity documents . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the remainder of the judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 arguments in a summary fashion :", "\u201c The fact that the service of worship held by the ORG and GPE religious groups , which are part of the centralised religious organisation \u2018 ORG [ sic ] , was conducted on behalf of that organisation and on premises paid for by it does not in itself exempt it from [ the need to meet ] the requirements [ applicable to ] religious groups when conducting religious services , since the activity of that organisation is banned in GPE .", "The court has considered the other arguments in the appeal ... [ They ] involved in essence a different interpretation of the law and a re - evaluation of evidence ... and these can not constitute grounds for reversing a court decision on appeal \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "9-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
