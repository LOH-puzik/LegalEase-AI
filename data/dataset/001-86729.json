The court found in favour of the applicant , choosing to rely on the expert opinion and to disregard the decisions of the NORP courts .

Her appeal was heard DATE and on DATE ORG gave judgment allowing the appeal . ORG reversed the judgment of ORG , finding that the applicant did not have custody rights within the meaning of LAW and that therefore the child \u2019s removal from GPE was not wrongful under LAW of the same LAW . ORG criticised the decision of ORG to seek a further expert opinion after having obtained a final decision on the matter from the NORP courts and expressed regret about the length of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope of PERSON observed , inter alia , that :", "\u201c LAW contemplates that the court may need to be provided with a determination from the authorities of the state of the child \u2019s habitual residence that the removal was wrongful . So a judge is not to be criticised if he decides to use this procedure because he can not responsibly resolve the issue on the information provided by the applicant . Nevertheless if he decides on this course delay will be inevitable . Great care must therefore be taken , in the child \u2019s best interests , to keep this to the absolute minimum . The misfortunes that have beset this case show that , once the court has received the response , it should strive to treat the information which it receives as determinative .", "In this case the response that was received from GPE was sufficient to show that the child \u2019s removal was not wrongful within the meaning of article CARDINAL . On DATE the final ORG of GPE , upholding the court of first appeal , stated in the clearest terms that , under the law as it then stood in GPE , termination of marriage through divorce brings joint custody to an end , that cases where the agreement of the parties is required about a measure which the parent with custody proposes are limited , and that none of the rights that the father had been granted on divorce gave him a right of veto or to decide the child \u2019s place of residence . It is wholly understandable that the father should feel aggrieved by what has happened in this case . The effect on his ability to exercise his rights of access is plain to see . But the phrase \u201c rights of custody \u201d has been given a particular definition by the Convention . It is only if there has been a breach of rights of custody as so defined that the removal can be described as wrongful for its purposes . The information provided by the NORP court shows that , as the law stood at the time of the child \u2019s removal , the father had no such rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON of GPE commented , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... ORG concluded that the removal of the child in DATE had not been wrongful ... How then should the courts of the requested state respond to such a determination ? Most certainly not as they did in this case . Having received a determination , binding between the parties , in the final court of the requesting state , the ORG proceeded in effect to allow the father to challenge that ruling by adducing fresh expert evidence . The fact that the expert was jointly instructed does not cure the vice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON stated that :", "\u201c It was quite wrong to permit the father to adduce further expert evidence from Dr PERSON which challenged not only the conclusion but the statement of the content of the father \u2019s rights set out in the judgment of the NORP court . The NORP court should have considered the terms of the judgment itself , without any subsequently obtained expert evidence . If it had done so it could only have come to the same conclusion as the NORP court , even without applying any presumption in its favour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON commented as follows :", "\u201c This is an extraordinary case . It is , we are told , unique in the length of time which elapsed before the judge \u2019s order for the child \u2019s summary return to GPE ( over DATE after the commencement of GPE Convention proceedings ) ; and unique too in being the only case in which a GPE court has rejected a foreign court \u2019s LAW determination that the child \u2019s removal was not in the event wrongful within the meaning of LAW ...", "In circumstances like these it seems to me almost inconceivable that the court requesting the article CARDINAL determination would then not simply accept it . Certainly there would need to be some compelling reason to reject it such as a flagrant breach of the rules of natural justice in the foreign judicial process or a manifest misdirection as to the autonomous meaning of the Convention term \u201c rights of custody \u201d . There is nothing of that sort here . On the contrary , the judge - neither PERSON ( who had requested the determination ) nor PERSON ( who later ordered the child \u2019s return to GPE ) - on DATE , acting merely on the father \u2019s request , ordered that an expert in NORP law be jointly instructed by both parties to cover exactly the same ground as ORG had themselves just covered ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the entire proceedings in GPE the applicant was allowed to meet his child on a number of occasions in special contact centres for periods not exceeding TIME . According to him , however , over DATE he has only been able to spend TIME with his son .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that the applicant ever applied to the GPE courts in order to obtain a judgment from them giving him access to the child . However , on an unspecified date in DATE he applied to ORG in GPE for the recognition of the NORP judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG is not aware of the outcome of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "CARDINAL .
