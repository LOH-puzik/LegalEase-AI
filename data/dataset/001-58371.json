Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , PERSON \u015e\u00fckran Ayd\u0131n , is a NORP citizen of NORP origin . She was born in DATE . At the time of the events in issue she was DATE and living with her parents in the village of ORG , which is about QUANTITY kilometres from the town of GPE where the district gendarmerie headquarters are located . The applicant had never travelled outside her village before the events which led to her application to the Commission .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , serious disturbances have raged in the south - east of GPE between the security forces and the members of the ORG ( Workers\u2019 ORG ) . This confrontation has so far , according to the ORG , claimed the lives of CARDINAL civilians and CARDINAL members of the security forces .", "At the time of the ORG \u2019s consideration of the case , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL provinces of south - eastern GPE had since DATE been subjected to emergency rule .", "CARDINAL . The facts in the case are disputed .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , a group of people comprising village guards and a gendarme arrived in her village on DATE . Although the applicant put the time of their arrival at TIME , the Commission , relying on the recollection of the applicant \u2019s father and sister - in - law , found that it was more likely that this occurred early in TIME of CARDINAL June at TIME", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL members of the group came to her GPE home and questioned her family about recent visits to the house by ORG members ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Her family were threatened and subjected to insults . They were then taken to a village square where they were joined by other villagers who had also been forcibly taken from their homes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , her father , PERSON , and her sister - in - law , ORG , were singled out from the rest of the villagers , blindfolded and driven away to PERSON gendarmerie headquarters .", "CARDINAL . The Government have disputed the applicant \u2019s claim that she and CARDINAL members of her family were detained in the circumstances described above . In his oral evidence to the Commission delegates who heard evidence from witnesses in GPE from CARDINAL to DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , Mr PERSON , the commander of PERSON gendarmerie headquarters in DATE , stated that no operations had been conducted in or immediately around the village on DATE in question and no incidents had been recorded . Furthermore , in support of their challenge to the applicant \u2019s account of the events the Government drew attention to the inconsistencies in the evidence concerning the time of the incident and the number of village guards involved as well as to the fact that the applicant and her family failed to recognise any of the village guards although they all would have come from neighbouring villages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that , on arrival at the gendarmerie headquarters , she was separated from her father and her sister - in - law . At some stage she was taken upstairs to a room which she later referred to as the \u201c torture room \u201d . There she was stripped of her clothes , put into a car tyre and spun round and round . She was beaten and sprayed with cold water from high - pressure jets . At a later stage she was taken clothed but blindfolded to an interrogation room . With the door of the room locked , an individual in military clothing forcibly removed her clothes , laid her on her back and raped her . By the time he had finished she was in severe pain and covered in blood . She was ordered to get dressed and subsequently taken to another room . According to the applicant , she was later brought back to the room where she had been raped . She was beaten for TIME by several persons who warned her not to report on what they had done to her .", "CARDINAL . The Government have challenged the credibility of the applicant \u2019s account of the events . They pointed out that there was no indication in the custody register kept at PERSON gendarmerie headquarters that anyone had been detained on DATE . Had the applicant and the members of her family been taken into custody on that date the responsible duty officer would have followed the proper procedure and entered the details in the custody register . The station commander and the custody officer on duty at the time had been heard by the Commission delegates as witnesses and both had confirmed that no one had been taken into custody at that time . Furthermore , interrogation of terrorist suspects never took place at the PERSON headquarters but at the provincial headquarters in GPE . The Government also found it significant that the applicant failed to recognise photographs of the LOC when shown to her . Furthermore , the Government highlighted several inconsistencies in the way in which the applicant reported on the details of the alleged rape and assault to the public prosecutor and to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she , her father and her sister - in - law were taken away from the gendarmerie headquarters on or DATE . They were driven by members of the security forces to the mountains where they were questioned about the location of ORG shelters . They were subsequently released separately . The applicant made her own way back to her village .", "The Government argued that the applicant \u2019s account of her release also undermined the credibility of her allegations . They contended that it would have been extremely na\u00efve on the part of the security forces to take the applicant and the members of her family to a location within TIME of NORP after DATE of detention to ask about the whereabouts of terrorists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant together with her father and her sister - in - law went to the office of the public prosecutor , Mr FAC , in PERSON to lodge complaints about the treatment which they all alleged they had suffered while in detention . The public prosecutor took statements from each of them . The applicant reported that she had been tortured by being beaten and raped . Her father and sister - in - law both alleged that they had been tortured . According to the applicant , she confirmed her account of what happened to her in a statement given to ORG on DATE , which was submitted , undated , to the ORG along with her application .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL were sent the same day to Dr PERSON at ORG . The public prosecutor had requested PERSON to establish the blows and marks of physical violence , if any , in respect of PERSON and PERSON . In respect of the applicant , he requested that she be examined to establish whether she was a virgin and the presence of any marks of physical violence or injury .", "In his report on the applicant dated DATE , PERSON , who had not previously dealt with any rape cases , stated that the applicant \u2019s hymen was torn and that there was widespread bruising around the insides of her thighs . He could not date when the hymen had been torn since he was not qualified in this field ; nor could he express any view on the reason for the bruising . In separate reports he noted that there were wounds on the bodies of the applicant \u2019s father and sister - in - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor sent the applicant to be examined at ORG with a request to establish whether she had lost her virginity and , if so , since when . She was examined by Dr PERSON , a gynaecologist . According to the doctor \u2019s report , dated the same day , defloration had occurred DATE prior to her examination . No swab was taken and neither the applicant \u2019s account of what had happened to her nor whether the results of the examination were consistent with that account were recorded in his report . Dr ORG did not comment on the bruising on her inner thighs on account of the fact that he was a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology . He did not frequently deal with rape victims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor took a further statement from the applicant who by that stage was married . On DATE he referred the applicant to ORG requesting that a medical examination be carried out to establish whether the applicant had lost her virginity and , if so , since when . The medical report dated CARDINAL DATE confirmed Dr ORG \u2019s earlier findings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that the hymen had been torn but that after DATE defloration could not be accurately dated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor wrote to PERSON gendarmerie headquarters enquiring as to whether the applicant , her father and her sister - in - law had been held in custody there and , if so , as to the dates and duration of the detention and the names of those who carried out the interrogations . By letter dated DATE , the commander of the gendarmerie headquarters , Mr PERSON , replied that they had not been taken into custody . On DATE , he supplied the public prosecutor with a copy of the entries for DATE . There were CARDINAL entries for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor wrote to PERSON gendarmerie headquarters requesting that the custody register for DATE be sent to him for inspection . The register contained no entries for DATE in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor sent the applicant \u2019s file to ORG in GPE . By letter dated DATE , the chief coroner requested that the applicant attend for an examination .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor wrote to the chief of security in PERSON on DATE and CARDINAL DATE requesting that the applicant be brought to the office of the Attorney - General . In a follow - up letter of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor referred to the fact that he had received no reply to his earlier letters . In a further letter dated CARDINAL DATE , the public prosecutor informed the chief of security at PERSON that the applicant , her father and her sister - in - law should attend at his office .", "CARDINAL . By report dated CARDINAL DATE in reply to a request for information of CARDINAL DATE , the public prosecutor informed the office of the Attorney - General in GPE that there was no evidence to support the applicant \u2019s claims but that the investigation continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor in PERSON took CARDINAL further statements from the applicant \u2019s father who confirmed his earlier account of the events of DATE . Her father also declared that the applicant and her husband had left the district in DATE to find work elsewhere and that he did not know of their whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor , Mr PERSON , interviewed Mr PERSON , a former ORG activist . Mr GPE alleged that the ORG members used the applicant \u2019s home as a shelter and that DATE and DATE she was having a sexual relationship with CARDINAL ORG members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant \u2019s complaint had been declared admissible by the Commission , a public prosecutor , Mr ORG , took a statement from Mr PERSON who commanded PERSON gendarmerie headquarters from DATE to DATE . Mr PERSON , who admitted to memory loss as a result of a road accident , stated that he had no recollection of any incident of rape or torture at the time in question and denied any involvement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also alleged that she and her family have been subjected to intimidation and harassment following the communication by the Commission of her application to the ORG and particularly following the ORG \u2019s decision to invite her to give oral evidence . Her father was repeatedly asked her address by the public prosecutor and , on occasion , by the police . The applicant and her husband were also repeatedly called to the police station for no apparent reason , their house had been searched ( once before DATE and again on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ) and they were questioned about her application to ORG . The applicant was also made to sign a statement of the contents of which she is ignorant . Further , on or CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s husband was taken into custody . On the first occasion , he was slapped , kicked and severely beaten with truncheons by CARDINAL police officers , one of his teeth being broken in the process . On the second occasion , he was again severely beaten by the same CARDINAL officers .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant alleged that on DATE , the applicant , her husband , father and father - in - law were called to PERSON police station from where they were sent to the public prosecutor . He showed them the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s statement of DATE and asked questions about it . The applicant \u2019s husband was asked whether the police were intimidating them , to which he replied \u201c Yes \u201d . While they were not ill - treated on this occasion , the applicant \u2019s husband strongly considered that they all felt intimidated by the very fact of being called by the police and that the constant calls by the police to their homes were making their situation very difficult . The applicant also referred to incidents of harassment , including the stoning of her father - in - law \u2019s house which neighbours attributed to the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The Government were requested by the ORG to respond to the above allegations . By letter and comments dated CARDINAL DATE , the ORG referred to the provisions of NORP criminal procedure whereby it is the duty and unavoidable obligation of public prosecutors to investigate the facts of crimes , which involves finding and questioning witnesses . In this context , police officers function as assistants to the public prosecutors . The public prosecutor who conducted the investigation instigated by the applicant and her father , and the police officers who acted under his authority , contacted the applicant and her father with the sole purpose of investigating the facts of the allegations and assembling the evidence . They submitted that the statements taken by the public prosecutor revealed no element of pressure being exerted and it was in the interests of the applicant for further evidence to be gathered . There was , they contended , no substantiation of the allegations of intimidation and harassment , the statements submitted by the applicant \u2019s representatives having been taken by extra - judicial means and their authenticity disputed . They submitted a letter from ORG ( ORG ) stating that no search took place at the applicant \u2019s house and that the purpose of the police ORG visit to PERSON was to communicate to the applicant the summons to attend the ORG \u2019s hearing . Since she was not there , he was asked for her address and there was no persecution involved . In an earlier communication of DATE in response to the first allegations of harassment of the applicant \u2019s father , the Government had responded that they rejected these allegations categorically and that they formed part of a campaign to influence the course of the proceedings and the holding of hearings to take evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the taking of evidence before delegates of the Commission in GPE on DATE , the Agent of the Government responded to allegations made orally by the applicant \u2019s representative concerning the repeated questioning of the applicant \u2019s father . He stated that it was the duty of ORG to facilitate the proceedings of the Commission and that they had to notify the applicant . To avoid any problems of non - attendance or the waste of expenditure of coming to GPE if she did not intend to comply with the summons , it was necessary to obtain her address from her father and that was why he was continually asked for the address . Requesting that information from her father could not , in his view , be regarded as harassment .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of any findings of fact reached by the domestic authorities on the applicant \u2019s complaint , ORG assessed the evidence and established the facts on the basis of :", "CARDINAL . The Commission \u2019s findings can be summarised as follows :", "\u201c ... the evidence of these officers as regards the facilities for taking persons into custody and the practice regarding taking persons into custody during DATE has been less than frank . It finds itself left with serious doubts as to whether the gendarmerie custody register is an accurate record of persons taken into custody during DATE . In these circumstances , the Commission considers that the lack of any official confirmation of the applicant \u2019s detention is insufficient evidence to discredit the account of the applicant and her father , which it finds to be credible and on the whole consistent . \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s report )", "\u201c ... the applicant was blindfolded , beaten , stripped , placed inside a tyre and sprayed with high - pressure water , and raped . It would appear probable that the applicant was subjected to such treatment on the basis of suspicion of collaboration by herself or members of her family with members of the ORG , the purpose being to gain information and/or to deter her family and other villagers from becoming implicated in terrorist activities \u201d . ( paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report )", "\u201c ... have been subjected to significant pressure from the authorities in circumstances which threaten to impinge on their continued participation in the proceedings before the ORG and that this has rendered the exercise of the applicant \u2019s right of individual petition more difficult \u201d . ( paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s report )", "CARDINAL . LAW makes it a criminal offence", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , the public prosecutor must investigate the facts on being informed of the commission of a crime . He must conduct the necessary inquiries to identify the perpetrators , hear witnesses , take statements from suspects , issue search warrants , etc .", "Article CARDINAL of the LAW authorises the public prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation into an offence either directly or with the support of the police .", "According to Article CARDINAL the public prosecutor may institute criminal proceedings if he decides that the evidence justifies the indictment of a suspect . If it appears that the evidence against a suspect is insufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings , he may close the investigation . However , the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute if and only if the evidence is clearly insufficient . Under Article CARDINAL a complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Decree no . CARDINAL modifies the application of PERSON no . ORG , the Anti - Terror Law ( DATE ) , in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency , with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the administration or of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils .", "These councils are composed of civil servants . Decisions of the local council may be appealed to ORG ; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal . If the offender is a member of the armed forces , he would fall under the jurisdiction of the military courts and would be tried in accordance with the provisions of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review .", "\u2026", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose liability is of an absolute , objective nature , based on the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus the administration is liable to indemnify persons who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on the state of emergency , which provides :", "\u201c ... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this PERSON are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Any illegal act by civil servants , be it a crime or a tort , which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW , an injured person may file a claim for compensation against an alleged perpetrator who has caused damage in an unlawful manner whether wilfully , negligently or imprudently . Pecuniary loss may be compensated by the civil courts pursuant to LAW and non - pecuniary or moral damages may be awarded under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of DATE requires that a State party", "\u201c shall ensure that any individual who alleges that he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to and have his case promptly and impartially examined by its competent authorities . Steps shall be taken to ensure that the complainant and witnesses are protected against ill - treatment or intimidation as a consequence of evidence given \u201d .", "Article CARDINAL of the Convention requires each State party to ensure", "\u201c that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation , wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its public statement on GPE adopted on DATE ( ORG / inf ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) , ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) , following CARDINAL visits to GPE , found :", "\u201c In light of all the information at its disposal , the ORG can only conclude that the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in GPE ... \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "It emphasised the words \u201c persons in police custody \u201d , having heard fewer allegations and finding less medical evidence of torture and other forms of premeditated severe ill - treatment by members of the gendarmerie ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It considered that \u201c the phenomenon of torture and other forms of ill - treatment of persons deprived of their liberty in GPE concerns at the present time essentially the police ( and to a lesser extent the gendarmerie ) . All the indications are that it is a deep - rooted problem \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its second public statement issued on DATE the ORG noted that some progress had been made in implementing the remedial measures which it had recommended but that \u201c the translation of words into deeds is proving to be a highly protracted process \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The committee noted in its statement that in the course of visits to GPE in DATE its delegations had found clear evidence of the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment by the NORP police ( paragraph QUANTITY ) . It concluded that the information at its disposal", "\u201c ... demonstrates that resort to torture and other forms of severe ill - treatment remains a common occurrence in police establishments in GPE . To attempt to characterise this problem as one of isolated acts of the kind which can occur in any country \u2013 as some are wo nt to do \u2013 is to fly in the face of the facts \u201d . ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In their written submissions to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ORG noted that the rape of a female detainee by an agent of the ORG for purposes such as the extraction of information or confessions or the humiliation , punishment or intimidation of the victim was considered to be an act of torture under current interpretations of international human rights standards . They referred in this respect to the PERSON and PERSON v. GPE decision of DATE ( Report no . CARDINAL , Case MONEY ) of ORG on Human Rights taken under LAW of ORG , to the reports published by ORG and to the fact that ORG for Former GPE had approved bills of indictment against individuals for torture based on allegations that they had raped female detainees .", "ORG also drew attention to current international legal standards on the investigation of allegations of rape made by detainees , in particular Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["25"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["25-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
