THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (estoppel);Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant PERSON was born in DATE and her son PERSON in DATE . PERSON husband , PERSON , was born in DATE , and their children GPE and PERSON in DATE , respectively . These applicants live in GPE . The applicant PERSON \u2013 a daughter of PERSON was born on CARDINAL DATE and lives in PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after the death of her first husband and during the civil war , PERSON fled from GPE to GPE , where she applied for asylum . She submitted that she had been harassed and detained by the NORP authorities on account of her husband \u2019s activities for ORG . Although denied asylum , she was granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in DATE . Her eldest child , PERSON , had stayed behind in GPE with a friend of his mother \u2019s , and she had left her other CARDINAL children , ORG and PERSON , in the care of an uncle and their grandmother ( in what subsequently became ORG ) . After permission was granted by the NORP authorities for the children to reside with PERSON , and with the assistance of those authorities and the ORG , her son PERSON entered GPE in DATE . It did not prove possible at that time to procure the departure of the other children from GPE , but it was PERSON intention to bring them to GPE later .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON married Mr GPE , who was living in the GPE where he had been admitted as a refugee . On DATE PERSON and her son PERSON moved to the GPE to live with Mr GPE . PERSON was granted a residence permit in order to reside in the GPE with her husband on DATE . CARDINAL children , GPE and PERSON , were subsequently born to the couple .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON and Mr PERSON filed a request for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) for ORG , in an attempt to have their ( step)daughter , who was then DATE , join them in the GPE . Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit , which confers more permanent residence rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) rejected their request . The Minister concluded that there were no grounds to authorise family reunion in the GPE since the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between PERSON and her daughter were considered to have ceased to exist and such ties had never existed between Mr GPE and his stepdaughter . Ever since PERSON ORG had left GPE , ORG had been living with an uncle and her grandmother ; she was deemed to have been integrated into the latter \u2019s family and thus no longer actually belonged to PERSON family unit ( gezin ) . There was no indication that this situation could not be maintained . Moreover , after marrying PERSON , PERSON had started a new family unit in the GPE to which her daughter had never belonged . Furthermore , the couple had not shown that they had been sufficiently involved with the upbringing and care of their ( step)daughter . According to the information available , it was PERSON parents who had custody of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and Mr PERSON filed an objection ( bezwaar ) through counsel with the Minister of ORG , emphasising that Mehret could no longer lead a normal existence in GPE now that she had reached marriageable age and her grandmother had decided that , for that reason , ORG should stop going to school . There were , moreover , sound reasons why PERSON had been unable to bring her daughter to GPE or the GPE prior to DATE . At the time when she had been granted leave to remain in GPE and permission to be joined by her children , contacts with GPE were impossible and it was for this reason that only PERSON , who had been in GPE at the time , was able to go to GPE . In DATE Mrs ORG had travelled to GPE but it had not proved possible to obtain travel documents for ORG , as there were not yet any official bodies equipped to issue passports in GPE and the authorities in GPE refused to do so for NORP citizens . The family \u2019s housing situation in the GPE had posed a further problem : despite the fact that they had been placed on a waiting list and had been issued with a certificate of urgency ( urgentieverklaring ) , no rental accommodation suitable for a family of CARDINAL adults and CARDINAL children was available . Once it had become possible to obtain a passport for ORG and more spacious accommodation had been obtained , the application for a provisional residence visa was lodged . Moreover , PERSON and her husband had been sending money to GPE on a regular basis , initially by courier as bank transactions were impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister rejected the objection , reiterating that the close family ties between PERSON and her daughter had ceased to exist . PERSON and her husband had not shown that they had made a substantial parental or financial contribution to ORG upbringing . Furthermore , the couple had not sufficiently shown why , in view of ORG age , she could not remain in the care of her uncle or her grandmother , if necessary supported financially by her family from the GPE . The Minister did not find it established that serious attempts had been made to arrange for ORG to come to the GPE as soon as possible : PERSON had been legally resident in the GPE since DATE but the request for ORG to be allowed to join her had not been lodged until DATE . Contrary to what the applicants appeared to contend , under the applicable legal provisions a lack of adequate accommodation would not have stood in the way of a provisional residence visa being granted . It appeared that PERSON and her husband had let the inexpediency of ORG presence in their cramped accommodation prevail over the desire to reunite ORG with her mother as soon as possible . Thus , the Minister concluded , the child \u2019s integration into the uncle \u2019s and grandmother \u2019s family could not be considered to have been a temporary measure .", "CARDINAL . On behalf of ORG , PERSON and Mr GPE lodged an appeal against this decision of the Minister , through counsel , with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in GPE , on DATE . In these proceedings , the Minister of ORG argued , inter alia , that from DATE it had been possible to request and obtain a passport in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held that PERSON had failed to show that her close family ties with her daughter had been maintained . It also found that , following her departure in DATE , PERSON had no longer exercised parental authority over her daughter in the sense of being intensively involved with her daughter \u2019s upbringing or of taking decisions in this regard . ORG agreed with the Minister of ORG that the ( step)daughter of PERSON and Mr Tuquabo should be deemed to have become integrated into the family of her uncle and grandmother . ORG attached importance to the fact that the couple had only requested to have their ( step)daughter join them in the GPE on DATE , and that they had failed to provide any documentary evidence to substantiate their claim that , even after DATE , it had remained impossible to obtain a passport for Mehret in GPE .", "CARDINAL . When assessing whether the ORG \u2019s actions had been in compliance with the requirements of LAW , ORG addressed the question whether the refusal to grant ORG residence visa , as such , constituted a violation of that provision . It pointed out that its task was to strike a fair balance between the interests of the applicants and those of society as a whole ( the latter interest being served by a restrictive immigration policy ) . It found that no obligation for the ORG to allow family reunion on its territory could be derived from LAW . It further considered that there were no objective reasons why the family members in the GPE could not pursue family life with ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was final and not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the time relevant to the present application , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d - Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act entered into force but this has no bearing on the present case .", "CARDINAL . As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy owing to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising from international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . The admission policy for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW of LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) . It provided that the spouse , a minor child born of the marriage and actually belonging to the family unit , and a minor child born outside the marriage but actually belonging to the family unit ( such as a child from an earlier relationship of either spouse or a foster child ) could be eligible for family reunion , if certain further conditions ( relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence ) were met .", "CARDINAL . The person with whom a family member was seeking to be reunited in the GPE had to have suitable accommodation available to him or her on a permanent basis . This requirement was not imposed on GPE nationals , on refugees who had been admitted or on holders of a residence permit for the purposes of asylum .", "CARDINAL . The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY \u201d ) used in GPE law only partly overlaps with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The former is understood to mean , for instance , that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the child and its parents whom it wishes to join in the GPE already existed in another country and have been maintained . For the rest , the question whether the close family ties can be deemed to have been severed is addressed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each specific case . Factors taken into consideration include the length of time during which parent and child have been separated and the reasons for the separation , the way in which the relationship between parent and child has been developed during the separation , the parent \u2019s involvement in the child \u2019s care and upbringing , custody arrangements , the amount and frequency of the parent \u2019s financial contributions to the child \u2019s care and upbringing , the parent \u2019s intention to have the child join him or her as soon as possible and his or her efforts to do so , and the length of time that the child has lived in a family other than with the parent . The burden of proving that the close family ties between parent and child have not been severed lies with the parent residing in the GPE . The longer the parent and child have been separated , the heavier the burden of proof on the person in the GPE becomes . It is then incumbent on the parent to present sound reasons as to why he or she did not seek to bring the child to the GPE sooner .", "CARDINAL"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
