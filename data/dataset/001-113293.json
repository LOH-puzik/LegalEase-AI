In response , Dr M. informed her of the possibilities either to commit the applicant to a psychiatric hospital for emergency treatment or to initiate a procedure for obtaining his mandatory institutional treatment , if necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mother informed PERSON that the reason for her having previously moved out of their common flat was the applicant \u2019s \u201c strange behaviour \u201d and that she was afraid of returning . On DATE Dr M. noted in the mother \u2019s medical file that she was discussing with her the problems concerning the applicant , whom his mother perceived as psychotic .", "CARDINAL . During their subsequent consultations , the mother repeatedly mentioned to PERSON that the reason for her anguish was that the applicant had not taken up a proper job and still lived on financial support from his family . In her medical file PERSON reiterated the view that the mother \u2019s problem originated in her son \u2019s conduct perceived as psychotic by the mother .", "CARDINAL .

Since the applicant did not do so , on CARDINAL DATE PERSON requested the ORG to order his mandatory institutional treatment . This application consisted of a pre - printed form stating that there was a possibility that the applicant \u2019s conduct would become dangerous because of a mental disorder . PERSON completed the form by adding that the applicant \u2019s mother asked her for assistance since she had the suspicion that her son was mentally ill , that the applicant had contacted PERSON upon notice , that he had not worked for DATE , was supported by his mother , lived an isolated life , and did not get in touch with anyone , and finally that he was shorttempered towards his mother , who had moved away from the flat as the patient \u2019s behaviour was threatening .", "CARDINAL .

Dr H. did not produce any written opinion at this stage ; she presented her testimony to the court verbally following the break . Its written version was faxed to the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON considered that the applicant suffered from delusional schizophrenia , characterised by grandiose delusions , bizarre elements of lifestyle and partial insight into his condition . She specified that she considered the applicant \u2019s treatment necessary since otherwise his health would decline , whereas therapy might improve his condition . She was of the view that the applicant could not take care of himself , by which he represented a significant danger to himself . She was not convinced that the applicant would voluntarily seek outpatient care but suggested that a decision on compulsory treatment be postponed for DATE , in order to observe the applicant \u2019s conduct . The judge pointed out that no such option was allowed under the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held another hearing , at the beginning of which PERSON report was handed over to the applicant and his guardian ad litem . PERSON was summoned but failed to appear . The guardian argued in essence that the applicant \u2019s behaviour was not dangerous and that he posed no significant threat either to himself or others . He noted that neither PERSON nor PERSON testimony contained elements pointing to the applicant \u2019s representing any danger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s mandatory institutional treatment . Relying on the medical opinions , it accepted that he suffered from schizophrenia with grandiose delusions and was satisfied that he posed a danger to his own health by failing voluntarily to subject himself to psychiatric treatment and by not looking after himself . The court affirmed that \u201c appropriate medical treatment would improve [ the applicant \u2019s ] condition \u201d and that , if untreated , his health would decline .

He was advised to appeal against the decision . During the second - instance proceedings , the applicant continued to be represented by the guardian ad litem appointed for him by ORG , whereas ORG provided him with additional legal advice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardian ad litem appealed to ORG . He argued that the conditions for mandatory treatment as required by LAW were not fulfilled , since the evidence provided by the CARDINAL psychiatrists involved did not prove the applicant \u2019s significant dangerous character but consisted of no more than vague predictions of an eventual deterioration in the applicant \u2019s condition . The decision was not in conformity with LAW , since ORG had established the applicant \u2019s dangerous character relying on his lifestyle rather than a mental illness and its symptoms ; in fact , the forensic expert had merely suspected the presence of a mental disorder and her opinion did not contain a proper diagnosis or substantiate that the degree of the applicant \u2019s mental illness warranted mandatory treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance decision , endorsing in essence its reasoning .

The court was of the opinion that [ PERSON ] was suffering from a psychiatric disease imperatively requiring inpatient treatment , this being the only way to improve her health status . The patient refuses medical help or medicines , thereby endangering her own health . Against the final order a petition for review was filed by [ PERSON ] . ... She [ argued that she had ] refused medical help only because her trust in doctors had been shattered . Her letters written , sometimes in injurious tone , to various authorities could be evaluated as the outrages of a person having grown tired of seeking the truth but could not represent imminent endangering behaviour or a ground for committing her to imminent inpatient psychiatric treatment . There had been no elements whatsoever indicating that the life or health of others had been in imminent danger . She endangered solely her own health ; and the authorities\u2019 measure restricting personal liberty could not override her right to self - determination enjoyed as a person of full capacity .... On this question of law , an issue of principle , ORG has to date not taken a published decision of principle and in the interest of developing the jurisprudence it is necessary to carry out a review of the final order . ...", "The Health Act contains sui generis regulation in respect of psychiatric patients . Because of the nature of the disease , the law contains a system of special and interlinked provisions . These provisions allow , among other measures , for deprivation of personal liberty subject to sufficient statutory guarantees . Under LAW , psychiatric patients may be subjected to inpatient treatment in CARDINAL cases : if they consent thereto , if they are in a state endangering other persons and therefore in need of emergency inpatient treatment , and if mandatory inpatient treatment is ordered in a court decision ...", "Under LAW , emergency treatment ( section CARDINAL ) is linked to imminent endangering behaviour whereas mandatory inpatient treatment ( section CARDINAL ) is linked to endangering behaviour . Circumstances giving rise to imminent endangering behaviour or endangering behaviour are differentiated on the basis of acute disturbance or disturbance of the patient \u2019s psychic status , respectively . If , in consequence of an acute disturbance of the patient \u2019s psychic status , the patient imminently and seriously endangers his or others\u2019 life or limb ( imminent endangering behaviour ) or , in consequence of a disturbance of the patient \u2019s psychic status , the patient may significantly endanger his or others\u2019 life or limb , but the nature of the disease does not justify emergency treatment , the court may order mandatory inpatient treatment ( Health Act , section CARDINAL ( b ) ( c ) ) .

( ORG no . Pfv . III.CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted the following elements concerning the law on the subject matter of the application in various NORP jurisdictions .", "According to the findings of ORG financed by ORG in DATE on the \u201c Compulsory Admission and Involuntary Treatment of Mentally Ill Patients \u2013 Legislation and Practice in GPE Member GPE \u201d , the legal criteria qualifying a person for involuntary placement in a psychiatric facility differ widely across the Member GPE of ORG . The research focused on CARDINAL GPE Member GPE but its findings can be generalised as regards all CARDINAL Member States of ORG , only the number of GPE belonging to different models varies .", "When determining the criteria for compulsory admission , a basic conflict between a medical model and a civil liberties approach can be identified . These CARDINAL approaches can also be characterised as the \u201c parens patriae \u201d approach or the \u201c police powers \u201d approach , respectively . The medical model emphasises the need for treatment as a sufficient prerequisite for the involuntary confinement of a mentally ill patient . Supporters of the medical model consider compulsory admission to be essential and inevitable to secure treatment for patients whose mental illness interferes with their capacity to accept treatment on a voluntary basis . Similarly , the \u201c parens patriae \u201d approach is the public - policy power of the ORG to act as the parent of an individual who is in need of protection but can not protect himself . On the basis of this power , ORG authorities may make decisions regarding mental health treatment on behalf of one who is mentally incompetent to make the decision himself . A strict human - rights approach accepts forced hospital admission only when a mentally ill person threatens to do harm to others or himself . This is the only criterion ( \u201c dangerousness criterion \u201d ) justifying or permitting someone to be admitted involuntarily . This is similar to the police - power approach which authorises and requires the ORG only to interfere in order to protect the public order and the rights and safety of others .", "The first and common condition for compulsory admission is the existence of a \u201c mental disorder \u201d . This term is generally not defined by legislation and is given a wide definition in practice . Among the States covered by the comparative analysis , only GPE restricts this condition to \u201c psychosis \u201d . The same restricted meaning is given to this term in practice in GPE . Schizophrenia is generally included in the notion of psychosis . Therefore it can be concluded that schizophrenia is regarded in the Member States of ORG as a mental disorder of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement .", "As to the further conditions of compulsory admission , danger to oneself or to others is not an essential prerequisite everywhere . It is completely absent as a criterion in GPE and GPE . A serious threat of harm to the person himself and/or to others is an essential prerequisite for compulsory admission in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the GPE . GPE , including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE apply both the dangerousness criterion and the need - for - treatment criterion , as alternatives , to admit mentally ill patients involuntarily . The dangerousness criterion is not applied in a uniform manner in GPE ORG . GPE qualify the level of danger required for admitting a person involuntarily , others do not . The defined thresholds , however , are rather vague , requiring that the danger to health or safety of the person concerned or to the public be \u201c serious \u201d , \u201c immediate \u201d , \u201c significant \u201d or \u201c substantial \u201d . Some countries include only public threats , while others add the element of possible harm to the patient himself . In some jurisdictions , the risk of deterioration of the patient \u2019s health is expressly mentioned in the law ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ( in respect of certain psychiatric conditions ) ) , but it is not clear whether and to what extent the risk of deterioration is included by judicial interpretation in the danger to one \u2019s own health in other GPE . Among those countries that stipulate the need for treatment as a criterion , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE additionally emphasise the lack of insight by the patient .", "Guardianship rules may also affect the conditions of involuntary admission and treatment of patients with mental disorders . In GPE , there are CARDINAL different admission laws ( Unterbringungsgesetz ) in force in the public laws of the L\u00e4nder and CARDINAL guardianship law ( Betreuungsgesetz ) in force in the federal civil law , regulating the detention of mentally ill persons under certain circumstances . The public - law aspect is fundamentally determined by a decision of ORG , confirming an overall \u201c right to be ill \u201d and largely exempting the society from responsibility for improving the condition of citizens by infringing upon their personal freedom . The function of public law is to avert danger to public order and security relating to mentally ill persons , whereas that of guardianship law is to secure appropriate personal , medical and economic care for those in need due to disability or illness . Such persons are taken care of by a court - appointed guardian who can decide on the necessity of psychiatric treatment , including hospitalisation .", "Similarly , in GPE , ORG authorises compulsory admission only if the person suffering from severe mental disorder is dangerous to himself or to other persons , whereas the LAW on the incapacity of adults ( guardianship ) is regarded as serving the protection of mentally ill persons .", "The same dichotomy is reflected in the law of GPE where different conditions are applicable depending on the initiator of compulsory admission : if it is initiated by a \u201c third party \u201d ( a relative or other private party ) , the person suffering from mental disorder rendering his consent impossible must be in a state that requires immediate care and constant supervision in a hospital , whereas if it is initiated by the police , it must be shown that the person whose mental disorder jeopardises law and order or public safety may cause danger to others .", "In GPE , if a police officer has reasonable grounds for believing that a person suffers from a mental disorder and that there is a serious likelihood of that person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or to others , the police may take the person into custody . If confinement is initiated by other persons , it is sufficient that a registered medical practitioner be satisfied that the person is suffering from a mental disorder .", "In GPE , compulsory admission is justified if the psychotic patient is either dangerous to self / others or if the prospect for recovery will diminish substantially if detention in a psychiatric ward will not take place . The involuntary admission of a patient to a NORP psychiatric ward will always be for a therapeutic reason ; the placement of incurably mentally disordered people without medical aims is illegal . The LAW on guardianship is applied to placement in nursing homes of incurably mentally disordered people .", "In GPE , involuntary treatment is allowed both due to \u201c need for treatment \u201d and \u201c dangerousness \u201d . For the purposes of \u201c need for treatment \u201d , the possible deterioration of the mental illness is expressly referred to . The process of ordering compulsory confinement is organised as a primarily medical decision - making one , similarly to GPE and GPE .", "In GPE , in addition to preventing acts of violence against himself or others , a person suffering from a severe psychiatric disorder can be admitted and treated involuntarily when this disorder makes the patient unable to look after his own well being , and ( or ) treatment is expected to improve his condition and reverse the deterioration of his mental health .", "In GPE , compulsory admission can be ordered by a court either if the person concerned represents real danger to himself / others as the result of a mental anomaly and he refuses treatment or if the absence of adequate treatment would entail a risk of further deterioration , of which the person himself is unaware .", "In GPE and GPE ) , the criteria for detention ( admission for assessment or treatment ) specify that it must be necessary either in the interests of the patient \u2019s health , or his safety , or for the protection of other persons . In the case of treatment orders of those with psychopathic disorder or mental impairment , there is a further condition , namely that treatment must be \u201c likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration \u201d of the condition in question . Compulsory admission for treatment is justified only if appropriate treatment is available for the person concerned .", "In GPE , psychiatric assistance without the consent of a patient is provided for not only if the patient behaves violently or threatens to cause personal injuries to himself or to another person but also if the patient with a mental health disorder has disclosed an inability to care for himself ( or for a person under his guardianship ) and his health might unavoidably and seriously deteriorate .", "NORP law also allows for compulsory hospitalisation of a mental patient on account of the risk of a serious deterioration of his health .", "In sum , the majority of the Member States of ORG perceive the risk of deterioration of the patient \u2019s health as justifying his compulsory hospitalisation if he refuses to receive treatment voluntarily . In those GPE where compulsory hospitalisation is more restricted , guardianship laws are applied to provide treatment to persons suffering from a mental disorder without their consent .", "As regards the condition that the person detained under LAW ( e ) must be reliably shown to be of unsound mind , the expertise required to assess the medical criteria for admitting a person involuntarily are heterogeneous across LAW . The laws of several GPE permit doctors other than trained psychiatrists to be involved in the initial medical assessment of the persons concerned not only in emergency cases but also during routine involuntary placement procedures ( and thorough assessments are performed by psychiatrists only when a patient is admitted to a psychiatric facility ) , whereas the expert testimony of a psychiatrist is mandatory in the remaining countries ( GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and some of the CARDINAL NORP L\u00e4nder ) . Most Member GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) require the opinion or certificate of CARDINAL expert ( but not necessarily all of them being a psychiatrist and not necessarily prior to ordering compulsory admission ) ; the opinion of CARDINAL expert is sufficient in GPE , GPE and the GPE . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the decision is left to psychiatrists or other health care professionals , whereas in CARDINAL other GPE the decision is made either by judges , prosecutors , mayors or other agencies independent from the medical system ( e.g. social workers in GPE ) .", "GPE require that less restrictive treatment options be considered before ordering compulsory hospitalisation . In GPE , compulsory admission is applicable only when there is no other adequate treatment option . In practice , this is equivalent to the patient \u2019s refusing voluntary treatment . In GPE and GPE ) the criteria for detention specify that the patient must be suffering from a mental disorder \u201c of a nature or degree \u201d which makes it \u201c appropriate \u201d for the patient to receive assessment or treatment in hospital . In effect , this means that treatment in the community must be impractical or impossible , the latter being most commonly because the patient can not be relied upon to be compliant with assessment or treatment on a voluntary basis . Compulsory outpatient treatment as a possible less restrictive alternative to compulsory hospitalisation is mentioned in the laws of CARDINAL GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that from the academic literature it was evident that NORP countries recognised dangerousness and incapacity to consent to treatment as CARDINAL separate issues in their mental health systems . Most provided for involuntary treatment separately on both grounds ( e.g. GPE ) , some only on the basis of incapacity ( e.g. GPE ) , but they did not conflate the CARDINAL issues .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE \u2013 CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u2013 the NORP ORG accepted a constitutional complaint lodged by a convicted felon committed to a psychiatric hospital as a measure of correction and prevention , holding that the relevant legislation in GPE - Palatinate was unconstitutional . ORG summarised the case as follows :", "\u201c Medical treatment performed against the natural will of a person who , as a measure of correction and prevention , has been committed to an institution ( compulsory treatment ) is an especially serious encroachment on the person \u2019s fundamental right to physical integrity under Article CARDINAL sentence CARDINAL of LAW ) . The legislature is not as a matter of principle prevented from permitting such encroachments . This also applies to a treatment which serves to achieve the objective of the measure , i.e. is to enable the person committed to an institution to be released . The legal interest of the person \u2019s own freedom , which is protected as a fundamental right ( LAW ) , may be suitable to justify such an encroachment if due to his or her illness , the person lacks insight into the gravity of his or her illness and the necessity of treatment measures , or is unable to act according to such insight . To the extent that under this condition , an authorisation to perform compulsive treatment is to be recognised by way of exception , this does not establish a \u201c reason - based sovereignty \u201d of state bodies over the holder of fundamental rights in such a way that the will of the latter may be disregarded merely because it deviates from average preferences or appears to be unreasonable from an outside perspective . Compulsory treatment measures may only be used if they are promising with regard to the objective of the treatment that justifies their use and if they do not involve burdens to the person affected which are out of proportion to the benefit that can be expected . \u201d [ press release ]", "ORG held in particular as follows :", "\u201c Zwangsma\u00dfnahmen d\u00fcrfen ferner nur als letztes NORP eingesetzt werden , wenn mildere NORP keinen Erfolg versprechen ...

At any rate in case of planned treatment measures , a sufficiently specific announcement is necessary which provides the person affected with the possibility of seeking legal protection in good time . To preserve proportionality , it is essential for compulsive medication to be ordered and supervised by a physician . To ensure proportionality and the effectiveness of legal protection , it is necessary to extensively document treatment measures taken against the will of the person affected . With a view to the special situation - related threats to fundamental rights to which the person who is committed to an institution is exposed , it must furthermore be ensured that compulsory treatment performed in order to achieve the objective of the measure of correction and prevention be preceded by a review taking place under conditions which secure its independence of the institution to which the person is committed . It is for the legislature to elaborate the way in which this will be done .", "The essential substantive and procedural prerequisites of the encroachment require legal regulation . \u201d [ press release ]", "CARDINAL .
