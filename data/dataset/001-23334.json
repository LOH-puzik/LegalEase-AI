FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON , in the d\u00e9partement of FAC ( GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , of the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant has worked as an accountant for various accountancy firms since DATE . In DATE he applied to be registered as a chartered accountant ( a member of the ordre des experts - comptables , ORG ) on the basis of his professional experience , under section CARDINAL bis of Ordinance no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE .", "The procedure laid down in the ORG provides for the possibility of becoming a chartered accountant on the basis of professional experience ; candidates must demonstrate that they have CARDINAL years\u2019 experience in accounting or auditing , including DATE in posts or on assignments entailing substantial administrative , financial and accounting responsibilities . Applications are considered by a regional committee , and unsuccessful candidates may appeal to ORG set up to implement section CARDINAL bis of the Ordinance of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "On DATE ORG regional committee refused the applicant \u2019s application on the ground that he had not produced certificates attesting that he had CARDINAL years\u2019 experience in posts or on assignments entailing substantial administrative , financial and accounting responsibilities . It held that , as a result , the applicant did not \u201c fully satisfy the requirements laid down in the relevant provisions \u201d and could not \u201c be regarded as having acquired experience comparable to that of a well - qualified chartered accountant , as is required by section CARDINAL bis of the Ordinance of DATE \u201d .", "The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG , arguing that the assessment of his professional experience had been incorrect and that the regional committee had infringed the principle of equality of opportunity in prematurely refusing his application . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , giving the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c The candidate was considered on the basis of the application he submitted .", "As a consequence of an appeal , the ORG rehears the case as a whole . At that stage , the candidate had the opportunity to produce additional information in support of his appeal . Consequently , the procedure followed did not give rise to any discrimination against him .", "In order to satisfy the first requirement laid down in the Decree cited above , candidates must have discharged accounting or auditing duties on a regular basis for DATE .", "From an examination of the candidate \u2019s application it appears that he satisfies that requirement .", "In order to satisfy the second requirement , candidates must have assumed substantial responsibilities in CARDINAL fields \u2013 administrative , financial and accounting DATE for DATE . To qualify as substantial , such responsibilities must be exercised within large institutions that raise complex problems , and must be accompanied by decision - making powers enabling the person in whom they are vested to commit the firm by which he is employed and to influence its future .", "As evidence of the responsibilities he has assumed , the candidate has produced various certificates .", "Only those from ORG and PERSON are signed by authorised persons .", "The certificate issued by Mr Le Petit , the chairman of ORG , states that the candidate performed the duties of a management auditor and did not have any real decision - making powers .", "The candidate performed the duties of a managing director for DATE , as is attested by PERSON , the current managing director of ORG .", "With regard to the duties performed within ORG group ... and subsequently within ORG ... and ORG ... , the documents submitted do not give a sufficiently clear indication of the extent of the powers enjoyed by the candidate in administrative and financial matters ; in that respect , there is no proof of such powers having been delegated to him . Moreover , the documents and organisation charts giving details of those duties have been drawn up by the candidate himself and , in some cases , are signed by persons outside the companies or by former managers and can not be treated as ORG certificates .", "As regards the remainder of the candidate \u2019s career , there is no evidence in his application that the posts or assignments concerned have entailed responsibilities of the kind required by the statutory provisions .", "Accordingly , he is unable to show that he has PERCENT five years\u2019 experience in posts entailing substantial administrative , financial and accounting responsibilities .", "It follows from the foregoing that Mr GPE does not satisfy the second requirement laid down in LAW of DATE . \u201d", "The applicant applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat to have ORG decision set aside . He argued , in particular , that the proceedings before ORG did not satisfy the requirements of LAW on account of their secret and anonymous nature . He submitted in that connection that the committee \u2019s decision did not contain any indication of its composition , so that its members remained anonymous . He also observed that the committee had given its decision without holding a public hearing and without hearing evidence from him .", "In a judgment of DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the application on the following grounds :", "\u201c Outward legality", "... No provision of a statute or of regulations has conferred the status of a court on ORG set up to implement section CARDINAL bis of the Ordinance of DATE . The provisions cited above are therefore not applicable to it .", "Internal legality", "By DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of the Decree of DATE , as amended , registration as a chartered accountant is conditional on the candidate \u2019s having \u2018 CARDINAL years\u2019 experience in accounting or auditing , including DATE in posts or on assignments entailing substantial administrative , financial and accounting responsibilities\u2019 .", "It does not appear from the documents in the file that ORG erred in law or made a manifest error of assessment in holding that Mr GPE , who has practised in various companies and accounting firms since DATE and satisfies the above - mentioned requirement of having DATE experience , did not have DATE experience in exercising substantial responsibilities of the kind referred to in the Decree of DATE cited above . Mr GPE accordingly has no grounds for seeking the setting aside of the decision of CARDINAL DATE in which ORG refused him leave to apply to be registered as a chartered accountant . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL bis of the Ordinance of DATE provides :", "\u201c Persons who have carried on an occupation entailing accounting or auditing duties and who have consequently acquired experience comparable to that of a well - qualified chartered accountant , may be granted leave to apply ... to be registered as a member of the ordre with the status of chartered accountant . ... \u201d", "LAW DATE , as amended by Decree no .
