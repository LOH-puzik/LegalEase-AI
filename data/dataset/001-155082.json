On the applicant \u2019s admission to the intensive - care unit on DATE of the incident , the doctor treating her had noted \u201c depressive , self - destructive thoughts against a background of psychotropic , anti - anxiety and antidepressant medication \u201d .

On DATE the CARDINAL psychiatrists submitted their unanimous report , concluding as follows :", "\u201c The letter of DATE ] suggests all the signs of melancholic major depression . ... These melancholic features are grounds for hospital admission or observation where necessary . ... These documents thus demonstrate beyond doubt that [ the applicant ] no longer felt able to control her actions ... she developed a transient dissociative state of depersonalisation , causing her to perform acts of extreme violence .

In a judgment of DATE ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges and the jury , endorsed the guilty verdict reached by the jury and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment . The judgment included reasons for the sentence . The court took into account the particularly heinous nature of the offences , holding :", "\u201c The accused \u2019s heavy family responsibilities and her painful feelings of isolation and dependence may account for a legitimate desire for greater personal freedom . Her mental fragility , depression and character no doubt made it more difficult to handle this desire and , through dialogue , to seek possible improvements within the limits of her specific circumstances , taking into consideration all those close to her .", "However , neither those factors , nor even a wish to escape from what she considered a dead - end situation through suicide , nor a lack of appropriate help , can provide a sufficient explanation for the acts of extreme violence which she resolved to commit , and carried out in cold blood .", "...", "In the specific circumstances relating both to the accused \u2019s character and to her living environment , the genuine difficulties experienced by her do not constitute mitigating factors , having regard to the extremely serious nature of the offences committed . \u201d", "As an ancillary penalty , the applicant was stripped of all titles , ranks and functions she held and was permanently deprived of certain rights in accordance with Articles DATE and DATE of LAW as in force at the material time . Lastly , the judgment was to be printed and publicly displayed in the municipality where the offence had been committed , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law , raising the same complaints as those submitted before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . With regard to the jury \u2019s guilty verdict , it observed that ORG had had to rule on a plurality of serious crimes ( concours mat\u00e9riel de crimes ) within the meaning of LAW and not a single act constituting several different offences ( d\u00e9lit collectif ) within the meaning of LAW , which required a unity of intent , and that the parties had agreed to the wording of the questions put to the jury . ORG pointed out that LAW did not require the court to be made up solely of professional judges , lawyers or experts and that the applicant had not adduced any specific evidence to justify her fear that the jury might not be impartial . Furthermore , the wording of the jury \u2019s guilty verdict in the form of a simple \u201c yes / no \u201d answer was prescribed by LAW . With regard to the applicant \u2019s criminal responsibility , ORG held that ORG judgment had indicated why the conditions for the application of LAW were not satisfied :", "\u201c In noting the accused \u2019s cold - blooded manner and her determination to carry out her crimes , the [ ORG ] judgment indicates the reason why ORG did not accept that the perpetrator had been suffering from any mental disturbance making her incapable of controlling her actions at the time of the events . \u201d", "As regards the reasons for the sentence , ORG held that there was no statutory provision prohibiting ORG precluded any mitigation of the perpetrator \u2019s guilt ; nor was there any statutory provision establishing that a decree of divorce in civil proceedings constituted res judicata in respect of criminal proceedings . Furthermore , the conclusions of ORG judgment to which the applicant had objected had not punished her for refusing to admit her own guilt but had indicated the reasons why ORG had not accepted that there were any mitigating circumstances .", "In addition , regarding the ancillary penalties , ORG pointed out that deprivation of functions and permanent withdrawal of certain civic rights were mandatory ancillary penalties ( Articles DATE of LAW ) for anyone sentenced to life imprisonment and therefore did not require any reasons . It further held that public display of a criminal conviction did not attain the minimum level of severity required by LAW . Lastly , the fact that no appeal lay against the jury \u2019s verdict ( LAW ) resulted from a provision which ORG had not applied in the judgment itself and which was therefore extraneous to the judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
