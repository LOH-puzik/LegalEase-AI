On DATE officers of ORG were patrolling the border between GPE and GPE in GPE , by the river PERSON . At TIME the officers noticed several cars approaching the river and heard the sound of a boat in the water . The officers approached CARDINAL of the cars and found cartons of cigarettes inside , which they suspected had been smuggled from GPE . The CARDINAL individuals who had been in the car , ORG , PERSON and ORG , were arrested . During the arrests ORG received a gunshot wound and the officers took him to a hospital in Jurbarkas ( hereinafter \u201c the hospital \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME mobile telephone began to ring and a border officer answered it . The caller stated that he would \u201c find and shoot \u201d the officer who had injured ORG subsequent forensic examination identified the caller \u2019s voice as probably ( tik\u0117tinai ) that of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant arrived at the hospital and approached the border officers guarding ORG The applicant used various swearwords towards the officers , demanded that they release PERSON and said that he would beat them up or kill them . It appears that no physical altercation occurred between the applicant and the officers and that the applicant subsequently left the hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened a pre - trial investigation against the applicant and several other individuals . The applicant was suspected , among other things , of threatening to murder or seriously injure law enforcement officers and obstructing and verbally abusing them in the exercise of their official duties , under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP district prosecutor ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) discontinued the pre - trial investigation against the applicant for lack of evidence . As to the words and statements used by the applicant in his interaction with the border officers ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the prosecutor noted that the applicant could have committed the administrative offence of minor hooliganism under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The prosecutor \u2019s decision was forwarded to ORG , instructing them to decide whether administrative proceedings against the applicant should be instituted . However , DATE a senior prosecutor annulled that decision and reopened the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date administrative proceedings were instituted against the applicant ; the information available to the ORG does not indicate which authority was in charge of them . On DATE ORG held that the applicant had committed the administrative offence of minor hooliganism when he had used swearwords in the presence of border officers in the hospital ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He was given a warning . The decision was not appealed against and became final after the expiry of the DATE time - limit for appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor charged the applicant with threatening to murder or seriously injure law enforcement officers , and insulting them in the exercise of their official duties , under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . The indictment alleged that the applicant had committed the offences in the hospital on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The case was transferred to ORG for examination on the merits but in DATE , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , the case was returned for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation , stating that the applicant \u2019s actions had not amounted to the criminal offence of threatening to murder or seriously injure the officers because there had not been any objective circumstances indicating that he could have carried out those threats . The prosecutor also held that the applicant could not be prosecuted for insulting the officers because he had already been given an administrative penalty for the same conduct ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 continuing the criminal proceedings against him would be in breach of the ne bis in idem principle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled the prosecutor \u2019s decision and reopened the investigation , noting that the administrative penalty given to the applicant \u201c did not automatically preclude \u201d the criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to a senior prosecutor at ORG but on DATE his appeal was dismissed . The senior prosecutor held that , in line with the case - law of the domestic courts , an administrative penalty did not preclude the institution of subsequent criminal proceedings concerning the same conduct ; however , in order to comply with the ne bis in idem principle , if a person was found guilty in the criminal proceedings , the previous administrative penalty had to be annulled or , if that was impossible , it had to be taken into account during sentencing . Accordingly , the prosecutor considered that the administrative penalty given to the applicant did not preclude the continuation of the criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal and overruled the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE . It held that criminal proceedings against the applicant could be continued only after the administrative penalty had been annulled , but since that had not been done , any further proceedings concerning the same conduct would be in breach of the ne bis in idem principle . However , on DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision , reiterating the reasoning of the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . That decision was not subject to any further appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the case was transferred to ORG for examination on the merits . The amended indictment alleged that the applicant had committed the offences set out in GPE CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW because of the words and statements which he had used when speaking to the border officers on the telephone ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and in the hospital on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
