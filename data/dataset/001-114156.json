NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in the GPE . The President decided not to disclose the applicant \u2019s identity to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant fled his native GPE on DATE and travelled to the GPE where he arrived on DATE and applied for asylum . He was subsequently joined in the GPE by his spouse and CARDINAL of their CARDINAL children , the latter born DATE . On unspecified dates , the applicant \u2019s spouse and CARDINAL daughters were all granted GPE residence permits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request by holding LAW DATE LAW relating to ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) against him . The Minister based this decision on the applicant \u2019s statements about his career from DATE to CARDINAL as an officer in the ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON Dowlati ( \u201c ORG / WAD \u201d ) ; the intelligence service during the former communist regime in GPE in which he had last held the rank of colonel , and the general official country assessment report ( algemeen ambtsbericht ) on GPE , drawn up on DATE by ORG . According to this official report , LAW could be held against virtually every NORP asylum seeker who , holding the rank of third lieutenant or higher , had worked during the communist regime for the ORG . Although this decision entailed that the applicant was no longer lawfully staying in the GPE and was obliged to leave the country , the Minister further decided that for the time being the applicant would not be expelled to GPE as it could not be excluded that , if returned to GPE , he would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE . In its judgment of DATE , ORG accepted the appeal and quashed the impugned decision . Although it agreed with the Minister \u2019s decision and pertaining reasoning to hold LAW against the applicant , it also held \u2013 referring to a ruling given on DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) and noting that the Minister had acknowledged that in GPE the applicant would be exposed to a risk of treatment proscribed by LAW that the Minister should also have examined whether the applicant had established that LAW constituted a sustained obstacle to his expulsion to GPE . Consequently , the Minister \u2019s examination had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister took a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s asylum request , holding that it could not be concluded from the applicant \u2019s account \u2013 viewed against the background of the current political and social situation in GPE \u2013 that there existed a real and foreseeable risk that the applicant , if returned to GPE , would be subjected to treatment in breach of LAW . The Minister decided again to hold LAW against the applicant and , furthermore , decided to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on the applicant . As to the applicant \u2019s reliance on his right to respect for his family life within the meaning of LAW in the GPE with his spouse , their children and CARDINAL grandchild born in the GPE in the meantime , the Minister found that the exclusion order entailed an interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under this provision but that the general interest outweighed the applicant \u2019s personal interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the Minister against the decision to impose an exclusion order . As this order was immediately enforceable and the objection did not have suspensive effect , he also filed a request with ORG of The Hague for a provisional measure , i.e. an injunction on his expulsion pending the objection proceedings . On DATE , the applicant also filed an appeal with ORG of The GPE against the decision to reject his asylum request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the impugned decision . It noted at the outset that , since no appeal had been filed against the judgment of DATE , the decision to hold LAW against the applicant had become final , and that the subject of the present appeal was the question whether the applicant had established that he would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by LAW if returned to GPE , and , if so , whether that risk constituted a sustained obstacle . Noting that , in contrast to the decision of QUANTITY DATE , it had been concluded in the impugned decision at issue that the applicant had not established the existence of a real risk of treatment in violation of LAW in case of his return to GPE , ORG found that this changed opinion had not been duly reasoned . Accordingly , it remitted the case to the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ; the successor to the Minister for ORG ) for a fresh decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , apparently at the applicant \u2019s request , the NORP mission in the GPE issued a written statement , confirming that the applicant \u201c is an NORP national and has not committed any crime against humanity during his duty in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister filed an appeal against the judgment of DATE with ORG . On DATE , ORG accepted this appeal , quashed the judgment of DATE and declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL September CARDINAL against the decision to reject his asylum request . Referring to a ruling it had given on DATE ( PERSON [ Immigration Law Reports \u2013 \u201c JV \u201d ] CARDINAL ) , ORG found that the applicant did not have an interest in a determination of his appeal since as long as the exclusion order which had also been imposed on him remained in force , the appeal in issue could never lead to lawful stay .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningen - rechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE granted the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction on his expulsion pending the proceedings on his objection to the decision to impose an exclusion order on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . The Deputy Minister noted that the decision to hold LAW against the applicant had become final and that for that reason an exclusion order could be imposed . The Deputy Minister held that the statement of the NORP mission in the GPE did not alter the decision , which had already become final , that LAW was applicable , as this statement did not provide any concrete elements to cast doubts on the correctness and completeness of the information contained in the official report of DATE . As regards LAW , the Deputy Minister found that the applicant , noting his asylum account and his activities in GPE , had established that he had well - founded fears for assuming that , if returned to GPE in the present day situation , he would run a real risk to be subjected to treatment proscribed by this provision . However , this did not entail that the applicant was eligible for a residence title . This was dependent on the question whether this risk constituted a sustained obstacle . On this point , the Deputy Minister concluded that it had not been established that this was the case and that there was no reason to hold that withholding a residence permit from the applicant was disproportionate . As regards LAW , the Deputy Minister reiterated that the decision to impose an exclusion order entailed an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his family life but , taking into account the guiding principles set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the cases of GPE v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALIX ) and PERSON v. the GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALXII ) , considered \u2013 with extensive reasoning \u2013 that the interest of public safety and national security , as well as the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others weighed more heavily than the applicant \u2019s interest in an undisturbed family life . The Deputy Minister concluded that the interference was justified and not in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was rejected on CARDINAL DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . It agreed with the Deputy Minister that the decision taken on DATE to hold LAW against the applicant had become final and that the applicant had not demonstrated that LAW constituted a sustained obstacle to his expulsion to GPE . As regard LAW , it held :", "\u201c It is not in dispute that the exclusion order entails interference in the appellant \u2019s family life . In assessing whether such interference is justified , the guiding principles as set out in the ruling of ORG DATE , JV CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( LOC v. GPE ) and supplemented in the ruling of DATE , JV QUANTITY ( GPE v. the GPE ) must explicitly be taken into consideration . In weighing the general interest of the ORG against the appellant \u2019s personal life not only the separate principles must be addressed but these must also be considered in their correlation . And it must also be examined whether the imposition of an exclusion order , having regard also to its consequences , is proportionate . There must be a fair balance between the interests involved .", "It is noted that the Deputy Minister , in reaching the decision , has taken into account the above principles , also referred to as \u201c the LOC criteria \u201d . On appeal , the appellant has merely submitted that in the impugned decision the Deputy Minister has not made an assessment based on the guiding principles but only considered that the interest of public safety and national security ought to outweigh the appellant \u2019s interest in an undisturbed family life . ORG considers that , in his criticism of the extensive assessment by the Deputy Minister , the appellant has not sufficiently focussed on ( parts of ) that assessment . In the opinion of ORG , the Deputy Minister could conclude that the exclusion order does not violate LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE . It upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In so far as the applicant relied on LAW held :", "\u201c In the decision of DATE , the Deputy Minister has balanced the general interest DATE which is served by the protection of public safety as well as the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others \u2013 against the alien \u2019s personal interest in exercising his family life in the GPE with his wife and children and in this has attributed decisive weight to the general interest . In so doing , the Deputy Minister has had regard to the \u201c guiding principles \u201d formulated by ORG in the judgment of ... GPE v. GPE and the additional criteria cited in ... GPE v. the GPE . The Deputy Minister has attached substantial weight to the fact that LAW has been held against the alien . The Deputy Minister has further taken into account that the alien has lived outside of the GPE for the greatest part of his life and can therefore be considered capable of independently fending for himself in another country . The Deputy Minister has further adopted the position that , although a considerable period of time has elapsed since the facts occurred for which the alien is being held responsible , in view of their gravity the interest of public order weighs more heavily . As regards the alien \u2019s family members , the Deputy Minister has taken the view that , although at the time the decision was taken there was an objective obstacle to the family life at issue being exercised in GPE , this did not alter the fact that it had not appeared that there was an objective obstacle to family life being exercised in another country . According to the Deputy Minister , it could be expected of the alien \u2019s family members to follow him to another country . The Deputy Minister has found it to be of relevance that DATE at the time of the decision \u2013 three children of the alien had reached adulthood whereas it had not appeared that there existed \u201c more than normal emotional ties \u201d between them and the alien . Also , CARDINAL of the children was DATE at the time of the decision DATE and thus , according to the Deputy Minister , did not require daily care by the parents . According to the Deputy Minister , it could also not be excluded that this child , in her GPE company , could adjust in a country other than the GPE . The Deputy Minister has lastly considered that the family members could also maintain contact with the alien without the latter staying in the GPE .", "Having noted the decision of DATE , ORG has correctly not accepted the alien \u2019s argument that the Deputy Minister had given insufficient reasons for the finding that the exclusion order does not violate LAW . The fact that the alien has not been criminally convicted does not mean that the holding against him of LAW is an insufficient basis for interference with his right to respect for this family life .", "The grievance fails . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . On DATE , LAW DATE was replaced by LAW . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW . LAW ( PERSON ) applies to proceedings under LAW , unless indicated otherwise in this LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an alien is eligible for a residence permit for the purpose of asylum if , inter alia ,", "- he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention , or", "- he or she has established that he or she has well - founded reasons to assume that he or she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . If the exclusion clause under LAW of the CARDINAL ORG is held against an asylum seeker , the alien concerned loses any protection which might have been available under this LAW and , consequently , becomes ineligible for a residence permit for asylum under LAW of LAW ( article CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , judicial review by ORG and ORG in administrative law appeal proceedings only addresses whether the executive authority concerned has exercised its administrative powers in a reasonable manner and , in the light of the interests at stake , could reasonably have taken the impugned decision ( marginale toetsing ) . Both before ORG and ORG it is possible to apply for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that a foreign national may be declared an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , on the ground , inter alia , that he or she poses a danger to public safety or national security and/or that it is in the interests of the international relations of the GPE . An exclusion order entails a ban on residing in or visiting the GPE .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order , which is immediately enforceable , can be challenged in administrative law appeal proceedings under the terms of LAW . Such appeal proceedings do not have automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that an alien who stays in the GPE while he or she knows that an exclusion order has been imposed on him or her commits a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of CARDINAL CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros . In accordance with the discretionary powers held by the public prosecution service ( opportuniteitsbeginsel ) , it remains for that service to decide in each individual case and in line with the general policy rules defined by ORG ( College van procureursgeneraal ) whether to prosecute or not .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order may be revoked , upon request , if the alien concerned has been residing outside the GPE for an uninterrupted period of DATE ( article DATE of LAW ) . Such revocation entitles the alien to seek readmission to GPE territory subject to the conditions that are applicable to every alien .", "CARDINAL . The implementation as from DATE of ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE ( on common standards and procedures in Member GPE for returning illegally staying third - country nationals ) has no consequences in respect of persons on whom an exclusion order has been imposed and which has obtained the force of res iudicata . Exclusion orders which are being challenged in administrative appeal proceedings or in respect of which a request for revocation has been filed may be replaced by an entry ban ( inreisverbod ) within the meaning of the Directive and a decision to that effect can be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to article CARDINAL of LAW , a decision rejecting an alien \u2019s request for admission to the GPE automatically has , amongst others , the following legal consequences :", "- the alien is no longer lawfully residing in the GPE ;", "- he / she is required to leave the GPE within DATE ;", "- officials entrusted with the supervision of aliens are authorised DATE if the alien has not voluntarily left the GPE within the delay fixed for this purpose DATE to proceed with his / her effective removal from the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the preceding Aliens Act DATE , a separate decision was given in respect of each of these legal consequences which could each be challenged in distinct proceedings . This is no longer possible under LAW DATE and a negative decision on an admission request is therefore known as a so called \u201c multi - purpose decision \u201d ( meeromvattende beschikking ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the provisions of ORG ) , in force as from DATE , and article CARDINAL of LAW DATE an alien who does not have lawful residence in the GPE is not entitled to any benefits in kind , facilities and social security benefits issued by decision of an administrative authority . Derogation is possible if the benefits relate to education for minors , the provision of essential medical care ( i.e. prevention of life - threatening situations or loss of essential functions ) , the prevention of situations that would jeopardise public health of pose a risk for third parties ( for instance prevention of infectious diseases , or care related to pregnancy and childbirth ) or the provision of legal assistance to the alien concerned .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling of DATE ( PERSON ) , ORG considered that the decision to proceed with effective removal does not constitute an independent partial decision within the multi - purpose decision on a request for a residence permit , that the competence to proceed with effective removal is a legal effect ipso iure ( rechtsgevolg van rechtswege ) of the refusal of such a request , and that this competence is not of a discretionary nature . Although reiterating that in principle no further remedy lies against a multi - purpose decision as the lawfulness of its consequences has already been judicially determined in the administrative appeal proceedings challenging a refusal to admit the alien concerned , ORG also accepted that in certain exceptional circumstances , such as a relevant change of circumstances having occurred during the delay between the refusal of the admission request and an act aimed at effective removal ( daadwerkelijke uitzettingshandeling ) , an objection ( bezwaar ) and subsequent appeal ( beroep ) may be filed against an act aimed at effective removal . Under the terms of article CARDINAL of LAW , such an act can be equated with a formal decision within the meaning of LAW which can be challenged in separate administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A refusal on the basis of LAW of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention to grant an asylum - related residence permit does not necessarily imply that the alien concerned will be effectively removed to his or her country of origin if that would be in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL rulings handed down on , respectively , CARDINAL and DATE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG noted that , according to article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a refusal to grant asylum entailed that the person concerned should leave the GPE voluntarily , failing which he or she could be expelled . It accepted that an alien \u2013 who was denied entry pursuant to LAW but who could not be expelled to his or her country of origin on the basis of a risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of LAW can be denied a residence permit . It did however underline the legislator \u2019s apparent wish to limit the size of this group as much as possible . Where an asylum seeker is able to demonstrate that LAW constitutes a sustained obstacle to his or her expulsion to the country of origin , , the immigration authorities had not dealt with the question whether the expulsion of the persons concerned would be in breach of LAW , as they had first examined whether and concluded that the exclusion clause of LAW applied . ORG concluded that , therefore , the immigration authorities\u2019 examination of these cases had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL . These rulings resulted in an amendment to the relevant rules . Where it has been established that a person , for reasons based on LAW , can not be expelled to his or her country of origin but who , pursuant to LAW , is ineligible for any kind of residence permit , no act aimed at effective removal will be undertaken , at least for as long as these reasons exist . However , no residence title will be issued to the alien concerned who remains under the obligation to leave the GPE at his or her own motion . It further remains possible to proceed with his or her effective removal as soon as this no longer entails a risk of treatment contrary to LAW in the country of origin or to proceed with removal to a third ORG willing to accept the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . Eligibility for an eventual temporary regular residence permit may arise when the obstacle based on LAW return to his / her country of origin is of a sustained nature . In practice , such a situation may arise after a period of unlawful residence in the GPE of the alien concerned for DATE whilst Article CARDINAL continues to stand in the way of removal to his / her country of origin and without any prospect of change in that situation in the foreseeable future , and where the alien concerned has demonstrated that despite his / her best efforts there is no possibility for him / her to relocate to a third country , and where the continued withholding of a residence permit would be disproportional .", "CARDINAL .
