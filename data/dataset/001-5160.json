She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "", "On DATE the applicant gave birth to a daughter , T. After having received a report from the child welfare centre in DATE indicating certain shortcomings of the applicant \u2019s care of ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON started an investigation into the matter . It made several visits to the applicant \u2019s home . The applicant was also provided with various supporting measures , including the assistance of a home help , a family guidance counsellor and a so - called contact family . Furthermore , for some time the applicant and her daughter were staying with a foster family and for another period of time they were admitted to a children \u2019s psychiatric clinic .", "ORG investigation ended with the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s care of T. was deficient and constituted a risk to ORG \u2019s health and development . As a consequence , T. should be placed with foster parents . As the applicant had discontinued some of the supporting measures she had been provided with , ORG considered that the placement could not be realised on a voluntary basis . In DATE , it therefore applied to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON for a care order concerning ORG The application was made pursuant to LAW on ORG ( lagen med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "ORG held a hearing in the case , during which it heard the applicant , her counsel , ORG \u2019s counsel and representatives of ORG . It also heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the applicant . ORG \u2019s counsel supported the ORG \u2019s application .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG rejected ORG application . Having noted that the application was based on alleged deficiencies in the applicant \u2019s physical care of her daughter and in the emotional contact between them , the court gave the following reasons for its judgment :", "( Translation )", "\u201c With respect to [ the applicant \u2019s ] practical care of [ T. ] , the investigation does not show that there are such serious deficiencies as regards personal hygiene , diet and clothing that the child could be considered badly cared for . Accordingly , there is no reason to order care under [ LAW ] on this ground .", "As regards the other aspects of the care of [ T. ] , the [ court ] first notes that [ the applicant ] gives the impression of being immature and apparently has difficulties in fully understanding her responsibilities as a parent and the needs of a small child . According to assessments made during the investigation , this has led to certain reactions from [ T. ] . She has , inter alia , avoided eye contact with [ the applicant ] on some occasions , dissociated herself from her and failed to react when confronted with strangers or when separated [ from the applicant ] . It is true that these could be considered as worrying signs , but they do not express , in [ the court \u2019s ] view , any permanent disturbance in [ T. \u2019s ] ability to relate to other people or other injuries . The question is then whether [ the applicant \u2019s ] difficulties as a parent will henceforth entail such deficiencies in the care of [ T. ] that there is a palpable risk of impairment of the health and development of the child . In this respect , [ the court ] notes that [ the applicant ] has demonstrated that she is able to accept help and that an improvement has been brought about through the assistance of [ ORG ] . She has also a continuous positive attitude to [ ORG ] and is prepared to accept its assistance . Furthermore , the family \u2019s situation is generally more favourable since [ the applicant ] has found employment and [ T. ] is with the childminder during TIME . According to the childminder , who gave a reliable impression when giving evidence , the care is working well and [ T. \u2019s ] behaviour during DATE and when brought to and taken home from the childminder does not differ from that of other children . Further , the prospects of a positive development of the relationship between [ the applicant ] and [ T. ] will probably be better after the demanding period of infancy . [ The applicant \u2019s ] social network , principally her parents who have realised her need of support , also contributes in making things easier for [ the applicant ] and provides [ T. ] with normal relationships with other people . Even if [ the applicant ] has been very negative towards the efforts of the family guidance counsellor , she has demonstrated that she is aware of her difficulties and has not categorically rejected the assistance from the social authorities . Consequently , in the [ court \u2019s ] view , it can not be considered hopeless for the social authorities to attain a contact based on mutual trust with [ the applicant ] and provide her with continuous supporting measures trough persons whom she can regard as role models . In these circumstances , [ the court ] considers that [ the applicant \u2019s ] situation does not entail the clear risk of impairment to [ T. \u2019s ] development which is required for compulsory measures under [ the DATE Act ] . \u201d", "ORG appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , which held a further hearing in the case , during which it heard the same persons as the inferior court . CARDINAL of the witnesses who had appeared before ORG gave evidence also before ORG . In addition , the appellate court heard evidence from a psychologist proposed by ORG . The psychologist , who gave expert evidence , had not met the applicant or her daughter . ORG \u2019s counsel recommended the appeal be granted .", "On DATE ORG reversed the appealed judgment and , accordingly , ordered that T. be taken into care . The court gave the following reasons :", "( Translation )", "\u201c ORG shares ORG view that the physical care of [ T. ] is not deficient in such a way as to give reason for a care order under the [ CARDINAL Act ] .", "What has emerged from the statements in the case , principally the report submitted by [ ORG ] and the report on the situation in the home from the family guidance counsellor but also the report from the psychologist [ ORG ] acting as expert witness for ORG in ORG , is that serious shortcomings exist in the care of [ T. ] as regards [ the applicant \u2019s ] ability to communicate and be emotionally approachable as well as her ability to console ; in brief , shortcomings in the relationship between [ the applicant ] and [ T. ] which , given [ T. \u2019s ] age , presumably will lead to a palpable risk to [ T. \u2019s ] health and development .", "The investigation into the case reveals that the support given to [ the applicant ] has resulted in mother and daughter beginning to interact well , but that [ the applicant ] still would require considerable support for a long period of time in the form of , inter alia , a family guidance counsellor in the home and closer contact with [ the Children \u2019s Psychiatric Clinic ] \u2013 along with the support of the childminder and other parts of her social network , most of all her parents \u2013 in order for [ T. ] to receive the requisite care and attention . The alternative is that [ T. ] may bond with another adult in a foster family who , during DATE of her life , would be able to give her the loving care she needs without contact with the mother being broken .", "As concerns [ the applicant \u2019s ] ability to meet [ T. \u2019s ] care needs with the help of supporting measures it should be noted that [ the applicant ] , in many respects in her contacts in her working life and with [ ORG ] and ORG , has shown immaturity and dependence on others and also an ambivalent attitude towards the various supporting measures . Against this background and since both the help offered and the help requested have materialised only to a limited extent , there is reason to assume that [ the applicant ] does not possess the ability or the strength to utilise voluntarily the immense support required to give [ T. ] the necessary care . Instead , in order to secure such care for [ T. ] , it will probably be necessary to place her outside her home with foster parents in accordance with ORG care plan . As [ the applicant ] does not consent to this and there are such deficiencies in the care of [ T. ] that there is a palpable risk of her health and development being impaired , the requisite circumstances exist for [ T. ] to be taken into care under LAW , subsection CARDINAL and LAW of the [ DATE Act ] . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "", "On DATE ORG decided to place T. with foster parents in GPE , QUANTITY from Nordmaling . The decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE . ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "On DATE , in its review of the case under the provisions of Section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG decided to prolong the public care of T. The decision was based on a report dated DATE , drawn up by officers of ORG . The report concluded that ORG was in need of further care and it was not considered that the applicant \u2019s situation had changed in such a positive way as to give cause for moving T. back home . The applicant was still considered incapable of taking care of T.", "The applicant appealed against the decision . ORG decided that ORG \u2019s further need for care should be examined at FAC at ORG .", "Before ORG the applicant submitted that , on a voluntary basis , she was now willing to accept the continuation of ORG \u2019s placement in a family home during a transitional period , and further that she admitted that she was in need of support in taking care of T. ORG argued that ORG was still in need of care under LAW . T. \u2019s legal counsel also opposed to a termination of the care order .", "In DATE the applicant requested that the foster family placement of T. be terminated . On DATE ORG rejected this request .", "Following the termination of the examination at the clinic at ORG ordered the termination of the care under LAW by judgment of DATE . In its reasons the court stated that the decision of CARDINAL DATE to take T. into care was , inter alia , based on a statement by a psychologist which concluded that DATE are a very important period in a child \u2019s life . In considering the question of termination the court gave special weight to the fact that T. was now DATE . The court also considered it to be important that the applicant was now aware that she was in need of support in her care of T. and that she understood that ORG could move back home only after a transitional period and not immediately . The court concluded that the applicant at the time was not lacking the ability to take care of T. in such a way that T. \u2019s needs of emotional security and stimulus would be seriously neglected in the case of a reunion between mother and daughter .", "The judgment was appealed against by ORG . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal for the following reasons :", "( Translation )", "\u201c The initial care order for [ T. ] was based on the fact that , in several aspects , there were serious shortcomings in [ the applicant \u2019s ] ability to provide [ T. ] with the care she needed in view of her age and development , inter alia with regard to the possibilities of letting [ T. ] adequately interact with an adult . Although the matter of interaction does not seem as crucial DATE , the facts of the case DATE especially the results of the child psychiatric examination and the hearing of the expert , [ GPE ] \u2013 indicate that there is still a substantial lack in the ability of [ the applicant ] to provide care . These shortcomings can be assumed to be of such a character as to lead to a palpable risk to [ T. \u2019s ] health and development , should steps not be taken in order to handle them .", "ORG has , in this respect , made the assessment that adequate care for [ T. ] can not be provided in her own home but that it is necessary for [ T. ] to stay with a foster family while [ the applicant ] inter alia through continued contacts with [ ORG ] gains strength and develops so that she on the one hand learns to better understand and interpret [ T. \u2019s ] signals , CARDINAL the other hand is motivated and realises as well the need as the ability to accept the relatively extensive supporting measures necessary to eliminate the shortcomings in her ability to provide care . The reason for this is to make it possible for [ the applicant ] , with continuing supporting measures , to take care of [ T. ] in her own home after a gradual termination of the placement with foster parents .", "In particular as regards the implementation of a transfer from the foster home to the own home the expert has highlighted the risks for [ T. \u2019s ] health and development of a more abrupt termination of the ongoing placement with foster parents and has recommended that such a transfer in order not to harm [ T. ] be done gradually over a lengthy period with , for example , mother and child staying at [ the Children \u2019s Psychiatric Clinic ] and with measures supporting interaction , and that it is then continued with personal and other supporting steps in the own home .", "[ The applicant ] , who has now accepted that there are shortcomings in her ability to provide care and that , at present , there is also a risk for [ T. ] being harmed if she were to be taken care of in [ the applicant \u2019s ] home , has also expressed that DATE she is willing to consent to continued foster home placement for an undetermined period of time and that she accepts also otherwise the supporting measures in the form of contacts with [ ORG ] , personal assistance in the own home etc . necessary in order for her to be able to give her daughter the care she needs .", "The previous decision by [ ORG ] as regards the need for a care order was made in the light of the fact that [ the applicant ] was deemed to lack the ability and strength to utilise voluntarily the support required to give [ T. ] necessary care in her own home and that a placement outside the home was therefore necessary . At that time [ the applicant ] did not consent to that form of care .", "Taking into account what has previously occurred and not least the results of the psychiatric examination and the hearing of the expert , there are also DATE grounds for doubt as regards [ the applicant \u2019s ] ability to realise the need for necessary support in order to be able to provide care for [ T. ] in her own home . In this respect no decisive change seems to have taken place as regards [ the applicant \u2019s ] own personal development since [ T. ] was taken into care but [ T. ] is still in need of care outside her own home . Care in a foster home is necessary DATE not only because a sudden discontinuation in itself would be harmful for [ T. ] but foremost because [ T. ] can not be expected to receive the necessary care in her own home even if [ the applicant ] is given special support . In contrast to the previous situation , however , [ the applicant ] now consents to a placement of her daughter with a foster home for a transitional period .", "In the light of [ the applicant \u2019s ] attitude as regards the question of further care outside her own home it must first be assessed whether the necessary care for [ T. ] can be provided on a voluntary basis . These measures would consist of a placement with foster parents until further notice and of an immediately initiated continuing and active work by ORG in order to motivate and try to make [ the applicant ] realise as well [ T. \u2019s ] need of care as her own possibilities to meet this need with the help of active support . By a gradually more intensified right of access , [ T. ] can be transferred to her own home when both [ T. ] and [ the applicant ] are deemed mature enough to handle that .", "The question at present is not , however , whether [ the applicant ] has the ability or the strength to meet the necessary extensive and interfering measures needed as well before a transfer is possible as , if it is carried out , after [ T. ] is placed again in her own home , but primarily whether [ the applicant ] is likely to interfere with an ongoing voluntary placement with foster parents before it is possible to ascertain that the necessary care can be provided for [ T. ] in her own home by [ the applicant ] with the support provided by society .", "In this respect it should first be noted that she herself as well as her father , who has continuously as counsel for her daughter acted actively in concert with [ the applicant ] , clearly expressed that she accepts a continued placement with foster parents and that she realises that an expeditious transfer would be detrimental to [ T. ] . Furthermore , it should be taken into account that [ the applicant \u2019s ] actions so far evidently have been characterised to a relatively large extent by passivity . The reason to why various measures have not been commenced or have been terminated seems , accordingly , have been that [ the applicant ] by evasion or negligence to act has let the matter come to nothing . On the other hand she has not actively terminated or refused various help efforts . It seems that neither has [ the applicant ] consciously acted in a way she would understand as being harmful to her daughter . Therefore it may reasonably be possible to conclude that [ the applicant ] now , having experience also from compulsory care , does not reject the demands caused by the needs of [ T. ] . The [ court ] therefore comes to the conclusion that an overall assessment indicates that the consent expressed by [ the applicant ] , however at a late stage of the proceedings , should be accepted as adequate . Under these circumstances the [ court ] also finds that it is possible on a voluntary basis to provide [ T. ] with the necessary care outside her own home until it is possible to return [ T. ] to [ the applicant ] . This means that there are no longer grounds for compulsory care . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant revoked the power of attorney for her father , who had until then been representing her in the matter of the public care of T.", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s father requested ORG to decide on a gradual termination of [ T. \u2019s ] placement with the foster parents . On DATE the ORG concluded that he was no longer representing his daughter and decided to respond to him accordingly .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s father requested ORG to secure the implementation of the judgment of ORG of DATE . On DATE the court rejected the request , finding no legal basis therefor .", "The applicant \u2019s father appealed to ORG .
