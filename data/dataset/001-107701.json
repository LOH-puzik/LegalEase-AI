The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of membership of an organised criminal group , several counts of attempted aggravated murder , intentional destruction of property and arms possession and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , which he was sent to serve in correctional colony no . CARDINAL , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action with ORG , complaining of various violations of his rights by the administration of correctional colony no . CARDINAL . In particular , he complained that on a number of occasions in DATE and DATE the director of the correctional colony had ordered him to be placed in a punishment cell , which had entailed a serious worsening of the general conditions of his detention and limitation or deprivation of his rights as a detainee . The applicant also argued that the colony authorities had unlawfully seized his writing utensils , and had forbidden him to use the colony library and to purchase newspapers , magazines and books . He further alleged that they had not allowed him to have meetings with counsel and to make paid phone calls to his relatives , counsel and ORG . His biggest grievance , however , was that the administration had refused to post his complaints to various authorities in GPE and had monitored or even intercepted his correspondence with ORG . The applicant also requested that ORG ensure that he could be present at a court hearing during the examination of his complaint .", "CARDINAL . Following a number of refusals by ORG to grant the applicant \u2019s request , and the subsequent revocation of those decisions by ORG , on DATE the ORG granted leave to bring an action for an examination on the merits , and set a preliminary hearing for DATE . Subsequent hearings were held on DATE . The applicant was not informed of either of those hearings . In fact , on DATE he was transferred to another correctional colony in the town of Verkhneuralsk , GPE , QUANTITY from his previous place of detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to detention facility no . CARDINAL in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint , having found that either the restrictions on the applicant \u2019s rights had been lifted following an inquiry by prosecution authorities or they had been warranted by the applicant \u2019s placement in the punishment cell , in view of numerous instances of unlawful behaviour on his part , such as refusal to keep his cell tidy , destruction of colony property , and so on . The applicant was not brought to the hearing . Representatives of the colony administration attended the hearings before ORG and made oral submissions .", "CARDINAL . By a separate decision issued on CARDINAL DATE ORG responded to the applicant \u2019s request to be present at the hearings . In particular , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] , having been convicted by the judgment of DATE of ORG , is currently serving his sentence . It appears from the case file materials that he was transferred outside GPE . [ The applicant ] lodged a complaint about the actions of the head of [ correctional colony no . CARDINAL ] , GPE ... ; accordingly , his complaint is being examined by ORG within the civil procedure . LAW of GPE , in force at the material time , does not provide for an opportunity to transfer convicts to [ ensure ] their participation in court hearings in civil cases ; therefore it is impossible for the court to ensure [ the applicant \u2019s ] presence at the hearings in the present civil case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that ORG had unlawfully refused to ensure his presence at the hearings , despite the fact that the majority of the circumstances in dispute were exclusively within his personal knowledge and it was important for ORG to hear both parties to the proceedings , the applicant and the administration .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , held in the applicant \u2019s absence , ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , endorsing ORG reasoning , including that on the subject of the applicant \u2019s attendance .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Civil Procedure of GPE ( ORG ) provides that individuals may appear before a court in person or may act through a representative ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The Penitentiary Code provides that convicted persons may be transferred from a correctional colony to an investigative unit if their participation is required as witnesses , victims or suspects in connection with certain investigative measures ( LAW ) . The LAW does not mention any possibility for a convicted person to take part in civil proceedings , whether as a plaintiff or a defendant .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions ORG has dismissed as inadmissible complaints by detainees whose requests for leave to appear were refused by civil courts . It reasoned that the relevant provisions of LAW and LAW did not , as such , restrict a detainee \u2019s access to court . ORG has emphasised nonetheless that an imprisoned person should be able to make submissions to a civil court , either through a representative or in any other way provided by law . If necessary , a hearing should be held at the convict \u2019s place of detention , or the court committed to hear the civil case may instruct the court with territorial jurisdiction over the convict \u2019s place of detention to obtain his / her submissions or to take any other procedural steps ( decisions CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG a court may hold a session elsewhere than in a court - house if , for instance , it is necessary to examine evidence which can not be brought to the court - house .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG contains a list of situations which may justify the reopening of a finalised case on account of newly discovered circumstances . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG indicated that this LAW should be interpreted as , in principle , allowing a procedure to be launched to have a final judgment re - examined on account of newly discovered circumstances , such as the finding of a violation of LAW in a given case by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
