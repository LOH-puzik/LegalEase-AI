{"ITEMID": "001-79667", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "FALTER ZEITSCHRIFTEN GMBH v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant company , Falter Zeitschriften GmbH , is the owner and publisher of the DATE newspaper Falter , having its registered office in GPE . It was represented before the ORG by Mr A. Noll , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a police officer revealed that he and some colleagues had repeatedly transmitted data from the central police computer to officials of ORG ( ORG ) . Subsequently criminal investigations were opened against several persons , amongst them Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , who were , respectively , the leader of the GPE branch of the ORG and his secretary .", "In DATE criminal investigations against Mr PERSON were discontinued . Mr PERSON was convicted by the first - instance court in DATE , but was subsequently acquitted on appeal .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant company published a CARDINAL - page article in an issue of Falter commenting on the proceeding and the outcome of the investigations . The relevant passage concerning PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON read as follows :", "\u201c ... The commission investigated and proposed to the investigating judge that pre - trial detention be ordered for PERSON , head of GPE , and PERSON , his secretary . However , these individuals were both immune . Neither pre - trial detention nor house searches could be ordered rapidly . In DATE , on the premises of GPE so much material , like never before in DATE , was passed through the shredder . Files were discovered with some AUF [ police labour union ] officials in which just those passages subsequently to be found in ORG press releases had been highlighted in yellow .... \u201d", "Referring to the penultimate sentence of this passage , PERSON and Mr GPE instituted proceedings in ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , claiming compensation and seeking an order for publication of the judgment under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing and examined CARDINAL witnesses requested by the defence . The press officer of ORG ( Die Gr\u00fcnen ) , which had its LOC under those of ORG , stated that at the relevant time the doors of the ORG branch had been locked and there had been rumours that the shredder had been in continuous use . The court also examined CARDINAL journalists from ORG , an NORP DATE newspaper which had reported on the issue . Both stated that CARDINAL independent , anonymous sources had confirmed that at the relevant time a large amount of paper relating to the \u201c police information scandal \u201d had been shredded on the LOC of the GPE ORG . However , the journalists refused to give any further information regarding their sources .", "On DATE the court found that the offending statement amounted to defamation under LAW ) and to a violation of the presumption of innocence of PERSON and Mr GPE , as guaranteed under section CARDINALb of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . It ordered the applicant company to pay MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation to Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON respectively , to publish the judgment and to pay the costs of the proceedings to each of them .", "The court found that the offending statement , when read in its context , suggested that PERSON and PERSON had themselves destroyed evidence concerning the criminal proceedings instituted against them or at least had approved that destruction . This reading also appeared logical in the light of the fact that PERSON and Mr GPE would have benefited the most from the destruction of such material and that they were both , in their respective positions , the responsible persons . However , the evidence obtained at the trial was not sufficient to prove this allegation as the witnesses could not testify to anything they had perceived themselves . Furthermore , the applicant company had not given PERSON and PERSON the opportunity to comment on the allegations raised against them . The court lastly noted that the article did not refer to ORG and therefore dismissed the applicant company \u2019s argument that the offending statement was a neutral citation .", "The applicant company appealed against this judgment . It submitted that ORG should have heard a representative from the administration of the LOC in question who could have stated that at the relevant time more paper than average had been put through the shredder by the ORG party . The court further should have examined the author of the article in order to give him the opportunity to prove that journalistic diligence had been complied with . It further complained that , in the light of the evidence given by the witnesses at the trial , the court should have reached the conclusion that there had been sufficient proof of the offending PERSON veracity .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) confirmed ORG judgment but increased the amount of compensation to be paid to PERSON and PERSON , respectively , to ORG CARDINAL . It noted that the applicant company \u2019s request for the examination of a representative of the LOC in question had not been adequately submitted as it was filed only in written submissions prior to and not at the trial . In any event , however , a statement that more paper than average had been put through the shredder would not prove that it had in fact been evidence concerning the \u201c police information affair \u201d which had been destroyed . An examination of the author of the article to prove that journalistic diligence had been complied with had not been necessary . The applicant company had admitted that PERSON and PERSON had not been consulted before the writing of the article and it had not alleged that there had been exceptional circumstances , such as official documents , to prove the statement at issue , which would have exonerated it from this obligation . The court finally noted that the assessment of evidence was a matter to be dealt with by the courts . In the present case , the court could not possibly reach the conclusion that the information provided by anonymous sources had been reliable and credible as the ORG statements in this regard had to be considered as uncorroborated assessments by witnesses . In any event , these statements merely asserted that much material had been shredded , but did not prove that PERSON and PERSON had been involved .", "This judgment was served on the applicant company \u2019s counsel on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
