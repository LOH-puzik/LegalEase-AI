The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . In DATE he was convicted of a fraud offence and served a sentence of imprisonment in FAC from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE he was arrested on suspicion of unlawful possession of firearms . DATE and DATE he was detained on remand in FAC , where he claimed to have been detained with \u201c recidivist \u201d prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As he had never finished his secondary education , the applicant requested to be enrolled in the school operating inside FAC . In DATE he submitted a written request to the governor of ORG , asking to be enrolled for the DATE . He received no reply before DATE began on DATE , so he wrote again to the governor on DATE and also to ORG and ORG ( in GPE , the Prosecutor is the authority competent to oversee the lawful execution of pretrial and post - conviction detention ) . The applicant received a letter from the Prosecutor , dated DATE , which said that the prison administration had taken due account of the possibility for the applicant to study , in view of his previous sentence . The ORG further stated that the applicant \u2019s assertion regarding refused access to education had not been confirmed . The applicant also received a reply , dated DATE , from ORG . The letter stated that individuals deprived of their liberty ( \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430 ) were entitled to continue their education in prison and made no specific reference to remand prisoners .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant sent another request to the prison governor , ORG and ORG . On DATE the applicant filed a new request with the prison governor , again asking to be enrolled in the prison school for the DATE . Referring to the letter of DATE , the applicant argued that ORG had recognised his right to access to education in prison . On DATE he received a reply signed by the Head of the Execution of Punishments Directorate of the Ministry of Justice , rejecting his request . The letter stated , inter alia :", "\u201c It was established that [ the applicant ] has not yet been convicted . Once convicted , he is to be transferred to a prison for recidivists .", "The inclusion of recidivists in the educational and work programmes in a prison for non - recidivists would lead to a breach of the requirement that different categories of inmates are to be kept apart and are to participate separately in correctional programmes ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the refusal to enrol him in the school , claiming that in the absence of a second sentence of imprisonment he could not be treated as \u0430 \u201c recidivist \u201d . In his written pleadings he relied explicitly on the right to education as guaranteed by LAW and by LAW , as well as on LAW of ORG for the Treatment of Prisoners , which provided , inter alia , that \u201c [ p]rovision shall be made for the further education of all prisoners capable of profiting thereby \u201d . In the applicant \u2019s opinion LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) imposed the same obligation on the authorities to provide access to education to prisoners detained on remand as the obligation to provide such access to sentenced prisoners . The refusal pursued no legitimate aim and was contrary to LAW DATE and ORG in Education ( published in ORG in DATE ) . During the hearing he indicated that other persons in his situation were allowed to study and that the prison authorities had not shown any legal ground for their refusal . The prison governor admitted that there had previously been a practice of providing access to the school , but that this had been discontinued because of concerns about the influence of \u201c recidivists \u201d on \u201c non - recidivists \u201d . The applicant had been refused access as he was to be treated as a \u201c recidivist \u201d within the meaning of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and could not attend the school because this would bring him into contact with non - recidivists .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered the governor to include him in the prison \u2019s educational programme . It found , in particular , that the refusal of the prison governor was based on the assumption that the applicant was a \u201c recidivist \u201d and that since LOC was a prison for \u201c nonrecidivists \u201d , it was the duty of the prison administration to exclude him from programmes involving other inmates , most of whom were \u201c nonrecidivists \u201d . The court held that the applicant could not be considered a \u201c recidivist \u201d , as defined by LAW because , although he had previously received a sentence of imprisonment , the current set of proceedings against him were still pending and he had not yet been convicted and sentenced a second time . The rule requiring that \u201c recidivists \u201d be kept separately from \u201c non - recidivists \u201d in prison was , therefore , inapplicable .", "CARDINAL . The prison governor appealed against that judgment . He argued that , in accordance with the principle for differentiated treatment of the various categories of prisoner , the applicant was accommodated in the group of those remand prisoners who , if convicted , would fall within the category of \u201c recidivists \u201d . Moreover , LOC was a prison for \u201c non - recidivists \u201d and the accommodation of \u201c recidivists \u201d , including remand prisoners treated as such , was exceptional .", "CARDINAL . Before the examination of the appeal , on DATE the applicant requested the governor to enrol him in the prison school for DATE , starting DATE . As he received no reply to his request , on CARDINAL September CARDINAL he filed a similar request with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a final judgment in respect of the applicant \u2019s complaint about exclusion from the school . Before ORG , the prosecutor ( who intervenes in all ORG proceedings ) was of the view that the decision of ORG was correct and that the prison governor \u2019s appeal should be dismissed . The prosecutor further expressed the view that the grounds for the cassation appeal were unclear and based on an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law , contrary to the correct interpretation given by the first - instance court in the decision appealed against . In its decision ORG noted that before DATE amendments , LAW imposed an obligation for the mandatory education of all prisoners DATE . The current provision envisaged mandatory education only for persons DATE ; for those aged DATE and over there was an obligation on the State to make education available for prisoners who wished to take part . However , convicted prisoners had a right under domestic law to access education only where they had been sentenced to DATE or more of imprisonment , to ensure that they would have the possibility of completing DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . ORG concluded :", "\u201c [ T]he right to education ( whether mandatory or voluntary ) is envisaged and regulated in the legislation of GPE solely in regard of persons deprived of liberty as a result of a final conviction [ \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430 ] and not in regard of those deprived of liberty pursuant to a measure of remand [ \u0437\u0430\u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430 ] . \u201d", "It followed that the question whether the prison authorities unlawfully considered the applicant to be a \u201c recidivist \u201d was irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . Referring to that judgment , on DATE the Execution of Punishments Directorate replied to the applicant \u2019s requests of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , informing him that he would not be enrolled in the prison school for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in respect of the firearms offence . He was removed from FAC on DATE and transferred to ORG to serve his sentence . The Government informed the ORG that the applicant did not file any requests to take part in educational activities while at that prison . However , in his observations to the ORG , the applicant stated that he did not file a request because there was no school at FAC . In addition , he sent the ORG documents which indicated that CARDINAL prisoner considered a \u201c recidivist \u201d had participated successfully in the education programme at FAC . The applicant was released from FAC on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
