They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are CARDINAL NORP believers , including the person who used to be their parish priest . For DATE until the impugned events they attended religious services at FAC in GPE .", "In accordance with the Statute of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the \u201c temple \u201d is a legal person and part of ORG . It is governed by a church council , a body elected at a meeting of the parish and approved by the relevant eparchy .", "Some of the applicants are members of the church council governing ORG .", "Since DATE and until the events at issue the parish priest at GPE was PERSON , one of the applicants . In accordance with the procedure set out in the Statute of the Church , priests are ordained after approval by the respective eparchy and by ORG and elections conducted by secret ballot at a meeting of the parish .", "During the same period , by virtue of a decision of CARDINAL DATE of the FAC and FAC , Mr PERSON was also chairman of the church council at FAC .", "At the time of the impugned events , in DATE , the persons elected at a parish meeting held at DATE were the remaining members of the church council . The results of those elections were approved by the eparchy and registered at the FAC municipality in DATE , in accordance with LAW , which provided for such registration .", "For DATE after DATE of communism and the beginning of the democratic changes in GPE after , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) was divided . CARDINAL groups of leaders claimed legitimacy and sought to unite the believers under their leadership . Over DATE , successive governments supported CARDINAL or other of the CARDINAL leaderships . Also , each group had supporters among the clergy and the believers . A number of churches and monasteries became known as \u201c belonging \u201d to \u201c the alternative ORG \u201d presided over by metropolitan ORG , since the ministers in those places recognised his leadership . After DATE , CARDINAL different versions of the Statute of the Church existed . Contradictory acts registering CARDINAL or the other central leadership were issued DATE and some of them were later quashed by the courts ( see for a detailed account of these events , the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG of ORG ( Metropolitan Inokentiy ) and Others v. GPE , nos . PERSON and CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "The applicants supported the \u201c alternative ORG \u201d presided over by FAC and did not accept the leadership of PERSON and the ORG presided over by him .", "On DATE the new Religious Denominations Act CARDINAL came into force . It provided , inter alia , for the ex lege recognition of ORG . It also introduced a provision which stated that the ORG \u201c is headed by ORG and is represented by ORG ... \u201d The LAW prohibited CARDINAL denomination carrying the same name and stated , in its transitional provisions , that persons who had seceded from a registered religious institution were not entitled to use its name or assets .", "On DATE the church council governing ORG in GPE gathered and adopted a decision declaring that the temple recognised the leadership of ORG presided over by FAC .", "On DATE PERSON , the leader of the \u201c alternative LAW , issued a decision which stated that PERSON L.Popov was reappointed as parish priest and chairman of the church council at ORG in GPE .", "On DATE several priests and other ministers led by Archimandrite PERSON , the PERSON of the FAC and Veliki Preslav Eparchy , entered the area around FAC and occupied it , refusing to let in members of the church council and the parish priest . They claimed that they were the true representatives of the ORG whose true head was PERSON .", "PERSON and some of the other applicants informed the police and the prosecuting authorities and requested urgent action .", "The district prosecutor initially issued a decision ordering the restoration of the situation but on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , having received a letter from the FAC and FAC , annulled his decision on the basis that urgent action was not called for . The decision of CARDINAL DATE was upheld on CARDINAL May and DATE by the regional and appeals levels of the prosecuting service on the basis that prosecutors should not intervene in an internal ORG dispute and having regard to the special procedure under Article ORG of LAW ( see below ) .", "On DATE Mr PERSON , acting as chairman of the church council governing ORG , submitted an application to ORG for an order under Article PERSON of LAW to recover possession of the temple . Under that provision the claimant had to prove that he enjoyed the possession of a real property and that the defendant had deprived him thereof secretly or through violence .", "On DATE the ORG delivered its decision dismissing the application . It reasoned as follows .", "As to the admissibility of the application , it noted that under LAW , a church council could initiate judicial proceedings only with the authorisation of the eparchy or , in cases of eparchies comprising CARDINAL sole parish and a sole priest , of ORG . In the case under examination the claimant had submitted a document demonstrating that ORG presided over by FAC had approved the church council \u2019s decision to bring the proceedings at issue . Given the existence of CARDINAL religious communities bearing the name ORG , as noted by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( as to that judgment , see ORG and Others v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was unclear which leadership was competent to give the requisite authorisation . This lack of clarity should not , however , hamper the possibility for each of the CARDINAL communities to seek judicial protection . Therefore , the authorisation presented by the claimants was sufficient and the application was admissible .", "ORG accepted that the application was made on behalf of the local temple , which was a legal person under LAW , and that it had been made in the name of a local unit of the ORG governed by the \u201c alternative \u201d Synod .", "It noted , however , that PERSON had been appointed parish priest and chairman of the local church council by decision approved by the FAC and FAC , who had also approved other decisions of the same church council . ORG presided over by PERSON had certified that ORG was the head of the FAC and Veliki Preslav Eparchy . In these circumstances , contrary to what was claimed in the application , the claimant had not possessed the disputed property on behalf of the religious organisation presided over by FAC but for the organisation presided over by PERSON . Seeing that those who had entered and occupied the property belonged to the same organisation , it followed that there had been no deprivation of possessions .", "Upon the appeal submitted by Mr PERSON on behalf of the local temple , on DATE ORG annulled ORG decision and terminated the proceedings . The court noted that the claimant and the defendants belonged to the religious organisation of the NORP community in GPE . However , the State was not entitled to intervene in intra - religious matters and the courts were not competent to decide whether or not there had been a deprivation of possessions as in the particular circumstances the events concerned the manner in which the ORG governed its property . The courts could only deal with matters touching upon an internal conflict in a religious organisation if there was an issue of liability other than liability under canon law .", "The court further stated that even if it were accepted that the courts were competent to examine the application , it was in any event inadmissible . In particular , it was unclear whether it was made on behalf of the local temple as a legal person or on behalf of the church council which did not have legal personality separate from the temple and could not claim to have possessed the temple in its own name . That should have been clarified by ORG .", "Furthermore , there was no valid authorisation to institute proceedings , as required by Article ORG ) of the Statute of the ORG . Such authorisation could be issued by ORG solely in respect of eparchies comprising CARDINAL sole parish , which was not the case in the FAC and Veliki Preslav Eparchy . The authorisation in the particular case thus had to be issued by the bodies governing the eparchy . It had not been shown that such authorisation had been given .", "The decision of ORG was final and was not amenable to further appeal .", "In accordance with LAW of DATE , religious institutions are separate from the ORG . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG stated , inter alia , that the ORG must not interfere with the internal organisation of religious communities and institutions , which must be regulated by their own statutes and rules .", "LAW DATE governed the organisational structure and functioning of religious denominations between DATE and DATE . It provided that each religious denomination had to apply for registration and approval of its statute by ORG and to register its leadership with the ORG . The local leaderships were registered by the municipal authorities .", "In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG , while agreeing that certain provisions of LAW DATE were clearly unconstitutional , found that it was not its task to repeal legal provisions adopted prior to the entry into force of the DATE LAW , the ordinary courts being competent to consider them superseded by LAW , which has direct applicability .", "LAW , which entered into force on DATE , provides for judicial registration of all religious denominations except ORG , which is recognised as a legal person ex lege . In accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions , ORG need not be re - registered under LAW , unlike all other religious denominations .", "Section CARDINAL of the new LAW provides , inter alia , that ORG is a legal person whose structure is determined by its internal statute .", "Section CARDINAL provides that information about religious denominations , including the names of the persons representing them for all legal purposes , is recorded ( \u0432\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 ) in a public register at ORG . ORG has stated that this requirement applies to ORG ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ; see also the same interpretation in other judgments : ORG , judgment of DATE in case no . CARDINAL , and ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ) .", "Section CARDINAL provides that local religious leaderships must register with the relevant municipality .", "Section CARDINAL provides that the central leadership may decide to seek the registration of its local organisations as legal persons by applying to the relevant regional court .", "In accordance with the transitory and final provisions to LAW ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ) , local organisations which have obtained legal personality under the previous legal regime shall be registered ex officio at the respective regional court on request by the denomination \u2019s national leadership .", "In civil or administrative proceedings involving local units of religious denominations ( \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e PERSON DATE ; o\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043d\u0430 PERSON \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL DATE ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 GPE ; o\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL\u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412KC ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. o\u0442 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440.\u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u043d\u0430 GPE \u0441\u044a\u0434 NORP ) , the courts have accepted such PERSON locus standi without proof of registration at the relevant regional court , reasoning that LAW CARDINAL recognised the continuity of legal status acquired under previous legislation ( see also , \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e PERSON \u2116 DATE and o\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , where the same interpretation of the relevant law was implicit ) .", "In the initial period after the entry into force of LAW there was contradictory judicial practice on the question whether registration under section CARDINAL of LAW was needed in respect of local organisations of ORG .
