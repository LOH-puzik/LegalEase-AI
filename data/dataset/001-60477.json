In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had to examine the constitutionality of LAW subsection ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , by virtue of which the administrative offence of driving under the influence of drink was not subsidiary to an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the courts .", "ORG noted that that it was not contrary to LAW if a single act constituted more than one offence . This was a feature common to the criminal law of many NORP countries . However , it was also accepted in criminal law doctrine that sometimes a single act only appeared to constitute CARDINAL offence , whereas interpretation showed that one offence entirely covered the wrong contained in the other so that there was no need for further punishment . Thus , LAW prohibited the trial and punishment of someone for different offences if interpretation showed that one excluded the application of the other .
