From DATE to DATE the time taken to complete the file and transmit it to the assize court appears normal .", ". On the other hand , from DATE there was a delay in the proceedings which can under no circumstances be justified by the appeals filed by the accused in pursuance of their statutory rights .", ".

The necessity of keeping PERSON in detention during the proceedings", "Given the nature and the gravity of the offences and the results of the police investigation , PERSON \u2019s detention was at first justified , up until his recapitulatory examination of DATE .", "Moreover , until DATE , PERSON had not filed an application for release .
