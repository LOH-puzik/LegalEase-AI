QUANTITY of the property had been used , DATE , as a road and were recorded as such in the registers of public roads in DATE and DATE . The applicant disputed that the relevant authorities of the GPE had designated the property as a public road as required by the laws of the GPE .", "On DATE , and amended on DATE , the municipality made a written offer to the applicant , certified by a notary public , to buy the property for CARDINAL pursuant to LAW and Other Publicly Used Private Property \u2013 \u201c the Traffic Space Allocation Act \u201d ( Gesetz zur Bereinigung der Rechtsverh\u00e4ltnisse an LOC anderen \u00f6ffentlich genutzten privaten ORG ) ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "The applicant declined the offer .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to accept the offer .

CARDINAL of that Act ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , since the laws of the GPE did not necessarily require the proper designation of property as a public road ; that all other requirements for the sale as required by ORG had been met ; and that the calculation of the purchase price was in accordance with the statutory requirements .", "On DATE ORG informed counsel for the applicant of its intention to dismiss the applicant \u2019s appeal as manifestly ill - founded because ORG judgment , in particular concerning the qualification of the property as \u201c traffic space \u201d , had been free of error .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that it could not consider the applicant \u2019s claim that only part of the property was used as a road whereas the whole property was to be taken on the following grounds : the municipality had stated before ORG that it had made an offer for the whole property because the remainder of the property could not be sufficiently used ; the applicant had not disputed this assertion in the proceedings before ORG ; his new submission that the taking of the whole property would be contrary to Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) No .

That LAW is , inter alia , applicable if private property that was used as a public road by the authorities of the GPE continues to be used as a public road ( LAW ) of ORG ) . \u201c Traffic space \u201d is defined as roads , alleys and squares that are either designated as public roads or treated as if they were by law ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) No . CARDINAL of that Act ) . The public authority using private property for a public road may request that the property be sold to it by making a written offer , certified by a notary public ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act ) . The public authority may only request the sale of the property directly used for a public road ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) No . CARDINAL of that Act ) ; it has to purchase the remainder the property only if it can not be sufficiently used ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act ) . The purchase price is PERCENT of the value of the land ( LAW ) .

V ZR CARDINAL ) that the purchase price of PERCENT of the value of the land pursuant to LAW was constitutional on the grounds that the property had been used as a public road in the GPE and could not have been sold or used by the private owner prior to NORP reunification ; that the value of the property was diminished by the public use ; that the legislator had taken into account that not the owner but upon request the public authority had to bear expenses related to the property ; and that the public authority \u2019s right to use was considerably more limited than that of a user who acquired the property under the terms of LAW : whereas the latter could stop using the property and nevertheless remain the owner , the public authority was bound to sell the property to the former owner for a certain purchase price on request once it had stopped using the property as \u201c traffic space \u201d . Furthermore ORG held that the contested provisions of ORG did not violate the owner \u2019s rights under LAW No . CARDINAL read alone or in conjunction with LAW . Although the sale amounted to a de facto expropriation within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL , it had a basis in domestic law , was in the general interest and not disproportionate . In particular , the legislator had acted within the wide margin of appreciation to be accorded to him in the unique context of the NORP reunification .", "Pursuant to LAW shall base its decision on the facts established by the first instance court , unless there are concrete indications that raise doubts as to the correctness or completeness of the establishment of the relevant facts by the first instance court , and on new facts , as long as it is admissible to consider these .", "ORG may not consider submissions that the trial court has correctly excluded ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .
