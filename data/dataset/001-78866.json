The applicant is a foundation existing under the laws of GPE whose purpose is to provide educational facilities at ORG in GPE , GPE . It operates in accordance with the provisions of LAW , which afforded protection to old foundations providing public services for religious minorities . It is one of a number of foundations dating from the NORP era . After the proclamation of the Republic it fell under PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , by virtue of which it obtained legal personality . In DATE , in accordance with section CARDINAL of that Act , the applicant foundation filed a declaration indicating its aims and its immovable property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant foundation acquired , by way of donation , title to part of a building situated in GPE . That acquisition was based on a certificate issued on DATE by the Governor of GPE . The relevant part of that certificate read as follows :", "\u201c ORG is a legal entity authorised to acquire immovable property by virtue of LAW . It is run by an administrative board consisting of ... Further to a request of DATE by ORG , the present document is issued for the purposes of the transaction concerning immovable property located at ... by virtue of CARDINAL of LAW [ Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG see paragraph CARDINAL below ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The immovable property in question was subsequently registered at ORG . The applicant foundation duly paid property taxes in respect of its property .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , on DATE , the applicant foundation acquired , by purchase , co - ownership of another part of the same building . On DATE the Governor of GPE had issued the certificate required by LAW , again indicating that \u201c Fener Rum Erkek Lisesi Vakf\u0131 [ was ] a legal entity authorised to acquire immovable property by virtue of the LAW \u201d . The applicant \u2019s title to that property was accordingly registered at ORG and the relevant property taxes were duly paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged an application with ORG ( GPE ) seeking the annulment of the applicant foundation \u2019s title to the above - mentioned immovable property and the registration thereof in the name of the former owners , by virtue of the established case - law of ORG . In support of its application , it argued in particular that the applicant did not have the capacity to acquire immovable property . In addition , given that the property in question was not mentioned in its declaration of DATE , an instrument regarded as the legal foundation constitution ( vak\u0131fname ) of those establishments in accordance with the case - law of ORG , the applicant was not entitled to obtain the relevant title . The ORG therefore requested that the property be re - registered in the name of its former owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , further to a request from ORG , an expert in cartography and land surveys filed a report on the case . Referring to the case - law of the combined civil divisions of ORG , as established on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he observed that foundations belonging to religious minorities as defined by LAW which had not indicated in their constitution a capacity to acquire immovable property were precluded from purchasing or accepting gifts of such property . Consequently , the real estate of such foundations was limited to the property indicated in their constitutions , which had become final with the declarations of DATE . In conclusion , the expert considered that the applicant foundation \u2019s title should be annulled , as it lacked the capacity to acquire immovable property , and that the property in question should be re - registered in the name of its former owners .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the applicant foundation objected to the characterisation given to the DATE declarations by the ORG . It contended in particular that these declarations had been required by the ORG for the registration of the assets and income of foundations and that they could not be regarded as constitutive instruments . It further argued that such foundations did have the capacity to acquire property , by virtue of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE granting the request of the ORG , ORG ordered both the annulment of the applicant \u2019s title and the re - registration of the property in the name of the former owners . It found in particular as follows :", "\u201c As the ORG stated , the defendant foundation did not indicate in [ its ] declaration of DATE ... its [ disputed ] acquisitions by way of donation and purchase . Thus , as observed in the expert \u2019s report , those acquisitions are devoid of legal basis and must accordingly be struck out of the land register and re - registered in the name of the former owners . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant foundation appealed to ORG . It relied in particular on its right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions under LAW No . CARDINAL . Its appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an application by the applicant foundation for rectification of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant foundation submitted a request to ORG ( the \u201c Directorate \u201d ) for the amendment of its constitution . It sought a new constitutive instrument that would grant it the capacity to acquire immovable property . The request was rejected on DATE . In the grounds for its decision , relying on the judgment of the combined civil divisions of ORG CARDINAL DATE , the ORG observed that the DATE declarations by foundations of religious communities were to be regarded as the \u201c constitutive instruments \u201d of those establishments and that amendment of those constitutions was impossible for reasons of public policy .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that the striking - out of the applicant \u2019s title from the land register did not take place until DATE . In this connection they referred to a decision taken by ORG on DATE whereby the applicant foundation , as owner , together with its tenant , had been fined for adding an additional storey onto the building without authorisation .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , foundations ( vak\u0131f ) were not recognised as legal entities in the legal system of GPE . Not having legal personality , they used to have their property registered at ORG in the name of a holy person who had died or of a living person in whom they trusted . A PERSON of DATE ORG ( DATE ) , granting foundations the right of ownership , thus recognised their legal personality . Under that PERSON , foundations were entitled to have their property registered at ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the Republic was proclaimed in DATE , LAW and LAW no . CARDINAL on the implementation and application of LAW came into force on DATE . LAW no . CARDINAL provided as follows :", "\u201c A special PERSON will be enacted to govern the operation of foundations established before the entry into force of LAW .", "Establishments founded after the entry into force of the Civil Code shall be governed by the provisions of the said Code . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL was thus enacted on DATE and it recognised the legal personality of foundations set up under GPE . The legal status of foundations established after the entry into force of LAW of DATE was , however , governed by the LAW itself .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL imposed an obligation for foundations that had been created under GPE to submit a declaration indicating , among other things , the nature and amount of their income . For that purpose it contained the following transitional provision :", "\u201c ORG ... of foundations which have not registered with ORG ... shall file with it a declaration [ beyanname ] indicating the nature and amount of their income ... for DATE ... , within DATE from the entry into force of the present Act ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) provided in LAW as follows :", "\u201c Legal entities , in order to register transactions at ORG , shall request the higher authority of the district in which their registered offices , or those of their branches , are located , to issue them with a certificate indicating their capacity to acquire immovable property and the power of the legal entity \u2019s representative to enter into such transactions . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case - law established by its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG decided that the declarations of DATE were to be regarded as the constitutive instruments of the vak\u0131f , finalising their constitutions . Unless the declaration included an express provision to such effect , foundations were not entitled to acquire immovable property other than that declared in the said document . ORG appeared to consider that the acquisition by foundations of this type of property , in addition to that which was indicated in their constitution , could constitute a threat to national security . The court stated in particular as follows :", "\u201c The acquisition of immovable property by legal entities set up by persons who are not NORP is prohibited . It is evident that the ORG would be exposed to various risks if it granted such foundations the capacity to acquire immovable property ...", "The last paragraph of LAW provides that the management of foundations belonging to religious communities and artisans is to be entrusted to the persons and organs appointed by them . A legal status is thus created for them , without prejudice to their legal personality . Under LAW CARDINAL of LAW , the places [ yerler ] indicated in the registers and other similar documents filed with ORG following the enactment of LAW DATE are transmitted , by this means , to the register of foundations . Consequently , it is appropriate to regard the declarations filed under LAW CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW by such organisations DATE now foundations \u2013 belonging to communities and engaged in charitable , scientific or aesthetical activities , as being their legal foundation constitutions [ vak\u0131fname ] . A foundation is not entitled to acquire property unless it expressly indicated its capacity to do so in its constitution and the same applies to charities . They are not entitled to acquire immovable property , whether directly or by inheritance , if it is not clearly stipulated in their declaration that they can accept gifts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the legislation governing foundations was changed in DATE . LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c A. The following paragraphs shall be added at the end of section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE .", "Religious community foundations , whether or not they have a constitution , shall be entitled to acquire or possess immovable property , with the authorisation of ORG , in order to meet their needs for religious , charitable , social , educational , sanitary or cultural purposes .", "If a request is made within DATE from the entry into force of the present Act , immovable property of which any form of possession is recorded in tax registers , leases or other documents shall be registered at ORG in the name of the foundation in order to meet the needs of such foundations for religious , charitable , social , educational , sanitary or cultural purposes . Property that has been donated or bequeathed to the foundation shall be governed by the provisions of the present section . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , section CARDINAL of Law no .
