From DATE PERSON and PERSON became aware that PERSON 's breathing sometimes stopped and her heart raced . This led them to seek medical advice from , inter alios , doctors practising at ORG . PERSON was taken into hospital for CARDINAL periods , of DATE and DATE respectively , in the course of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The doctors found nothing physically wrong with PERSON . They began to suspect that PERSON was healthy but that PERSON might be suffering from a psychological disturbance known as the Munchausen syndrome by proxy .", "CARDINAL . The Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a condition in which a parent of a young child , nearly always the mother , driven by a need of her own for attention , seeks superfluous medical assistance for her child . The parent may invent a disease or even cause the symptoms . In certain cases , for example if the child 's breathing is interfered with , the child 's life may be in danger .", "CARDINAL . At around this time PERSON was referred to Curium , a children 's psychiatric clinic in GPE , near GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG doctors made their fears known to ORG ( PERSON ) . The Government state that the identity of the applicants was not revealed to ORG at this time . ORG advised the doctors to provide adequate medical care and discuss their fears with the child 's parents . The PERSON family was kept under medical observation but the doctors did not discuss their suspicions with PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG inzake GPE ) in GPE telephoned ORG . A doctor connected with this centre stated \u2013 according to the Government , still without naming the applicants \u2013 that it was suspected that PERSON was suffering from the Munchausen syndrome by proxy . In spite of the medical care provided , the situation had not improved . The question arose whether to intervene . It was agreed that ORG doctor would obtain more information with a view to informing ORG . It is not recorded that the doctor did so .", "CARDINAL . Kimberly was again taken into hospital on DATE , following an incident DATE .", "CARDINAL . A meeting took place on DATE to discuss the case of PERSON . Those taking part included the director of ORG , CARDINAL doctors and CARDINAL nurses connected with ORG , the doctor connected with ORG , the PERSON family 's general practitioner , the deputy unit head of ORG and a specialised family help worker ( gezinsverzorger ) . It was decided that ORG and ORG would jointly submit a report to ORG . PERSON and PERSON were neither involved nor informed .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that it was only during this meeting that the identity of the applicants was communicated to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was provided by ORG with a first version of this report ( hereinafter \u201c ORG report \u201d ) . In response to questions received from ORG , the reporting parties made additions to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Curium sent the revised version of the report to ORG . The report stated that they believed PERSON 's life to be at risk and that urgent action was required . It expressed the opinion that it was not possible to discuss the matter with PERSON and PERSON PERSON , there being a danger that they might react unpredictably . According to the Government , ORG received the report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied by fax to the juvenile judge ( PERSON ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE for a supervision order ( ondertoezichtstelling ) and an order for PERSON to be placed away from her family ( uithuisplaatsing ) . The same day the juvenile judge issued a provisional supervision order ( voorlopige ondertoezichtstelling ) , valid until DATE , pending a decision of a more permanent nature , at the same time ordering PERSON to be placed away from her family . The juvenile judge did not hear PERSON and PERSON before coming to this decision . She scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government state that ORG wrote to PERSON and PERSON on DATE , enclosing with their letter the application for a provisional supervision order , ORG report and several articles on the Munchausen syndrome by proxy .", "CARDINAL . The applicants state that they did not at any time receive either the letter of CARDINAL DATE or any of the other documents mentioned . The Government appear to dispute this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and PERSON arrived at ORG intending to collect ORG and take her home with them . It was then that they learnt of the juvenile judge 's decisions of CARDINAL DATE . They were not allowed to see PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the juvenile judge issued an order , again without hearing PERSON and PERSON , for PERSON to be taken to a foster home , the name and address of which was withheld from PERSON and PERSON Venema . This order was carried out DATE .", "CARDINAL . Again on DATE CARDINAL of the doctors from ORG DATE a paediatrician and a child psychiatrist \u2013 and the investigating officer of ORG met with PERSON and PERSON to discuss ORG report , the implications of a provisional supervision order and ORG 's placement away from her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the juvenile judge heard Mr and PERSON in camera . Mr and PERSON were assisted by a lawyer . A representative of ORG was also present . At the close of the hearing the juvenile judge decided that , given the expert opinions to the effect that PERSON 's life appeared to be in danger , the provisional supervision order would have to remain in force but that a second opinion would be obtained as soon as possible from a psychiatrist and a child psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . It can be inferred from the case file that PERSON and PERSON were allowed to see PERSON once DATE under an access arrangement , but no copy of the access order has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . The order of DATE was transmitted to PERSON and PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The psychiatrist 's report was dated DATE . It concluded that there were no indications that PERSON and PERSON posed any danger to PERSON . However , a paragraph which the psychiatrist added to this report on DATE , after discussions by telephone with ORG , stated that it \u201c [ could ] not be entirely ruled out \u201d that PERSON was suffering from the Munchausen syndrome by proxy , and recommended further examination .", "CARDINAL . ORG sent the psychiatrist 's report to ORG and ORG . Curium let it be known in response that it saw no reason to reconsider its point of view .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE on DATE against the placement order .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON submitted written statements made by their general practitioner ( dated DATE ) and PERSON gynaecologist ( dated DATE ) . These criticised the quality of the reporting by ORG and ORG doctors and expressed doubts as to the validity of their diagnosis . They also noted that PERSON had not shown any tendency to seek superfluous or clearly unnecessary medical attention .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON also submitted separate statements of CARDINAL different psychiatrists ( dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) , including CARDINAL university professors , who had examined them at their request . All were extremely critical of the diagnosis made by ORG doctors . They concluded that ORG would be in no apparent danger if she were returned to her parents and recommended that this be done .", "CARDINAL . The child psychiatrist , from whom an opinion was to be obtained pursuant to the order made by the juvenile judge on DATE , was approached by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG doctors elaborated on the reasons for their suspicions as set out in their report of DATE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A second child , PERSON , was born to PERSON and PERSON on DATE . ORG , aware that PERSON was due to give birth , had on DATE applied for a provisional supervision order aimed at the protection of the second child immediately after the birth , but had withdrawn this application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that ORG had had sufficient reason to approach the juvenile judge as it had done , and that the juvenile judge had had sufficient reason to make the orders in question . It would have been preferable , even so , to have involved the parents in the decision - making process beforehand , or at least at an earlier stage . As matters stood , the experts disagreed amongst themselves . Given the likelihood that the examinations ordered by the juvenile judge would be brought to a conclusion shortly and that the juvenile judge would rescind the placement order immediately if the outcome was favourable to Mr and PERSON , ORG decided to confirm the decision of the juvenile judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the juvenile judge gave a decision prolonging ORG 's placement away from her family until DATE . PERSON and PERSON PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . It appears that around DATE the access arrangement was modified in that PERSON and PERSON were then allowed to see PERSON once DATE instead of once a fortnight . The Government state that the initiative for this change was taken by the juvenile judge .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatieberoep ) against ORG decision of DATE with ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the juvenile judge made an order prolonging PERSON 's placement away from her family until DATE . Mr and PERSON appealed , complaining among other things that the juvenile judge had not heard them before reaching this decision . On CARDINAL DATE , after holding a hearing , ORG gave a decision confirming the juvenile judge 's order . It held that although the juvenile judge had erred in not hearing PERSON and PERSON , this error was sufficiently remedied by the appeal hearing . As to the merits of the case , ORG agreed that the opinion of the child psychiatrist appointed as an expert pursuant to the order of the juvenile judge was slow in coming but considered nonetheless that the potential danger to PERSON 's life outweighed any disadvantages of ORG 's placement away from her family . On DATE ORG , by a separate decision , declared PERSON and PERSON appeal against the decision of DATE , which had prolonged the placement order until DATE , inadmissible because by then it had become devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . The child psychiatrist submitted his opinion on DATE . It contained extensive reports of medical and other examinations and discussions with the applicants , character witnesses and doctors who had treated PERSON on several occasions after she had stopped breathing . Appended to the opinion were psychiatric reports in standard form on Mr and PERSON , finding no sign of any psychiatric disorder , and a report by CARDINAL ORG paediatricians finding a physical explanation for PERSON 's arrested breathing but no sign of maltreatment . The opinion noted that ORG 's normal development had been impaired by the proceedings and that PERSON and PERSON had found the entire sequence of events profoundly distressing . It concluded without reservation that PERSON should be handed back to her parents .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing in camera , the juvenile judge rescinded the provisional supervision order and the placement order , at the same time refusing to replace the provisional supervision order with a permanent CARDINAL . PERSON was handed back to PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG not yet having given judgment , PERSON and PERSON PERSON submitted on DATE that they nonetheless had a continued interest in obtaining a decision of that court as to the legality of the measures in question . They stated , in particular , that a finding in their favour would provide them with some form of moral satisfaction ; would enable them to take action in tort for damages against the ORG , ORG and ORG ; would prevent further interference with their family life ; and would obviate the need for the applicants to take further civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate - General ( advocaat - generaal ) at ORG submitted an advisory opinion on DATE . He expressed the view that the appeal was inadmissible as PERSON and PERSON no longer had any legal interest in the outcome of the proceedings . The possible satisfaction of being found in the right was not in itself a sufficient interest . Nor was the possibility of a further civil action for damages , it being by no means obvious that such an action would in fact be made possible by a decision of ORG . The possibility of further interference with the applicants ' family life in the future was not relevant to the case before ORG . The question whether the ORG , ORG had committed a tort against the applicants was outside the scope of the case before ORG , so that the need , if any , for further civil proceedings could not be considered relevant either . Turning to the merits of the case , ORG expressed the opinion that the decision of ORG was based on adequate legal grounds and sufficiently reasoned .", "DATE . On DATE ORG gave judgment declaring Mr and PERSON appeal on points of law inadmissible for lack of interest . It was held that the interests stated were insufficient .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , a discussion took place between a representative of ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c VVNOR \u201d ) , a non - governmental organisation that had taken up PERSON and PERSON case , and the Director of ORG . It would appear that ORG representative showed the Director documents taken from ORG 's medical records , which had been obtained from ORG and which had been in PERSON and PERSON possession for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , ORG transmitted a written statement of complaint on Mr and PERSON PERSON 's behalf to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Director of ORG gave a written decision declaring the complaint partly well - founded and partly ill - founded . Complaints considered well - founded related to the failure to give PERSON and PERSON access to certain documents \u2013 due to the absence from the file , at the relevant time , of certain meeting reports , and in the case of a list of contacts , due to an omission DATE and to the application for a provisional supervision order lodged on DATE in respect of the second child PERSON and PERSON were then expecting . As to the latter issue , it was stated that the said application had been withdrawn on DATE because it appeared not to be legally possible to seek a supervision order in respect of an as yet unborn child ; the application had therefore been precipitate . The Deputy Director expressed regret for the lapse of time involved .", "CARDINAL . The Legal Proceedings Monitoring Group , on behalf of PERSON and PERSON PERSON , lodged an appeal with ORG no . PERSON ( PERSON voor de kinderbescherming ) , which was received by that body on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on CARDINAL DATE and gave its decision on DATE . It was considered reasonable that ORG had accepted the assessment of ORG and Curium doctors that PERSON 's life was in danger ; given the apparent urgency of the situation , the ORG could not be faulted for not ensuring that ORG and Curium doctors had obtained PERSON and PERSON prior permission for the transmission to it of medical information . The ORG ought , however , to have informed PERSON and PERSON in good time that it did not intend to make use of witnesses named by them but intended to rely solely on the court - appointed experts . ORG further accepted the ORG 's statement that the psychiatrist had added to his report of CARDINAL DATE a reservation to the effect that it could not be ruled out that PERSON was suffering from the Munchausen syndrome by proxy , not at the bidding of ORG , but in response to a reminder that the report did not contain corroborating information from third - party sources ( heteroanamnesis ) .", "CARDINAL . The case received a measure of publicity . Questions in ORG and a complaint to the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ) , lodged on behalf of PERSON and PERSON by ORG , led the Deputy Minister to order an official inquiry into the way ORG had handled the affair .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report of the official inquiry was published on DATE . Its conclusions , in so far as relevant , may be summarised as follows .", "\u2013 In deciding to intervene without the prior involvement of PERSON and PERSON Venema , ORG had no doubt sought in good faith to protect ORG 's interests , but it might with advantage \u201c have displayed more creativity in seeking a solution that did more justice to the parents ' interests \u201d .", "\u2013 Given ORG own lack of psychiatric expertise and the fact that the Munchausen syndrome by proxy is difficult to diagnose , the use which ORG made of a variety of contradictory reports had not been \u201c unacceptable \u201d although it might have assessed them in a more critical fashion .", "\u2013 A lack of coordination within ORG had delayed the involvement of the child psychiatrist , who was only approached on DATE . This was regrettable because otherwise the reports might have been complete by the time of the birth of PERSON .", "\u2013 ORG advice to the juvenile judge might have been more complete . As a minimum , ORG could reasonably have been expected to justify the absence of any inquiry of its own and to give more extensive reasons for the choices it made .", "\u2013 ORG case - file management and internal reporting were deficient : documents explaining the background to its decisions were not contained in the file .", "\u2013 The transmission of the report of the psychiatrist to ORG doctors and PERSON had constituted a breach of confidence vis - \u00e0 - vis Mr and PERSON since , after they had first reported PERSON 's case to ORG , their involvement had ended . Curium in particular had been treated virtually as an external expert body .", "\u2013 It appeared that PERSON and PERSON had not been summoned in writing to the hearing of the juvenile judge on DATE , notwithstanding ORG statement to the contrary , but that this was due to a misunderstanding between the registry of ORG and ORG and could not be blamed on the latter .", "CARDINAL . The report went on to formulate recommendations aimed at preventing the recurrence of cases such as the present .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the report led the Deputy Minister to conclude that ORG had \u201c acted lawfully and fulfilled its statutory responsibility \u201d , although its internal working procedures deserved some criticism . It had been right for ORG to take firm action and , in view of the nature and seriousness of the complaint , to rely on the expertise of third parties .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events complained of , there was a child welfare board in the judicial district of each regional court ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , as in force at the time ) .
