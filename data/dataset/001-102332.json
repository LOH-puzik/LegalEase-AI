She had become pregnant unintentionally , believing her partner to be infertile . At the time she was unmarried , unemployed and living in poverty . She had CARDINAL young children . The youngest was disabled and all CARDINAL children were in foster care as a result of problems she had experienced as an alcoholic . She had a history of depression during her first CARDINAL pregnancies , and was battling depression at the time of her fifth pregnancy . During DATE her fifth pregnancy , she had remained sober and had been in constant contact with social workers with a view to regaining custody of her children . She considered that a further child at that moment of her life ( with its attendant risk of post - natal depression and to her sobriety ) would jeopardise her health and the successful reunification of her family . She decided to travel to GPE to have an abortion .", "CARDINAL . Delaying the abortion for DATE , the first applicant borrowed the minimum amount of money for treatment in a private clinic and travel from a money - lender ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) at a high interest rate . She felt she had to travel to GPE alone and in secrecy , without alerting the social workers and without missing a contact visit with her children .", "CARDINAL . She travelled back to GPE by plane DATE after the abortion for her contact visit with her youngest child . While she had initially submitted that she was afraid to seek medical advice on her return to GPE , she subsequently clarified that on the train returning from GPE she began to bleed profusely and an ambulance met the train . At a nearby hospital she underwent a dilation and curettage . She claims she experienced pain , nausea and bleeding for DATE thereafter but did not seek further medical advice .", "CARDINAL . Following the introduction of the present application , the first applicant became pregnant again and gave birth to her fifth child . She is struggling with depression and has custody of CARDINAL of her children whilst CARDINAL ( including the disabled child ) remain in care . She maintained that an abortion was the correct decision for her in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant travelled to GPE for an abortion believing that she was not entitled to an abortion in GPE . She was DATE pregnant .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant became pregnant unintentionally . She had taken TIME - after pill \u201d and was advised by CARDINAL different doctors that there was a substantial risk of an ectopic pregnancy ( a condition which can not be diagnosed until DATE of pregnancy ) . She was certain of her decision to travel to GPE for an abortion since she could not care for a child on her own at that time of her life . She waited DATE until the counselling centre in GPE opened after DATE . She had difficulty meeting the costs of the travel and , not having a credit card , used a friend \u2019s credit card to book the flights . She accepted that , by the time she travelled to GPE , it had been confirmed that the pregnancy was not ectopic .", "CARDINAL . Once in GPE she did not list anyone as her next of kin or give an NORP address so as to be sure her family would not learn of the abortion . She travelled alone and stayed in GPE TIME the procedure to avoid missing her appointment as well as TIME of the procedure , as she would have arrived back in GPE too late for public transport and the medication rendered her unfit to drive home from GPE airport . The clinic advised her to inform NORP doctors that she had had a miscarriage .", "CARDINAL . On her return to GPE she started passing blood clots and DATE , being unsure of the legality of having travelled for an abortion , sought follow - up care in a clinic in GPE affiliated to the LANGUAGE clinic .", "CARDINAL .

Prior to that , she had DATE of chemotherapy for a rare form of cancer . She had asked her doctor before the treatment about the implications of her illness as regards her desire to have children and was advised that it was not possible to predict the effect of pregnancy on her cancer and that , if she did become pregnant , it would be dangerous for the foetus if she were to have chemotherapy during the first trimester .", "CARDINAL . The cancer went into remission and the applicant unintentionally became pregnant . She was unaware of this fact when she underwent a series of tests for cancer , contraindicated during pregnancy . When she discovered she was pregnant , the applicant consulted her General Practitioner ( ORG ) as well as several medical consultants . She alleged that , as a result of the chilling effect of the NORP legal framework , she received insufficient information as to the impact of the pregnancy on her health and life and of her prior tests for cancer on the foetus .", "CARDINAL . She therefore researched the risks on the Internet . Given the uncertainty about the risks involved , the third applicant travelled to GPE for an abortion . She maintained that she wanted a medical abortion ( drug - induced miscarriage ) as her pregnancy was at an early stage but that she could not find a clinic which would provide this treatment as she was a non - resident and because of the need for follow - up . She therefore alleged she had to wait a further DATE until a surgical abortion was possible .", "CARDINAL . On returning to GPE after the abortion , the third applicant suffered complications as a result of an incomplete abortion , including prolonged bleeding and infection . She alleges that doctors provided inadequate medical care . She consulted her own GPE DATE after the abortion and her ORG made no reference to the fact that she was visibly no longer pregnant .", "CARDINAL .

The meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW was considered in GPE and GPE in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL PERSON CARDINAL ) , where the defendant had carried out an abortion on a minor , pregnant as a result of multiple rape . PERSON accepted that abortion to preserve the life of a pregnant woman was not unlawful and , further , where a doctor was of the opinion that the woman \u2019s physical or mental health would be seriously harmed by continuing with the pregnancy , he could properly be said to be operating for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother . This principle was not , however , applied by the NORP courts . In the case of ORG v.

In DATE there was some concern about the adequacy of existing provisions concerning abortion and the possibility of abortion being deemed lawful by judicial interpretation . There was some debate as to whether ORG would follow the course adopted in GPE and GPE in GPE ( cited above ) or in GPE in LAW ( MONEY ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . A referendum was held in DATE , resulting in the adoption of a provision which became LAW , LAW ( PERCENT of the electorate voted with CARDINAL votes in favour and CARDINAL against ) .

A number of cases then came before the courts concerning the interpretation of LAW and the provision of information on or referral to abortion services available in other countries .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( ORG ) obtained an injunction restraining CARDINAL organisations ( Open Door Counselling and the GPE Well FAC ) from furnishing women with information which encouraged or facilitated an abortion . ORG held ( see The Attorney General ( ORG ) v. Open ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ] ) that it was unlawful to disseminate information , including contact information , about foreign abortion services , which had the effect of facilitating the commission of an abortion ( see also FAC ( GPE ) v. PERSON and Others , cited above ) . These CARDINAL organisations then complained about restraints on their freedom to impart and receive information and a violation of LAW was established by ORG ( see Open Door and GPE Well Woman v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ( \u201c the Open Door case \u201d ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The interpretation of LAW was considered in the seminal judgment in the X case . X was DATE when she became pregnant as a result of rape . Her parents arranged for her to have an abortion in GPE and asked the NORP police whether it would be possible to have scientific tests carried out on retrieved foetal tissue with a view to determining the identity of the rapist . ORG was consulted who , in turn , informed the Attorney General . On DATE an interim injunction was granted ex parte on the application of the Attorney General restraining X from leaving the jurisdiction or from arranging or carrying out a termination of the pregnancy . X and her parents returned from GPE to contest the injunction .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , on appeal , a majority ( PERSON , PERSON J. , PERSON O\u2019Flaherty J. , with PERSON ) of ORG discharged the injunction .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Justice noted that no interpretation of the LAW was intended to be final for all time ( citing the domestic case of PERSON , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which statement was \u201c peculiarly appropriate and illuminating in the interpretation of [ LAW ] which deals with the intimate human problem of the right of the unborn to life and its relationship to the right of the mother of an unborn child to her life \u201d . He went on :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Such a harmonious interpretation of the LAW carried out in accordance with concepts of prudence , justice and charity , ... leads me to the conclusion that in vindicating and defending as far as practicable the right of the unborn to life but at the same time giving due regard to the right of the mother to life , the ORG must , amongst the matters to be so regarded , concern itself with the position of the mother within a family group , with persons on whom she is dependent , with , in other instances , persons who are dependent upon her and her interaction with other citizens and members of society in the areas in which her activities occur . Having regard to that conclusion , I am satisfied that the test proposed on behalf of the Attorney General that the life of the unborn could only be terminated if it were established that an inevitable or immediate risk to the life of the mother existed , for the avoidance of which a termination of the pregnancy was necessary , insufficiently vindicates the mother \u2019s right to life .", "CARDINAL . I , therefore , conclude that the proper test to be applied is that if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life , as distinct from the health , of the mother , which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy , such termination is permissible , having regard to the true interpretation of Article [ CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ] of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Considering that a suicide risk had to be taken into account in reconciling the right to life of the mother and the unborn , the Chief Justice continued :", "\u201c DATE . I am , therefore , satisfied that on the evidence before the learned trial judge , which was in no way contested , and on the findings which he has made , that the defendants have satisfied the test which I have laid down as being appropriate and have established , as a matter of probability , that there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother by self - destruction which can only be avoided by termination of her pregnancy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Similar judgments on the substantive issue were delivered by CARDINAL other judges . PERSON noted that \u201c the right of the girl here is a right to a life in being ; the right of the unborn is to a life contingent ; contingent on survival in the womb until successful delivery \u201d . He went on :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In my view , the true construction of the [ Eighth ] Amendment ... is that , paying due regard to the equal right to life of the mother , when there is a real and substantial risk attached to her survival not merely at the time of application but in contemplation at least throughout the pregnancy , then it may not be practicable to vindicate the right to life of the unborn . It is not a question of a risk of a different order of magnitude ; it can never be otherwise than a risk of a different order of magnitude .", "CARDINAL . On the facts of the case , which are not in contest , I am wholly satisfied that a real and substantial risk that the girl might take her own life was established ; it follows that she should not be prevented from having a medical termination of pregnancy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON in some detail on the lack of legislation implementing LAW . He noted in the above - cited PERSON case , that he had already pointed out that no relevant legislation had been enacted since the Eighth Amendment came into force , the direct criminal - law ban on abortion still deriving from LAW . He also noted that the Chief Justice had pointed out in the above - cited Open Door case that it was \u201c unfortunate that the [ ORG ] has not enacted any legislation at all in respect of this constitutionally guaranteed right \u201d .", "Having noted that LAW envisaged a lawful abortion in the ORG and thereby qualified section CARDINAL of LAW ( which had made abortion for any purpose unlawful ) , he continued :", "\u201c ... I agree with the Chief Justice that the want of legislation pursuant to the amendment does not in any way inhibit the courts from exercising a function to vindicate and defend the right to life of the unborn . I think it reasonable , however , to hold that the People when enacting LAW were entitled to believe that legislation would be introduced so as to regulate the manner in which the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of the mother could be reconciled .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the context of DATE that have passed since LAW was adopted and DATE since PERSON \u2019s case the failure by the legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate ; it is inexcusable . What are pregnant women to do ? What are the parents of a pregnant girl under age to do ? What are the medical profession to do ? They have no guidelines save what may be gleaned from the judgments in this case . What additional considerations are there ? Is the victim of rape , statutory or otherwise , or the victim of incest , finding herself pregnant , to be assessed in a manner different from others ? The LAW , born of public disquiet , historically divisive of our people , guaranteeing in its laws to respect and by its laws to defend the right to life of the unborn , remains bare of legislative direction ...", "CARDINAL . ... The ORG may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help , to counsel , to encourage , to comfort , to plan for the pregnant woman , the pregnant girl or her family . It is not for the courts to programme society ; that is partly , at least , the role of the legislature . The courts are not equipped to regulate these procedures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment of ORG gave rise to a number of questions . Certain obiter dicta of the majority in ORG implied that the constitutional right to travel could be limited so as to prevent an abortion taking place where there was no threat to the life of the mother .", "CARDINAL . A further referendum , in which CARDINAL separate proposals were put forward , was held in DATE . A total of PERCENT of the electorate voted .", "CARDINAL . The first was a proposal to amend the LAW to provide for lawful abortion where there would otherwise be a real and substantial risk to the mother \u2019s life , except a risk of suicide . Its acceptance would therefore have limited the impact of the X case : it was rejected ( PERCENT ) .", "CARDINAL . The second proposal was accepted and became LAW to the LAW ( added to LAW . It was designed to ensure that a woman could not be prevented from leaving the jurisdiction for an abortion abroad and it reads as follows :", "\u201c This subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the ORG and another ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The third proposal was also accepted and became LAW ( also added to LAW . It allows for the provision in GPE of information on abortion services abroad and provides as follows :", "\u201c This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available , in the ORG , subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law , information relating to services lawfully available in another ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Further to certain public reflection processes ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , a third referendum on abortion was held in DATE to resolve the legal uncertainty that had existed since the X case by putting draft legislation ( ORG , DATE ) to the electorate . The intention was CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The referendum was designed to ensure that the draft CARDINAL Act , once adopted by referendum , could only be changed by another referendum .", "CARDINAL . The proposed DATE Act defined the crime of abortion ( to replace sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW and to reduce the maximum penalty ) . It also removed the threat of suicide as a ground for a lawful abortion and thereby restricted the grounds recognised in the X case . The definition of abortion excluded \u201c the carrying out of a medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is , in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner , necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman \u2019s life other than by self - destruction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The proposed DATE Act also provided safeguards to medical procedures to protect the life of the mother by setting out the conditions which such procedures were to meet in order to be lawful : the procedures had , inter alia , to be carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved place ; the practitioner had to form a reasonable opinion that the procedure was necessary to save the life of the mother ; the practitioner had also to make and sign a written record of the basis for the opinion ; and there would be no obligation on anyone to carry out or assist in carrying out a procedure .", "CARDINAL . The referendum resulted in the lowest turnout in all CARDINAL abortion referenda ( PERCENT of the electorate ) and the proposal was defeated ( PERCENT against and PERCENT in favour ) . ORG had earlier explained that a negative vote would mean that LAW would remain in place as it was . Any legislation introduced thereafter would have to accord with the present interpretation of the LAW which would mean a threat of suicide would continue to be a ground for a legal abortion .", "CARDINAL . Following the above - described amendments , Article CARDINAL of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

NORP Before its enactment , LAW was referred by the President to ORG for a review of its constitutionality . ORG found it to be constitutional so that the DATE Act thereby became immune from future constitutional challenge ( LAW ) . In so concluding , ORG examined , inter alia , whether the provisions of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL were repugnant to the LAW namely , whether , from an objective point of view , those provisions represented \u201c a fair and reasonable balancing by [ ORG ] of the various conflicting rights and was not so contrary to reason and fairness as to constitute an unjust attack on the constitutional rights of the unborn or on the constitutional rights of the mother or any other person or persons \u201d . In this respect , ORG noted :", "\u201c The [ CARDINAL Act ] merely deals with information relating to services lawfully available outside the ORG for the termination of pregnancies and the persons who provide such services .", "The condition subject to which such information may be provided to a woman who indicates or on whose behalf it is indicated that she is or may be pregnant is that the person giving such information is", "( i ) not permitted to advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy to the woman or any person on her behalf ;", "( ii ) not permitted to give the information unless it is given in a form and manner which do not advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy", "and is only permitted to give information relating to services which are lawfully available in the other ORG and to persons , who in providing them are acting lawfully in that place if", "( a ) the information and the method and manner of its publication are in compliance with the law of that place , and", "( b ) the information is truthful and objective and does not advocate or promote , and is not accompanied by any advocacy or promotion of the termination of pregnancy .", "At the same time information , counselling and advice must be given directly to the woman in relation to all the courses of action that are open to her in relation to her particular circumstances and such information , counselling and advice must not advocate or promote and must not be accompanied by any advocacy or promotion of , the termination of pregnancy .", "Subject to such restrictions , all information relating to services lawfully available outside the ORG and the persons who provide them is available to her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the submission , namely that a woman \u2019s life and/or health might be placed at serious risk in the event that a doctor was unable to send a letter referring her to another doctor for the purposes of having her pregnancy terminated , was based on a misinterpretation of the provisions of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act :", "\u201c This section prohibits a doctor or any person to whom section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL Act ] relates from making an appointment or any other arrangement for or on behalf of a woman with a person who provides services outside the ORG for the termination of pregnancies .", "It does not preclude him , once such appointment is made , from communicating in the normal way with such other doctor with regard to the condition of his patient provided that such communication does not in any way advocate or promote and is not accompanied by any advocacy of the termination of pregnancy .", "While a doctor is precluded by the terms of the [ CARDINAL Act ] from advocating or promoting the termination of pregnancy , he is not in any way precluded from giving full information to a woman with regard to her state of health , the effect of the pregnancy thereon and the consequences to her health and life if the pregnancy continues and leaving to the mother the decision whether in all the circumstances the pregnancy should be terminated . The doctor is not in any way prohibited from giving to his pregnant patient all the information necessary to enable her to make an informed decision provided that he does not advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy .", "In addition , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) does not prohibit or in any way prevent the giving to a woman of any medical , surgical , clinical , social or other like records relating to her .", "...", "Having regard to the obligation on [ ORG ] to respect , and so far as practicable , to defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn having regard to the equal right to life of the mother , the prohibition against the advocacy or promotion of the termination of pregnancy and the prohibition against any person to whom LAW applies making an appointment or any other arrangement for and on behalf of a woman with a person who provides services outside the ORG for the termination of pregnancies does not constitute an unjust attack on the rights of the pregnant woman . These conditions represent a fair and reasonable balancing of the rights involved and consequently sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON are not repugnant to LAW on these grounds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Established in DATE , ORG terms of reference were to review the LAW and to establish those areas where constitutional change might be necessary with a view to assisting the governmental committees in their constitutional review work .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE Report , ORG considered the substantive law on abortion in GPE following the X case and the rejection of LAW to be unclear ( for example , the definition of the unborn , the scope of the admissibility of the suicidal disposition as a ground for abortion and the absence of any statutory time - limit on lawful abortion following the X case criteria ) . ORG considered the option of amending LAW to legalise abortion in constitutionally defined circumstances :", "\u201c Although CARDINAL of women go abroad DATE for abortions without breach of domestic law , there appears to be strong opposition to any extensive legalisation of abortion in the ORG . There might be some disposition to concede limited permissibility in extreme cases , such , perhaps , as those of rape , incest or other grave circumstances . On the other hand , particularly difficult problems would be posed for those committed in principle to the preservation of life from its earliest stage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that , while in principle the major issues should ideally be tackled by constitutional amendment , there was no consensus as to what that amendment should be and no certainty of success for any referendum proposal for substantive constitutional change in relation to LAW . ORG therefore considered that the only practical possibility at that time was the introduction of legislation to regulate the application of LAW . Such legislation could , inter alia , include definitions ( for example of the \u201c unborn \u201d ) ; afford express protection for appropriate medical intervention necessary to protect the life of the mother ; require written certification by appropriate medical specialists of \u201c real and substantial risk to the life of the mother \u201d and impose a time - limit on lawful abortion namely , in circumstances permitted by the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . A cabinet committee was established to supervise the drafting of a Green Paper on abortion and the preparatory work was carried out by an ORG of officials . In drawing up the ORG , submissions were invited from the public , from professional and voluntary organisations and any other parties who wished to contribute . CARDINAL such submissions were received , as well as petitions containing CARDINAL signatures . The introduction to the Green Paper CARDINAL noted the following :", "\u201c The current situation ... is that , constitutionally , termination of pregnancy is not legal in this country unless it meets the conditions laid down by ORG in the NORP case ; information on abortion services abroad can be provided within the terms of the [ CARDINAL Act ] ; and , in general , women can travel abroad for an abortion .", "There are strong bodies of opinion which express dissatisfaction with the current situation , whether in relation to the permissibility of abortion in the ORG or to the numbers of women travelling abroad for abortion .", "Various options have been proposed to resolve what is termed the \u2018 substantive issue\u2019 of abortion but there is a wide diversity of views on how to proceed . The Taoiseach indicated shortly after the government took office in DATE that it was intended to issue a ORG on the subject . The implications of the X case were again brought sharply into focus in DATE as a result of the C case , and a cabinet committee was established to oversee the drafting of this Green Paper , the preparatory work on which was carried out by an interdepartmental group of officials . [ for a description of the C case , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ]", "While the issues surrounding abortion are extremely complex , the objective of this Green Paper is to set out the issues , to provide a brief analysis of them and to consider possible options for the resolution of the problem . The Paper does not attempt to address every single issue in relation to abortion , nor to give an exhaustive analysis of each . Every effort has been made to concentrate on the main issues and to discuss them in a clear , concise and objective way .", "Submissions were invited from interested members of the public , professional and voluntary organisations and any other parties who wished to contribute ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL noted that there was no medical evidence to suggest that doctors in GPE did not treat women with cancer or other illnesses on the grounds that the treatment would damage the unborn .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the Paper comprised a discussion of CARDINAL possible constitutional and legislative solutions :", "\u2013 an absolute constitutional ban on abortion ;", "\u2013 an amendment of the LAW so as to restrict the application of the X case ;", "\u2013 the retention of the status quo ;", "\u2013 the retention of the constitutional status quo with a legislative restatement of the prohibition of abortion ;", "\u2013 legislation to regulate abortion as defined in the NORP case ;", "\u2013 a reversion to the DATE position ; and", "\u2013 permitting abortion beyond the grounds specified in the NORP case .", "DATE . As to the fifth option ( legislation to regulate abortion as defined in the NORP case ) , the Green Paper CARDINAL noted as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP The objective of this approach would be to implement the X case decision by means of legislation ... This approach assumes that there would be no change in the existing wording of LAW .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL In formulating such legislation a possible approach may be not to restate the prohibition on abortion , which is already contained in section CARDINAL of the Offences Against LAW , DATE , but instead to provide that a termination carried out in accordance with the legislation would not be an offence .", "CARDINAL The detail of such legislation would require careful consideration but it could be along the lines of that discussed under the previous option ( retention of the constitutional status quo with legislative restatement of the prohibition on abortion ) .", "Discussion", "CARDINAL NORP Since this option does not provide for a regime more liberal than the X case formulation , no constitutional amendment would be required . This option would , however , provide for abortion in defined circumstances and as such , would be certain to encounter criticism from those who are opposed to abortion on any grounds and who disagreed with the decision in the X case . Central to the criticism would be the inclusion of the threat of suicide as a ground and the difficulties inherent in assessing same .", "CARDINAL NORP The main advantage of this approach is that it would provide a framework within which the need for an abortion could be assessed , rather than resolving the question on a case - by - case basis before the courts , with all the attendant publicity and debate . It would allow pregnant women who establish that there is a real and substantial risk to the their life to have an abortion in GPE rather than travelling out of the jurisdiction and would provide legal protection for medical and other personnel , such as nurses , involved in the procedure to terminate the pregnancy . The current medical ethical guidelines would not be consistent with such legislation .", "CARDINAL It must be pointed out however that the problems of definition in the text of Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL would remain . A decision would be necessary on whether the proposed legislation would provide the definitions necessary to remove the current ambiguity surrounding the text of that Article . There is however a limit to what legislation can achieve by way of definitions as ultimately the interpretation of Article CARDINAL is a matter for the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the Seventh option ( permitting abortion beyond the grounds specified in the NORP case ) , the Green Paper CARDINAL noted as follows :", "\u201c QUANTITY In DATE , other possible grounds for abortion are examined and set where possible in an international context . As indicated earlier , a number of submissions also sought the introduction of abortion on some or all of these grounds . Each of the possible types of provision identified has been considered separately . This does not rule out consideration of a combination of some or all of these options if this approach were to be pursued . Were this to be done , some of the difficulties identified when options are considered separately might not arise .", "CARDINAL NORP In all of the cases discussed in this section , abortion would be permissible only if LAW were amended . Sections MONEY and CARDINAL of the Offences Against LAW , DATE may also need to be reviewed and new legislation to regulate any new arrangement would be necessary . The type of legislative model referred to in the discussion on the option of retention of the constitutional status quo with legislative restatement of the prohibition on abortion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) might , with appropriate adaptations , serve as a basis for regulation in other circumstances also . Issues such as criteria under which an abortion would be permissible , gestational limits , certification and counselling requirements , and possibly a waiting period after counselling , would be among the matters which legislation might address . The provisions in force in some other countries are also discussed in LAW .", "Discussion", "( a ) Risk to physical / mental health of mother", "CARDINAL NORP This option would provide for abortion on grounds of risk to a woman \u2019s physical and/or mental health .", "CARDINAL NORP In DATE the proposed LAW to the LAW was the subject of some criticism on the grounds that it specifically excluded risk to health as grounds for termination of a pregnancy . The LANGUAGE PERSON case of DATE involved interpretation of the Offences Against the Person Act , DATE to permit termination of a pregnancy where a doctor thought that the probable consequence of continuing a pregnancy would be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck .", "CARDINAL NORP As stated earlier , this case has not been specifically followed in any decision of the NORP courts . LAW would rule out an interpretation of the Offences Against the Person Act , DATE in the manner of the PERSON judgement . Therefore any proposal to permit abortion on the grounds of danger to a woman \u2019s health would require amendment of this LAW and possibly a review of the sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Offences Against LAW , DATE . A legislative framework to regulate the operation of such arrangements would also be required .", "CARDINAL NORP As discussed in LAW , \u2018 Other FAC for Abortion , set in an ORG Context\u2019 , the concept of physical health used in other countries for the purposes of abortion law tends not to be very specific . If it were intended to permit abortion on grounds of risk to a woman \u2019s health , but to confine the operation of such a provision to cases where there was a grave risk of serious and permanent damage , it would be necessary to circumscribe the provisions in an appropriate manner . The usual practice in other countries is for the issue to be treated as a medical matter . It could be anticipated that it might be difficult to arrive at provisions which would allow clinical independence and at the same time be guaranteed to operate in a very strict manner so as not to permit abortion other than on a very limited basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Green Paper CARDINAL was then referred to this ORG . The ORG consulted widely , initially seeking submissions on the options discussed in the Green Paper CARDINAL . CARDINAL submissions were received from individuals and organisations . PERCENT of these communications took the form of signatures to petitions ( CARDINAL signatures were contained in CARDINAL petition alone ) . The vast majority of communications were in favour of the first option in the Green Paper CARDINAL ( an absolute constitutional ban on abortion ) .", "CARDINAL . Since very few medical organisations had made submissions during the preparation of the Green Paper CARDINAL , ORG was concerned to establish authoritatively the current medical practice in NORP hospitals as regards medical intervention during pregnancies . The ORG therefore heard the views and opinions of experts in the fields of obstetrics , gynaecology and psychiatry through public ( and recorded ) hearings .", "CARDINAL . The Chairman of ORG , which represents PERCENT of the obstetricians and gynaecologists in GPE , gave written evidence , inter alia :", "\u201c In current obstetrical practice rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention is required at a stage in pregnancy when there will be little or no prospect for the survival of the baby , due to extreme immaturity . In these exceptional situations failure to intervene may result in the death of both the mother and baby . We consider that there is a fundamental difference between abortion carried out with the intention of taking the life of the baby , for example for social reasons , and the unavoidable death of the baby resulting from essential treatment to protect the life of the mother .", "We recognise our responsibility to provide aftercare for women who decide to leave the ORG for a termination of pregnancy . We recommend that full support and follow - up services be made available for all women whose pregnancies have been terminated , whatever the circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In oral evidence , the Chairman also noted the following :", "\u201c We have never regarded these interventions as abortion . It would never cross an obstetrician \u2019s mind that intervening in a case of pre - eclampsia , cancer of the cervix or ectopic pregnancy is abortion . They are not abortion as far as the professional is concerned , these are medical treatments that are essential to protect the life of the mother . So when we interfere in the best interests of protecting a mother , and not allowing her to succumb , and we are faced with a foetus that dies , we do n\u2019t regard that as something that we have , as it were , achieved by an abortion . Abortion in the professional view to my mind is something entirely different . It is actually intervening , usually in a normal pregnancy , to get rid of the pregnancy , to get rid of the foetus . That is what we would consider the direct procurement of an abortion . In other words , it \u2019s an unwanted baby and , therefore , you intervene to end its life . That has never been a part of the practice of NORP obstetrics and I hope it never will be .", "...", "In dealing with complex rare situations , where there is a direct physical threat to the life of the pregnant mother , we will intervene always . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG issued its ORG . The ORG explained that this was not a comprehensive analysis of the matters discussed in the Green Paper DATE but rather a political assessment of questions which arose from it in the context of the submissions received and the hearings conducted .", "CARDINAL . The Committee on the LAW agreed that a specific agency should be put in place to implement a strategy to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies by the provision of preventative services , to reduce the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services which make other options more attractive and to provide post - abortion services consisting of counselling and medical check - ups . There was agreement on other matters including the need for the government to prepare a public memorandum outlining the ORG \u2019s precise responsibilities under all relevant international and ORG instruments .", "DATE . The ORG agreed that clarity in legal provisions was essential for the guidance of the medical profession so that any legal framework should ensure that doctors could carry out best medical practice to save the life of the mother . However , the ORG found that none of the CARDINAL options canvassed in the Green Paper CARDINAL commanded unanimous support of ORG . CARDINAL approaches commanded substantial but not majority support : the first was to concentrate on the plan to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and the rate of abortion and to leave the legal position unchanged ; the second approach would add legislation which would protect medical intervention to safeguard the life of the mother within the existing constitutional framework ; and the third approach was in addition to accommodate such legislation with a LAW amendment . The ORG did not therefore reach agreement on a single course of reform action .", "CARDINAL . Further to ORG , the CPA was established by ORG Order CARDINAL ( ORG . CARDINAL of DATE ) . LAW of that Order described the functions of the ORG in its relevant part as follows ( prior to its amendment in DATE ) :", "\u201c ( i ) ... to prepare a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy , this strategy to provide , inter alia , for :", "( a ) a reduction in the number of crisis pregnancies by the provision of education , advice and contraceptive services ;", "( b ) a reduction in the number of women with crisis pregnancies who opt for abortion by offering services and supports which make other options more attractive ;", "( c ) the provision of counselling and medical services after crisis pregnancy .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The CPA implemented its first Strategy ( DATE ) and is in the process of implementing its second one ( DATE ) . It achieves its objectives mainly through its communications programme ( including media campaigns and resource materials ) , its research programme ( promoting evidence - based practice and policy development ) and its funding programme which funds projects ranging from personal development to counselling , parent supports and medical and health services .", "CARDINAL . Further to ORG DATE , the CPA was integrated into the ORG ( ORG ) from CARDINAL DATE . Funding of the crisis pregnancy function was also transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The CPA Guidelines , developed in association with ORG , outline the role of GPs in the management of crisis pregnancy . The PERSON detail the role of GPs in the prevention of crisis pregnancies , in assisting the woman in making decisions about the outcome of her crisis pregnancy ( by , inter alia , counselling on all options available to her including pregnancy , adoption and abortion ) and assisting her in safely carrying out her decision ( by , inter alia , advising on the importance of follow - up care , including medical care , after any abortion ) . GPs are advised on the importance of providing sensitive counselling to assist the decision - making process ( \u201c to minimise the risk of emotional disturbance , whatever decision is reached \u201d ) and of pre- and post - abortion counselling and medical care . GPs are reminded of their duty of care to the patient , that they should never refuse treatment on the basis of moral disapproval of the patient \u2019s behaviour and that , where they have a conscientious objection to providing care , they should make the names of other GPs available to the patient .", "The Guidelines went on to note that , \u201c [ i]rrespective of what decision a woman makes in the crisis pregnancy situation , follow - up care will be important . This may include antenatal care , counselling , future contraception or medical care after abortion . The ORG \u2019s response to the initial consultation will have a profound influence on her willingness to attend for further care . \u201d If a woman decides to proceed with an abortion , it is the ORG \u2019s main concern to ensure that she does so safely , receives proper medical care , and returns for appropriate follow - up . GPs are advised to supplement verbal advice with a written handout .", "CARDINAL . A Patient Information Leaflet is attached to the Guidelines . It informs women that , should they choose an abortion , they should plan to visit their ORG DATE after the termination to allow the ORG to carry out a full check - up and allow the woman to express any questions or concerns she may have .", "CARDINAL . The subject of this report was the perceptions of NORP women in the general age range of CARDINAL about fertility , sex and motherhood . The Report captured the meanings young women attributed to their fertility and fertility - related decisions in relation to life objectives and women \u2019s changing roles in education , careers , relationships , and motherhood . The report uses data drawn from qualitative interviews ( CARDINAL individual case studies and CARDINAL focus groups ; the total sample was CARDINAL women with an age range of CARDINAL ) . The research reflected the views of a diverse group of women by socio - economic status , geographic location , and relationship history . The data demonstrated a need for greater support for young NORP women in the range and variety of their decision - making about fertility , sex and motherhood .", "CARDINAL . The significant findings included the fact that the X case and the declining role of ORG were major events in the lives of young women and shaped their attitudes and experiences . PERSON women had moved into adulthood more firmly convinced that sexual and reproductive decisions should be part of a person \u2019s private actions , with the freedom to decide as they thought best .", "CARDINAL . The aim of the study was to establish nationally representative data on current attitudes , knowledge and experience of contraception , crisis pregnancy and related services in GPE . It carried out a cross - sectional national survey of the young adult population using a telephone interview ( in DATE ) of CARDINAL members of the public to include equal numbers of women and men and people aged DATE in order to focus on those for whom contraceptive practices , service perceptions and service usage were considered most relevant . It was also considered that the age profile of the sample meant that the results would be particularly relevant to the contemporary evaluation of services and in planning for the future .", "CARDINAL . Public attitudes to aspects of crisis - pregnancy outcomes were assessed to evaluate the acceptability of alternative outcomes ( lone parenting , adoption and abortion ) . The questions were adapted from a prior survey in DATE and the replication of these questions in the CPA study provided an opportunity to measure any changes in attitudes to abortion . In the DATE survey , over PERCENT of participants indicated that they believed abortion should not be permissible under any circumstances while PERCENT felt that it should be allowed in certain circumstances and PERCENT did not express a view .", "CARDINAL . In the CPA study , the question was extended to include the option that a woman \u201c should always have a choice to have an abortion , regardless of the circumstances \u201d : PERCENT of participants felt that abortion should not be permissible under any circumstances , PERCENT felt that it should be allowed under certain circumstances , PERCENT felt that women should always have a choice to have an abortion and PERCENT were unsure .

The ORG described the results as follows :", "\u201c The level of agreement reported across possible circumstances under which an abortion may be acceptable varied greatly across circumstance . The majority of these participants agreed that a woman should have a choice to have an abortion if the pregnancy seriously endangered her life ( PERCENT ) or her health ( PERCENT ) .

But it would be wrong to turn ORG into some kind of licensing authority for abortions and indeed it was for this reason that I have rejected a suggestion made by counsel for C in this case that I should effectively convert the judicial review proceedings into an independent application invoking the inherent jurisdiction of ORG and grant leave for such a termination to take place .

The ORG is nonetheless concerned that , in many of these GPE , numerous conditions are imposed and restrict the effective access to safe , affordable , acceptable and appropriate abortion services . These restrictions have discriminatory effects , since women who are well informed and possess adequate financial means can often obtain legal and safe abortions more easily .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes that , in member GPE where abortion is permitted for a number of reasons , conditions are not always such as to guarantee women effective access to this right : the lack of local health care facilities , the lack of doctors willing to carry out abortions , the repeated medical consultations required , the time allowed for changing one \u2019s mind and the waiting time for the abortion all have the potential to make access to safe , affordable , acceptable and appropriate abortion services more difficult , or even impossible in practice .", "CARDINAL . The ORG takes the view that abortion should not be banned within reasonable gestational limits . A ban on abortions does not result in fewer abortions but mainly leads to clandestine abortions , which are more traumatic and increase maternal mortality and/or lead to abortion \u2018 ORG which is costly , and delays the timing of an abortion and results in social inequities . The lawfulness of abortion does not have an effect on a woman \u2019s need for an abortion , but only on her access to a safe abortion .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , evidence shows that appropriate sexual and reproductive health and rights strategies and policies , including compulsory age - appropriate , gender - sensitive sex and relationships education for young people , result in less recourse to abortion . This type of education should include teaching on self - esteem , healthy relationships , the freedom to delay sexual activity , avoiding peer pressure , contraceptive advice , and considering consequences and responsibilities .", "CARDINAL . The ORG affirms the right of all human beings , in particular women , to respect for their physical integrity and to freedom to control their own bodies . In this context , the ultimate decision on whether or not to have an abortion should be a matter for the woman concerned , who should have the means of exercising this right in an effective way .", "CARDINAL . The ORG invites the member ORG to :", "CARDINAL . decriminalise abortion within reasonable gestational limits , if they have not already done so ;", "CARDINAL . NORP guarantee women \u2019s effective exercise of their right of access to a safe and legal abortion ;", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL . allow women freedom of choice and offer the conditions for a free and enlightened choice without specifically promoting abortion ;", "CARDINAL . NORP lift restrictions which hinder , de jure or de facto , access to safe abortion , and , in particular , take the necessary steps to create the appropriate conditions for health , medical and psychological care and offer suitable financial cover ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner noted that there was still no legislation in place implementing the X judgment and , consequently , no legal certainty as to when a doctor might legally perform a life - saving abortion . He opined that , in practice , abortion was largely unavailable in GPE in almost all circumstances . He noted the NORP v. GPE judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) and urged the NORP authorities to ensure that legislation was enacted to resolve this problem .", "CARDINAL .
