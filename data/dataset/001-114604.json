GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP national , ORG , was found dead in GPE , GPE . Subsequently , the applicant was arrested in GPE in connection with her murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of homicide and sentenced him to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment was upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the NORP authorities requested the NORP authorities to take over the execution of the applicant \u2019s sentence . On DATE they also decided that the applicant was to be expelled from GPE and prohibited from returning for DATE . The applicant did not give his consent to his transfer to GPE . On DATE ORG decided that it was possible to transfer the applicant to GPE under LAW ( LAW ) and its LAW . Afterwards the Polish ORG agreed to his transfer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG gave a ruling on the legal qualification of the offence under NORP law and on the enforcement of the sentence . It considered that the offence of which the applicant had been convicted in GPE fulfilled the description of the offence of homicide prohibited by Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW Criminal Code . The court further considered that this offence carried under NORP law a minimum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment or life imprisonment . Thus the sentence imposed in GPE did not exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering ORG and it was not necessary to adapt the sanction .", "CARDINAL . In consequence the court decided that the applicant would serve the sentence of life imprisonment in GPE .

The applicant appealed against the ruling . He complained in particular about the decision not to apply regulations pertaining to conditional release that were binding in the sentencing country , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the judgment . The court amended the legal basis of ORG judgment in that it considered that the latter court had correctly converted the applicant \u2019s sentence according to ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) and CARDINAL of LAW . Moreover , the court admitted that the rules pertaining to conditional release differed between GPE and GPE . In GPE a person in the applicant \u2019s situation could apply for parole after having served CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment whereas in GPE that term was shorter and amounted to DATE . However , the court decided not to rule on the matter of conditional release as the NORP judgment did not include a provision on the length of the sentence the applicant would have to serve before he was eligible to apply for conditional release . Therefore , NORP rules on enforcement of sentences would be applicable to the case .", "CARDINAL .
