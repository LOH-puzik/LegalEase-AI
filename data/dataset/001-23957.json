{"ITEMID": "001-23957", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "RAIPOLA v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant set up a limited liability company , ORG , with another person . He purchased MONEY of the shares . He also became the chairman of its ORG . The company 's business activities ended in DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for an income - related unemployment benefit . ORG ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myyskassa , arbetsl\u00f6shetskassan ) rejected his application on DATE , as he was not assessed as being unemployed . The decision was based on ORG ( ty\u00f6voimatoimikunta , arbetskraftskommissionen ) written statement , according to which , taking into account the applicant 's position and partnership in the company , he was regarded as being employed by his own company . The applicant 's appeals were subsequently rejected .", "In DATE , the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG of GPE ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) against ORG ( ty\u00f6voima- ja elinkeinokeskus , arbetskrafts- och n\u00e4ringslivscentralen ) , i.e. formally against ORG , claiming compensation for his financial loss . He argued that before setting up the company , he had called his local ORG ( ty\u00f6voimatoimisto , arbetskraftsbyr\u00e5n ) , enquiring about the possibilities of receiving unemployment benefits as a shareholder of a company . An official at ORG , X , had allegedly told him that he could receive unemployment benefits , provided he owned MONEY of the company 's shares .", "Before ORG , the applicant argued that as his application for an unemployment benefit had been rejected , it meant that X had provided him with incorrect information .", "ORG contested the action , arguing that X had not said that the applicant could own MONEY of a company 's shares , which information was incorrect . Moreover , the applicant had failed to make reference to his position in the company during his discussion with X.", "The applicant and CARDINAL witnesses , who had overheard the conversation between the applicant and X as the telephone had been switched to the \u201c hands - free \u201d system , gave testimony in FAC . The witnesses verified that X had said that the applicant would still be entitled to unemployment benefits , provided he owned MONEY of the shares .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the action , finding that ORG decision was based both on the applicant 's ownership in the company and on his membership of its ORG . ORG also found that the applicant and X had not discussed whether the membership of ORG had any effect on the grant of the benefit . Thus , there was no causal link between the incorrect information given by X and the rejection of the application for an unemployment benefit .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting an oral hearing and that he and his CARDINAL witnesses be reheard . He also invoked as new evidence ORG decision , arguing that ORG had drawn the wrong conclusions from the wording of the decision . He claimed that his application had not been rejected due to the fact that he was a member of ORG , but solely on grounds of ownership . Due to this misinterpretation by ORG , it was essential that ORG hold an oral hearing .", "On DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment . As to the request for an oral hearing , it noted that the applicant admitted not having informed X about his membership of ORG . Thus , ORG found that it was not necessary to evaluate the testimonies concerning the telephone conversation between the applicant and X. Insofar as the applicant argued that ORG had drawn the wrong conclusions from ORG decision , it noted that the issue concerned interpretation of and drawing conclusions from written evidence and that the applicant had not proposed any oral evidence on this point . ORG rejected the request for an oral hearing as being manifestly unnecessary , as the examination of the case did not depend on the credibility of oral evidence .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing with a view to hearing all CARDINAL witnesses that had been heard before FAC , including the opposing party 's witness , and a new witness . He also wanted to be heard in person . He argued that ORG had wrongly evaluated the evidence and refused his request to rehear his witnesses . On DATE ORG refused him leave to appeal .", "Under chapter CARDINAL ( PERSON ) , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the applicant was in principle entitled to a hearing once he had requested CARDINAL , but this request could be refused , if a hearing would have been manifestly unnecessary .", "According to subsection CARDINAL , if ORG rejects the appellant 's request for an oral hearing , he or she shall , where necessary , be reserved an opportunity to supplement the appeal .", "According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ORG shall hold an oral hearing regardless of whether one has been requested , if a decision on the matter turns on the credibility of the testimony admitted in ORG , or the findings of ORG in an inspection , or on new testimony to be admitted in ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
