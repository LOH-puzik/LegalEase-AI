The applicant has a young daughter , M .- A. , who was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her daughter , who had lived in GPE since the latter \u2019s birth , arrived in GPE by aeroplane . As soon as she had landed , the applicant consulted the airport medical service because her daughter had not been feeling well . The duty doctor found that the little girl was vomiting and had a temperature of NORP and , accordingly , had her admitted to hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the hospital psychiatric department applied to ORG to have M .- A. removed from her mother \u2019s care and for an injunction on the mother visiting her until the complex medical and psychiatric state of the child , who did not speak NORP , had been clearly diagnosed . According to the doctor in charge of ORG case , the applicant had a clinical obsession with her daughter \u2019s health . It had also been very difficult to assess the little girl \u2019s psychological state because the applicant had constantly interfered with her treatment and medical examinations . The doctor stated lastly that the applicant had attempted to remove her daughter from the hospital in breach ( he said ) of recommendations already made by the court . However , there is no evidence that the court had previously been called upon to make any decision with respect to the applicant or her daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG provinciale per l\u2019assistenza GPE ) for the province of GPE supplied the court with the information it had been able to obtain by interviewing the applicant , the hospital staff and the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON , who had lived in GPE for a long time . According to the Institute , the evidence gathered showed that the applicant had had M .- A. hospitalised on several occasions , in particular in paediatric hospitals in GPE , GPE and GPE , because she had believed the little girl to be seriously ill . ORG also reported that during M .- A. \u2019s last period in hospital in GPE , in DATE , ORG had been asked to issue an injunction forbidding the applicant to remove her daughter from the hospital and to open proceedings to have the little girl adopted . The applicant had , however , succeeded in smuggling her daughter out of the hospital and reaching GPE . The ORG stated , lastly , that M .- A. did not appear to be troubled by the separation from her mother , even though she asked for news of her .", "CARDINAL . In its final report , dated DATE , the psychiatric department of the GPE hospital made the following recommendations to ORG :", "( a ) that M .- A. should be kept away from her mother ;", "( b ) that M .- A. should be discharged from hospital as soon as possible ;", "( c ) that she should be placed with a family in which the parents had an emotionally stable relationship ; and", "( d ) that she should be settled in a school and take part in social activities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The hospital had formed the opinion that M .- A. had developed a pathological bond with her mother , a bond which met the needs of the mother rather than the child \u2019s developmental requirements . The little girl had reacted to the separation from her mother with anxiety and depression but had shown herself capable of overcoming this by relying on other images of women . She had demonstrated great interest in other children of her age and an excellent capacity for socialisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that M .- A. be temporarily placed with the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s family .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime PERSON and his wife had persuaded the applicant to seek treatment and on DATE she was admitted to the psychiatric department of a hospital in DATE , near GPE . According to a medical report dated DATE , she was suffering from chronic psychosis , the constitutive element of which was a form of vicarious hypochondria focused on her daughter . The applicant left the hospital on the date of the report and returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG , which had acquired jurisdiction over the case because of where the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s family lived , found that M .- A. \u2019s placement with that family could no longer continue because of a series of problems within it . The court decided , in consequence , to keep the child away from the applicant and to place her in the care of social services on the basis that she should be placed with another family as soon as possible . The court also ordered a comprehensive psychological report on the mother . Lastly , it ordered that proceedings under LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) should be set in motion with a view to a declaration that M .- A. was available for adoption . Under that provision , \u201c ORG , may , even of its own motion , declare \u2026 . a minor available for adoption if he has been abandoned in the sense of being deprived of all emotional or material support from his parents or the members of his family responsible for providing such support ( other than in temporary cases of force majeure ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the court suspended the applicant \u2019s parental responsibility and ordered that there should for the time being be no contact between the little girl and her mother or the other members of her family . In view of the urgency of the matter , the court did not hear submissions from ORG or the applicant . It based its decision primarily on a report on ORG psychological health prepared by ORG . According to that report , M .- A. was suffering from anxiety and depression together with an almost neurotic tendency to satisfy her immediate needs . Her perception of the image of her parents was problematic : that of her mother was difficult to identify and that of her father , whom she had never met , aroused fear and remained abstract . The report \u2019s conclusion was that the little girl was suffering from serious emotional and relationship problems due to the pathological behaviour of her mother , who had for a long time been her sole source of stimulation . Noting the potential represented by the child \u2019s will to develop emotionally in a positive way , the report recommended that she should be placed with an emotionally stable family , be given suitable psychological help and be integrated into a stimulating socio - scholastic environment .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged her first application with ORG , seeking to have the order of CARDINAL DATE revoked . She argued , inter alia , that her daughter had lived her whole life in GPE and that at the time at which she had been separated from her mother she had not even been able to speak or understand NORP . The applicant also pointed out that under LAW preliminary provisions of LAW , as it had stood at the time , the relationship between parent and child was governed by the law of the mother \u2019s country if the father \u2019s identity was not known .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the court ordered the social services department in charge of ORG case to give an opinion on her suitability for adoption , emphasising that the matter was urgent .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , M .- A. \u2019s father had recognised her as his daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared M .- A. available for adoption after hearing submissions from , among others , the applicant , M .- A. \u2019s maternal grandmother and PERSON The court held that the little girl had been abandoned within the meaning of LAW no . CARDINAL , given the mother \u2019s situation and the fact that it was impossible to place the child with her maternal uncle \u2019s family . It also held that no weight could be given to the late recognition of M .- A. by her natural father , who had never seen her and who did not know her first name . Lastly , on the question of whether NORP law applied , it held , following the case - law of ORG , that it was sufficient for a child who had been abandoned to be within NORP territory for NORP law to apply .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a second application , submitting , inter alia , that the report of DATE on her psychiatric state had been based on an account of her medical history reconstructed primarily from information supplied by her sister - in - law , with whom she had had no contact before coming to GPE , and who could not therefore know what her life with her daughter in GPE had been like . Moreover , the court should have taken account of the fact that the applicant had had herself voluntarily admitted to LOC hospital because she was afraid of being separated from her daughter . She submitted lastly that it could not be said that M .- A. had been \u201c abandoned \u201d since she ( the applicant ) received an allowance and also owned an apartment in GPE which brought in rent . The applicant asked the court to order a report on her mental health and enclosed an expert report which she had had drawn up privately and which stated that separating a child from its mother could be justified only on exceptional grounds , which did not exist in the applicant \u2019s case , and that certain symptoms of anxiety and depression in the applicant had been caused by the separation from her daughter .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG at ORG had informed the NORP authorities that , contrary to the information provided by ORG of the province of GPE on DATE , the GPE court had never taken any action concerning the applicant or her daughter .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing in the case was held on DATE . A second hearing was scheduled for DATE but was apparently adjourned because of a delay in M .- A. \u2019s case file arriving from ORG .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE the doctor who had been in charge of the applicant \u2019s case at ORG hospital stated that he had obtained his information on the applicant \u2019s recent past directly from her but that the general information about her life had been supplied by her sister - in - law . He said that the applicant \u2019s sister - in - law had at first thought it desirable for the applicant to stay in hospital and DATE , when the doctor had asked her to think of an alternative , had suggested that the applicant should return to GPE . The doctor stated lastly that his diagnosis of chronic psychosis had been based on the information provided by the sister - in - law and acknowledged that he had never asked the applicant if she had had other children or any abortions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG again asked ORG to send it the little girl \u2019s case file , emphasising the urgency of the matter . The GPE case file was finally sent to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The final hearing took place on DATE . M .- A. \u2019s guardian ad litem ( curatore speciale ) applied to have the order of CARDINAL DATE set aside on the grounds that the bench had been improperly composed . That application was allowed and the order in question annulled .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the court registry on DATE and served on the applicant on DATE of DATE , the court issued a fresh declaration that M .- A. was available for adoption . The court , which had not heard evidence from the child and whose decision reflected the submissions of ORG , based its ruling on the same grounds as those given in the annulled decision of DATE , namely , inter alia , the medical reports of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The court also noted the fact that M .- A. \u2019s natural father intended to marry the applicant but without attributing any significance to it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who had meanwhile applied for the adoption process to be suspended , applied for an order setting aside that decision . She submitted , first , that it slavishly followed the reasoning set out in the first order and argued in particular that the diagnosis of her mental health made in DATE could not provide grounds for a decision reached DATE , given that a declaration of availability for adoption should be based on the circumstances existing at the time it was made . The applicant also declared her willingness to be supervised by social services so as to ensure a better upbringing for her daughter . She asked lastly for permission to see her daughter again , on neutral ground and in the presence of social workers , for M .- A. to give evidence and for an expert report on herself to be ordered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also filed a number of expert reports by psychologists in private practice . CARDINAL of them , by a forensic medical examiner specialising in psychiatry , stated that a diagnosis of \u201c chronic \u201d psychosis would have to be based on psychotic antecedents , of which there was no evidence in the records of the applicant , a trained nurse who had always practised her profession successfully . It also stated that the applicant \u2019s concerns about her daughter \u2019s health were based on real evidence and were not \u201c delusions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . There was indeed evidence that a number of doctors had in the past diagnosed M .- A. as having health problems . The case file contained :", "a certificate of DATE from the medical faculty of ORG certifying the existence of an unspecified medical problem ;", "another certificate from the same faculty dated DATE stating that the little girl 's immune system was deficient and recommending that she should not be vaccinated , should avoid any contact with other children who might be carrying viruses and should not be sent to school ;", "a certificate of DATE from a doctor in private practice recommending regular medical and pharmaceutical treatment and a change of climate ;", "a certificate of DATE from another specialist in private practice diagnosing infections of the digestive and respiratory organs and prescribing the use of oxygen at home during attacks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL expert reports ordered by the court were completed . In DATE evidence was taken from ORG grandfather and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court took evidence from the applicant and ordered a psychological report on the little girl .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE a number of lay and expert witnesses gave evidence ( a hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned because the applicant \u2019s counsel had had a road accident ) .", "CARDINAL . A hearing on DATE was devoted to evidence from a number of witnesses called by the applicant , who also asked for a hearing to be scheduled to enable witnesses from GPE to testify .", "CARDINAL . A hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned because of the need to replace CARDINAL of the members of the bench and also because the applicant had applied for an adjournment . The following hearing , scheduled for CARDINAL DATE , was also adjourned because the witnesses from GPE whom the applicant had called had failed to appear . The court was consequently obliged to issue rogatory letters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , noting that the final hearing had been adjourned to DATE , complained that , in spite of her repeated requests , no meeting between her daughter and herself had been arranged and the court had taken no measures to enable her to explore the possibility of re - establishing a relationship with her daughter but had failed to respond to her requests or refused them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , following ORG recommendation , dismissed that complaint .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the declaration of availability for adoption to be set aside . The court first examined the time taken to reach a decision at first instance . It found that the length of the proceedings had been caused by the applicant \u2019s numerous requests for lay and expert witnesses to be called , to the large number of documents she had produced and her frequent changes of legal representative , as well as by the workload of the court . It pointed out , moreover , that it had not received the additional information requested from ORG until the final hearing .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the case , the court began by acknowledging the extremely complex nature of the case ( which it described as CARDINAL of the most difficult it had ever had to determine ) and the difficulty of building an accurate picture of what the applicant and her daughter \u2019s situation in GPE had really been . It noted that when M .- A. had last been in hospital in GPE , the department where she was a patient had informed ORG of her situation , with a view to possibly having her removed from the applicant \u2019s care . The applicant had then smuggled her out of the hospital and left for GPE . Indeed , while M .- A. was a patient in the hospital , the doctors had had her transferred to the child psychology department , the children in which were usually destined for adoption .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court emphasised that the report which it had commissioned on ORG had established that she had never had any serious medical problem until DATE , a finding certified by the hospitals to which she had been admitted ( in GPE , GPE and GPE ) . The report had also stated that the little girl suffered from common childhood complaints which could be treated by ordinary medical methods and did not justify her mother \u2019s obsessive health - care measures or the continual hospitalisations which the latter had made her undergo , frequently against medical advice .", "CARDINAL . The court placed particular emphasis on the fact that the report of CARDINAL October CARDINAL from the GPE hospital referred to aspects of the relationship between the applicant and her daughter which were extremely similar to those noted DATE , on DATE , by the doctor from the GPE hospital , aspects which had led the latter to notify ORG at ORG . It was clear , according to the court , that the doctor in GPE had not known of the identical step taken by his NORP colleague . Those CARDINAL documents demonstrated the tragic conditions in which ORG had lived up to that time : isolated , without contact with other children of her age and trapped in the role of patient which , in reality , was satisfying the needs of her mother , with whom she had a symbiotic relationship . The tribunal found that the circumstances of the sudden departure for GPE were equally significant : the applicant had taken CARDINAL cases , had bought the airline tickets at the airport , had abandoned her job DATE before retirement , had abandoned her flat and had taken M .- A. out of school , which she had recently started attending for the first time . The court considered that the explanation put forward by the applicant , who had stated that she had left for GPE in order to find her father \u2013 whose address she did not know and whom she had not seen since DATE \u2013 was not convincing . Moreover , once in GPE the applicant had again attempted to discharge her daughter from hospital without permission when criticised for the way in which she treated her\u2013 as had also happened in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to observe that the little girl who had arrived in GPE pale , sad , with numerous decayed teeth and difficulty in walking DATE despite constant treatment from her mother for health problems which were really not serious \u2013 was now a happy , healthy little girl . Furthermore , a psychological report on the child showed that during her life in GPE she had felt like a prisoner in her home , where she was constantly being given injections , put on drips and treated with other medical apparatus and was taken to hospital against her will as soon as she felt in the slightest degree unwell . The report had also been able to establish that M .- A. had been happy to be placed with another family and had distanced herself from the memory of her mother , and that the idea of entering into contact with her again aroused fears in the child .", "CARDINAL . The court remarked , lastly , that the applicant , who had supplied it with a minute account of all the illnesses from which her daughter was allegedly suffering , had never told it about her physical characteristics , her personality or her preferences . Nor had the applicant at any point in the proceedings demonstrated a willingness to open certain of her attitudes towards her daughter up to discussion . In the face of this unwillingness to look at herself critically , all attempts to influence the convictions of the applicant , who had never been aware of having any psychological problems , had been in vain . Even though the applicant had spared no effort in relation to her daughter \u2013 albeit misguidedly DATE and even though her allegations as to the behaviour of the members of her family were not completely without foundation , she had not demonstrated an ability to remedy her psychological state so as to enable her to have renewed contact with her child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She submitted , inter alia , that whenever M .- A. had been hospitalised it had always been for good reason and following medical diagnosis . She also emphasised that she had always been concerned for her daughter and her daughter \u2019s upbringing . She submitted that there were a number of witnesses to confirm that she had had a good relationship with her daughter and that the little girl had been living in a completely normal environment .", "CARDINAL . ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in a judgment of DATE , deposited with the court registry on CARDINAL DATE . The court of appeal placed emphasis on , inter alia , the importance of the fact that a doctor from the GPE hospital had sought to inform ORG at the local court of the seriousness of the little girl \u2019s situation , and on the significant circumstance that an identical step had been taken by the doctor at the GPE hospital . The court also found that the expert reports which the applicant had commissioned could not diminish the weight of those prepared for the court , given the general nature of the contents of the former and their lack of specific observations . Nor had the testimony favourable to the applicant been such as to lead to a different conclusion from that set out in the thorough expert reports ordered by the court , since that testimony had concerned only limited contact with the applicant and her daughter and therefore did not go beyond appearances . The court of appeal held , lastly , that it was unnecessary and undesirable to hear evidence from M .- A. again as she had already been questioned at length by the court - appointed expert and that examination had shown that the little girl had already made her choice from a psychological point of view .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG on a point of law . She submitted , inter alia , that , under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , an adoption order was justified only when a child had been abandoned in the sense of being deprived of all emotional or material support ; the fact of taking great care of the child \u2019s health \u2013 on the basis of medical diagnoses , even ones later revealed to be mistaken \u2013 could not be a ground for such an order . The applicant also complained of the fact that the courts had never attempted to assess the manner in which her own situation and state of health had improved , something which , combined with the fact that M .- A. was older , could have justified an attempt to re - establish contact between herself and her daughter at a later stage , before any relationship between them had been finally destroyed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the court registry on CARDINAL October of that year , the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed . ORG observed , first , that it had consistently held that a situation of abandonment could arise as a result not only of a lack of material and emotional support , but also of parental behaviour that prejudiced the healthy , balanced development of the child \u2019s personality . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the courts had separated her from her daughter without first making any recommendation , either to the applicant or social services , as to how the situation could be remedied , ORG emphasised that such a decision was a matter for the discretion of the courts concerned , which had deemed any such attempt vain in view of the chronic nature of the applicant \u2019s illness . The court held , lastly , that the issue as to whether or not M .- A. should have given evidence was also a matter for the discretion of the tribunals of fact , so that it had no power to review it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was finally adopted by her foster parents . According to information from the applicant , which the respondent Government have not disputed , the applicant has succeeded in having presents delivered to her . On DATE M .- A. came of age ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
