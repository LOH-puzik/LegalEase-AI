THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Pauliine Koskelo;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr P. Rule , counsel , a barrister practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . When a person is sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment , the normal practice is for that person to be released \u201c on licence \u201d after serving CARDINAL of the sentence . The licence period usually lasts for the remainder of the sentence and during this period the person may be recalled to prison if he or she breaches the conditions of the licence .", "CARDINAL . When an offender is convicted of certain sexual or violent offences , the sentencing court may pass an \u201c extended sentence \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . In such cases , if the offender is sentenced to a determinate term of imprisonment he or she is usually released after serving CARDINAL of that sentence . However , an additional licence period known as \u201c the extension period \u201d takes effect after the normal licence period ceases . This extension period can be of such length as the court considers necessary to protect members of the public from serious harm .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE persons convicted of certain sexual offences are required to notify the police of various personal details . This includes the person \u2019s current address , any change of address and any other address at which they stay for DATE or more . They must provide their national insurance numbers to the police and must allow the police to take their photograph and fingerprints for the purpose of verifying their identity . They must also give advance notice to the police of any foreign travel .", "CARDINAL . These notification requirements were first enacted in LAW and subsequently re - enacted , with minor amendments , in sections CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs DATE below ) . The notification period varies according to the term of imprisonment imposed on the offender . For a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE , it is DATE from the date of conviction , but for a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE or more it is indefinite .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. S ( PERSON ) [ DATE ] ORG R CARDINAL ORG , in observations which were subsequently treated as obiter , expressed the view that on plain construction the phrase \u201c term of imprisonment \u201d in the ORG DATE did not include a sentence of extended licence . However , in R v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr App ( S ) CARDINAL ORG held that in this respect R v. S ( PERSON ) had been decided per incuriam and was wrong . In determining the length of the \u201c qualifying sentence \u201d for the purposes of making an order disqualifying an offender from working with children , ORG found that the whole length of the extended sentence had to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to CARDINAL offences of taking indecent photographs of a child , CARDINAL offences of voyeurism and CARDINAL of indecent assault . The maximum penalty for the offences of taking indecent photographs of a child and indecent assault was DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced in respect of the most serious of the offences to an extended sentence . This extended sentence comprised a custodial term of DATE and an extension period of DATE . Lesser sentences were imposed for the other offences . The sentencing judge gave the applicant credit for his early guilty pleas , his previous absence of any criminal convictions , his genuine remorse and his disgust at his own behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was issued with a notice by the prison at which he was detained stating that he would be subjected to the sex offender notification requirements for a period of DATE . However , the notice warned that it was \u201c not a complete statement of the law . \u201d It went on to add : \u201c It is suggested that you confirm this with the police when you make your notification on release from imprisonment . It is your responsibility to check this if you are not certain . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The Chief Constable of GPE subsequently notified the applicant by letter of CARDINAL DATE that he would be subjected to the notification requirements indefinitely . The Chief Constable reasoned that the applicant had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE since the extended sentence was CARDINAL of fiftyfour DATE ( the custodial term of DATE plus the extension period of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disagreed with the Chief Constable \u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions . He considered that , when calculating the term of imprisonment , only the custodial term should have been counted and , given that this was DATE , the notification period should only have been DATE . Accordingly , in DATE he sought judicial review of the Chief Constable \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the judicial review proceedings , the applicant also submitted that the legal framework in respect of the notification requirement lacked the degree of clarity and certainty required to be \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d within the meaning of LAW ; and that the Chief Constable \u2019s interpretation of the relevant legislation constituted a disproportionate interference with his right to respect for his private life under that Article . He further submitted that there had been a breach of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW because , after he had been sentenced , the sentencing regime had changed so that for persons sentenced after DATE an extended sentence was no longer available unless they either had a previous conviction for a serious offence or the custodial term was DATE imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a consequence , someone in his position sentenced under the new sentencing regime would not receive the extended sentence he received .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of his LAW argument , the applicant relied on PERSON v. GPE , no . MONEY , DATE , in which the ORG had accepted that the different treatment of different categories of prisoners depending on the sentences imposed on them was based on \u201c other status \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . Having reviewed both the domestic legislation and caselaw , it considered \u201c it plain that the entirety of the extended sentence is a sentence of imprisonment \u2018 in respect of the offence\u2019 for which it is imposed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , in respect of LAW , the court held that the legal framework was sufficiently certain to satisfy the \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d requirement . Furthermore , as the purpose of the extension period was to manage and reduce the risk posed by an offender it was proportionate for the extension period to be included in any calculation of the notification period . The legislature had been entitled to fix the threshold for indefinite notification at DATE . In doing so , it had struck a fair balance for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In respect of Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL , the court considered itself bound by the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in R ( PERSON ) v the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL , which had ruled that the treatment of prisoners based on differences in length of sentence did not constitute differential treatment on the ground of \u201c other status \u201d , even though in PERSON v. the GPE this ORG had subsequently reached the opposite conclusion . In any event , ORG found it \u201c difficult to see how changes in the legislative regime referred to , affecting those sentenced at different dates , could give rise to discrimination \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It upheld ORG finding that the prison term for the purpose of ascertaining the notification period was the aggregate term of the extended sentence . In this regard , it noted that \u201c ORG was , with respect , plainly right on the short ground that the statutory language permits no other sensible conclusion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In respect of LAW , the applicant had submitted that the imposition upon him of an indefinite notification requirement had been arbitrary and disproportionate . However , the court found that , given the purposes of the notification requirement and of extended sentences , there was nothing \u201c arbitrary \u201d or disproportionate in the imposition of an indefinite notification requirement in the applicant \u2019s case . Moreover , it would , in time , be possible for the applicant to seek review of the indefinite notification period ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL , the court observed that all that had happened was that ORG had altered its views as to the threshold for indefinite notification requirements . That did not generate retrospectively a good LAW argument . Furthermore , Laws LJ considered that ORG , like ORG , was bound by ORG judgment in R ( PERSON ) v the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused the applicant permission to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , when the applicant was sentenced , extended sentences were regulated by CARDINAL of ORG ) Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) which provided , as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL Sexual or violent offences : extension of certain custodial sentences for licence purposes .", "( CARDINAL ) This section applies where a court \u2014", "( a ) proposes to impose a custodial sentence for a sexual or violent offence committed on or after DATE ; and", "( b ) considers that the period ( if any ) for which the offender would , apart from this section , be subject to a licence would not be adequate for the purpose of preventing the commission by him of further offences and securing his rehabilitation .", "( CARDINAL ) Subject to subsections ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) below , the court may pass on the offender an extended sentence , that is to say , a custodial sentence the term of which is equal to the aggregate of \u2014", "( a ) the term of the custodial sentence that the court would have imposed if it had passed a custodial sentence otherwise than under this section ( \u201c the custodial term \u201d ) ; and", "( b ) a further period ( \u201c the extension period \u201d ) for which the offender is to be subject to a licence and which is of such length as the court considers necessary for the purpose mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) above .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The extension period shall not exceed \u2014.", "( a ) DATE in the case of a sexual offence ; and", "( b ) DATE in the case of a violent offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The term of an extended sentence passed in respect of an offence shall not exceed the maximum term permitted for that offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Justice Act DATE ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d ) subsequently enacted new provisions governing extended sentences for offences committed after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Before an extended sentence may be imposed under the new provisions the court must find that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences ( section CARDINALA of the ORG DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Further requirements for the imposition of an extended sentence were added as of DATE . These additional requirements are that the offender must either :", "( i ) have a previous conviction for a serious offence ( as defined in Schedule CARDINALA to the ORG DATE ) ; or", "( ii ) have committed an offence or offences meriting a custodial term of DATE ( section CARDINALA of the ORG DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The notification requirements for those convicted of certain sexual offences are now contained in LAW DATE ( \u201c the ORG DATE \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL sets different notification periods . For a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE but DATE , the notification period is DATE . For a person sentenced to QUANTITY or more , the notification period is indefinite .", "CARDINAL . A person subject to the notification requirements is required to give the police his biographical information ( his name(s ) , date of birth , ORG number , his home address and any other address at which he regularly resides or stays ) as well as any changes to that information ( sections DATE ) and CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL provides for periodic notification of the information specified in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL requires notification of any travel arrangements outside GPE , including the date on which the offender will leave , the country ( or the first country ) to which he will travel and his point of arrival in that country , and any other information which the offender holds about his departure from or return to GPE or his movements while outside GPE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that , where a notification is given , the relevant offender must , if requested to do so by a police officer or authorised person , allow the officer or person to take his fingerprints and/or photograph any part of him .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL ) it is an offence to fail , without reasonable excuse , to comply with these requirements .", "CARDINAL . The applicants in R ( on the application of F ) and ORG had sought a declaration that in the absence of any mechanism for review , the indefinite notification period under LAW was incompatible with LAW . A ORG of ORG granted the declaration of incompatibility and ORG upheld that decision . The Secretary of ORG appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal . It accepted that the indefinite notification requirement under the SOA DATE was capable of causing significant interference with the right to respect for private and family life and , in the absence of any provision for individual review of the requirement , it constituted a disproportionate interference with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Following R ( F ) and ORG , the ORG DATE was amended so as to make provision for review of the indefinite notification requirement . In respect of GPE and GPE , the review provisions are set out in sections CARDINAL - F. Pursuant to these provisions , an offender over DATE can , after DATE , apply to the Chief Officer of Police for the area in which he resides for a determination that he or she should no longer be subject to the indefinite notification requirement ( section CARDINALB ) . The offender must satisfy the relevant Chief Officer of Police that indefinite notification is no longer necessary for the purpose of protecting the public or any particular members of the public from sexual harm ( section MONEY ) ) .
