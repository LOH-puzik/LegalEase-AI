The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s son , PERSON , born on CARDINAL DATE and then DATE , was playing with other children outside the applicant \u2019s apartment , situated in GPE district ( Naujamies\u010dio seni\u016bnija ) in the city of GPE . Whilst the children were standing on the balcony of an ancillary building containing cellars , the balcony broke off the building and collapsed . Part of the balcony fell on ORG , who died at the scene from the injuries he received . CARDINAL other children , GPE and PERSON , suffered minor bodily injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police opened a pre - trial investigation . On DATE and the next investigators surveyed the scene of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic expert established that ORG had died because the balcony block had fallen on to him , broken his spine and crushed his internal organs .", "CARDINAL . By GPE city police investigator \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was recognised as having victim status .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , after the accident the future of the ancillary building containing the cellars was discussed at a meeting of the GPE municipal council on DATE . An expert inspection of DATE recommended that the building be fenced off until it could be demolished . [ The GPE city municipality ] Commission on Residential and Non - Residential Houses and Premises on DATE approved the demolition of the building . In accordance with a contract signed on DATE between the GPE city council and Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , the GPE municipal enterprise , in DATE that enterprise demolished the building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged , in the criminal proceedings , a civil claim for non - pecuniary damage , in the sum of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL ) , and for litigation costs with ORG . She submitted that the GPE city municipality and its institutions had failed to supervise the buildings and , as a result , her son had died . The loss caused her immense moral suffering and depression . Even though it was not possible to bring her son back , the persons responsible should compensate the non - pecuniary damage . The applicant also referred to LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , arguing that the amount of damage could be assessed according to all the circumstances established in the criminal case and the [ criminal ] court had such competence .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the prosecutor recognised the applicant as a civil claimant in the criminal case , on the basis of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , an employee of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , was charged with the offence of failure to fulfil official duties , under LAW . The authorities considered that PERSON had failed to inspect the buildings at issue and to inform the municipality of their condition , even though he had been assigned that function by order of the Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas director on DATE . On DATE the authorities imposed a restrictive measure on PERSON , namely an obligation not to leave his place of residence .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG discontinued the pre - trial investigation . The prosecutor referred to LAW which determined that in the most general sense supervision of the use of construction works was the municipality \u2019s responsibility . Similarly , LAW set out the municipality \u2019s duty to supervise the use of residential houses and other constructions . The prosecutor analysed in detail whose responsibility it had been , and when , in respect of GPE city municipality and Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , to supervise the buildings , given that there had been changes in the bodies DATE . She noted that in DATE the city had made some enquiries of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas about the cellars , but there was no - one in the municipality who had the responsibility of supervising the activities of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas . However , the prosecutor considered that the evidence gathered was contradictory , and that therefore it was not possible to establish which body \u2013 the GPE city municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas DATE had been responsible for the proper maintenance of the building , the collapse of which had resulted in the death of the applicant \u2019s son . Therefore the prosecutor could not identify any physical person who could be held accountable for failure to act and to ensure that the building was in good condition and not dangerous . The prosecutor thus dropped the criminal charges in respect of PERSON Moreover , under LAW a corporate person could not be held criminally liable . However , the prosecutor noted that , in accordance with LAW , the applicant and the parents of the CARDINAL injured children could lodge civil proceedings against GPE city municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , and claim that the building had been left unattended .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the above decision , arguing that the GPE city municipality and Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas had been aware for a long time that the building was in a dangerous state ( avarin\u0117s b\u016bkl\u0117s ) , but no one had known what to do with it . The father of PERSON also appealed , submitting that the investigation had been going on for a long time , but no person had been found responsible for the building and thus for the accident .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor reopened the investigation . She noted that it was imperative to take measures to identify the person or persons whose responsibility it had been to take care of the building \u2019s maintenance and to establish why they had not done so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another prosecutor at ORG decided to discontinue the pre - trial investigation . The prosecutor found that the evidence as regards which body owned the collapsed building was contradictory . However , he considered that the GPE city municipality was the de facto owner of the building . On the basis of documents dated DATE and DATE , the prosecutor also concluded that the municipality had known earlier about the poor condition of the building where the accident had happened . Nonetheless , in DATE an administrative reform had taken place within the GPE city municipality , as a result of which new administrative units had been created , the responsibilities of those units redistributed and new people assigned to those administrative units . Consequently , at the time of the incident there was no one who had the duty to manage derelict and unused buildings . There was therefore insufficient evidence to find that a crime under LAW had been committed .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also suggested that the applicant lodge a civil claim on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a higher prosecutor upheld that decision . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC found that the pre - trial investigation had not been sufficiently thorough and effective . As a result , the identity of the owner of the derelict buildings had not been established . The court drew the prosecutor \u2019s attention to specific actions to be taken and specific circumstances to be examined , whilst noting the applicant \u2019s earlier requests to the prosecutor to the same effect . Having given the prosecutor precise instructions , including to obtain archived documents from DATE , the district court emphasised that without that specific information it was not possible to establish the identity of persons who had failed to adopt a timely final decision , in accordance with their official duties , about the future of the derelict buildings and their proper maintenance . The prosecutor \u2019s decision was quashed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant wrote to the Attorney General , arguing that the pre - trial investigation had been superficial and that the prosecutors at ORG had been passive and unwilling to discover the truth , thus stalling the investigation . For the applicant , the investigation in essence consisted of sending written questions and answers from CARDINAL municipal institution to another . It was clear that neither of the institutions , GPE city municipality or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , was willing to take responsibility for failing to perform its duties . The applicant thus asked the Attorney General to take over the investigation or to transfer it to ORG . She also observed that although DATE had passed since the court decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prosecutors had still not taken all the required investigative actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG again discontinued the pre - trial investigation , in essence upholding the conclusions of the decision of DATE to the effect that the evidence as to which body was in possession of the building at issue was contradictory . Accordingly , it was not possible to identify the physical person whose duty it was to maintain the building , and who was therefore liable for the death of CARDINAL child and injury of CARDINAL others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , arguing that even though DATE had passed since the accident , the prosecutors had not been active enough and had therefore failed to establish who was responsible for the maintenance of the building . The applicant argued in addition that the prosecutors had also failed to take all the steps which had been ordered by the court on CARDINAL DATE . The correspondence between GPE city municipality and Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas showed that both bodies had known the building was derelict , and yet no effort had been made to repair or demolish it . Immediately after the incident the building had been fenced off and demolished by the municipality , even though the municipality had earlier denied that it was within its control and had argued that it did not have the legal authority to tear down the building . The applicant asked for the pre - trial investigation to be reopened .", "CARDINAL . By a higher prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE , the investigation was reopened . For the prosecutor , it was possible that the employees of the GPE city municipality or those of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas had not performed their duties that stemmed from [ Article CARDINAL of ] LAW , LAW and other relevant legal acts . It was therefore indispensable to establish which particular person had been designated by the municipality to inspect / supervise the buildings without owners in question ( kam pavesta be\u0161eimininki\u0173 pastat\u0173 prie\u017ei\u016bra ) in LOC . If such functions had not been assigned to any particular unit or person at the municipal or district level , the prosecutor should consider whether the municipality \u2019s or district \u2019s managers ( vadovai ) should be held responsible under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , a senior specialist in LOC , was charged with failure to carry out official duties , under Article CARDINAL of LAW . By a decision of the LOC director ( seni\u016bno ) on DATE GPE had been given the responsibility of monitoring empty buildings belonging to the municipality . The criminal investigator considered that GPE had failed to inform the municipality about the danger posed by the derelict cellars in question , as he should have done under LAW [ \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ] of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor for the Vilnius City District discontinued the investigation , as no physical persons criminally liable for the accident could be identified . The prosecutor noted , however , that the GPE city municipality had learned on DATE of the poor state of the building the collapse of which had caused the death of the applicant \u2019s son . However , at that time the municipality was going through structural changes and the duties and responsibilities of the municipality \u2019s employees were being redistributed , therefore there was no particular person with the specific duty to take action on derelict and abandoned buildings . Moreover , taking into account the short period of time that had elapsed between that date and the accident ( DATE ) , it was not possible to conclude that the municipality \u2019s employees had been stalling the process of finding a solution to the question of what had to be done with the building . The evidence collected in the case did not prove that employees of the GPE city municipality , the LOC district or Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas had failed to carry out any of their clearly prescribed duties and had thus caused the death of one child and injuries to CARDINAL others . The prosecutor therefore dismissed the criminal charges against PERSON , an employee of Naujamies\u010dio b\u016bstas , and against GPE , a LOC specialist . The prosecutor suggested that the applicant and the parents of the CARDINAL children who had been injured in the accident bring separate civil proceedings under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the case should be returned for a fresh pre - trial examination , so that the ownership of the buildings could be established and the persons ( physical and corporate ) liable for the accident thus identified .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE the GPE City ORG refused to reopen the pre - trial investigation , because a criminal action under LAW had become time - barred . The pre - trial investigation had been opened on DATE and LAW provided a DATE term to prosecute a crime of a negligent or minor premeditated nature . The court therefore did not address the applicant \u2019s complaint that the pre - trial investigation had been flawed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , questioning the effectiveness of the investigation and asking for it to be reopened .", "CARDINAL . By a final ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision to discontinue criminal proceedings under the statute of limitations .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a person \u2019s right to life shall be protected by law .", "CARDINAL . The Law on Local Self - Government provides that CARDINAL of the functions of a municipality is to supervise how buildings are used and to manage land and other property which belong to it by the right of ownership ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
