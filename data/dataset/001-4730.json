He is represented before the ORG by Mr R. ORG , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the manager of a factory , ORG , received a telephone call from an individual who said that he was speaking on behalf of ORG , an illegal organisation . The manager was instructed to pay a substantial amount of money under threat . The manager informed the police and a surveillance operation was mounted .", "The police provided the factory manager with green paper towels to be used to simulate bank notes . In accordance with the blackmailer 's instructions , the factory manager went to a shop to obtain a white plastic bag in which to put the money . He purchased a packet of cream cracker biscuits to provide a reason for obtaining the bag . He then went to the location specified by the blackmailer and deposited the white plastic bag containing the paper towels and the packet of biscuits in the place agreed .", "The applicant was seen by a police officer working for the surveillance team approaching the area where the plastic bag had been placed . He was next seen with a white plastic bag containing something that appeared to be green . He was then seen TIME without the plastic bag .", "At TIME on DATE the applicant was arrested pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Following the applicant 's arrest a search of the area was carried out in the course of which the box of biscuits was recovered . On subsequent examination of the box , a print of the applicant 's left thumb was found on the box .", "The applicant was taken to ORG , GPE , where over a period of DATE , from DATE until DATE , he was interviewed on CARDINAL separate occasions . It would appear that all CARDINAL interviews were conducted whilst the applicant was under caution pursuant to LAW Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "On his arrival at ORG , at TIME on DATE , the applicant indicated that he wished to see a solicitor as soon as practical . The police , pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , deferred access to the solicitor nominated by the applicant ( PERSON ) until TIME on DATE . On DATE the applicant consulted with his solicitor from CARDINAL p.m. to CARDINAL p.m. He had further consultations with his solicitor on DATE from CARDINAL TIME , on DATE from TIME , and on DATE from TIME to TIME", "The applicant was interviewed on CARDINAL occasions in the period from his arrest to the end of Interview no . CARDINAL at TIME on DATE . Throughout these interviews the applicant denied being involved in any blackmail attempt and refuted the suggestion that he had been in the places in which he had been seen by the police surveillance team .", "At Interview no . DATE , which began at TIME on DATE , the police confronted the applicant with evidence that his left thumbprint had been found on the box of biscuits recovered from the scene . When asked for an explanation as to how , in the light of his denials , his thumbprint could have been found on the packet , the applicant replied : \u201c I did n't lift them , they were thrown at me \u201d .", "The interview ended at TIME on DATE . The interviewing officers recorded in their notes at the conclusion of the interview :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] appeared to want to tell the truth but was indecisive about how to approach the matter ... [ T]he interview laboured between [ the applicant ] wanting to talk to us but hesitating to do so . \u201d", "At TIME on DATE the applicant requested facilities to consult with his solicitor , PERSON . At TIME an attempt was made to contact PERSON . Mr PERSON was not at his office . It was noted in the Occurrence Book for ORG : \u201c PERSON office contacted TIME . PERSON to ring back later \u201d .", "No time having been given for PERSON visit , Detective PERSON , pursuant to non - statutory guidelines issued by the Secretary of ORG relating to the questioning of terrorist suspects , authorised the interview to commence without the applicant first having had an opportunity to consult with his solicitor .", "Interview no . CARDINAL commenced at TIME on DATE . In the course of this interview the applicant admitted to the blackmail offence and started to confess to his involvement in various acts of terrorism , including murder and membership of ORG . The applicant went on to make further confessions during DATE interviews which commenced at TIME and TIME respectively on DATE .", "At TIME on DATE , Mr H. , a solicitor employed by PERSON firm , contacted ORG and arranged a consultation with the applicant for TIME In the interim a further interview , DATE , was conducted in the course of which the applicant made further admissions . The applicant consulted with PERSON from TIME until TIME The applicant informed police officers at Interview no . DATE that his solicitor had told him \u201c not to make statements \u201d .", "At the CARDINALth interview , which was conducted on DATE from TIME until TIME , the applicant made further admissions of his involvement in various terrorist offences . DATE interviews were conducted in the course of DATE , on DATE . During these final CARDINAL interviews the applicant made further admissions .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted before a single judge sitting without a jury at ORG on CARDINAL counts alleging various offences of terrorism including murder , blackmail , possession of firearms and membership of ORG . The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment . The confession evidence obtained in the course of the police interviews sustained the charges against the applicant .", "The applicant , who did not dispute that the evidence before the court accurately recorded admissions which he made in the course of being interviewed , submitted through his counsel on the voir dire to determine the admissibility of the confession evidence that the evidence should be excluded under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , on the grounds that it had been obtained by violence and threats of violence ; alternatively under section ORG the CARDINAL Act , in order to avoid unfairness to the applicant or as otherwise being in the interests of justice .", "It was submitted on behalf of the applicant by his counsel that the confession evidence had been obtained in circumstances where :", "( CARDINAL ) NORP threats had been made by the police that they would arrest and harass members of his family and put out the word that the applicant was a \u201c tout \u201d if he did not confess , together with express or implied promises that the police would help him if he confessed . The applicant further stated that in the course of being interviewed the police had fed him details of the various offences to which he subsequently admitted ;", "( CARDINAL ) he was suffering from ill - health and confusion which manifested itself , inter alia , in a severe loss of weight , namely QUANTITY ; and", "( CARDINAL ) there were breaches by the police of their duty to permit the applicant to consult with a solicitor .", "The interviewing officers as well as the applicant gave evidence in the voir dire and were cross - examined on their evidence . The interviewing officers denied that they had threatened the applicant or fed him with information in earlier interviews about the crimes to which he later confessed . They testified that they had confined their questions during the first CARDINAL interviews to the blackmail offence .", "In respect of ( CARDINAL ) , the trial judge rejected the applicant 's evidence that he had been threatened , or that he had been given promises and inducements to persuade him to confess , or that he had been fed information of crimes which he had then repeated to the police . The trial judge ruled that he was :", "\u201c ... satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ... that [ the applicant 's ] evidence of threats made , and promises and inducements given to him , by the police , and the feeding of information to him about crimes other than the ... blackmail which he then repeated back to the police , are completely untrue . \u201d", "He gave as his reasons , inter alia , that the evidence of the interviewing officers was to be believed , that the applicant 's evidence and demeanour in the witness box showed him to be a completely untruthful witness , and that his version of events was \u201c a concoction \u201d . Further , the trial judge held that the fingerprint evidence was \u201c a very damaging piece of evidence \u201d and that it was that , rather than the alleged threats , which had caused the applicant to confess and \u201c make a clean breast of matters \u201d .", "In respect of ( CARDINAL ) , the trial judge found that whilst the applicant probably suffered some weight loss , it was not of the order of QUANTITY and that his weight had probably been inaccurately recorded when he first arrived . Furthermore , the trial judge accepted , in any event , the evidence of the various doctors , who had made routine examinations of the applicant during the period he was being interviewed , that the applicant was not in such a state of ill health or confusion such as to render him unfit to be interviewed .", "In respect of ( CARDINAL ) , the applicant 's counsel contended that the police had acted unfairly and in breach of LAW , and paragraph CARDINAL of the non - statutory guidelines issued by the Secretary of ORG , in authorising the continuation of interviewing on DATE without the applicant first having had an opportunity to consult with his solicitor . While admitting to having certain misgivings about Detective PERSON testimony , the trial judge found that that police officer had reasonable grounds for believing that waiting for the applicant 's solicitor to arrive , when no time had been specified for his visit , would cause unreasonable delay to the process of investigation . The trial judge found , accordingly , that in authorising the interviews to continue , Detective PERSON had not acted in breach of the guidelines .", "The judge further noted that even if Detective Superintendent C. had breached paragraph CARDINAL of the non - statutory guidelines in authorising interviews to continue on DATE , he would not have excluded the evidence obtained since he considered , with reference to the wording of section ORG ) of the CARDINAL Act , that \u201c it would not have been appropriate to do so in order to avoid unfairness to the accused or otherwise in the interests of justice \u201d . The trial judge gave as his reasons :", "\u201c In this case [ the applicant ] had had the benefit of CARDINAL consultations with his solicitor DATE . It is therefore clear that he had been fully advised as to his legal rights when being questioned by the police . It is also apparent from the interviews which took place DATE that [ the applicant ] was fully capable of declining to answer questions from the police and was fully capable of refusing to make admissions . It was common case that this was not the first time that [ the applicant ] had been interviewed whilst in police custody and it is clear that he was familiar with being interviewed by the police . Moreover the evidence which I heard on the voir dire satisfied me that nothing was said or done in the course of the interviews which was likely to make unreliable the confessions which were made by [ the applicant ] . A further important consideration is that I am satisfied that [ the applicant ] began to make confessions , not because of improper behaviour by the police in the course of the interviews , but because the police quite properly put to him a new and very damaging piece of evidence , which was that his fingerprint had been found on the packet of cream crackers . I am satisfied that this was the factor which caused him to begin to confess . Against those considerations and that background I do not consider that considerations of fairness to [ the applicant ] or other considerations in the interests of justice make it appropriate for the court to exclude his confessions in the exercise of its discretion . \u201d", "The trial judge 's overall conclusion in the light of all the evidence adduced at the voir dire was as follows :", "\u201c In this case [ the applicant ] confessed to crimes of the utmost gravity on behalf of a terrorist organisation ( including involvement in very brutal murders of a nature which have terrorised and horrified entire communities ) in circumstances where :", "( CARDINAL ) there was no impropriety by the police in the course of the interviews ;", "( CARDINAL ) there was nothing in the course of the interviews to give rise to a concern that the confessions were unreliable ;", "( CARDINAL ) the accused was caused to confess because the police quite properly put to him that they had received new and very damaging evidence against him , namely his fingerprint on the packet of cream crackers ; and", "( CARDINAL ) the accused had already consulted with his solicitor on DATE , CARDINALth and DATE and on the CARDINALth the police properly and promptly at TIME informed his solicitor that the accused wished to see him .", "I consider that having regard to these circumstances neither considerations of fairness to the accused nor the interests of justice operate to cause the court to exclude the confessions in exercise of its discretion on the ground that he did not consult with his solicitor on DATE before the interviews on DATE in which he made confessions . \u201d", "Following the voir dire the applicant declined in cross - examination to answer any questions as to whether the admissions which he had made of the various terrorist offences with which he was charged were true . The judge , in concluding that the confession evidence was true and reliable and that he could properly act on it in convicting the applicant , drew very strong inferences under LAW ) Order DATE from the applicant 's refusal to give any evidence that would raise as a possibility that his admissions of involvement in various terrorist offences were untrue .", "The applicant appealed against conviction . On appeal the applicant challenged , inter alia , the exercise by the trial judge of his discretion in not excluding the confession evidence . In doing so , the applicant relied on each of the CARDINAL grounds which had been raised before the trial judge . The applicant , through his counsel , disputed the trial judge 's findings of fact in respect of each of the first CARDINAL grounds . In respect of the third ground the applicant 's counsel submitted in addition that even if there had been no breach of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the non - statutory guidelines issued by the Secretary of ORG , the judge should have ruled that it was unfair to interview the applicant on DATE pending the arrival of his solicitor , as he had every reason to want , indeed need , a solicitor at that stage .", "Following a review of the transcript of the evidence before the trial judge , ORG , upheld the judge 's findings of fact in respect of DATE grounds . In respect of the third , ORG held that there had not been any breach of the rules covering the conduct of police interviews . As regards the applicant 's contention that it was unfair to continue to interview the applicant before he had had an opportunity to consult with his solicitor , ORG found :", "\u201c The reality in the present case was that the police were investigating a serious blackmail case , additional information or admissions might be forthcoming , [ the applicant ] had already had CARDINAL visits from his solicitor and had been accompanied by him at the identification parade when NORP had not picked him out , he had been interviewed before , he did not demur at the absence of his solicitor , he did not remain silent until he arrived instead he chose to reveal his part in a series of serious crimes which disclosed that he was an active terrorist assisting in the activities of a proscribed organisation \u2013 ORG . [ The applicant 's counsel ] submitted that his solicitor might have advised him to say nothing . That is so but equally he might have told his solicitor that he was going to confess \u2013 it is idle to speculate what might pass between a solicitor and his client . What we do know is that after he saw his solicitor he repeated his account of his criminal activities and went so far as to sign the notes . \u201d", "ORG accordingly held that the trial judge had properly exercised his discretion in not excluding the confession evidence , that this evidence sustained the charges upon which the applicant had been convicted , and , on DATE , confirmed the sentences which had been imposed .", "B.
