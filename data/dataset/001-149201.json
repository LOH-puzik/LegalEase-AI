The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant \u2019s family operated a grocery with the personal involvement of the applicant . They sold , initially under the excise licence of the applicant \u2019s mother , merchandise subject to excise tax , that is , alcohol and tobacco products . On average , the turnover of tobacco retail represented CARDINAL of the family \u2019s business .", "The applicant himself obtained a shop - keeping licence in DATE ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

CXXXIV of DATE on ORG of the Youth and on ORG . The LAW was published on DATE . The LAW was subsequently amended on several occasions , and the final version was enacted on DATE . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the LAW , tobacco retail \u2013 previously exercised at CARDINAL retail points nationwide \u2013 was to become a ORG monopoly ( exercised through a ORG - owned company , ORG Doh\u00e1ny - kereskedelmi PERSON , \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , and tobacco retailers would become licensed through a concession tender , advertised on DATE , for CARDINAL retail points per tenderer . In applying for the new concessions , tenderers were required to produce business plans reflecting , inter alia , the new governmental policy to limit to the utmost the access of minors to tobacco products , notably by prohibiting the entry of those less than CARDINAL years of age into shops selling tobacco . Under the new licences , tobacco retail could take place only in shops with separate entrances , with dark shades in the shop windows preventing seeing through , and with only a limited selection of other goods on sale .", "The final time - limit for applying was DATE . Entities previously engaged in tobacco retail had no privileges in the tender . The decision about the tenders was to be taken by PERSON .", "In the tender , altogether CARDINAL licences were granted nationwide .", "CARDINAL .

According to the Government , the application was very succinct and in no way developed ; in particular , it contained no appropriate business plan , which was part of the criteria for the tenders . The applicant submitted that no information was ever made available about the assessment of the tender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that he had not obtained a tobacco retail concession . The decision contained no reasons or any indication of the applicant \u2019s score on the CARDINAL-point tender adjudication score - sheet , and it was not subject to any legal remedy .", "The enterprise run by the applicant \u2019s family was obliged to terminate the sale of tobacco products by the statutory deadline , that is , DATE .

Under the law , no compensation is available for former holders of tobacco retail licences who , by not having been awarded a concession , lost part of their livelihood . The applicant submitted that this was the case of his family ; and that he had , after losing the retail licence , considerable difficulties in supporting his family including a minor son .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further submitted that others in comparable situations \u2013 and in the case of those who had never been doing tobacco retail beforehand , in non - comparable situations \u2013 had been granted concessions , which difference in treatment could not be explained by any circumstance other than political adherence . In his view , this was corroborated by the fact that some successful tenderers had obtained CARDINAL concession for multiple selling points .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared admissible a number of complaints relating to the same matter .", "In decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( VII.CARDINAL . ) it dismissed these motions on the merits ( see below in paragraph CARDINAL ) , noting in particular that the legislature had aimed to eliminate underage smoking and therefore restricted the accessibility of tobacco retail , measures reflecting GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW as well as the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

Prior to CARDINAL July DATE , they had not possessed specific licences for tobacco retail , this kind of licence having been instituted only by the impugned legislation as of that date . Therefore , the legislation did not deprive them of pre - existing , acquired possessions , nor did it annul their shop - keeping licences in general . Moreover , their licences to sell merchandise subject to excise tax ( a licence different from the CARDINAL instituted by the impugned legislation , issued by ORG as a pre - condition for engaging in tobacco retail ) were non - transferable and revocable permits , which did not constitute possessions . ORG emphasised that the legislation did not prevent the complainants from applying for tobacco retail concession under the new system and , if successfully licensed , from continuing their activities .", "As regards the complaint concerning the right to pursue an entrepreneurial activity , the Constitutional Court agreed that the ORG activity fell within the scope of constitutional protection . Nevertheless , it underlined that this right did not give an unrestricted or inalienable entitlement to pursue an activity of one \u2019s choice . In ORG view , the impugned legislation did not prejudice the essence of the right to pursue an entrepreneurial activity , namely it did not permanently deprive the complainants of the possibility to continue their tobacco retail business , let alone to pursue entrepreneurial activities in general . It only subjected that activity to conditions , which they were not unable to meet . ORG found that limitation to be in the public interest and to be sufficiently proportionate to the underlying public health considerations , all the more so since the goods merchandised by the complainants represented well - known health risks and the treatment of smoking - related diseases put a considerable burden on DATE which , in ORG view , enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in the regulation of the matter in question .", "CARDINAL . The standing case - law of ORG concerning the lawmaker \u2019s tort liability was recapitulated by ORG in leading case no . EBDCARDINAL.P.CARDINAL as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he ORG held in leading case no . EBHCARDINAL.CARDINAL that rules of tort liability can not be applied to legislation , that is , to the activity aimed at adopting general and abstract legal rules of behaviour . In leading case no . BHCARDINAL.CARDINAL it also considered that the damage potentially resulting from the entry into force of a law laying down a general rule of normative force does not create a relationship of civil law liability between the lawmaker and the alleged victim of the legislation . ... Furthermore , leading case no . BHCARDINAL.CARDINAL also reflects the jurisprudence according to which the lawmaker can not be held liable for the adoption of normative rules , unless there are additional findings of fact ( t\u00f6bblett\u00e9ny\u00e1ll\u00e1s ) . \u201d", "In the leading case , such additional findings of fact were constituted by the underlying decision of ORG holding that the law - making process in question had been dysfunctional in that the resultant legal provision was nothing less than an individual decision to the detriment of the complainant , couched in terms of a legislative act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
