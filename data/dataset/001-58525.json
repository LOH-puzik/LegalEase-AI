On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police . On DATE the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Prosecutor ( Prokurator Wojew\u00f3dzki ) charged him with fraud and detained him on remand on the grounds specified in LAW . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) , ruling on the applicant 's appeal , upheld the detention order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , at the prosecutor 's request , prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . The court based its ruling on the grounds originally given for his detention and the fact that the investigation had not been completed since further evidence needed to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on a further request by ORG , prolonged the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE . The court relied on the same grounds as those mentioned in its decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision prolonging his detention .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards , on an unspecified date , the investigation was completed . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG lodged a bill of indictment with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG referred the applicant 's appeal of DATE to ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) . On DATE ORG held that it \u201c was purposeless \u201d to examine this appeal and decided that it should be deemed to be an application for release . The court observed that a decision on the prolongation of detention on remand was necessary only at the investigation stage . Therefore , after the investigation was completed and the bill of indictment was lodged , the applicant could simply file an application for release at any time with the court competent to deal with his case , pursuant to LAW . As a consequence of that decision , the appeal was referred back to ORG . The applicant was informed thereof on DATE . However , in the subsequent proceedings , ORG did not examine the appeal in question either as an application for release under LAW or under any other head .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had filed a formal petition with ORG ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) . He informed the prosecutor that the order for his detention had expired on DATE , so that his continued detention had become unlawful and unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Later , on DATE , the applicant lodged an application for release with ORG , arguing , in particular , that he should be released in view of the bad state of his health . On DATE the court , sitting in camera , ordered that the authorities of the prison hospital at FAC submit a medical report on the applicant 's current state of health . It adjourned the examination of the application without fixing a date for a further session .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant repeatedly complained to the authorities that his detention under the bill of indictment had become unlawful since , on DATE , in reply to those complaints , PERSON , the President of ORG of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court , sent a letter to the applicant , the relevant part of which read as follows :", "\u201c The ORG hereby informs the accused that , since the bill of indictment was submitted to ORG , ORG placed the detainee at the disposal of that court . ... From then on , the accused has been at FAC disposal [ and will be ] until the detention order is quashed ( at the [ applicant 's ] or his lawyer 's request , or [ at the request of ] ORG administration \u2013 for instance on the ground of his bad state of health ) .", "In case an application for release is not allowed , detention may continue until the first - instance judgment is delivered .", "In such cases , after the delivery of the judgment , the court makes a decision on whether detention shall continue further . Therefore , the accused 's assertion that his detention [ order ] has expired is unjustified ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE doctors from the prison hospital submitted the report requested by the trial court . They stated that the applicant could undergo medical treatment in that hospital . They suggested , however , that he be examined by a cardiologist , a psychiatrist and a neurologist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court again adjourned the examination of the application for release , finding that reports from the said medical experts had to be obtained to establish whether the applicant should be released on health grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another application for release with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert cardiologist submitted a report to the court . On DATE the court found it necessary to place the applicant in the prison hospital but adjourned its decision on his applications for release until the expert psychiatrist and neurologist had submitted their joint report . The report was ready on DATE ; however , on DATE , the court , at the request of ORG , again adjourned the examination of the applications and ordered that certain \u2013 unspecified \u2013 evidence concerning the state of the applicant 's health be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ruled on the applications for release dated DATE and DATE respectively . It held that no circumstances justified altering the preventive measure in issue . The decision was based on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . On DATE ORG , ruling on the applicant 's appeal , upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , since DATE , the applicant had been requesting ORG to give an interpretation of the detention order of DATE , in particular as to whether or not that order had remained enforceable after its expiry . He lodged these requests under LAW on the following dates : CARDINAL and DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE . The applicant argued that the fact that the indictment had been lodged with the court did not mean that his detention automatically continued after DATE . He further submitted that no provision of LAW provided that detention was prolonged as a result of the transfer of the case to the court . He asserted that the order of DATE was not enforceable as he had lodged an appeal against it . The applicant concluded that he should have been released immediately after DATE because his detention as from that date lacked any legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sitting with a single judge rendered a decision on all the above requests . The court held that the decision of DATE to prolong the applicant 's detention until CARDINAL DATE was enforceable , despite the fact that the applicant had lodged an appeal against it . The judge further reiterated the arguments set out in the letter to the applicant of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He submitted that the court should have been composed of CARDINAL judges in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW . He again argued that there was no legal basis for keeping him in detention after DATE . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG quashed the contested decision . The court found that the firstinstance court should have been composed of CARDINAL judges , as submitted by the applicant . However , it also held that LAW was not applicable in the applicant 's case since that provision applied only to cases involving doubts concerning the execution of the sentence or the calculation of the penalty imposed and not to the execution of detention orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . On DATE the President of ORG of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Court issued an order refusing to allow the applicant 's appeal on the basis that it was inadmissible in law . The applicant filed a further appeal against that decision . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE , considering that it had been open to the applicant to file an appeal against the decision of DATE , but that any further appeal was inadmissible in law since LAW did not apply to a detainee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the detention order and released the applicant under police supervision . The criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending in the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the domestic provisions governing detention on remand were contained in LAW of DATE , which is no longer in force as it was repealed and replaced by LAW DATE ( currently referred to as the \u201c GPE Procedure \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE listed detention among the so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( those measures including , inter alia , detention on remand , bail and police supervision ) . Until DATE ( that is , the date on which the PERSON of DATE on LAW to LAW and Other Criminal Statutes came into force ) a prosecutor was empowered to order all preventive measures as long as the investigation lasted . Also , at the time the national law did not set out any statutory timelimits concerning the length of detention on remand in court proceedings ; however , under LAW a prosecutor was obliged to determine in his decision the period for which detention was ordered .", "That Article stated ( in the version applicable at the material time ) :", "\u201c Preventive measures shall be ordered by the court ; before a bill of indictment has been lodged with the competent court , those measures shall be ordered by the prosecutor . \u201d", "The relevant part of LAW ( in the version applicable at the material time ) stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The prosecutor may order detention on remand for a period not exceeding DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) the court competent to deal with the case , at the prosecutor 's request , for a period not exceeding one year ;", "( CARDINAL ) ORG , at the request of ORG , for such further fixed term as is required to terminate the investigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The courts , when ruling on a prosecutor 's request under LAW of the LAW , were obliged to determine the precise period for which detention should be prolonged . If they refused to prolong detention or if the prosecutor failed to submit a request for a further prolongation before or on the expiry of the last detention order ( regardless of whether it had been made by him or by a court ) , the detainee had to be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provided :", "\u201c A preventive measure ( including detention on remand ) shall be immediately quashed or altered if the basis therefor has ceased to exist or new circumstances have arisen which justify quashing or replacing a given measure with a more or less severe one . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ( in the version applicable at the material time ) provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand may be imposed if :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the due course of proceedings by any other unlawful means ;", "...", "( CARDINAL ) an accused has been charged with an offence which creates a serious danger to society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time there was no specific provision governing detention on remand after the bill of indictment had been lodged with the competent court . Since DATE , the date of entry into force of the Law of DATE on LAW to LAW and Other Criminal Statutes and under the present criminal legislation , the courts have been and are bound by the maximum statutory time - limits for which detention on remand can be imposed during the entire course of the proceedings . In particular , at the material time , there was no provision stating that the lodging of a bill of indictment automatically prolonged or replaced a previous detention order , or that this event itself resulted in detention which had originally been prolonged by a court for a fixed period at the investigation stage being continued either for an unlimited period or until a judgment at first instance was given . Nor was there any case - law to that effect . Nevertheless , according to domestic practice , once a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to deal with the case , detention was assumed to be prolonged pending trial without any further judicial decision being given .", "CARDINAL . It was as late as DATE that ORG , referring to the historical background to the amended criminal legislation , mentioned the practice of keeping an accused in detention under the bill of indictment . It did so in a ruling on the interpretation of LAW . That ruling did not , however , concern criminal legislation as it stood at the material time but related to the LAW as amended with effect from DATE , when LAW as amended ) set out maximum time - limits for detention on remand not only at the investigation stage but at the whole pre - trial stage . In its resolution ( no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG replied DATE in the affirmative \u2013 to the question whether , after the lodging of a bill of indictment with the court competent to deal with the case , that court was obliged to give a decision prolonging detention on remand which had meanwhile exceeded the period fixed ( or further prolonged ) at the investigation stage . The relevant parts of the resolution read as follows :", "\u201c Under the provisions of LAW which applied before [ CARDINAL DATE , when ] the amendment of DATE took effect , an obligation to determine the period of detention imposed by a prosecutor at the investigation stage was laid down in LAW . However , it did not emerge explicitly from Article QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW that , at the investigation stage , a prosecutor or the court competent to deal with the case had each time to determine the point until which detention should last . It was deemed to be obvious that , when prolonging detention at the investigation stage , both the prosecutor and the court competent to deal with the case had to determine the time until which detention was to last under a given decision . It was therefore assumed that the obligation to determine the period of detention arose if a decision on that matter was given before the expiry of the maximum statutory terms applicable at a given stage of the proceedings .", "Comparing the old legislation with the present one leads [ this ORG ] to the conclusion that the legislator , when amending the LAW in DATE , simply extended [ the scope of ] the rules applicable to continuing and prolonging detention on remand DATE which had previously applied only at the investigation stage DATE to the phase of court proceedings .", "Before the amendment , the legislation was based on the precept that a suspect should not be detained indefinitely as long as his case was not being dealt with by an independent court . Now , the starting - point is that a suspect ( and an accused ) should not be detained indefinitely as long as a first - instance judgment is not rendered .", "Under the previous legislation there was no need to determine the period of detention after a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court because at this point proceedings reached the phase in which there was no statutory time - limit [ on this measure ] . For this reason , the court concerned had no interest in [ knowing ] until when detention had been prolonged under the last decision [ ; ] detention could continue because ' detention of limited duration ' had become ' detention of unlimited duration ' . There was therefore only a need to ascertain whether there were grounds for continuing detention under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its further resolution ( no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE , ORG confirmed that :", "\u201c If the case , in which detention on remand had been ordered , has been referred to a court with a bill of indictment and the period of detention which had previously been fixed expires , the court has a duty to consider whether detention needs to be continued and to give an appropriate decision on this matter . \u201d", "Referring to the resolution of DATE , it also stressed that :", "\u201c ... the ratio legis of the amendments to criminal legislation is based on the precept that a suspect ( accused ) should in no case be detained indefinitely until the first - instance judgment is rendered in his case ...", "It should be noted that , from the point of view of procedural safeguards for an accused , what is material is not how long his detention at the investigation stage has lasted and how long it has lasted at the stage of the court proceedings , but the total period of his detention and whether his detention and its length are subject to review . If there is such a review at the investigation stage ( LAW and CARDINAL ) , there is no reason why there should not be one at the stage of the court proceedings ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , referring to the formal requirements for a bill of indictment , stipulated that it should contain the first name and surname of the accused and information as to whether a preventive measure had been imposed on him , a statement of the offence with which he had been charged , a detailed description of the facts of the case along with a statement of reasons for the charges , an indication of the court competent to deal with the case and evidence on which the charges were based .", "CARDINAL . Once the bill of indictment had been lodged with the court , the president of the court carried out preparations for the main trial .", "LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The president of the court , ex officio or at the request of a party , shall refer the case to a court session if he finds that its resolution lies beyond his own competence , in particular :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) when there is a need to issue an order on a preventive measure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , at the material time , according to the relevant domestic practice in respect of detention continuing after the last detention order had expired and after a bill of indictment had been lodged with a court , the courts did not make use of the procedure prescribed by the above - mentioned provision as it was presumed that the detention continued solely due to the fact that a bill of indictment had been lodged and , therefore , there was no need to issue a separate decision prolonging the detention .", "CARDINAL . Also , at the time , the LAW set out CARDINAL different legal avenues whereby a detainee could challenge the lawfulness of his detention : an appeal to a court against a detention order made by a prosecutor ; proceedings in which courts examined requests for prolongation of detention submitted by a prosecutor ; and proceedings relating to a detainee 's application for release .", "CARDINAL . As regards the last of these , LAW ( in the version applicable at the material time ) stated :", "\u201c An accused may at any time apply to have a preventive measure quashed or altered .", "Such an application shall be decided by the prosecutor or , after the bill of indictment has been lodged , by the court competent to deal with the case , within a period not exceeding DATE . \u201d", "No provision of the Code stipulated that exceeding the time - limit laid down in that Article would have any legal consequence .", "CARDINAL . The interpretation of enforceable decisions in criminal proceedings was at the relevant time governed by the provisions of LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of that Code provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Everyone whom the decision on interpretation referred to in paragraph CARDINAL concerns may appeal against such a decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , provisions of the Code referring to a \u201c convicted person \u201d applied by analogy to a \u201c detainee \u201d . However , in the light of domestic practice and legal theory , it was considered doubtful whether LAW applied to cases in which a person detained on remand challenged the lawfulness of his detention since such a challenge was normally examined in the proceedings prescribed by LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings relating to a request under LAW were designed to obtain an interpretation of an enforceable decision which had not been formulated with adequate precision .
