PERSON ( [ DATE ] Probate Reports CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON ruled that sex for that purpose is to be determined by the application of chromosomal , gonadal and genital tests where these are congruent and without regard to any surgical intervention . This use of biological criteria to determine sex was approved by ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG ) and given more general application , the court holding that a person born male had been correctly convicted under a statute penalising men who live on the earnings of prostitution , notwithstanding the fact that the accused had undergone gender reassignment therapy .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(b ) of LAW DATE , any marriage where the parties are not respectively male and female is void . The test applied as to the sex of the partners to a marriage is that laid down in the above - mentioned case of PERSON v. PERSON .

The sex of the child must be entered on the birth certificate . The criteria for determining the sex of a child at birth are not defined in the LAW . The practice of the Registrar is to use exclusively the biological criteria ( chromosomal , gonadal and genital ) as laid down by Mr Justice PERSON in the above - mentioned case of PERSON v.

The official position is that an amendment may only be made if the error occurred when the birth was registered . The fact that it may become evident later in a person 's life that his or her \u201c psychological \u201d sex is in conflict with the biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry at birth was a factual error . Only in cases where the apparent and genital sex of a child was wrongly identified , or where the biological criteria were not congruent , can a change in the initial entry be made . It is necessary for that purpose to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect . No error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex .", "CARDINAL . The Government point out that the use of a birth certificate for identification purposes is discouraged by ORG , and for DATE birth certificates have contained a warning that they are not evidence of the identity of the person presenting it .

Should a post - operative transsexual be asked by a prospective employer to disclose all their previous names , but fail to make full disclosure before entering into a contract of employment , an offence might be committed . Furthermore , should the employer discover the lack of full disclosure , there might also be a risk of dismissal or an action by the employer for damages .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , in the case of PERSON and ORG , ORG ( ECJ ) held that discrimination arising from gender reassignment constituted discrimination on grounds of sex and , accordingly , LAW of DATE on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion and working conditions , precluded dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to a gender reassignment . The ECJ held , rejecting the argument of ORG that the employer would also have dismissed PERSON if PERSON had previously been a woman and had undergone an operation to become a man , that :", "\u201c ... Where a person is dismissed on the ground that he or she intends to undergo or has undergone gender reassignment , he or she is treated unfavourably by comparison with persons of the sex to which he or she was deemed to belong before undergoing gender reassignment .", "To tolerate such discrimination would be tantamount , as regards such a person , to a failure to respect the dignity and freedom to which he or she is entitled and which the ORG has a duty to safeguard . \u201d ( paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL .

Detailed guidelines concerning the searching of transsexual prisoners were under consideration by which post - operative male to female transsexuals would be treated as women for the purposes of searches and searched only by women ( see paragraphs PERCENT ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG for ORG announced the establishment of an ORG on Transsexual People with the following terms of reference :", "\u201c to consider , with particular reference to birth certificates , the need for appropriate legal measures to address the problems experienced by transsexuals , having due regard to scientific and societal developments , and measures undertaken in other countries to deal with this issue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG produced a report in DATE in which it examined the current position of transsexuals in GPE , with particular reference to their status under national law and the changes which might be made . It concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Transsexual people deal with their condition in different ways . Some live in the opposite sex without any treatment to acquire its physical attributes . Others take hormones so as to obtain some of the secondary characteristics of their chosen sex . A smaller number will undergo surgical procedures to make their bodies resemble , so far as possible , those of their acquired gender . The extent of treatment may be determined by individual choice , or by other factors such as health or financial resources . Many people revert to their biological sex after living for some time in the opposite sex , and some alternate between the CARDINAL sexes throughout their lives . Consideration of the way forward must therefore take into account the needs of people at these different stages of change .", "CARDINAL . Measures have already been taken in a number of areas to assist transsexual people . For example , discrimination in employment against people on the basis of their transsexuality has been prohibited by ORG Regulations DATE which , with few exceptions , provide that a transsexual person ( whether pre- or post - operative ) should not be treated less favourably because they are transsexual . The criminal justice system ( i.e. the police , prisons , courts , etc . ) try to accommodate the needs of transsexual people so far as is possible within operational constraints . A transsexual offender will normally be charged in their acquired gender , and a post - operative prisoner will usually be sent to a prison appropriate to their new status . Transsexual victims and witnesses will , in most circumstances , similarly be treated as belonging to their acquired gender .", "CARDINAL . In addition , official documents will often be issued in the acquired gender where the issue is identifying the individual rather than legal status . Thus , a transsexual person may obtain a passport , driving licence , medical card etc , in their new gender . We understand that many non - governmental bodies , such as examination authorities , will often re - issue examination certificates etc . ( or otherwise provide evidence of qualifications ) showing the required gender . We also found that CARDINAL insurance company will issue policies to transsexual people in their acquired gender .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding such provisions , transsexual people are conscious of certain problems which do not have to be faced by the majority of the population . Submissions to the ORG suggested that the principal areas where the transsexual community is seeking change are birth certificates , the right to marry and full recognition of their new gender for all legal purposes .", "CARDINAL . We have identified CARDINAL options for the future ;", "\u2013 to leave the current situation unchanged ;", "\u2013 to issue birth certificates showing the new name and , possibly , the new gender ;", "\u2013 to grant full legal recognition of the new gender subject to certain criteria and procedures .", "We suggest that before taking a view on these options the Government may wish to put the issues out to public consultation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report was presented to ORG in DATE . Copies were placed in the libraries of both ORG and sent to CARDINAL recipients , including ORG members , ORG officials , Members of ORG , individuals and organisations . It was publicised by a ORG press notice and made available to members of the public through application to ORG in writing , E - mail , by telephone or ORG web site .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. PERSON , EWCA Civ CARDINAL [ CARDINAL ] , CARDINAL FCR CARDINAL , the appellant who had been classified at birth as a man had undergone gender re - assignment surgery and in DATE had gone through a form of marriage with a man who was aware of her background . She sought a declaration under LAW DATE that the marriage was valid . ORG held , by a majority , that the appellant 's marriage was invalid as the parties were not respectively male and female , which terms were to be determined by biological criteria as set out in the decision of PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] . Although it was noted that there was an increasing emphasis upon the impact of psychological factors on gender , there was no clear point at which such factors could be said to have effected a change of gender . A person correctly registered as male at birth , who had undergone gender reassignment surgery and was now living as a woman was biologically a male and therefore could not be defined as female for the purposes of marriage . It was for ORG , not for the courts , to decide at what point it would be appropriate to recognise that a person who had been assigned to CARDINAL sex at birth had changed gender for the purposes of marriage . Dame PERSON , President of ORG noted the warnings of ORG about continued lack of response to the situation of transsexuals and observed that largely as a result of these criticisms an interdepartmental working group had been set up , which had in DATE issued a careful and comprehensive review of the medical condition , current practice in other countries and the state of LANGUAGE law in relevant aspects of the life of an individual :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL . ] ... We inquired of PERSON on behalf of the Attorney - General , what steps were being taken by any government department , to take forward any of the recommendations of the ORG , or to prepare a consultation paper for public discussion .", "[ CARDINAL . ] To our dismay , we were informed that no steps whatsoever have been , or to the knowledge of PERSON , were intended to be , taken to carry this matter forward . It appears , therefore , that the commissioning and completion of the report is the sum of the activity on the problems identified both by the Home Secretary in his terms of reference , and by the conclusions of the members of the working group . That would seem to us to be a failure to recognise the increasing concerns and changing attitudes across western LOC which have been set out so clearly and strongly in judgments of Members of ORG at GPE , and which in our view need to be addressed by the GPE ...", "[ CARDINAL . ] We would add however , with the strictures of ORG well in mind , that there is no doubt that the profoundly unsatisfactory nature of the present position and the plight of transsexuals requires careful consideration . The recommendation of the interdepartmental working group for public consultation merits action by the government departments involved in these issues . The problems will not go away and may well come again before ORG sooner rather than later . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his dissenting judgment , Lord Justice PERSON considered that the foundations of the judgment in PERSON v. PERSON were no longer secure , taking the view that an approach restricted to biological criteria was no longer permissible in the light of scientific , medical and social change .", "\u201c [ CARDINAL . ] To make the chromosomal factor conclusive , or even dominant , seems to me particularly questionable in the context of marriage . For it is an invisible feature of an individual , incapable of perception or registration other than by scientific test . It makes no contribution to the physiological or psychological self . Indeed in the context of the institution of marriage as it is DATE it seems to me right as a matter of principle and logic to give predominance to psychological factors just as it seem right to carry out the essential assessment of gender at or shortly before the time of marriage rather than at the time of birth ...", "[ CARDINAL . ] The present claim lies most evidently in the territory of the family justice system . That system must always be sufficiently flexible to accommodate social change . It must also be humane and swift to recognise the right to human dignity and to freedom of choice in the individual 's private life . CARDINAL of the objectives of statute law reform in this field must be to ensure that the law reacts to and reflects social change . That must also be an objective of the judges in this field in the construction of existing statutory provisions . I am strongly of the opinion that there are not sufficiently compelling reasons , having regard to the interests of others affected or , more relevantly , the interests of society as a whole , to deny this appellant legal recognition of her marriage . I would have allowed this appeal . \u201d", "He also noted the lack of progress in domestic reforms :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL . ] ... although the [ interdepartmental ] report has been made available by publication , PERSON said that there has since been no public consultation . Furthermore when asked whether the ORG had any present intention of initiating public consultation or any other process in preparation for a parliamentary PERSON , PERSON said that he had no instructions . Nor did he have any instructions as to whether the ORG intended to legislate . My experience over DATE suggests how hard it is for any department to gain a slot for family law reform by primary legislation . These circumstances reinforce my view that it is not only open to the court but it is its duty to construe s CARDINAL(c ) either strictly , alternatively liberally as the evidence and the submissions in this case justify . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Government presented to ORG the document \u201c Civil Registration : Vital Change ( Birth , Marriage and Death Registration in DATE ) \u201d which set out plans for creating a central database of registration records which moves away from a traditional snapshot of life events towards the concept of a living record or single \u201c through life \u201d record :", "\u201c In time , updating the information in a birth record will mean that changes to a person 's names , and potentially , sex will be able to be recorded . \u201d ( para .

Currently , once a record has been created , the only corrections that can be made are where it can be shown that an error was made at the time of registration and that this can be established . Correcting even the simplest spelling error requires formal procedures and the examination of appropriate evidence . The final records contains the full original and corrected information which is shown on subsequently issued certificates . The Government recognises that this can act as a disincentive . In future , changes ( to reflect developments after the original record was made ) will be made and formally recorded . Documents issued from the records will contain only the information as amended , though all the information will be retained . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In its DATE study , it had found that over DATE there had been an unmistakable trend in the member ORG towards giving full legal recognition to gender re - assignment . In particular , it noted that out of CARDINAL countries analysed CARDINAL ( including GPE ) did not permit a change to be made to a person 's birth certificate in CARDINAL form or another to reflect the re - assigned sex of that person . In cases where gender re - assignment was legal and publicly funded , only GPE and GPE did not give full legal recognition to the new gender identity .", "CARDINAL . In its follow up study submitted on DATE , ORG noted that while there had not been a statistical increase in GPE giving full legal recognition of gender re - assignment within LOC , information from outside LOC showed developments in this direction . For example , there had been statutory recognition of gender re - assignment in GPE , and a similar pattern of recognition in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and all except CARDINAL of GPE . It cited in particular the cases of Attorney - General v. Otahuhu Family Court [ DATE ] CARDINAL NZLR CARDINAL and PERSON [ DATE ] FamCA CARDINAL where in GPE and GPE transsexual persons ' assigned sex was recognised for the purposes of validating their marriages : In the latter case , Mr Justice PERSON held :", "\u201c I see no basis in legal principle or policy why NORP law should follow the decision in PERSON . To do so would , I think , create indefensible inconsistencies between NORP marriage law and other NORP laws . It would take the law in a direction that is generally contrary to development in other countries . It would perpetuate a view that flies in the face of current medical understanding and practice . Most of all , it would impose indefensible suffering on people who have already had more than their share of difficulty , with no benefit to society ...", "... Because the words ' man ' and ' woman ' have their ordinary contemporary meaning , there is no formulaic solution to determining the sex of an individual for the purpose of the law of marriage . That is , it can not be said as a matter of law that the question in a particular case will be determined by applying a single criterion , or limited list of criteria . Thus it is wrong to say that a person 's sex depends on any single factor , such as chromosomes or genital sex ; or some limited range of factors , such as the state of the person 's gonads , chromosomes or genitals ( whether at birth or at some other time ) . Similarly , it would be wrong in law to say that the question can be resolved by reference solely to the person 's psychological state , or by identifying the person 's ' brain sex ' .", "To determine a person 's sex for the law of marriage , all relevant matters need to be considered . I do not seek to state a complete list or suggest that any factors necessarily have more importance than others . However the relevant matters include , in my opinion , the person 's biological and physical characteristics at birth ( including gonads , genitals and chromosomes ) ; the person 's life experiences , including the sex in which he or she was brought up and the person 's attitude to it ; the person 's self - perception as a man or a woman ; the extent to which the person has functioned in society as a man or a woman ; any hormonal , surgical or other medical sex re - assignment treatments the person has undergone , and the consequences of such treatment ; and the person 's biological , psychological and physical characteristics at the time of the marriage ...", "For the purpose of ascertaining the validity of a marriage under NORP law the question whether a person is a man or a woman is to be determined as of the date of marriage ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
