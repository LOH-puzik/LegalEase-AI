NORP The applicant organisation , SIA AKKA / LAA ( ORG Autorties\u012bbu un komunic\u0113\u0161an\u0101s konsult\u0101ciju a\u0123ent\u016bra / Latvijas NORP apvien\u012bba \u201d \u2013Copyright and ORG ) is a non - profit organisation founded in GPE by a separate nonprofit organisation , ORG , whose members are various NORP artists .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the applicant organisation , acting as a representative of CARDINAL domestic and CARDINAL international authors who had entrusted the applicant organisation to manage the copyright of their musical works , was concluding licence agreements with several broadcasters in GPE . DATE , after the expiry of the previous licence agreements , the applicant organisation and certain broadcasting organisations in GPE could not reach an agreement on the terms of the future licence agreements , especially with regard to the remuneration to be paid for the broadcasting of music . As a result some broadcasting organisations continued to use the protected musical works without a written agreement , either without paying any remuneration or paying the amount the broadcasting organisations unilaterally considered equitable . In DATE the applicant organisation instituted civil proceedings against several broadcasters operating in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant organisation lodged a claim against a private radio station , ORG , and requested that ORG , acting as a first - instance court , recognise that by broadcasting protected musical works without a valid licence agreement DATE and DATE , the defendant had violated economic interests of the authors represented by the applicant organisation . The applicant organisation further asked that the court award compensation for unauthorised use of musical works . By relying on the ORG exclusive rights to control the use of their musical works , the applicant organisation asked the court to apply an injunction precluding the defendant from using the ORG works before a valid licence agreement between the parties had come into effect .", "CARDINAL . The defendant lodged a counterclaim arguing that the applicant organisation had abused its dominant position and had fixed an unreasonably high royalty rate , which was CARDINAL times the rate which had been applicable for DATE . They asked the court to order the applicant organisation to conclude a licence agreement with the defendant organisation and to lay down an equitable royalty rate .", "CARDINAL . During the first - instance court \u2019s hearing , the applicant organisation admitted that the parties had a dispute over the royalty rate in the draft licence agreement negotiated by the parties , but that the court was precluded under section CARDINAL of LAW from setting the rate as long as there was no licence agreement concluded between the parties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court partly upheld the claim and fully upheld the counterclaim . It established that DATE and DATE the defendant had infringed the ORG rights by broadcasting the protected works without authorisation , contrary to the provisions of LAW . The first - instance court ordered the defendant to pay to the applicant organisation compensation for the above period in the amount of CARDINAL NORP lats ( ORG , equivalent to CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) , which was PERCENT of the defendant \u2019s net turnover over this period .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the first - instance court ordered the applicant organisation to conclude a licence agreement with the defendant for DATE period with a royalty rate set at PERCENT of the defendant \u2019s DATE net turnover ( ikm\u0113ne\u0161a neto apgroz\u012bjums ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , by relying on the preamble of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and Articles DATE of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the first - instance court dismissed the applicant organisation \u2019s application to have an injunction granted to prohibit the defendant from broadcasting works of the rightsholders represented by the applicant organisation . By referring to the testimonies of CARDINAL authors represented by the applicant organisation , the first - instance court concluded that the authors themselves were interested in their musical works being publicly broadcasted . An interdiction on broadcasting of the musical works would infringe the ORG exclusive rights to have their work reproduced , as well as it would negatively affect the interests of the society to listen to music .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , acting as an appellate court , upheld the part of the first - instance judgment concerning the compensation for copyright infringement and the injunction .", "CARDINAL . On the issue of ordering the conclusion of a licence agreement , the appellate court observed that both parties had expressed their intention to enter into a such an agreement , as attested by a draft licence agreement of CARDINAL DATE in which the parties had agreed on certain terms and conditions such as the duration of the licence and the income from which royalties should be calculated . The appellate court noted that it was partly due to the applicant organisation \u2019s inconsistent negotiating that a licence agreement could not be concluded . The appellate court accordingly recognised that the licence agreement was to be considered concluded in the wording as agreed by the parties on DATE . On the question of remuneration , the appellate court established that in the negotiation process the applicant organisation had changed the royalty rate from PERCENT and then to PERCENT , whereas the defendant had insisted on PERCENT of the income from which royalties should be calculated . The appellate court took note of the characteristics of the defendant \u2019s activities and concluded that an equitable remuneration would be PERCENT of the income from which , as agreed by the parties , the royalties should be calculated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an appeal on points of law , the ORG of ORG upheld the appellate court \u2019s findings that after the expiry of the earlier licence agreement on DATE the de facto contractual relationship between the parties had continued mainly owing to the fact that the applicant organisation had failed to reach an agreement with the defendant on the terms of the licence agreement . The ORG of ORG further observed that the parties did not contest that the authors had a right to receive equitable remuneration , but that to that day the parties had not reached an agreement on the rate of the royalty payments . Given that there was no other authority responsible to decide on this matter , the ORG of ORG concluded that pursuant to LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW , it was within the court \u2019s competence to set the royalty rate . The ORG of ORG also dismissed the allegations that the appellate court \u2019s judgment had infringed the intellectual property rights protected under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In their claim against ORG , a state - owned limited liability company , the applicant organisation asked ORG , acting as a first - instance court , to find that by broadcasting the rightsholders\u2019 musical works without a valid licence agreement DATE and DATE , the defendant had violated economic interests of the authors represented by the applicant organisation . The applicant organisation further asked that the court award compensation for unauthorised use of musical works . By relying on the ORG exclusive rights to control the use of their musical works , the applicant organisation asked the court to apply an injunction precluding the defendant from using the ORG works before a valid licence agreement between the parties had come into effect .", "CARDINAL . By lodging a counterclaim the defendant in essence asked the court to recognise that in the disputed period the parties had a de facto contractual relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant organisation \u2019s claim and upheld the counterclaim . The court established that even though the licence agreement concluded between the parties with the royalty rate set at PERCENT of the defendant \u2019s DATE income had expired in DATE , the applicant organisation had continued receiving royalty payments from the defendant , which continued to pay at a lower rate . Given that the applicant organisation had not referred to objections to the broadcasting of the musical works , the existence of a de facto contractual relationship between the parties had been proven . Relying on section CARDINAL of the Copyright Law the court set the royalty rate from DATE at PERCENT of the defendant \u2019s DATE income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG , acting as an appellate court , diverted from the first - instance court \u2019s findings and recognised that the defendant had infringed copyright by broadcasting the musical works over a prolonged period of time without a valid written licence agreement . It awarded the applicant organisation compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , which exceeded the amount the defendant had paid under the expired licence agreement . It considered that it would be fruitless to issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from broadcasting the works . The appellate court observed that in principle the parties had expressed their interest in concluding a licence agreement but that before and during the court proceedings the parties had not agreed on the equitable royalty rate . It also pointed to the applicant organisation \u2019s responsibility in failing to reach an agreement in the negotiation of a new licence . As a result , over a prolonged period of time the ORG rights had been unprotected . As the parties had not asked the court to decide on the exact terms and conditions of a licence agreement , the appellate court decided to impose on the parties a general obligation to conclude a licence agreement by DATE . Given that the parties had been unable to agree on a royalty rate , the appellate court set the rate at PERCENT of the defendant \u2019s net turnover . In reaching this conclusion the appellate court took into consideration such elements as , inter alia , the royalty rate set in other court proceedings and the existing practice in certain other ORG member GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant organisation appealed on points of law arguing that by , inter alia , ordering the parties to conclude a licence agreement and setting its terms , the court had overstepped its powers and acted in breach of LAW of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partly upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment with similar reasoning as in the first set of proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"]}
