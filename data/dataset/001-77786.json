The first applicant , an NORP national born in DATE and living in GPE , is an editorial journalist at the newspaper \u201c FAC \u201d . The second applicant is the owner and publisher of this newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a group of homosexuals , the \u201c NORP Forum of NORP and NORP \u201d ( \u201c GPE Schwulen- PERSON \u201d , ORG ) held a demonstration in GPE P\u00f6lten , at which the editors of the magazine \u201c Der CARDINAL . \u2013 Zeitung der Katholiken f\u00fcr GPE und Kirche \u201d ( DATE Newspaper of NORP for ORG ) took pictures of participants and published them together with an article written by PERSON in its issue of CARDINAL DATE . That article reflected a negative and hostile position towards homosexual relationships , suggesting , inter alia , that \u201c they [ homosexuals ] ought to be disciplined ' gender - specifically ' with whips and pizzles ! ( sie geh\u00f6ren ' geschlechtsspezifisch ' PERSON und ORG zurechtgewiesen ) \u201d and that \u201c nazi - methods should be applied to them ! \u201d It read further that \u201c homosexuals now crawl like rats out of their holes and are fed ' lovingly ' by politicians and church officials \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently CARDINAL homosexual persons filed a private prosecution ( PERSON ) against the author PERSON for defamation and a compensation claim under LAW against the owner and publisher of \u201c LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) found that certain passages of the article constituted the offence of insult ( PERSON ) under LAW of LAW ) and ordered the owner and publisher of \u201c Der CARDINAL . \u201d to pay compensation to CARDINAL plaintiffs who could be identified on the pictures . It dismissed the compensation claim as regards the other plaintiffs and acquitted PERSON The court found that PERSON NORP had not mentioned any of those plaintiffs ' name in his article and that it could not be established that he had known that his text would be illustrated by these pictures . On pages CARDINAL the judgment contained an excursus about the nature of homosexuality , referring to a book called \u201c Lexicon of love ( PERSON der PERSON ) \u201d and the results of an opinion survey on this topic . It read , inter alia , that \u201c in truth , homosexuality includes also the lesbian world and , of course , that of animals \u201d , which was followed by a long passage describing in detail examples of same - sex practices among different animals .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , politicians and representatives of ORG publicly criticised the deciding judge PERSON for the text and style of this judgment , which was documented in a number of press releases by ORG ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , including an article published by \u201c Der Standard \u201d with the title \u201c The judge and the dear cattle ( Der Richter und das liebe Vieh ) \u201d on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE \u201c Der Standard \u201d published CARDINAL articles written by the first applicant , whereby the first one referred to the commentary ( ORG ) at issue on page CARDINAL , which read as follows :", "\u201c The punishment chamber ( PERSON )", "PERSON", "It is strange how often the avowed defenders of western values are inclined to adopt draconian methods when they feel them to be jeopardised by people with different beliefs , ideas or lifestyles . If a writer in some odd rag just says he would like to flog gay people or beat them with bulls ' pizzles , that would not normally be worth mentioning , other than to say that everyone is entitled to live out his sexual fantasies and obsessions as he pleases , even in words , as long as the objects or subjects of his desires derive as much pleasure from it as he does .", "Where such matters are being dealt with in court , however , we might expect at DATE that a judge of even minimal enlightenment would , at the very least , deliver a judgment that differs more than somewhat from the traditions of medieval witch trials . A judge in GPE , PERSON , has achieved the feat of acquitting a defendant who was given the benefit of the doubt although no doubt was apparent \u2013 on the contrary , the judge 's reasoning handed the flogger enough arguments to justify the threats of punishment he had made so enthusiastically , even if only in writing . That flies in the face , for a start , of any conception of law which sees the courtroom as more than just a punishment chamber for all possible tendencies .", "Lending support to a homophobe 's venomous hate campaign with outrageous examples from the animal kingdom casts doubt on the intellectual and moral integrity of the judge concerned . The fact that public clarifications are now needed to the effect that homosexuals are not animals prompts concern about the state of this country . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge PERSON decided that the above - mentioned excursus on pages CARDINAL be taken out of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Subsequently disciplinary proceedings were opened against judge PERSON B. On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , acting as disciplinary authority , imposed the disciplinary penalty of a warning . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) confirmed this decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , judge PERSON filed a private prosecution against the first applicant for defamation ( \u00dcble Nachrede ) and a compensation claim under LAW against the second applicant on account of the above article published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the first applicant of defamation under LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) on him , suspended on DATE . It also ordered the second applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation to judge PERSON under LAW of LAW and to publish the judgment . It found in particular that the following statements were capable of lowering judge PERSON in the public esteem , constituting the slanderous reproach that he had violated his obligations under the law and the rules on professional conduct ( Gesetzes- und Standespflichten ) , required of a judge :", "a ) the judgment delivered by the private prosecutor would only differ somewhat from the traditions of medieval witch trials ( das vom Privatankl\u00e4ger gef\u00e4llte ORG w\u00fcrde sich nur \u201c marginal PERSON mittelalterlicher ORG abheben \u201d ) and", "b ) that judge PERSON would lend support to a homophobe 's venomous hate campaign with outrageous examples from the animal kingdom ( und dieser w\u00fcrde \u201c die geifernde Hetze eines LOC DATE aus dem Tierreich st\u00fctzen \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted , inter alia , that even if the reasoning of that judgment contained irrelevant annotations , it could not be inferred from it that the private prosecutor PERSON believed that different rights were accorded to homosexuals and heterosexuals , nor that he had compared homosexuals with animals or that he had put them on an equal footing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against this judgment , claiming that the article at issue criticised exclusively the reasoning of the judgment and not the way in which judge PERSON had conducted the trial . The statements were permissible value judgments based on facts and , thus , protected under LAW . Arguing that journalistic liberty also allowed a certain degree of exaggeration and even provocation , and considering the public discussion caused by the reasoning of the judgment not only in various media but also among judges , the polemical style of the article was not disproportionate either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal and confirmed ORG judgment . It found that an average reader , interested in the subject - matter , would understand by the first statement that the private prosecutor had grossly violated fundamental procedural rights , such as the principles of impartiality and adversarial hearings , which were regularly breached in medieval witch trials . Thus , this reproach of violating the rules on professional conduct required of a judge consisted in concrete facts , which were not proved true by the records of the trial . The second statement was not only a value judgment , but also insinuated that judge PERSON had sided with the accused PERSON and had , thus , been partial . As it was not mentioned in the article that judge PERSON had impartially conducted the trial and that only certain passages of the judgment were subject to that criticism , the statements could not be considered as value judgments based on facts . Rather , in their context , they were disparaging statements of facts , falling outside the scope of protection of LAW . Since certain passages of the above judgment proved to be legally superfluous , as affirmed by the private prosecutor 's decision of DATE taking them out , they could have been subject to ( fair ) comment .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation ; the victim can thus claim damages from him . In this context \u201c defamation \u201d has been defined in LAW ) , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
