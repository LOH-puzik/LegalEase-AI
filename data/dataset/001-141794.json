A list of the applicant parties is appended .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time Mr PERSON was the chairman of the CARDINAL applicant companies and Mr PERSON was the authorised representative ( procuratore ) of the applicant company ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public limited company ORG ( ORG Torino ) signed a financing agreement ( prestito convertendo ) with CARDINAL banks . That contract was due to expire on DATE and stipulated that , should ORG fail to reimburse the loan , the banks could offset their claim by subscribing to an increase in the company \u2019s capital . Thus , the banks would have obtained PERCENT of ORG \u2019s share capital , while the holdings of the public limited company ORG ( which subsequently , on DATE , became PERSON ORG . , the name by which it will be referred to hereafter ) would have decreased from PERCENT to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . Mr Gabetti wished to obtain legal advice on the best way to ensure that PERSON remained the controlling shareholder in ORG , and to this end he contacted a lawyer specialising in company law , PERSON . He considered that one possibility would be to renegotiate an equity swap ( that is , a contract allowing a share \u2019s performance to be exchanged against an interest rate , without having to advance money ) , dated DATE and based on CARDINAL ORG shares , concluded by PERSON with an NORP merchant bank , ORG , which was due to expire on DATE . In Mr Grande Stevens \u2019s opinion , this would be CARDINAL way to prevent the launch of a takeover bid with regard to the ORG shares .", "CARDINAL . Without mentioning ORG for fear of breaching his duty of confidentiality , on DATE Mr PERSON asked ORG ( ORG \u2013 \u201c the CONSOB \u201d , which in the NORP legal system , has the task , inter alia , of protecting investors and ensuring the transparency and development of the stock markets ) whether , in the scenario he envisaged , a takeover bid could be avoided . At the same time Mr PERSON began making enquires with ORG about the possibility of amending the equity swap contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CONSOB asked PERSON and PERSON to issue a press release providing information on any initiative taken in the light of the forthcoming expiry of the financing agreement with the banks , any new fact concerning ORG and anything that might explain the market fluctuations in ORG shares .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON alleges that he was on leave on that date . He had informed Mr PERSON of the CONSOB \u2019s request and had sent him a copy of it . Mr PERSON submits that he was not involved in drafting the press releases described in CARDINAL and DATE below .", "CARDINAL . Mr Gabetti submits that on DATE he was in hospital in GPE . He had received a draft press release and had contacted Mr Grande Stevens by telephone ; the lawyer had confirmed to him that , given the significant number of elements that remained uncertain , renegotiation of the equity swap contract could not be considered as a relevant and currently available option . In those circumstances , PERSON approved the draft press release .", "CARDINAL . The press release issued in response [ to the CONSOB \u2019s query ] , approved by Mr Grande Stevens , merely indicated that PERSON had \u201c neither instituted nor examined initiatives with regard to the expiry of the financing contract \u201d and that it wished \u201c to remain ORG \u2019s reference shareholder \u201d . No mention was made of the possible renegotiation of the equity swap contract with ORG , which , in the absence of a clear factual and legal basis , the applicants considered merely as CARDINAL possible future scenario .", "CARDINAL . The Giovanni Agnelli Company confirmed PERSON \u2019s press release .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON continued his negotiations with ORG , exploring the options for amending the equity swap contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of an PERSON family meeting , it was decided that the draft text being studied by PERSON ought to be submitted for approval by the PERSON board of management . On DATE , the CONSOB received a copy of the equity swap contract and was informed of the negotiations under way with a view to using that contract to enable PERSON to acquire ORG shares .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in execution of the decisions taken by their respective boards of management , PERSON and ORG concluded the agreement on amending the equity swap contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the question posed to it by Mr Grande Stevens on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the CONSOB indicated that , in the scenario envisaged , there was no obligation to launch a takeover bid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG increased its share capital ; the new shares were acquired by the CARDINAL banks in compensation for the sums owed to them . On DATE the agreement amending the equity swap contract took effect . In consequence , PERSON continued to hold a PERCENT stake in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CONSOB \u2019s ORG ( CARDINAL mercati e consulenza economica DATE ufficio Insider Trading \u2013 hereafter the \u201c IT Office \u201d ) accused the applicants of breaching LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE . That article , entitled \u201c Market Manipulation \u201d , provides :", "\u201c Without prejudice to criminal penalties where the conduct amounts to an offence , any person who , through means of information , including Internet or any other means , disseminates false or misleading information , news or rumours of a kind to provide false or misleading indications concerning financial instruments shall be liable to an administrative penalty ranging from MONEY ( ORG ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the agreement to amend the equity swap had been concluded or was in the process of being concluded before the press releases of CARDINAL DATE were issued , and accordingly it was abnormal that they had contained no mention of it . The applicants were invited to submit their defence .", "CARDINAL . ORG then transmitted the file to the CONSOB \u2019s ORG ( ufficio sanzioni amministrative \u2013 hereafter , \u201c the Directorate \u201d ) , accompanied by a report ( relazione istruttoria ) dated DATE , which set out the evidence against the accused and their arguments in reply . According to that report , the arguments submitted in their defence by the applicants were not such as to enable the file to be closed .", "CARDINAL . The ORG communicated this report to the applicants and invited them to submit in writing , within DATE period that would expire on DATE , those arguments that they considered necessary for their defence . In the meantime , ORG continued to examine the applicants\u2019 case , by obtaining oral statements and analysing the documents received on DATE from ORG On DATE it transmitted a \u201c supplementary note \u201d to the ORG in which it stated that the new documents examined by it were not such as to alter its conclusions . On DATE the applicants received a copy of the supplementary note of DATE and its appendices ; they were given a further DATE deadline within which to submit any comments .", "CARDINAL . Without communicating it to the applicants , the ORG presented its report ( dated DATE and containing its conclusions ) to the Commission \u2013 the CONSOB proper \u2013 , that is , to the body responsible for deciding on possible penalties . At the relevant time the Commission was made up of a chairman and CARDINAL members , appointed by the President of the Republic on a proposal ( su proposta ) from the President of ORG . Their term of office was for DATE and could be renewed only once .", "CARDINAL . By resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE , the CONSOB imposed the following administrative fines on the applicants :", "EUR CARDINAL in respect of Mr Gabetti ,", "EUR CARDINAL in respect of Mr Grande Stevens ,", "ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of Mr Marrone ,", "ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of the company PERSON ,", "EUR CARDINAL in respect of the company ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr Gabetti , PERSON and PERSON were banned from administering , managing or supervising listed companies for periods of CARDINAL , DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The CONSOB held , in particular , that the file showed that on DATE , date of the impugned press releases , the plans to maintain a PERCENT stake in ORG \u2019s capital on the basis of renegotiation of the equity swap contract with ORG had already been studied and were being put in place . It followed that the press releases falsely represented ( rappresentazione falsa ) the situation at the time . The CONSOB also emphasised the positions held by the persons concerned , the \u201c objective gravity \u201d of the offence and the existence of malicious intent .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to ORG seeking to have these penalties set aside . They alleged , inter alia , that the CONSOB \u2019s rules were illegal , since , contrary to the requirements of LAW septies of Legislative Decree no . DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they did not comply with the principle of an adversarial examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . Mr Grande PERSON further noted that the CONSOB had accused and punished him for being involved in publication of the press release of DATE as the executive director of PERSON . Before the CONSOB , he had argued unsuccessfully that he did not have that role and that he was merely a lawyer and consultant for ORG . Before the appeal court , PERSON maintained that , since he was not an executive director , he could not have taken part in the decision to publish the impugned press release . In pleadings of DATE , Mr PERSON requested that , should the appeal court consider the documents placed in the case file to be insufficient or unusable , it summon witnesses for questioning \u201c on the facts set out in the above - mentioned documents \u201d . He did not indicate clearly in those pleadings either the names of those witnesses or the circumstances in respect of which they were to give evidence . In pleadings of the same date , Mr PERSON named CARDINAL witnesses whose statements would prove that he had not taken part in drafting the press releases , and stated that the appeal court could , if necessary ( ove occorresse ) , question them .", "CARDINAL . In judgments deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG reduced the administrative fines imposed by the CONSOB in respect of certain of the applicants , as follows :", "- ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of ORG . ;", "- EUR CARDINAL in respect of PERSON s.p.a . ;", "- EUR CARDINAL in respect of PERSON .", "The heading of the judgments delivered in respect of PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON . indicated that the court of appeal had met in private ( riunita in camera di consiglio ) . The \u201c procedure \u201d part of the judgments issued in respect of Mr PERSON and ORG . mentioned that the parties had been summoned to the deliberations ( disposta la comparizione delle parti in camera di consiglio ) .", "CARDINAL . The length of the ban on assuming responsibility for the administration , management or supervision of companies listed on the stock exchange was reduced from DATE in respect of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal dismissed the ORG other complaints in their entirety . It noted , inter alia , that even after the file had been transmitted to the ORG , ORG had been entitled to continue its investigative activities , as the CARDINAL-day deadline provided for the CONSOB \u2019s deliberations had not been binding . Furthermore , the adversarial principle was complied with if , as in the present case , those charged had been informed of the new evidence obtained by ORG and had had an opportunity to submit their replies .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal also noted that it was true that the CONSOB had both imposed the penalties provided for by LAW no . DATE and reported the case to the prosecuting authorities , alleging that the criminal offence described in LAW same decree had been committed . Under the terms of this provision ,", "\u201c Anyone who disseminates false information , carries out simulated transactions or uses other ploys ( artifizi ) which are objectively capable of triggering a significant change in the value of financial instruments shall be punishable by CARDINAL six years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL euros . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the court of appeal , those CARDINAL provisions had as their subject - matter the same conduct ( the \u201c dissemination of false information \u201d ) and pursued the same aim ( to prevent market manipulation ) , but differed with regard to the situation of risk alleged to have been generated by this conduct : in respect of Article QUANTITY , it was sufficient in itself to have given false or misleading indications concerning financial instruments , while LAW further required that that information had been such as to trigger a significant change in the price of the instruments in question . As ORG had indicated in its order no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , it was open to the legislature to punish illegal conduct both by a pecuniary administrative sanction and by criminal penalties . In addition , LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which invited the member States of ORG to apply administrative sanctions against persons responsible for manipulating the market , contained in turn the phrase \u201c without prejudice to the right of Member GPE to impose criminal sanctions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On the merits , the court of appeal observed that it was clear from the case file that the renegotiation of the equity swap had been examined in minute detail at the relevant date and that the conclusion reached by the CONSOB ( namely , that this plan already existed DATE prior to CARDINAL DATE ) had been reasonable in the light of the established facts and the conduct of the persons concerned .", "CARDINAL . As to Mr Grande Stevens , it was true that he was not an executive director of ORG . Nonetheless , the administrative offence punishable under LAW no . DATE could be committed by \u201c anyone \u201d , and therefore by a person in any capacity whatsoever ; Mr PERSON had indeed participated in the decision - making process which had led to publication of the press release in his capacity as a lawyer consulted by the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . In the third and fourth grounds of their points of appeal , they alleged , inter alia , that there had been a breach of the principles of a fair hearing , enshrined in LAW , because , in particular : the investigative phase of the CONSOB proceedings had not been adversarial in nature ; there had been a failure to transmit the ORG \u2019s report to the accused ; in the applicants\u2019 view , it had been impossible to file pleadings with or be heard in person by the ORG ; ORG had continued its investigation and transmitted a supplementary note after expiry of the time - limit set for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . By judgments of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed their appeals on points of law . It considered , in particular , that the principle of an adversarial examination of the case had been complied with in the proceedings before the CONSOB , noting that the latter had indicated to the applicants the acts with which they were charged and taken account of their respective defence submissions . The fact that the applicants had not been questioned and that they had not received the ORG \u2019s conclusions had not been in breach of that principle , since the constitutional provisions regarding a fair hearing and the right of defence were applicable only to judicial proceedings , and not to proceedings to impose administrative sanctions .", "CARDINAL . Under Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , the applicants\u2019 impugned conduct could be the subject - matter not only of an administrative sanction , imposed by the CONSOB , but also of the criminal penalties provided for in LAW , cited in paragraph CARDINAL above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were committed for trial before ORG . They were accused of having stated , in the press releases of DATE , that PERSON wished to remain ORG \u2019s reference shareholder and that it had neither initiated nor examined initiatives with regard to the expiry of the financing contract , although the agreement amending the equity swap had already been examined and concluded , information that had been withheld in order to avoid a probable fall in the ORG share price .", "CARDINAL . CONSOB applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party , a possibility open to it under LAW undecies of Legislative Decree no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , the date on which the judgment dismissing the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law against the penalties imposed by the CONSOB was deposited with the registry ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicants requested that the criminal proceedings against them be discontinued , by virtue of the non bis in idem rule . In particular , at the hearing of DATE , they argued that the relevant provisions of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL and LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were unconstitutional , on account of their alleged incompatibility with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The representative of the prosecuting authorities opposed this objection , alleging that \u201c double proceedings \u201d ( administrative and criminal ) were imposed by LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which the NORP legislature had transposed by enacting ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Legislative Decree no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not immediately rule on the ancillary question of constitutionality raised by the defence . It ordered an expert report describing the fluctuations in ORG shares DATE and DATE and evaluating the effects of the press releases of CARDINAL DATE and the information made public on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on DATE , the Turin ORG acquitted PERSON on the ground that he had not been involved in the publication of the press releases , and also acquitted the other applicants on the ground that it had not been proven that their conduct had been such as to trigger a significant change in the financial markets . It noted that the fact that the press releases contained false information had already been punished by the administrative body . In the court \u2019s view , the applicants\u2019 impugned conduct had , probably , been aimed at concealing the renegotiation of the equity swap contract from the CONSOB , and not at increasing ORG \u2019s share price .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the ancillary question of constitutionality raised by the applicants was manifestly ill - founded . It noted that NORP law ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) prohibited \u201c double proceedings \u201d ( doppio giudizio ) , criminal and administrative , in respect of the \u201c same act \u201d . However , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ter of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL did not punish the same act : only the criminal provision ( LAW ) required that the conduct be such as to cause a significant change in the value of financial instruments ( it referred to judgment no . DATE of ORG ( Sixth Section ) , of DATE ) . In addition , application of the criminal provision required the existence of malicious intent , while the administrative provision was applicable as soon as culpable conduct was established . Moreover , the criminal proceedings which had followed the imposition of the financial penalty provided for by LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL were authorised by LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the case - law of the ORG cited by the applicants ( PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-C ) , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE ) , ORG v. GPE ( no . MONEY , DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) ) , it was not relevant to this case , since it concerned cases where a single act had been punished by criminal and administrative penalties and where the latter had a punitive element and could include a custodial sentence or ( as in the PERSON case ) were for a sum higher than the criminal fine .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed on points of law , alleging that the offence with which the applicants had been charged was CARDINAL \u201c of danger \u201d ( reato di pericolo ) and not \u201c of damage \u201d ( reato di danno ) . It could therefore be committed even in the absence of damage having been sustained by the shareholders .", "DATE . On DATE ORG allowed in part the prosecuting authorities\u2019 appeal on points of law and quashed the acquittal of the companies PERSON and PERSON , and those of Mr PERSON and PERSON . However , it upheld the acquittal of PERSON , given that he had not taken part in the impugned conduct .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG convicted PERSON and PERSON of the offence set out in LAW no . DATE , considering it highly probable that , had the false information included in the press release of CARDINAL DATE not been issued , the value of ORG \u2019s shares would have fallen much more sharply . However , it acquitted the companies PERSON and PERSON , holding that no criminal acts could be imputed to them .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal held that there was no appearance of a violation of the ne bis in idem principle , thus endorsing the main thrust of the GPE ORG reasoning .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the Government on DATE , PERSON and PERSON appealed on points of law against that judgment , and the proceedings were still pending at that date . In their appeals , these CARDINAL applicants relied on a violation of the ne bis in idem principle and asked that an ancillary question of constitutionality be raised in respect of LAW .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P7-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-3", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-a", "6-3-c", "P1-1-1"]}
