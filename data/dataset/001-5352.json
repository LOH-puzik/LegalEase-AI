In a reply of DATE , he was informed that it was open to him to submit at any time written objections to the case - file as regards the manner in which TIME of the hearings were being taken .

Apologies were presented to the applicant .", "In a letter of DATE , the applicant again complained about discrepancies between CARDINAL versions of the same decision .

The court further noted that the applicant had been on holiday from DATE to DATE , and later from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . From DATE he had not lived in his apartment , as he had been taking care of his mother .

On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision , considering that the applicant had failed to adduce any circumstances capable of showing that he had shown due diligence , particularly as he had left on holiday without informing the court thereof .
