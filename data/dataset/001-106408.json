THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in PERSON ( NORP Republic ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mr NORP ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the GPE ORG found the applicant guilty of aiding and abetting murder . The court held that on DATE , a certain PERSON and the applicant had entered a jewellery shop and that PERSON had taken a shop assistant to another room and shot him dead . The applicant was given a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment . PERSON was tried in GPE and sentenced to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The applicant was initially serving his prison sentence in FAC in GPE . He could work , move freely in the building for most of DATE , freely interact with any of the other CARDINAL prisoners , make an appointment with a psychologist , psychiatrist or social worker at any time , follow vocational courses and study programmes , engage in outdoor exercise for TIME a day or more , a wide range of sports activities were available to him , and his cell was ventilated and dark at TIME . He was entitled to apply for conditional release after serving DATE , that is , on DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued an administrative expulsion order against the applicant .", "On DATE ORG of GPE requested GPE to take over the execution of the applicant \u2019s sentence . The applicant did not give his consent to his transfer . ORG , however , agreed to the transfer .", "On DATE ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) validated the NORP judgment regarding the applicant \u2019s conviction and converted his sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It held that , despite the applicant \u2019s objection to the transfer , all the conditions of the Convention on ORG , having regard to LAW , had been met . It noted that at the time of the commission of the crime a sentence of DATE imprisonment could have been given under LAW only , inter alia , on the condition that the possibility of the offender \u2019s rehabilitation was particularly remote . Based on the available evidence , it held that this condition had not been met and thus a sentence of imprisonment of DATE would not be compatible with NORP law .", "ORG ( krajsk\u00fd st\u00e1tn\u00ed z\u00e1stupce ) appealed against the decision , requesting the imposition of a sentence of PERCENT imprisonment because of the exceptional degree of danger to society posed by the applicant \u2019s crime .", "On DATE ORG ( vrchn\u00ed soud ) quashed ORG judgment and ruled that the applicant should continue to serve his sentence of life imprisonment without any conversion . It held that ORG had not been entitled to consider whether all the conditions for a life sentence had been met , but only to determine whether under NORP law the sentence imposed by the foreign court was at all possible for the crime in question . As it found that LAW generally provided for a sentence of life imprisonment for murder , it held that that sentence must continue to be served in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( \u00fastavn\u00ed soud ) dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant as manifestly ill - founded . It held that NORP courts could alter a foreign sentence only if the sentence was not envisaged at all under NORP law for the crime in question .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE and taken into detention pending a court ruling on the execution of his sentence .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant should serve his sentence in a secure prison ( v\u011bznice s ostrahou ) . It held that under LAW , the penal position of sentenced persons could not be aggravated by their transfer and that this also applied to conditions of detention . Consequently , the applicant could not serve his sentence in a prison with heightened security ( v\u011bznice se zv\u00fd\u0161enou ostrahou ) as would normally be the case for prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment .", "The applicant appealed , arguing that his penal position would be aggravated because the conditions of detention in a NORP secure prison were much harsher than in FAC , where he had served his sentence before being transferred .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision . It held that any disadvantages of a NORP secure prison compared to Straubing prison were offset by the advantages of serving the sentence in the applicant \u2019s home country , where his mother tongue was spoken and where he had better possibilities of visits .", "Since then the applicant has served his sentence in ORG in a section for life - sentenced prisoners . In that prison he allegedly has not been offered any employment ; he must spend TIME a day in his cell or CARDINAL room on the same floor ; he is allowed TIME , or exceptionally CARDINAL , of outdoor exercise daily in a very small area ; he is able to interact only with CARDINAL other life - sentenced prisoners ; his access to a psychologist or psychiatrist is limited ; he can not follow any vocational or study courses ; his cell is lit TIME a day and it is not possible to open a window in his cell ; and there is no possibility of sports activities except for table tennis in DATE .", "The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal , disagreeing , inter alia , with the advantages of serving his sentence in GPE noted by ORG . He argued that he had already become accustomed to a NORP environment , was fluent in NORP , was visited by people from the outside and could receive parcels without any problem . In comparison , in GPE he was in contact only with his mother , who , however , lived in PERSON , which was QUANTITY away from his prison .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his constitutional appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "Under LAW of LAW as in force in DATE , an extraordinary sentence of DATE could be imposed by a court only if the degree of danger to society posed by the offender \u2019s crime was very high and the possibility of rehabilitating the offender was regarded as remote .", "Under LAW , a life sentence could be imposed on an offender who had committed murder where :", "( a ) the degree of danger posed by such a crime to society was extremely high because of the particularly contemptible manner in which the crime was committed , or a particularly contemptible motive on the part of the offender , or a particularly serious result of the crime for which it was difficult to compensate , and ;", "( b ) the imposition of such a sentence was required for the effective protection of society , and ;", "there was no hope that the offender could be rehabilitated by a prison sentence of DATE duration .", "Under LAW of LAW a life - sentenced prisoner is eligible for parole after serving a minimum of DATE of his sentence .", "Under LAW the administering ORG is bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing ORG . If , however , this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering ORG , or its law so requires , that ORG may , by a court or administrative order , adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence . As to its nature , the punishment or measure must , as far as possible , correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced . It shall not aggravate , by its nature or duration , the sanction imposed in the sentencing ORG , nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering ORG .", "Under LAW , in the case of conversion of a sentence , the competent authority must not aggravate the penal position of the sentenced person , and is not bound by any minimum which the law of the administering ORG may provide for the offence or offences committed .", "Under LAW of LAW , upon being requested by the sentencing ORG , the administering ORG may agree to the transfer of a sentenced person without the consent of that person , where the sentence passed on the latter , or an administrative decision consequential to that sentence , includes an expulsion or deportation order or any other measure as the result of which that person will no longer be allowed to remain in the territory of the sentencing ORG once he or she is released from prison .", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL provide :", "\u201c This LAW shall be applicable to the enforcement of sentences imposed either before or after its entry into force .", "CARDINAL . Any Contracting State may at any time denounce this LAW by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary General of ORG .", "...", "CARDINAL . This LAW shall , however , continue to apply to the enforcement of sentences of persons who have been transferred in conformity with the provisions of both the LAW and this LAW before the date on which such denunciation takes effect . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
