RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) , for registration of a newspaper entitled Letters to the President ( \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443 ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE , the deputy head of ORG informed the applicant that , judging by its title , the newspaper could be perceived as an official bulletin published by a competent ORG authority . As that was likely to mislead potential readers , the applicant was advised to \u201c obtain the approval of the competent authorities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant replied to the deputy head and to the Minister , insisting that either the newspaper be registered or an official refusal be issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the ORG 's failure to act before ORG of GPE . He claimed that he had satisfied the legal requirement to be the founder of a newspaper and that the ORG 's procrastination was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received the ORG 's official refusal to register the newspaper , based on CARDINAL grounds . First , it was said that the information in the application was \u201c inconsistent with the real state of affairs \u201d ( \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f , \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) because the newspaper purported to cover a broader range of subjects than its title suggested . Second , the ORG considered that only ORG of GPE could consent to the publication of letters to the President or be a founder of a newspaper with such a title .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant amended his claim , seeking to have the ORG 's refusal overturned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE upheld the refusal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... The court considers it possible to agree with the argument [ of the Ministry ] that the title of a newspaper denotes its specialisation which [ in this case ] could be perceived by the readership as an official publication founded by a competent ORG body ... which prepares the President 's direct answers to incoming letters from citizens .", "The court considers that the above fact may give rise to incompatibility of the actual specialisation of the publication under the title Letters to the President with the current legislation . In this connection the court concludes that the ORG 's argument as regards the specialisation of the newspaper in question is a sufficient ground to refuse its registration ... under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which does not violate [ the applicant 's ] rights to found a newspaper and to choose its title ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the district court , endorsing the above reasoning . The court also held :", "\u201c ... the [ first - instance ] court rightly concluded that [ the applicant ] had failed to comply with the time - limit for bringing court proceedings without a valid excuse . Having received on DATE the refusal to register his newspaper , he lodged his claim before a court only on DATE ...", "The expiry of the DATE time - limit for lodging such claim is an independent reason for rejecting the applicant 's claims ( LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A newspaper may be founded by an adult who has not been convicted or declared legally incapable ( section CARDINAL ) . The editor 's office may begin functioning upon registration of a newspaper ; an application for registration is to be examined within DATE of being lodged ( section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . An application for registration must specify , in particular , the title of the newspaper and an approximate list of subjects and/or specialisation ( section ORG ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Registration may only be refused on the following grounds : ( CARDINAL ) the application is lodged by an individual who can not be a founder ; ( CARDINAL ) the information in the application is \u201c inconsistent with the real state of affairs \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) the title , range of subjects and/or specialisation represent an abuse of the freedom of mass media as defined in DATE ; ( CARDINAL ) if an existing newspaper with the same title has been registered earlier ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL prohibits using the mass media for the commission of criminal offences , the disclosure of ORG secrets or protected information , for extremist activities , or for the dissemination of pornography or the promotion of violence and cruelty .", "CARDINAL . An individual may bring a complaint within DATE when he or she became aware of a violation of his or her rights or freedoms ( LAW ) . The court must examine the reasons for any failure to comply with the DATE period and may reject the complaint on that ground ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .
