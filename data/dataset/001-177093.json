He referred to evictions and demolitions carried out by the municipality since DATE on CARDINAL different streets , among which FAC , from which the individual applicants in the present case had been evicted .", "CARDINAL . He emphasised , without further detail and without listing the names of the individual applicants , that the actions of the municipality breached the affected ORG human rights . He submitted that , while those persons would bring proceedings before ORG , that process would take too long and the families under threat of being evicted at that time risked being left in the street without shelter during DATE . He asked the court to order the municipality to provide shelter to the people facing eviction or to halt the planned eviction until shelter was secured .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the application did not meet the requirements of LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that it was necessary for the representative of the association to correct the irregularities in it . More specifically , the court order stated that he had to clarify the object of his application . If it was a complaint against an individual administrative act then he needed to specify the act , the body which had issued it and in what way the act was unlawful . Similarly , if he was complaining about actions or omissions on the part of an administrative body , then those had to be specified , together with their alleged unlawfulness . Further , it was necessary to indicate what he was asking of the court : the quashing of an unlawful administrative act or the discontinuation of actions or omissions by an administrative body . If he was asking for the latter , then he had to state whether those actions were carried out on the basis of an administrative act , or whether they were carried out without a lawful basis . He further had to provide proof of a paid state fee ( of CARDINAL ORG ) , as well as of the existence of the association and of its valid representation . The court suspended the case so that the association \u2019s representative could comply with the above instructions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the association \u2019s representative filed a submission entitled \u201c clarifying application \u201d in response to ORG order of DATE . It indicated that it was brought by PERSON , acting as a head and representative of association \u201c PERSON \u201d . The modified application specified that it was a complaint representing , on the one hand , a challenge to the implementation by GPE municipality of the ordinance on people \u2019s housing needs . On the other hand , the complaint was a challenge to the authorities\u2019 actions and omissions relating to the eviction of the individual applicants in DATE from CARDINAL Borimechkata Street in GPE and the authorities\u2019 continued failure thereafter to provide the evicted GPE people with adequate shelter . He identified the authorities in question as FAC municipal council officials , the ORG social assistance directorate , police officials and the private security firm \u2019s staff hired by the municipality to assist during the above - mentioned eviction and demolition . He further complained about the inaction of the social assistance department which , despite having been repeatedly informed by the association of the children \u2019s imminent eviction in DATE , had contented themselves with the drawing up of a report concluding that it was beyond their mandate to act .", "CARDINAL . The association \u2019s representative further listed the names of the individual members of the GPE families who he claimed had suffered damage as a result of the LOC actions and inactions . The latter were enumerated as follows : the forced removal of the named individuals from their dwellings by the police ; the humiliating treatment of the former by authorities involved in the eviction and demolition ; the selective demolition of dwellings occupied by GPE only ; forcing a DATE baby to spend DATE in his cot in the open in the street , as a result of which he had died DATE from double - sided pneumonia ; psychological harassment of the children from the demolished homes and failure to provide them with psychological support for the shock of witnessing their homes being destroyed and the helplessness of their parents ; subsequent housing of the GPE families in conditions unsuitable for human occupation ; unfair and discriminatory treatment during DATE of GPE in need of social housing including the families listed ; and discriminatory treatment on the basis of people \u2019s social status in the distribution of municipal dwellings . The association \u2019s representative stated that those actions and inactions had breached ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the human rights and freedoms provided for in ORG and , in particular , ORG , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . He asked the court to order the municipality to audit its municipal housing policy as regards the ethnicity and social status of the people given municipal dwellings . In addition , he asked the court to compel the municipality to provide normal living conditions to the applicant families . He also asked the court to order the municipality to pay just compensation to them for the humiliating living conditions in which they had been forced to live after the eviction and demolition , as well as for having discriminated against them as regards the provision of housing . He also sought compensation for the family of the dead child , PERSON , and for all CARDINAL families for the insufficient protection provided to the children during the demolition and thereafter . He sought costs and expenses and submitted proof of payment of the state tax due and of the existence of the association . He also listed the written items of evidence which he submitted together with his application .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the clarified application on DATE . The court found , in the first place , that this application had made it clear that the complaint was against the actions and inactions of municipal officials from GPE municipality , of police officers and private contractors at the time of the demolition of dwellings in DATE . The court further concluded that the complaint was against the inaction of the social assistance department for having refused to draw up a report on the living conditions of the children in the PERSON family during the said period . It then observed that the association was seeking , on behalf of CARDINAL families , pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages stemming from the actions and omissions of the municipal administration in relation with the demolition of the municipal houses in which those families had been living and damages for placing those individuals in inappropriate municipal dwellings .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the aforementioned actions and omissions had been presented as being unlawful and in breach of ORG , the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided that it had not been seized with a complaint against a specific individual administrative act under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE , nor with a proper complaint against specific actions or omissions under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , or with a proper claim for damages under the ORG and ORG DATE ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . In particular , neither in the initial application of DATE nor in the clarified application thereafter had the association representative specified an individual administrative act against which judicial review proceedings could be brought . Even assuming that this act was the eviction and demolition order in respect of the dwelling at CARDINAL FAC , the association was not a party to , or personally affected by , that order and the DATE statutory period for judicial review of such orders had long expired . Furthermore , the claim against the administrative actions or omissions under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW was likewise out of time , given that the authorities\u2019 actions complained of had taken place in DATE . The court further noted that a claim under LAW ORG was inadmissible due to the lack of standing of the association and because such a claim would require a prior declaration of illegality in accordance with LAW . The court declared the application inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the restating the complaint made by the association that the actions and omissions in question had been unlawful and in breach of the ORG , among other legal instruments ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , at no point in its decision did ORG refer to the ORG \u2013 the legislative act to which the association had made explicit reference DATE , examine the procedural regularity or irregularity of the application from the perspective of the ORG or explain why , for all or any of the association \u2019s complaints made in it , the ORG could not constitute an effective remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the context of a cassation review , the ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . It found that the application before it was admissible as submitted within the statutory limitation period . However , it was not well - founded . In particular , the lower court had correctly established that it had not referred to a specific administrative act under LAW . Neither had it pointed out specific actions or omissions LAW . Given that from the applicant association \u2019s submissions it had been clear that the events complained of had taken place in DATE , it was indisputable that the statutory limitation period had lapsed , which in turn was an additional ground for not examining the application on its merits . Finally , the applicants had not made a valid claim for compensation under section CARDINAL of the ORG , given that they had failed to specify the concrete acts , actions and omissions in connection with which compensation was being sought , or its amount . The ORG did not address the applicability of the ORG either .", "CARDINAL . Individuals can seek protection against actions and omissions of administrative bodies under LAW of LAW . LAW stipulates that everyone with a legal interest can bring a claim before the administrative court , seeking the discontinuation by an administrative body of an action not based on an administrative act or in the law .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW an administrative act may be contested before a court within DATE of its communication .", "CARDINAL . All claims for damages stemming from unlawful acts , actions or omissions by public bodies or officials are heard at first instance by the competent administrative court ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , judicial review of an individual administrative act has to be lodged in writing and must indicate , inter alia , the court , personal and contact data of the applicant , the administrative act which is contested and the essence of the request . The administrative court may collect evidence admissible under LAW Procedure DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and it assists the parties in proceedings before it to correct formal errors and lack of clarity in their submissions ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If an irregular application has been made challenging an individual administrative act before a court , the court specifies the irregularity and invites the party to correct it and resubmit the application ( LAW . Thus , in CARDINAL decisions , ORG , referring to the latter provision , returned an application twice to the claimant , indicating each time its irregularities and how to correct them ( see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0441\u044a\u0434 ORG \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0438 CARDINAL \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
