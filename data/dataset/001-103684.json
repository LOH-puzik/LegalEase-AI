NORP On DATE , the applicant was convicted after trial in the High Court of Justiciary at GPE of CARDINAL offences of a sexual nature .", "CARDINAL . The victims ( complainers ) were QUANTITY girls , N , C and J. The offences were alleged to been committed DATE when the QUANTITY girls had been in the foster care of the applicant and his wife . N and J were sisters who entered the applicant \u2019s care in DATE . C and her brother and sisters came into the care of the applicant in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) prohibits the admission of evidence or questioning as to the character or sexual history of a complainer in sexual offences unless the evidence or questioning falls within CARDINAL of the exceptions provided for in section CARDINAL . Those exceptions require : ( i ) that the evidence or questioning relate only to a specific occurrence or occurrences of sexual or other behaviour ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) ; are relevant to whether the accused is guilty ( section CARDINAL ) ) ; and the probative value of the evidence is significant and likely to outweigh any risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ) ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the trial started , a preliminary hearing was held to consider inter alia an application by the defence under section CARDINAL to admit evidence at trial that :", "( i ) in DATE ( around the same time she made her own allegations to the police ) the complainer C had a conversation with a defence witness , M , in which C indicated that she did not believe the allegations that had been made against the applicant by the other girls ( issue CARDINAL(b ) in the application ) ; and", "( ii ) that the applicant had made CARDINAL allegations of theft against C , which had been investigated by the police and led to reports to ORG ( the prosecution authority ) ( issue CARDINAL in the application ) .", "CARDINAL . The preliminary hearing judge decided to exclude the evidence in issue CARDINAL(b ) on the grounds that , as a general rule , evidence of facts affecting the credibility of a witness , apart from the evidence of the witness herself , was inadmissible unless the facts were also relevant to the questions at issue ; a witness should not be asked to express an opinion as to the credibility of another witness . He excluded the evidence in issue CARDINAL on the grounds that the test of relevance in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) had not been met .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their evidence at trial all CARDINAL complainers gave evidence as to the offences which they alleged had been committed against them . J also gave evidence that she had observed CARDINAL incident of abuse involving N. The jury also heard evidence that , in DATE , following a discussion between N and J , the applicant \u2019s conduct was reported to the authorities and all CARDINAL complainers were removed from his household . All CARDINAL complainers gave evidence that the reason they had delayed in reporting the abuse was that they feared that they would be separated from their respective siblings . Evidence was also led by the prosecution from a brother of N and J. The brother testified that he had seen a different instance of sexual activity between N and the applicant from that observed by J.", "CARDINAL . Each complainer was cross - examined to the effect that nothing of an inappropriate manner had ever occurred and that they had fabricated aspects of their evidence . N and J were examined as to differences between the statements they gave to the police and their testimony in court . C was examined as to why she had denied anything had happened to her at all , when first interviewed by the police in DATE . A suggestion was put to J that she had colluded with N as to what she said she had seen the applicant doing to N. It was also put to N and C that the applicant \u2019s alleged erectile dysfunction rendered him incapable of certain of the activities of which each of them had testified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave evidence denying any inappropriate conduct had ever occurred involving any of the complainers . He gave evidence as to his alleged erectile dysfunction , which , he said , meant the conduct described in particular by N and C could not have occurred . He gave evidence of a number of arguments between him and N just before they reported his conduct to the authorities in DATE . He suggested PERSON had misunderstood the incident she had observed between him and PERSON also suggested that the CARDINAL complainers had lied , possibly out of self - interest . CARDINAL character witnesses gave evidence in his defence . The applicant \u2019s general medical practitioner gave evidence that the applicant had sought help for erectile dysfunction . The applicant \u2019s wife gave evidence as to the general circumstances in the house , the applicant \u2019s character and her impression of the relationships he had with the complainers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted by a majority verdict of the jury as charged . As is the normal practice in NORP criminal law , when convicting the applicant , the jury did not give reasons for their verdict .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his conviction . He submitted that first , the preliminary hearing judge had erred in excluding the evidence set out in issues CARDINAL(b ) and CARDINAL of the defence application . Second , he submitted that the verdict of the jury was a miscarriage of justice because it had been taken in ignorance of evidence that C was motivated to tell lies about him because he had reported her to the police for theft . He argued that this evidence would have been of high probative value . It was particularly relevant because in his charge ( summing up ) to the jury the presiding judge had advised the jury that the evidence of C might be essential to the other charges .", "CARDINAL . NORP The appeal was dismissed by ORG of Justiciary sitting as a court of criminal appeal ( \u201c the Appeal Court \u201d ) on DATE . ORG accepted that the preliminary judge had erred in excluding the evidence regarding issue CARDINAL(b ) since the proposed line of questioning would not have been prohibited by CARDINAL of LAW . He had been in error in thinking that the proposed line of questioning would have been to invite the defence witness M to comment on the credibility of C. Instead , it had been to question C \u2019s credibility by proving that she had made CARDINAL contradictory statements : CARDINAL to M and another to the police . However , ORG concluded that the fact that this evidence was not before the jury did not amount to a miscarriage of justice . Whether evidence had been wrongly excluded was not the same question as whether the trial was fair ; the issue of miscarriage of justice depended on the materiality of that evidence . The question was whether , had the evidence been before the jury , there would have been any real possibility that the verdict of the jury would have been different . ORG observed :", "\u201c In the present case , the jury had before them undisputed evidence that when C was interviewed by police officers in DATE she denied that she had been sexually abused . The jury had no basis for rejecting that evidence . Notwithstanding that evidence , the jury must have accepted C \u2019s evidence that she had in fact been abused by the [ applicant ] , in the manner outlined in the CARDINAL charges relating to her . It is a well - known phenomenon for individuals who have been victims of abuse when they were children to be unwilling or reluctant to disclose such abuse , or to delay in doing so . Evidence that C had also , during DATE , indicated to defence witness M that she did not believe allegations of abuse made by the other CARDINAL complainers would , at its highest , merely have provided another instance of the same phenomenon . In our opinion it would not have added anything significant to the jury \u2019s consideration of the case . On the contrary , the jury was liable to have regarded those CARDINAL chapters of evidence as consistent manifestations of reluctance on the part of C to disclose abuse which she herself had suffered , a reluctance which common sense and experience of life indicated was understandable and one she subsequently overcame .", "The jury \u2019s verdicts were returned after they had heard evidence from all CARDINAL complainers and the [ applicant ] himself . That involved their accepting that the other CARDINAL complainers had been sexually abused by the [ applicant ] while they were in his care in similar circumstances to complainer C. It is also reasonable to assume that the jury must have accepted the evidence of the eye - witness to CARDINAL instance of abuse against complainer PERSON When all these factors are taken into account , there appears to be no real possibility that the exclusion of evidence about what complainer C may have said to defence witness M would have affected the jury \u2019s verdicts , whether in relation to the charges involving C or any of the other charges . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered that the evidence in regard to issue CARDINAL ( the alleged thefts ) had been properly excluded . None of CARDINAL requirements contained in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a)-(c ) had been met . In particular , the CARDINAL allegations of theft did not make it more or less likely that the applicant had been guilty of sexual abuse , nor did the making of those allegations by the applicant in DATE or DATE make it more or less probable that C had fabricated allegations of sexual abuse in DATE . The probative value of that evidence was insignificant and would have been calculated to blacken by innuendo the character of C by evidence relating to matters unconnected with the charges faced by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP Scots criminal law distinguishes between summary and solemn procedure . In the former the trial takes place before a judge sitting alone . In the latter , which is reserved for more serious offences , the trial takes place before a judge and a jury of CARDINAL members on the basis of an indictment . LAW and ORG and DATE Act provide for the form and content of the indictment .", "CARDINAL . The admission of evidence is a matter either for the presiding judge or , as occurred in this case , if an application is made before the start of the trial , a preliminary hearing judge .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE , immediately after the close of the evidence for the prosecution , the accused may intimate to the court his desire to make a submission that he has no case to answer both : ( a ) on an offence charged in the indictment ; and ( b ) on any other offence of which he could be convicted under the indictment . Subsections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)-(CARDINAL ) provide :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If , after hearing both parties , the judge is satisfied that the evidence led by the prosecution is insufficient in law to justify the accused being convicted of the offence charged in respect of which the submission has been made or of such other offence as is mentioned , in relation to that offence , in paragraph ( b ) of subsection ( CARDINAL ) above , he shall acquit him of the offence charged in respect of which the submission has been made and the trial shall proceed only in respect of any other offence charged in the indictment .", "( CARDINAL ) If , after hearing both parties , the judge is not satisfied as is mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) above , he shall reject the submission and the trial shall proceed , with the accused entitled to give evidence and call witnesses , as if such submission had not been made .", "( CARDINAL ) A submission under subsection ( CARDINAL ) above shall be heard by the judge in the absence of the jury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . If the trial judge rejects a submission of no case to answer , the defence case is presented . The prosecution and defence then address the jury . By section CARDINAL of LAW , the defence has the right to speak last . The presiding judge then charges the jury . The role of the presiding judge in charging the jury was restated by the Lord Justice General in GPE v. ORG ( DATE ) JC CARDINAL :", "\u201c The primary duty of the presiding judge is to direct the jury upon the law applicable to the case . In doing so it is usually necessary for him to refer to the facts on which questions of law depend . He may also have to refer to evidence in order to correct any mistakes that may have occurred in the addresses to the jury , and he may have occasion to refer to the evidence where controversy has arisen as to its bearing on a question of fact which the jury has to decide . But it is a matter very much in his discretion whether he can help the jury by resuming the evidence on any particular aspect of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The \u201c utmost care \u201d should be taken to avoid trespassing upon the jury \u2019s province as masters of the facts ( ORG v. HM Advocate ( DATE ) SLT CARDINAL ) and a presiding judge should always be slow to express his own views on questions of fact in case he thereby influences the jury whose task it is to determine all questions of fact ( PERSON v. ORG ( DATE ) JC MONEY ) . A conviction will be quashed if ORG finds that the presiding judge unduly impressed his own views on the evidence upon the jury . This may be the case even if the presiding judge attempts to cure this defect by later emphasising that the evidence is entirely a matter for the jury ( ORG v. ORG ( DATE ) SLT CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The jury may return CARDINAL of CARDINAL verdicts : CARDINAL of guilty and CARDINAL alternative acquittal verdicts of not guilty or not proven . No reasons for any of the CARDINAL verdicts are given by the jury . However , by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW , there is a right of appeal in respect of any alleged miscarriage of justice , which includes a miscarriage based on the jury having returned a verdict which no reasonable jury , properly directed , could have returned . Thus a conviction may be quashed or varied when the jury \u2019s verdict is logically inconsistent or lacking in rationality , for example , when they can not logically acquit on certain counts in an indictment and convict on others ( see , for example , PERSON v. ORG ( DATE ) SLT CARDINAL ; PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] HCJAC CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The compatibility of the jury system with LAW was considered in PERSON v. ORG [ CARDINAL ] HCJAC CARDINAL , judgment of DATE . ORG considered the Second Section \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ( in which ORG has subsequently given judgment : PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . It also considered a judgment of ORG in A. v. ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , in which Judge PERSON , giving the lead judgment of the court , considered that LAW in Taxquet had not intended to establish a principle that a jury had to give reasons for its decisions . ORG concluded ( at CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c We find Judge PERSON \u2019s full and careful analysis of the Taxquet judgment and the earlier GPE jurisprudence highly persuasive and we respectfully agree with her that the judgment is not to be read as imposing a requirement that a jury supply reasons for its verdict .", "Just as in any other jury trial in GPE , the verdict returned by the jury in the present case is not returned in isolation . It is given within a framework which includes , in particular , the speeches to the jury by those advocating the prosecution and the defence and the directions given to the jury by the trial judge . It is not suggested that the address by the trial Advocate depute in this case did not set out clearly the nature of the ORG case and the evidence which the ORG invited the jury to accept and acceptance of which was necessary if the jury were to return a guilty verdict . Nor is it suggested that the address by defence counsel did not clearly present to the jury the basis upon which it was contended that guilt was not established and that the appellant should be acquitted . It is also not suggested that the trial Judge \u2019s charge to the jury did not adequately identify all the matters which the ORG had to establish , or fail to analyse or describe the necessary elements or ingredients in the offence . Accordingly , from that framework and also from the evidence in the case , the basis of the conviction is discernable . With a jury verdict thus placed in such a framework , we do not consider , having regard to the case law of the ECtHR to which we were referred , that the fact that a jury does not supply reasons involves an infraction of the fair trial requirements of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The current versions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act were introduced by ORG by ORG ( Procedure and Evidence ) ( GPE ) Act DATE . They provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL Restrictions on evidence relating to sexual offences", "( CARDINAL ) In the trial of a person charged with an offence to which section CARDINAL of this Act applies , the court shall not admit , or allow questioning designed to elicit , evidence which shows or tends to show that the complainer\u2014", "( a ) is not of good character ( whether in relation to sexual matters or otherwise ) ;", "( b ) has , at any time , engaged in sexual behaviour not forming part of the subject matter of the charge ;", "( c ) has , at any time ( other than shortly before , at the same time as or shortly after the acts which form part of the subject matter of the charge ) , engaged in such behaviour , not being sexual behaviour , as might found the inference that the complainer\u2014", "( i ) is likely to have consented to those acts ; or", "( ii ) is not a credible or reliable witness ; or", "( d ) has , at any time , been subject to any such condition or predisposition as might found the inference referred to in sub - paragraph ( c ) above .", "CARDINAL Exceptions to restrictions under section CARDINAL .

The DATE Act was preceded by a public consultation and a Policy Memorandum , which was published by ORG . The Policy Memorandum stated that evidence as to the sexual history and character of a complainer in sexual offences was rarely relevant and , even where it was , its probative value was frequently weak when compared with its prejudicial effect . It involved invasion of the complainer \u2019s privacy and dignity and diversion from the issues which required to be determined at trial .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL were considered to be compatible with LAW by the High Court of Justiciary in PERSON ( PERSON ) v. HM Advocate ( also known as GPE v. ORG ) ( DATE ) MONEY CARDINAL , where the appellant faced trial on charges of rape and sexual assault . The Lord ORG , giving the opinion of the court , referred first to the \u201c twin myths \u201d that , in a rape case , a complainer \u2019s previous sexual experience or adverse sexual reputation made it more likely that she consented to intercourse and made it less likely that she was a credible witness . His Lordship continued :", "\u201c The embarrassment and humiliation of a complainer in a rape trial is a genuine social problem . Counsel agree that the protection of the complainer from unfair and intrusive attacks on her sexual history or character and the exclusion of evidence tendered in pursuit of the twin myths to which I have referred are , in general , legitimate legislative aims that recognise the complainer \u2019s rights to privacy under LAW ( cf R v A ( No CARDINAL ) , [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , PERSON of PERSON at paras . [ CARDINAL ] , [ CARDINAL]-[CARDINAL ] ; SN v GPE , No . CARDINAL , DATE , unrepd , at para CARDINAL ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] But the protection of the complainer can not be seen apart from the basic principles of fairness in NORP criminal procedure which entitle everyone accused of a crime to defend himself , to confront his accusers and to have a fair opportunity to put his own case . These principles underpin a value that is fundamental to criminal jurisprudence in a free society , namely the protection of the citizen from being wrongly convicted .", "[ CARDINAL ] The difficult problem of reform in this emotive branch of the law is to reconcile the legislative aims to which I have referred with the basic principles of fairness ( SN v GPE , supra , at para [ CARDINAL ] ) . Although article CARDINAL expresses the right to a fair trial in unqualified terms , what is required for fairness may vary according to context ( cf ORG Secretary , [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG , ORG at para CARDINAL ) . Individual evidential or procedural rules may be devised to take account of rights and interests other than those of the accused . Such interests include respect for the complainer \u2019s rights under article CARDINAL ( cf PERSON v the GPE , supra , at para CARDINAL ) , and the public interest in the detection and prosecution of crime . The protection of such interests is a clear and proper public objective that justifies a legislature in qualifying to a limited extent the constituent rights comprised within article CARDINAL ( Brown v Stott , supra , Lord PERSON of PERSON at p CARDINALA ) ; but the legislature can not qualify them to such an extent that the overall fairness of the trial is compromised ( PERSON v Stott , supra ; PERSON and ORG , supra , at para CARDINAL ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] In my opinion , the primary aim of the DATE legislation and the subordinate and specific aim set out in paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( supra ) , are both legitimate legislative aims . The balancing exercise by which those aims are to be achieved without prejudice to the overall fairness of the trial lies in the first instance within the province of the legislature . The underlying aim of CARDINAL involves a sensitive social issue that is more appropriate for the consideration of the legislature than that of the courts . In my opinion , the enactment of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL was within the legitimate area of discretion of ORG . The ORG had an evidential basis on which to exercise its judgment in the matter , namely the research evidence referred to in the Policy Memorandum , supported by the evidence of CARDINAL of its authors to ORG . The underlying policy was fully considered and tested during the legislative process . The policy justification was , in my view , coherent .", "[ CARDINAL ] But although the legislation is directed to legitimate aims , there remains the question whether the restrictions that it imposes on the defence are greater than are strictly necessary for the achievement of those aims ( cf Rowe and ORG , ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , at para CARDINAL ; PERSON v GPE , ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ; PERSON , supra ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] If CARDINAL had imposed an absolute prohibition on the questioning or evidence to which it refers , there would have been a violation of article CARDINAL ( cp R v Seaboyer , supra , McLachlin J at pp CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; GPE and PERSON v GPE ORG , DATE ORG CARDINAL , at paras [ CARDINAL ] , [ CARDINAL ] ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] The decision of the court under LAW will in every case depend on the nature of the prosecution case and of the proposed questioning or evidence . The probative value of evidence that the complainer had a sexual experience with another man may be much less than that of evidence that she had a sexual relationship with the accused ; and there may be strong reasons for the court \u2019s allowing reference to a matter affecting the complainer \u2019s character that has no conceivable sexual connotations ; for example , a previous conviction of the complainer for perjury or for perverting the course of justice , or some mental condition of the complainer that predisposes her to fantasise or to exaggerate .", "[ CARDINAL ] Section CARDINAL , in my view , is a reasonable and flexible response to the problem and a legitimate means of achieving the legislative objective ( R v A ( No CARDINAL ) , supra , Lord Hope of PERSON at paras CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . It lies within the discretionary area of the judgment that is confided to the ORG ( R v ORG , ex p Kebilene , [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL , at p CARDINAL ; ORG Secretary , supra , ORG at paras DATE ) and in my view meets the requirements of proportionality ( PERSON Minister of Agriculture , [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , Lord PERSON at p DATE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The accused in that case was subsequently convicted and appealed ( PERSON v. ORG Advocate DATE SLT CARDINAL ) . The conviction was quashed on different grounds . However , in respect of section CARDINAL , ORG confirmed that \u201c behaviour \u201d in that section should not be given a restrictive meaning ; it would also include acts or omissions of the complainer and statements made by him or her , provided that they were relevant to whether the complainer was likely to have consented to the sexual acts alleged or reflect upon his or her credibility or reliability ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
