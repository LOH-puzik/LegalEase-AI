NORP Since DATE they have lived apart . According to the applicant , in DATE she initiated proceedings for dissolution of the marriage in GPE . By a decision of QUANTITY DATE ORG decided to grant the applicant separation from DATE which in NORP law is not identical to a divorce , since the spouses remained legally married .
