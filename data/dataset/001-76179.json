The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained at NORP prison ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , accused together with other persons of various counts of aggravated theft ( including theft in various factories and car theft ) , was arraigned before ORG sitting as ORG .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution concluded the case on the merits on DATE . It produced further evidence on charges of recidivism on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal qualification of the charges was presented on DATE , on which date ORG started to hear the evidence for the defence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant of CARDINAL of the charges , namely receiving stolen goods and theft of a car . It found the applicant guilty of the remaining CARDINAL charges of theft and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence . CARDINAL of his co - accused appealed , challenging exclusively the reasonableness of their sentence .", "CARDINAL . The defendants introduced a number of requests for release on bail , for the examination of new witnesses and for leave to present further submissions . This led to the adjournment of the case on several occasions , in particular on DATE and on DATE , dates scheduled for the delivery of the judgment . The examination of the case was suspended from DATE until DATE because the presiding judge was ill .", "CARDINAL . The delivery of the judgment was scheduled first for DATE , then for DATE ; however , the proceedings were adjourned as some of the accused wished to present further submissions and because the presiding judge had been assigned to a foreign tribunal . By an order of DATE ORG adjourned the proceedings sine die awaiting the outcome of the constitutional claim which the applicant had introduced in the meantime ( see infra , under PERSON \u201c The applicant \u2019s constitutional claim \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings were resumed after the determination of the applicant \u2019s constitutional claim , and on DATE ORG gave its final judgment . It reaffirmed that its role was not to interfere with the first court \u2019s appreciation of the evidence , as long as it was satisfied that the conclusions reached by ORG were lawful and reasonable . In the light of the material before it and having regard to the fact that the applicant had admitted his guilt , ORG confirmed the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant had filed a constitutional claim with ORG ( FAC ) . Invoking LAW CARDINAL of LAW , he complained about the length of the criminal proceedings and alleged that his trial had not been fair .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that no delay could be imputed to the prosecution or to the trial court . The case was a rather complex one , as it involved many counts and a number of accused persons . Moreover , ORG had to hear several witnesses and to obtain many documents . Notwithstanding this , most of the requests for bail were decided on DATE , which was DATE after DATE of the arraignment . Some of the accused failed to appear at several hearings , thus obliging the trial court to adjourn the proceedings . There were also difficulties in controlling the various accused , as their behaviour during the hearings had obstructed the normal course of justice . As some of them did not respect the bail conditions , the police had to take action for the revocation of bail and ORG had to decide on this issue . Some witnesses were untraceable and others , albeit properly summoned , did not attend the sittings . There had been no excessive delay in the inquiries and it had to be taken into account that it was necessary to exhibit the record of the inquiry for every single charge . The prosecution had concluded the case within a reasonable time and the proceedings before ORG were conducted without any unnecessary delay .", "CARDINAL . As to the proceedings before ORG , they were prolonged because of the great number of claims presented by the defence and the need to obtain several reports from prison officials and/or psychiatric experts on the behaviour of the defendants , with a view to considering the progress they had made while in prison . Apart from the period DATE and DATE , the case was never left dormant .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , notwithstanding the fact that the case had been pending for DATE , there had been no substantial delay . It was true that most of the delay had been caused by the requests of other accused and not of the applicant himself . However , ORG considered that , the crimes being connected , it would not have been consonant with the proper administration of justice to separate the defendants\u2019 respective situations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the latter quashed the impugned judgment in so far as it concerned the applicant \u2019s complaint relating to the length of the criminal proceedings and declared that there had been a breach of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d principle . It also ordered the Attorney General to pay the applicant MONEY ( Lm \u2013 PERCENT ) as just satisfaction . It held that each party had to bear its own costs . ORG confirmed ORG judgment for the remainder .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that there had been some delay at the appeal stage . The case was not particularly complex as the appeals concerned almost exclusively the measure of the penalty . Notwithstanding this , the case remained undecided for DATE and DATE and in DATE it was eventually referred to a new presiding magistrate . Even if it was true that the defendants presented a number of claims which had the effect of slowing down the proceedings , ORG had the duty to ensure that the duration of the trial was not excessive . As most of these claims had been introduced by the other defendants , and not by the applicant himself , there had been a violation of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d principle in respect of the latter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
