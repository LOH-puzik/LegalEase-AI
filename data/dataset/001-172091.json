Having left their home country , GPE , they travelled through GPE , GPE , and GPE , and entered the territory of ORG in GPE . From there , they transited through the former GPE . Mr PERSON spent TIME on NORP territory ; whereas Mr GPE DATE . At last , on DATE they arrived in the PERSON transit zone situated on the border between GPE and GPE . On DATE , they submitted applications for asylum .", "CARDINAL . From that moment on , the applicants stayed inside the transit zone , which they could not leave in the direction of GPE . They alleged that the transit zone was , in their view , unsuitable for a stay longer than a day , especially in the face of their severe psychological condition . They were effectively locked in a confined area of QUANTITY , part of the transit zone , surrounded by fence and guarded by officers ; and were not allowed to leave it for GPE . They claimed that they had no access to legal , social or medical assistance while in the zone . Moreover , there was no access to television or the Internet , landline telephone or any recreational facilities . They submitted that they stayed in a room of QUANTITY containing beds for CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the containers measured QUANTITY . There were CARDINAL beds in each container and an electric heater . The number of asylum - seekers never exceeded CARDINAL in the material period . Hot and cold running water and electricity were supplied . CARDINAL pork - free meals were available DATE to the applicants in a dining - container . Medical care was available for TIME DATE by doctors of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the Report of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , asylum seekers in the GPE zone were accommodated in rooms of QUANTITY in ground surface that were equipped with CARDINAL beds fitted with clean mattresses , pillows and bedding . The accommodation containers had good access to natural light and artificial lighting , as well as to electric heating . Further , there was a narrow designated area in front of the containers to which foreign nationals had unrestricted access during DATE . The sanitary facilities were satisfactory . The ORG delegation had a good impression of the health - care facilities and the general health care that was provided to foreign nationals in the establishment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , both illiterate , were interviewed at once by ORG ( \u201c the asylum authority \u201d ) . By mistake , the first applicant was interviewed with the assistance of an interpreter in PERSON , which he does not speak . Both applicants\u2019 mother tongue was GPE . According to the record of the meeting , the asylum authority gave the first applicant an information leaflet on asylum proceedings , which was also in PERSON . The interview lasted TIME . An GPE interpreter was present for the second applicant \u2019s interview , which lasted TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the notes taken during the interviews GPE was the first country where both applicants had applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . By a decision delivered on DATE of DATE , the asylum authority rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum applications , finding them inadmissible on the grounds that GPE was to be considered a \u201c safe third country \u201d according to Government Decree no . CARDINAL . ( VII.CARDINAL . ) on safe countries of origin and safe third countries ( \u201c the Government Decree \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The asylum authority ordered the applicants\u2019 expulsion from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the decision before ORG . On DATE the applicants , through representatives of ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) who had access to the transit zone , authorised CARDINAL lawyers acting on behalf of ORG to represent them in the judicial review procedure . However , the authorities did not allow the lawyers to enter the transit zone to consult with their clients until TIME of CARDINAL September CARDINAL , that is , after the court hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing regarding both applicants with the assistance of an GPE interpreter . Both applicants stated that they had received a document from the NORP authorities written in NORP , which they could not understand , and that they had been ordered to leave NORP territory . At the hearing , the second applicant submitted that he had applied for asylum in GPE , but his application had not been examined .", "CARDINAL . The court annulled the asylum authority \u2019s decisions and remitted the case to it for fresh consideration . It relied on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Government Decree and argued that the asylum authority should have analysed the actual situation in GPE regarding asylum proceedings more thoroughly . It should also have informed the applicants of its conclusions on that point and afforded them DATE to rebut the presumption of GPE being a \u201c safe third country \u201d with the assistance of legal counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of their lawyers , a psychiatrist commissioned by ORG visited the applicants in the transit zone and interviewed them with the assistance of an interpreter attending by telephone . Her opinion stated that the first applicant ( Mr PERSON ) had left GPE in DATE partly because of a flood and partly because CARDINAL political parties had been trying to recruit him . When he refused , he was attacked and suffered injuries . The psychiatrist observed that he was well oriented , able to focus and recall memories , but showed signs of anxiety , fear and despair . He was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder ( \u201c PTSD \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the second applicant ( Mr PERSON ) , the medical report stated that he had fled his country DATE . He had previously worked abroad , during which time his whole family had died in a flood . He had then left GPE and migrated through several countries in order to restart his life . He was found to be well oriented with no memory loss but with signs of depression , anxiety and despair . He was diagnosed with PTSD and as having an episode of depression .", "CARDINAL . Neither of the reports contained any indication of urgent medical or psychological treatment . However , the psychiatrist was of the opinion that the applicants\u2019 mental state was liable to deteriorate due to the confinement .", "CARDINAL . According to the documents in the case file , on DATE the asylum authority informed the ORG legal representatives by telephone that a hearing would be held DATE . However , the applicants submitted that no such precise information had been given to their representatives .", "CARDINAL . Since their legal representatives were not present at the hearing , the applicants decided not to make any statement . With the assistance of an GPE interpreter , the asylum authority informed the applicants that they had DATE to rebut the presumption of GPE being a safe third country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 legal representatives made submissions to the asylum authority and requested that a new hearing be held , which they would attend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the asylum authority again rejected the applications for asylum . It found that the reports prepared by the psychiatrist had not provided enough grounds to grant the applicants the status of \u201c persons deserving special treatment \u201d since they had not revealed any special need that could not be met in the transit zone . As to the status of GPE being classed as a \u201c safe third country \u201d , the asylum authority noted that the applicants had not referred to any pressing individual circumstances substantiating the assertion that GPE was not a safe third country in their case , thus they had not managed to rebut the presumption . As a consequence , the applicants\u2019 expulsion from GPE was ordered .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought judicial review by ORG . On DATE the court upheld the asylum authority \u2019s decision . It observed in particular that , in the resumed proceedings , the asylum authority had examined , in accordance with the guidance of the court , whether GPE could be regarded generally as a safe third country for refugees and had found on the basis of the relevant law and the country information obtained that it was so . It had considered the report of ORG published in DATE , the reports of DATE and DATE issued by the ORG concerning GPE together with other documents submitted by the applicants . It had established on the basis of those documents that GPE satisfied the requirements of section CARDINAL ( i ) of LAW . The court was satisfied that the asylum authority had established the facts properly and observed the procedural rules , and because the reasons for its decision were clearly stated and were reasonable .", "CARDINAL . The court further emphasised that the ORG statements given at the hearings were contradictory and incoherent . The first applicant had given various reasons for leaving his country and made confusing statements on whether he had received any documents from the NORP authorities . The document he had finally produced was not in his name , and therefore it could not be taken into account as evidence . Never in the course of the administrative proceedings had he referred to the conduct of human traffickers before his hearing by the court . The second applicant \u2019s statements were incoherent on the issue of the duration of his stay in GPE and the submission of a request for asylum . The applicants had not relied on any specific fact that could have led the authority to consider GPE non - safe in their respect . They had contested the safety of GPE only in general which was not sufficient to rebut the presumption .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court was satisfied that the authority \u2019s procedure had been in compliance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The final decision was served on the applicants on DATE . It was written in NORP but explained to them in GPE . Escorted to the NORP border by officers , the applicants subsequently left the transit zone for GPE without physical coercion being applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the transcript of the court hearing held on DATE was sent to the applicants\u2019 lawyer . On DATE the lawyer received the GPE translation of the court \u2019s decision taken at the hearing . On DATE the applicants\u2019 petitions for review were dismissed on procedural grounds , since the GPE held that it had no jurisdiction to review such cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
