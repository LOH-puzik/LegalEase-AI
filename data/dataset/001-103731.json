The building is situated in a privileged location near the centre of GPE and has an excellent view of the LOC ... It is a fact that the building in issue , like all the buildings that have been expropriated for the construction of the new ORG , is in a prime location on account of its proximity to the historical centre of the city of GPE , [ where ] real estate demand exceeds existing supply . \u201d", "The court also relied on comparative data , such as the compensation awarded for the expropriation of CARDINAL adjacent and CARDINAL neighbouring buildings and the price obtained from the sale of CARDINAL neighbouring buildings .", "On DATE ORG and ORG lodged an action with ORG for the assessment of the final unit amount for compensation , claiming that the amounts awarded by judgment no .

ORG assessed the provisional unit amount for compensation ... for the fifth floor at ORG QUANTITY ...", "As far as the market value of the apartments is concerned , it should be noted , however , that the fact that the amounts assessed by ORG were PERCENT higher than the amounts proposed by the ORG and ORG was obviously because they [ the ORG and ORG ] had requested , clearly in error ( \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae ) , the assessment in QUANTITY , influenced by the measurements used in the cadastral report , which gives the volume [ of the apartments ] in QUANTITY ...", "In support of their arguments the parties referred to and submitted the following evidence and comparative information .", "The ORG submitted judgment no .
