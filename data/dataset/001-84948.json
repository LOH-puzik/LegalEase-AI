GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Javier Borrego Borrego;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant was convicted of murder and has been serving a life sentence in Straubing Maximum Security Prison since DATE . The highest level of security applies at the prison , as it houses solely inmates serving long - term or life - imprisonment sentences or those in subsequent preventive detention . Radios are permitted in the prison facility in question .", "On DATE the applicant applied for permission to have a CD player and audio CDs and a play station and its necessary accessories .", "On DATE ORG rejected his application in accordance with section QUANTITY of FAC , arguing that granting it would have jeopardised security and order in the prison .", "The applicant applied for judicial review .", "ORG submitted to the court that , given the maximum - security regime of the prison and the significant number of inmates who had been involved with drugs , every object that was handed over to an inmate had to be thoroughly checked for hidden drugs or facilities that could enable a breakout . The electronic facilities which the applicant applied for had multiple cavities and owing to their high complexity could have been modified to carry illegal or impermissible information . Moreover , every audio CD would have had to be checked for possible hidden electronic data . Therefore , maintaining security and order in the prison would have necessitated time - consuming checks by specially qualified prison staff . Having regard to the possibility of multiple similar requests , allowing prisoners to have the devices in question would have necessitated substantial additional work and would possibly have required a raise in the number of staff . Therefore , the necessary security measures to be taken would have been disproportionate to the applicant \u2019s interests at stake .", "The applicant submitted that the possession of a CD player and a play station would not have posed a real threat to security . To this end he referred at large to the decisions of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE , which found that a play station did not pose a relevant threat to prison order . The applicant also referred to ORG decision of DATE . He relied , in particular , on the principle of equality . None of these decisions directly concerned the applicant PERSON ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision , endorsing the arguments given by it and noting that the case - law cited by the applicant did not provide for a decision in his favour .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( Rechtsbeschwerde ) as inadmissible . It found that neither the development of law nor the necessity of uniform case - law demanded the examination of its merits . The decisions of ORG and ORG were based on sufficient grounds , namely , the special circumstances of the prison concerned , and thereby complied with the law .", "On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to examine his constitutional complaint without further reasons .", "Section QUANTITY CARDINAL of the law on the execution of prison sentences and measures of rehabilitation and prevention involving deprivation of liberty DATE FAC \u2013 provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every inmate is allowed to possess books or other objects to a reasonable extent for educational or leisure purposes .", "( CARDINAL ) This does not apply if the possession , the surrender or the use of the object would [ ... ]", "CARDINAL . jeopardise [ ... ] the security or order of the prison facility . \u201d", "ORG in its decision of DATE ( CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and ORG in its decision of DATE ( CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) found that a play station did not pose a relevant threat to security and order of the prison and was therefore permitted according to section QUANTITY . These decisions did not deal with the security level of the prison facilities in question .", "ORG decided on DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that the refusal to allow a prison inmate to have a play station did not infringe any of that person \u2019s constitutional rights . ORG decision was , in particular , not contrary to the principle of equality . Referring to the above decisions of the GPE and ORG it found that every request concerning electronic devices in prison had to be decided on its own merits according to the circumstances of the particular case and the conditions of the prison facility concerned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
