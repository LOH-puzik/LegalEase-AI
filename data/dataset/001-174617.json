De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant graduated from ORG with a degree in law . He worked as an investigator at ORG city police headquarters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established that from DATE , when he had been working as an investigator , the applicant had several times solicited and sometimes succeeded in getting bribes for discontinuing criminal proceedings . The victims of the applicant \u2019s crimes , who were suspects in criminal proceedings or their relatives , had been threatened and sometimes harassed sexually by the applicant . He would tell them that \u201c the case would end badly ( blogai baigsis ) \u201d if they did not meet his demands . ORG found that such actions amounted to the intentional crimes of abuse of office ( LAW ) and bribery ( LAW ) . The court also noted that the applicant had not acknowledged his guilt , but had instead tried to justify his criminal acts and avoid taking responsibility for them in any way possible . The trial court sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 deprivation of liberty in a correctional labour colony under a strict regime , ordered the confiscation of all his property , and prohibited him from working in law enforcement or the justice system for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s conviction was upheld by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , upon entry into force of the new Criminal Code , ORG requalified the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 deprivation of liberty . The applicant was released from prison on DATE after serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG expunged the applicant \u2019s conviction from his criminal record . The court noted that the applicant had served his sentence . He had been convicted of crimes of medium severity . The court also took account of the fact that the applicant had not committed any violations of administrative law , had been bringing up a child alone , had been described in positive terms by people at his place of residence and at his workplace , had drawn the right conclusions from the crimes he had committed , and had promised not to commit any crimes in the future . The ruling was not appealed against and became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s curriculum vitae , which he later submitted to ORG , from DATE he worked as in - house lawyer and loan administrator in various private companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG , which regulates advocates ( lawyers admitted to the Bar , advokatas ) , requesting to be admitted as a trainee advocate . He asked that an advocate V.S.B. be appointed as his supervisor in his work practice . The applicant also confirmed in writing that \u201c none of the grounds listed in the PERSON on the Bar prevented him from being put on the list of trainee advocates \u201d . The applicant also submitted a written application ( advokato \u012fskaitos lapas ) where he listed his former places of employment , stating that from DATE until DATE he had worked in the police and from DATE in the private sector . There was no explanation about the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG placed the applicant \u2019s name on the list of trainee advocates on DATE and advocate ORG was appointed as his supervisor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG received a letter from a private person , GPE , informing it that the applicant had withheld information from ORG that he had been previously convicted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that by failing to inform it of the conviction , the applicant had withheld information relevant to assessing his reputation , and that therefore he had shown that his attitude towards the standing of ORG and towards becoming a trainee advocate was not honest and respectful . ORG considered that the applicant had breached points CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the Code of Ethics \u201d ) , and disciplinary proceedings against him were therefore justified . ORG also considered that the applicant \u2019s supervisor , ORG , had likewise breached LAW but that he would not face disciplinary proceedings owing to his long and positive professional record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG held that the applicant had committed a disciplinary violation by withholding information about his conviction by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The committee emphasised the fact that the applicant had not mentioned the conviction or his \u201c long prison sentence \u201d in his application to be admitted as a trainee advocate , his curriculum vitae or in the other documents submitted in support . Information about the conviction had been relevant for assessing his reputation . By withholding such information the applicant had acted dishonestly and disrespectfully , and had not protected the prestige of ORG . The applicant had thus breached points CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Ethics , which set out the necessary requirements for candidates to become trainee advocates ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The case therefore had to be decided by ORG ( hereinafter DATE \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the chief prosecutor of ORG wrote that the applicant lived in the city of ORG and that in the course of his work as a trainee advocate he had interaction with the same investigators , prosecutors and judges with whom he had worked before committing his crimes and with those who had later investigated his crimes or examined his case in court . Even though the applicant had served his sentence , communication with those investigators , prosecutors and judges caused some strains at work in ORG . The chief prosecutor stated that it would be better if the applicant could be prevented from practising law in the city or region of ORG , even though the PERSON on the Bar did not provide for the possibility to restrict an advocate \u2019s activity within or outside a certain area .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant about the forthcoming hearing in his case , and invited him to participate in person or have an advocate represent his interests in those disciplinary proceedings . The applicant was present at the hearing , and explained that he had not hidden his conviction . The only reason he had not informed ORG about it was because in his view there had been no requirement to do so . He also asked for the removal of the president of ORG , PERSON , stating that the manner in which the latter had put certain questions to him showed he was biased . The request was refused as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . ORG , composed of the presiding advocate , PERSON , and CARDINAL other advocates , ORG and FAC , met on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . They postponed the hearing to a later date on each occasion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicant to remove PERSON as unsubstantiated , while PERSON was replaced by another advocate , PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG also held on DATE that the applicant had breached LAW and imposed the disciplinary measure of ordering his removal from the list of trainee advocates , on the basis of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Bar ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In setting out its reasons ORG had regard to the crimes committed by the applicant and noted that during the criminal court proceedings he had expressed no remorse ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . For ORG , even though the law did not directly require that a person disclose a prior conviction when submitting a request to become a trainee advocate , such an obligation stemmed from DATE ) of the Law of the Bar , which required candidates to be of high moral character ( nepriekai\u0161tinga reputacija ) . Similarly , point CARDINAL of the Code of Ethics set out that an advocate had to act honestly and ethically , even if certain acts or behaviour that did not meet the requirements of the PERSON on the NORP or the Code of ORG were not described specifically in that Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG considered that the crimes which the applicant had committed whilst working in law enforcement had been cynical and had shown great disrespect towards society . Moreover , he had committed those crimes while working in the legal field . In the light of such considerations , ORG was convinced that the applicant , who had a university degree and had previously had a law - related job , had deliberately withheld information about his prior conviction , because he had been aware that , if information not only about his crimes but also about the manner in which he had committed them had come to light , then ORG would have rejected his application to become a trainee advocate . Lastly , ORG noted that the profession of advocate was defined not only by legal acts , but also by certain ethical rules , historic practices and society \u2019s legitimate expectations as to the assistance an advocate was to provide as part of his or her role . An advocate should therefore always adhere to the moral and legal standards and obligations , protect the professional honour and dignity of advocates and do nothing that would discredit the good name of the profession , the advocate \u2019s oath , or the notion of justice .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the above decision before ORG . He argued , inter alia , that there had been procedural beaches and that ORG had not been impartial . He also maintained that the concept of high moral character applied to advocates was too strict when compared with the requirements for bailiffs or civil servants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded . It dealt with the applicant \u2019s allegations about procedural violations by ORG by noting that that court had merely postponed the case on DATE and DATE , without examining it on the merits ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant \u2019s suggestion that ORG had issued a ruling on either of those dates that the applicant had not committed a disciplinary violation was therefore unfounded . Furthermore , PERSON , the advocate who had been the president of ORG , had been questioned as a witness by ORG and had testified that he had not been biased against the applicant ; he had only had an opinion about the particular actions performed by the applicant . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s allegation about a lack of impartiality on the part of PERSON had also been dismissed as unfounded by ORG . Lastly , the change in the composition of that court when the case had been decided on DATE , removing ORG , a member said by the applicant to have been favourable to him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had not been a decisive factor because the court had been unanimous in its finding against the applicant . ORG thus dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to summon for questioning advocate PERSON , who , according to the applicant , had participated in the hearing when his case had gone before ORG . On the basis of the written evidence , the first - instance court established that ORG had not taken part in the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As to the question of the applicant \u2019s reputation , ORG had particular regard to the crimes of which he had been convicted ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . While observing that the conviction had expired , the court noted that the crimes had been committed when the applicant had been working in law enforcement . The manner in which those crimes had been committed and their scale did not allow for the assertion that the applicant had automatically regained the status of being of high moral character immediately after the conviction had been expunged . Were it otherwise , society \u2019s expectations as to the morals and ethics of representatives of the advocate \u2019s profession would not be met . Only people of high moral character could be trusted to work in the process of the implementation of justice . In other words , the applicant \u2019s actions had to be looked at to see not only if they had been in accordance with applicable laws , but also whether they had adhered to the requirements of professional ethics . That stemmed , inter alia , from DATE ) and other provisions of the LAW on the Bar , which provided that an advocate was liable to disciplinary sanctions , including disbarment , for breaches of professional ethics ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and was something that had also been confirmed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concurred with ORG that the applicant had had a moral obligation to disclose important information such as a prior conviction to ORG when submitting an application to become a trainee advocate , even though that requirement had not been explicitly stated on the application form ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , advokato \u012fskaitos lapas ) . The fact that , according to the applicant , his supervising advocate , several other advocates in ORG and some members of ORG had known about his prior conviction , did not absolve him from the obligation to provide information that was as comprehensive as possible when applying to the Bar , so that it would be possible to assess his reputation objectively and comprehensively . ORG had also been correct in holding that the applicant had consciously withheld that information because he had understood that the nature of his criminal acts would not have permitted him to be considered as a person of high moral character . In any case , if the applicant had had any doubts about whether the information about his prior conviction was relevant , he could have asked ORG . Consequently , it had been legitimate for ORG to impose a disciplinary measure on the applicant by removing him from the list of trainee advocates .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the rules of LAW had not applied to him at the time when he had requested to become a trainee advocate , given that they applied only to people who were already advocates and trainee advocates . According to the applicant , the president of ORG had clearly acknowledged to ORG that anyone who had disclosed a prior conviction had been admitted to the Bar and that the applicant would also have been admitted if he had done the same . The applicant also relied on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) , implying that the definition of high moral character had been interpreted too broadly by ORG .", "ORG asked that the applicant \u2019s appeal be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG arguments and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that no violations had been committed under LAW QUANTITY CARDINAL of the Convention as regards the fairness of the disciplinary proceedings . The rules regulating disciplinary proceedings did not prohibit postponing examination of a case . Moreover , the applicant had not challenged ORG \u2019s participation in the disciplinary proceedings . It would also have been irrelevant to summon ORG as she had not sat in ORG when it had decided on the applicant \u2019s case on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits of the complaint , ORG had been correct in its interpretation of the PERSON on the Bar and of established court practice in looking at the applicant \u2019s crimes , their manner and scale not only in the light of the LAW on the Bar , but also taking into account the rules for advocates\u2019 professional ethics . There had been no arguments in the applicant \u2019s appeal to refute the first - instance court \u2019s view of his crimes and behaviour in the light of those ethical requirements . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s submission , the first - instance court had relied on LAW and on LAW , not on LAW . The applicant \u2019s argument that the first - instance court had applied LAW on the Bar ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) retroactively was therefore unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that he had had no obligation to inform ORG about his prior conviction . ORG had been correct in finding that such an obligation stemmed from the PERSON on the Bar and the Code of Ethics , which also applied to the applicant . ORG conclusion had been supported by point CARDINAL of LAW , which set out that the relationship between an advocate and the Bar was based on mutual respect and good - will assistance , and by point CARDINAL , which stated that an advocate must also adhere to the traditions and customs which corresponded to the common principles of ethics and decency ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As a result , ORG had had grounds to impose a disciplinary penalty on the applicant and to strike his name off the list of trainee advocates on the basis of Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Bar .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He submitted , inter alia , that the prohibition on him practising law was in breach of his rights under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . He also argued that an expired conviction should not be an obstacle for him to become an advocate . He mentioned that the stricter requirements on reputation under the amendments to LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , should not have been applied to him retroactively . For the applicant , it was also wrong to apply the Code of Ethics to actions he had committed before becoming a trainee advocate . Lastly , he was also dissatisfied by how his case had been handled by ORG , relying on LAW . He argued that all such considerations meant his case merited review by ORG because the uniform interpretation of the law was at stake .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It restated its settled case - law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) that advocates and trainee advocates were part of the justice system , and were therefore not only bound by laws , but also had to protect the spirit of the law and the ideals of justice and lawfulness . Ignorance of requirements of laws discredited the advocate \u2019s profession and undermined its prestige . An advocate or trainee advocate who had breached imperative legal norms could not excuse that failing by alleging that he or she did not know the law or that the law was not sufficiently precise , because that person was bound to know the law and ethical requirements as part of his or her job . The activity of advocate was not only regulated by standards applicable to the general public , but also by special requirements set out in the laws regulating the advocate \u2019s profession and by professional ethics . The requirements for the applicant \u2019s behaviour , which were set out in the rules for professional ethics , were objectively necessary : only a person whose professional behaviour was beyond reproach could be entrusted to take part in the process of the implementation of justice . The notion of the implementation of justice would be discredited if any and every person was allowed to take part in that process , irrespective of his or her behaviour . The applicant \u2019s case therefore did not give grounds for cassation appeal because it followed established case - law and was not relevant for developing it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant attempted to submit another appeal on points of law . He drew ORG attention to ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE to expunge his conviction ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the appeal to be essentially identical to the earlier one and refused to admit it for examination ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
