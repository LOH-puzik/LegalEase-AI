ORG examined the factual context as alleged by the parties and the following medical evidence regarding the applicant : ( a ) the medical reports dated CARDINAL and DATE issued at ORG ; ( b ) the medical report dated DATE issued at ORG ; ( c ) the medical report dated DATE from ORG ; ( d ) the medical report dated DATE issued by a military doctor prior to his entry into military detention ; ( e ) the medical report dated DATE issued by ORG ; ( f ) the medical report dated DATE issued by a military doctor prior to his discharge from military detention ; ( g ) the applicant 's complete medical file from ORG ; ( h ) various scan results concerning the applicant 's cranium and neck dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE DATE ; ( i ) the medical report issued by ORG on DATE ; and ( j ) the opinions of LAW dated CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .

They further considered that the findings noted in the medical reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , concerning the applicant 's head and wrist injuries , were the type of wounds seen in the recovery phase . Finally , the ORG held that the findings of ORG regarding the applicant 's skin lesion and the haematuria found in his urine demonstrated that he had sustained a trauma and that this trauma could have been the result of a direct contact with a hard and blunt object , but it would not be possible medically to establish the exact time of this trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court , relying on the evidence in the case file , acquitted the police officers of the offences with which they had been charged . It held that the findings indicated in the medical reports were consistent with the accused officers ' contention , backed up by witnesses , that the applicant had banged his head and hands against the bars of his cell . In this connection , the court dismissed the applicant 's parents ' testimony as unreliable due to their kinship with the applicant and to the fact that it was not likely that police officers would commit a serious crime like torture in front of first - degree relatives . Moreover , as to the other symptoms recorded in the medical report of DATE , the court noted , firstly , that the applicant had been medically examined on DATE and that no such findings were recorded . Secondly , it noted that the haematuria had been found in the applicant 's urine DATE after he had been transferred to the army . Finally , it took into account that it was not possible to pinpoint the date when the applicant had suffered the trauma which led to haematuria . It therefore considered that this trauma could have occurred after the end of the applicant 's detention . Taking into account the principle \u201c in dubio pro reo \u201d , the court considered that the evidence in the case file did not suffice to convict the accused police officers of torture .", "CARDINAL .
