On DATE the applicant was notified by ORG that a criminal investigation had been opened against him on suspicion of fraud committed in an organised group ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It was suspected that from DATE until DATE the applicant and his accomplices , using companies founded or acquired for the purpose , had bought large amounts of fish from unspecified persons without paying value added tax ( VAT ) , forged payment documents to show that the applicable ORG had been paid , and then sold the fish to another company for a price that included the applicable VAT \u2013 thus appropriating an amount equal to the said applicable VAT . It was suspected that in this manner the applicant and his accomplices had appropriated CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) , which should have been paid into the ORG budget as LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was prohibited from going abroad or leaving his home without the approval of the investigating authorities ( kardomoji priemon\u0117 DATE ra\u0161ytinis pasi\u017ead\u0117jimas nei\u0161vykti ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant and his accomplices . The applicant was charged with several counts of fraud and forgery of documents committed in an organised group ( under LAW , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW ) . The indictment noted that the applicant had admitted his guilt and cooperated with the investigative authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of all charges and ordered him to pay a fine of LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly amended the judgment of the regional court . It acquitted the applicant of fraud but upheld his conviction for forgery of documents and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment . The sentence was suspended for DATE , during which time an injunction ( \u012fpareigojimas ) was imposed on the applicant : he was prohibited from leaving his home for DATE in a row without the approval of the supervising institution ( hereinafter , \u201c the sentence for forgery \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant began complying with the injunction imposed on him by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly amended the judgment of ORG . It quashed the applicant \u2019s acquittal of fraud and returned that part of the case for re - examination by ORG . The remaining of the appellate court \u2019s judgment was upheld .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after re - examining the above - mentioned part of the case , convicted the applicant of fraud . When determining the sentence , the court took into account various aggravating circumstances ( the crime had been well organised , the applicant had played a leading role in its commission , and the value of the appropriated property had been high ) , as well as mitigating circumstances ( the applicant had admitted his guilt , he had a family and a job , and he had been complying with the injunction previously imposed on him ) . As a result , ORG sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for DATE and DATE a sentence which was close to the minimum sentence stipulated in LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The court combined this sentence with the CARDINAL previously imposed on the applicant for forgery of documents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and ordered a consolidated sentence ( subendrinta bausm\u0117 ) for the QUANTITY crimes \u2013 imprisonment of DATE and DATE . ORG stated that because the crime of fraud was serious ( sunkus nusikaltimas ) , the consolidated sentence could not be suspended ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a cassation appeal to ORG . He asked the court to quash the sentence of imprisonment for the crime of fraud ordered by ORG and instead restore the fine imposed by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delayed the execution of ORG judgment of DATE until the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal was examined . ORG decision did not explicitly indicate whether the applicant had to continue complying with the injunction imposed on him during the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Nonetheless , during the period of the delay the applicant continued complying with the injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal . It found that when determining the sentence ORG had correctly assessed the gravity of the crime , the applicant \u2019s personality , and all relevant mitigating and aggravating circumstances . It also reiterated that LAW excluded the possibility of suspending the sentence in the event that the individual concerned had been convicted of a serious crime , such as fraud . However , ORG partly amended ORG judgment of DATE by applying the terms of a DATE law on amnesty and reducing the applicant \u2019s sentence of imprisonment by CARDINAL . Thus , the applicant \u2019s final consolidated sentence was DATE and DATE of imprisonment ( hereinafter , \u201c the consolidated sentence \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . After ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant began complying with the injunction imposed on him during the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery . The applicant was not allowed to leave his home for DATE without the approval of the supervising institution . He was also obliged to report to the local prison department DATE , which he did from DATE until DATE . At the applicant \u2019s request , on DATE the local prison department issued a certificate stating that he had been complying with the injunction and that the term of suspension of his sentence for forgery would end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted a request to ORG to be released from serving the consolidated sentence . The applicant stated that he had nearly completed serving the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery by complying with the injunction imposed by ORG . According to the applicant , given that the sentence for forgery ( DATE of imprisonment ) was longer than the consolidated sentence ( DATE and DATE of imprisonment ) and given that he had served the former , he should be released from serving the latter ; otherwise he would have to serve CARDINAL sentences for CARDINAL crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . The court reiterated that the applicant had been convicted of CARDINAL crimes \u2013 one of which ( fraud ) was serious and the other ( forgery of documents ) less serious ( apysunkis ) DATE and LAW did not permit the suspension of a sentence for a serious crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the regional court \u2019s judgment . The court firstly found that the applicant had not yet finished serving the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery : the completion of the term had to be confirmed by a decision of the relevant district court , but no such decision had been adopted as at that date ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG further held that the imposition of an injunction during the term of suspension of a sentence ( \u012fpareigojimai , paskirti nuosprend\u017eio vykdymo atid\u0117jimo metu ) did not amount to the serving of that sentence ( bausm\u0117s atlikimas ) ; therefore , the applicant had not actually served his sentence for forgery , so the question of \u201c double punishment \u201d did not arise . The fact that he had been complying with the injunction was relevant only during the determination of the final consolidated sentence , and that had been done by ORG .", "The judgment was final and not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant submitted a request to ORG , asking it to confirm that he had completed the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery . On DATE the court refused to examine the applicant \u2019s request because , under domestic law , a request for the term of suspension of a sentence to be declared completed could only be submitted by the supervising institution and not by the convicted person ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court stated that that the applicant had been prohibited from leaving his home since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , so during the entire time he had been complying with that restrictive measure and not with the injunction relating to the suspended sentence . The court further held that ORG judgment of DATE had annulled the suspension of the sentence for forgery , but that the domestic law did not provide for the possibility to release a convicted person from the obligation to serve a sentence due to the fact that he or she had been complying with an injunction which had subsequently been annulled .", "The judgment was final and not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Around the same time the applicant submitted a request to ORG , asking it to order the local prison department to request a district court to affirm that the applicant had completed the term of suspension of the sentence for forgery ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG held that it did not have the competence to examine the applicant \u2019s request because that request only related to matters of criminal sentencing and not acts of public administration . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the lower court on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant began serving the consolidated sentence in ORG . After serving CARDINAL of the sentence , on DATE he was released on probation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
