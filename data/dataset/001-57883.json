At the material time he was a lieutenant - colonel in the NORP army .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE he was arrested and held in pre - trial detention on a charge of founding and leading a terrorist organisation , which is an offence under LAW ; he was suspected of being one of the founders and leaders of the \" FP CARDINAL de Abril \" ( Popular Forces DATE ) , a group that had claimed responsibility for several bomb outrages , armed attacks and murders .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the judge of ORG ( tribunal de instru\u00e7\u00e3o criminal ) to whom the case had been assigned closed the adversarial investigation and sent the file to the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor delivered his charges ( acusa\u00e7\u00e3o ) . He accused the applicant and several of his co- defendants of having drawn up a comprehensive plan under which , by means of the \" FP CARDINAL de Abril \" , they would seize power by force and overthrow the ORG \u2019s institutions . He emphasised that Mr PERSON was one of the instigators of the scheme .", "CARDINAL . ORG In accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE on the administration of justice , section CARDINAL of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the file was sent , together with the prosecution \u2019s submissions , to ORG ( tribunal criminal ) so that the judge responsible for the case , Mr PERSON , could issue the despacho de pron\u00fancia or de n\u00e3o pron\u00fancia .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr PERSON issued a despacho de pron\u00fancia . After noting that there had been no irregularities during the judicial investigation or any other impediment to a trial of the merits , he rejected the prosecution \u2019s charges in respect of CARDINAL of the co - defendants on the ground that the evidence gathered was not sufficient to enable a reliable assessment to be made of the probability of guilt ( \" a prova indici\u00e1ria recolhida ... \u00e9 insuficiente para ... permitir a formula\u00e7\u00e3o de um s\u00e9rio juizo de probabilidade sobre a sua culpabilidade \" ) . On the other hand , he accepted the charges relating to Mr PERSON and CARDINAL other defendants and decided to keep all but CARDINAL of them in pre - trial detention .", "The applicant did not appeal against the despacho under LAW procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The trial began on DATE before ORG of ORG , which was composed of CARDINAL judges and was presided over by PERSON . The proceedings took up CARDINAL sittings of the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing on DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG challenging the compatibility of the provisions cited earlier ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) which empowered one and the same judge both to issue the despacho de pron\u00fancia and to try the case with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "He argued that in making such an order , the judge formed a view of an accused \u2019s guilt in advance that was likely to influence him when giving judgment on the merits .", "On DATE , ORG held the appeal to be admissible and decided to refer it to the higher court together with any appeal against the judgment it would itself be delivering .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG held that the applicant was a leading member of the \" FP CARDINAL de Abril \" but not one of their founders and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 military imprisonment ( pres\u00eddio militar ) , of which DATE , DATE and DATE were immediately remitted under an amnesty . It acquitted QUANTITY of his co - defendants and sentenced the others and Mr PERSON jointly and severally to pay the ORG MONEY escudos .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG ( tribunal de rela\u00e7\u00e3o ) dismissed appeals by the prosecution and CARDINAL of the defendants , including Mr PERSON .", "Unlike ORG , it held that the applicant was also one of the founders of the \" FP CARDINAL de Abril \" . It consequently increased the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 military imprisonment , DATE and DATE of which were immediately remitted under the amnesty . The court upheld the sum to be paid .", "CARDINAL . ORG As regards the complaint based on LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court pointed out that the drafting history showed that the purpose of section CARDINAL of the aforementioned Law no . CARDINAL was precisely to ensure that investigating judges did not give rulings on the offences into which they had to inquire ; that was why the legislature had vested in the trial judge and not the investigating judge the power to issue the despacho de pron\u00fancia , which entailed assessing and classifying the offences charged .", "CARDINAL . ORG An appeal by Mr PERSON to ORG ( Supremo Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a ) was dismissed on DATE . Referring to its case - law , the court held that the provisions complained of by the applicant were not incompatible with Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the LAW ; a judge issuing a despacho de pron\u00fancia was not bound by the view taken at that stage of the proceedings and had complete freedom when giving judgment on the merits , so that his impartiality was in no way jeopardised .", "On the other hand the court held that the applicant was only a leader of the \" FP CARDINAL de Abril \" and accordingly reduced the sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG Finally , the applicant applied to ORG constitucional ) . Reiterating the submissions he had made in the other courts , he argued in particular that the despacho de pron\u00fancia was the key decision in the prosecution . The fact that it was taken by a judge who subsequently sat on the trial court violated Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the LAW , which established an absolute separation between judicial investigation , prosecution and trial ; it also , he submitted , undermined the court \u2019s impartiality , as the judge in question would be prejudiced against the defendant when he came to consider the merits .", "CARDINAL . ORG In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG emphasised the need to distinguish between the indictment , which was the responsibility of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , and the despacho de pron\u00fancia . The latter was designed solely to verify the probability of guilt in order to avoid a trial where there was no prima facie evidence . It was thus a decision on the viability of the indictment and did not entail any prejudice on the part of the judge when the merits were being considered . It consequently served as a filter and a safeguard . Even if his legal classification of the facts was different , a judge did not act as a prosecutor . In the instant case PERSON could not be accused of partiality merely because he had issued the despacho de pron\u00fancia . It would have been different if in his decision he had gone beyond the scope of the prosecution \u2019s charges and had made substantial alterations to them . In that case , which was not the one before it , the distinction between the indictment and the despacho de pron\u00fancia would have been lost as the judge would have encroached on the prerogatives of the public prosecutor .", "ORG did , however , allow the appeal on another ground , not adduced before ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , which related to a lack of reasons in the judgment at first instance . It accordingly remitted the case to ORG for the appropriate steps to be taken .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the prosecution sought clarification of certain passages in the judgment and applied for rectification of clerical errors in it . On DATE ORG ordered the rectifications , allowed CARDINAL item in the application for clarification and provided the particulars sought .", "CARDINAL . ORG On its rehearing of the case on CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to that court for a fresh assessment of the facts .", "The applicant was provisionally released that DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG delivered a new judgment ; the prosecution and several defendants , including the applicant , appealed against it on points of law to ORG .", "On DATE ORG allowed the appeals in part and varied the impugned decision accordingly .", "Mr PERSON and CARDINAL of the co - defendants appealed to ORG against ORG judgment .
