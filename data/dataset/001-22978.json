SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE and living outside GPE . She is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as described by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant lives under orderly social conditions . She is the mother of CARDINAL children , her son P. , born in DATE , and CARDINAL daughters , born respectively in DATE , DATE and DATE . After separating from their father Mr B. in DATE , she has been the sole holder of the custody and has assumed the DATE care of all CARDINAL children . However , the applicant has had several problems with her son PERSON , who since an early age has been hyperactive and unable to concentrate , combined with aggressive behaviour . Her application under the Convention concerns certain public care measures taken with respect to him by the NORP social authorities .", "According to the applicant , her ex - husband had alcohol problems and physically abused both herself and P. In DATE he was convicted of having assaulted her in DATE . For the same reason he was banned from visiting the family for DATE from DATE to DATE .", "In connection with her separation from PERSON in DATE , the applicant contacted the mental welfare services for children and young people ( the so - called \u201c PBU \u201d ) , as she had difficulties in managing PERSON and wished assistance in dealing with the impending separation . PERSON was examined by a psychologist , who observed , inter alia , that the boy was unsure of his identity and scared by his own aggressiveness and that disaster and chaos were dominant features of his world . No indication of neurological disabilities was detected then . Since PERSON was found to need to be in a small group of children , he was placed in a special pre - school , named PERSON , in DATE .", "In DATE , ORG received a report from ORG , stating that PERSON was not feeling well . The applicant was described as having great difficulty in setting limits for him . PERSON was said to function relatively well at pre - school , where activities were structured and the staffing ratio was relatively high . The report also said that PERSON constantly hit his mother . As the staff understood the situation , PERSON and his mother were engaged in a power struggle . They had also noticed that the conflicts between the parents had an adverse effect on P. On CARDINAL recent occasions , P. had had bloody scratch - marks in his face , which his mother had stated that she had caused . She had informed the staff that P. had told her that he wanted to die in order to make her sad . She had seen him sitting with the point of a sheath knife turned towards him .", "In the light of this report , the social welfare office made an investigation , which resulted in the applicant and her ( then ) CARDINAL children being admitted in DATE to the child psychiatry clinic at ORG , where they stayed for DATE . There she received assistance in setting limits and improving routines . The staff had no impression that P. might be suffering from any neurological disabilities . To begin with , the family \u2019s situation had slightly improved after the stay at the clinic . The social welfare office was in regular contact with the applicant . During DATE , the situation began to deteriorate again . The applicant was offered assistance in the form of a stay at a treatment centre . She , however , declined this offer . She told the social welfare officers that at present she was in no need of having contact with the social services other than in connection with the follow - up meetings at ORG pre - school . In DATE she concluded her after - care contact with the clinic at ORG and shortly afterwards she also discontinued her dialogue contact with \u201c FAC \u201d .", "At or around the same time , in accordance with the applicant \u2019s wishes , the social services appointed the children \u2019s paternal aunt and uncle as contact family in order to provide some relief to the applicant .", "In DATE PERSON submitted a second report to ORG stating that PERSON had recently had great problems at the pre - school and , as they understood it , at home as well . The mother was unable to calm him down , they quarrelled and she slapped him . He had a very negative self - image and often spoke of himself in disparaging terms . On DATE , a serious incident had occurred . Together with a younger child PERSON had run away from the pre - school across the road in the direction of the railway track . CARDINAL teachers had run after them and had shouted to them to stop . While the other child obeyed , P. jumped down onto the track . After being dragged away from the track by CARDINAL of the teachers , he was brought back to the pre - school . DATE , when the teachers tried to explain the danger of the trains to P. , he had replied that he wished to die .", "On learning about the above incident , the applicant sought assistance at the child psychiatry clinic at FAC , where she and the children were kept for observation from DATE . According to relevant medical records , PERSON was particularly sad , had several times expressed that he wished to die and had stated that he wished to hurt his mother and sister . His mother was very tired and lacked the necessary strength to support him during these periods of melancholy . Conflicts often blow up between them . The mother was not only worried about PERSON but also about his sister . Following a meeting involving the applicant , a social welfare officer and doctors , it was found necessary to investigate her ability to assume the care of the children and what kind of support and assistance they needed .", "On DATE , with the applicant \u2019s approval , she and the children were placed at Triaden , an emergency care and investigation centre . According to the relevant report , P. had recurrent outbreaks of aggression and staff had to mediate between him and his mother and also to physically protect her . In these situations , P. was in a state of great anxiety and the mother expressed that she was afraid of him . On some occasions she escaped by shutting herself up in her room . There were few occasions when she listened to P. and comforted him in order to make him feel safe . She often raised matters in his presence that made him feel anxious and often pushed him away when he sought physical contact with her . When she allowed him to get close to her , he would variably hug her , pull her hair or scratch her face . P. sometimes hit his sister hard and she hit him back . The mother was not capable of separating them and preventing them from hurting each other . P. had said to his mother that she could kill him if she wished and had also threatened to kill his sister , who became so scared that she could not sleep .", "A psychologist found , inter alia , that P \u2019s feelings towards his mother were characterised by great ambivalence , combining a yearning for closeness , a need for control and fierce aggressiveness . It was probably necessary that other adults create structure and set limits in order for him and his mother to have a good time with each other . It was evident that he needed considerable adult support , to be in a well - defined and structured environment with clear requirements and limits being set , where he could feel that he had a certain degree of control . He also needed assistance in his relationship with his mother , both as regards closeness and emancipation . It was also recommended that P. undergo neuropsychiatric examination and suggested that care at a treatment centre could provide him with both structure , limits and emotional understanding and at the same time assist his mother in establishing a good relationship with him .", "After DATE at Triaden , the competent staff of the centre found that , because of the destructive conflicts between the applicant and P. and her inability to see to his needs , it had become untenable to keep them both there . They suggested that he receive care outside his home , preferably at a residential treatment centre . The applicant expressed a wish that he receive independent assistance outside the family as she too realised that she was unable to provide him with appropriate care . She was advised that placement at a centre would normally DATE . On DATE , with the applicant \u2019s consent and in consultation with the social services , the boy was placed in an emergency family home ( jourhem ) not far from the applicant \u2019s home .", "In DATE access arrangements were agreed on , according to which P. was to spend DATE in the applicant \u2019s home , in addition to visits by the applicant in the emergency family home DATE .", "Since the applicant appeared to have a preference for placement of P. in a foster home rather than in an institution and since the foster home placement seemed to function well , the authorities agreed that this was the best alternative .", "As there were long waiting lists for a neuropsychiatric examination , the social services engaged a psychologist who , at DATE , performed a neuropsychological examination , a so - called PERSON - test , on P. In a report of CARDINAL DATE the psychologist concluded that the test profile revealed characteristics of so - called Deficits in Attention , Motor control and ORG DAMP \u201d ) and that immediate assistance to address ORG \u2019s special needs was called for .", "In DATE , after an unsuccessful attempt by the applicant to have Mr B. \u2019s prohibition on visits extended , the contact between PERSON and his father was resumed . In accordance with the applicant \u2019s wishes , they were to see each other in the presence of P. \u2019s aunt and uncle . In DATE , she stated that she no longer wished to keep them as contact family as they were not impartial . Instead , P. \u2019s father was to see PERSON in the emergency family home . Around the same time she told PERSON ( the \u201c emergency family home mother \u201d ) that , contrary to her agreement with the social services , she would bring PERSON home DATE instead of DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant told the social services that she wanted P. to return home . This was followed by discussion in the course of the spring , at meeting organised by the social welfare office and involving the persons implicated . In DATE , the applicant appointed a personal representative to handle her contacts with the social services , since she no longer wished to meet the social welfare officers .", "On DATE the applicant declared that she no longer consented to her son \u2019s emergency home placement .", "On DATE ORG decided , under section CARDINAL of the Act with Special Provisions on ORG ( lag ( CARDINAL ) med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga ; hereinafter \u201d the DATE LAW ) , immediately to take ORG into public care on a provisional basis . ORG confirmed the decision on DATE .", "ORG then carried out an investigation . In its report of DATE it observed that P. needed to be in an environment that was clearly structured , with well - defined requirements and limits and with adults who could give him support . P. had become calmer during his stay in the emergency family home , where he was functioning well with more clearly defined limits , greater security and support . The applicant had tried to the best of her ability to cope with her role as a parent and had endeavoured to find ways of meeting ORG needs . Unfortunately , her efforts had not sufficed to provide P. with an environment in which he could grow up and develop positively . The problems inherent in the relationship between them manifested themselves clearly during PERSON \u2019s stay in the emergency family home . There was a palpable risk that his health and development would be impaired as a result of deficiencies in the care in his home environment . Irrespective of the cause or causes of P. \u2019s problems \u2013 a neurological disability , abuse on the part of his father or the applicant \u2019s lack of capacity to take care of him DATE it was clear that there were very substantial problems in the mother - child relationship . Both reports from GPE concerned the applicant \u2019s problems in dealing with P. , as did the investigation by PERSON . The support and assistance the applicant had received in her role as parent had not brought any lasting improvement . There was no time to spare for meeting ORG care needs . Those needs would best be satisfied by placing him in a family home after his stay in the emergency family home .", "On DATE ORG applied to ORG for the taking into care of P. on a permanent basis in accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing during which the applicant , P. \u2019s counsel , representatives of ORG as well as witnesses for each party were heard .", "The applicant opposed ORG application , disputing that there were deficiencies in her care and that any of the other conditions in section DATE Act had been fulfilled . In her submission , the problem in issue was of medical and psychiatric character and she would consent to appropriate treatment of these problems .", "Moreover , the court \u2019s case file included certain reports from ORG , the emergency foster home and from an investigation concerning PERSON conducted on DATE by a child emergency care home . The latter stated , inter alia , that P. had difficulties in controlling his aggressiveness and in showing his feelings .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG granted the application and issued a care order concerning PERSON court found that the applicant and her son had a destructive emotional relationship to one another and that she had difficulties in setting limits to her son \u2019s behaviour . In the court \u2019s opinion there was nothing that proved the applicant \u2019s allegation that P. suffered from GPE . The court held that , whatever the possible causes to the problems between mother and son , those problems had lasted for a very long period . Already when PERSON was a baby , the applicant had had contacts with the child welfare services and , in DATE , with a psychology centre for children and young persons . In spite of substantial assistance provided by ORG under a voluntary care arrangement , there had been no improvement in the relationship between mother and son . It is therefore obvious that the mother was unable to provide him with the secure and stable environment he needed . She still was unable to see to his needs for care . Accordingly , there had been a serious deficiency in the mother \u2019s care for her son . The court concluded that the shortcoming in the applicant \u2019s care constituted a clear risk of impairment to her son \u2019s health and development .", "On DATE a paediatrician diagnosed P. as suffering , to a moderate degree , from ORG ( \u201c ADHD \u201d ) resulting in hyperactivity and inability to concentrate . In her report the paediatrician stated , inter alia , that P. was in need of a structured and calm environment and of assistance in solving conflicts caused by his hyperactivity and concentration disorder . The paediatrician further pointed out that it was important that P. \u2019s carer receive psychological support .", "The above decision did not alter the access arrangements agreed on in DATE , which apparently continued to apply .", "The applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG , which on DATE held a further hearing in the case . The applicant adduced the paediatrician report and the court heard , at the applicant \u2019s request , oral evidence from the applicant \u2019s father . According to the social welfare officer , it had not yet been possible to find a foster family for P. other than the emergency family home . He therefore remained in the latter home , where Ms E. received assistance from the social services and from a family inspector .", "On DATE ORG upheld , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , the lower court \u2019s judgment . In its reasoning the majority stated as follows :", "\u201c The circumstances adduced by the applicant and what has further emerged in the case do not give reasons to modify ORG judgment . \u201d", "The minority stated :", "\u201c The applicant has several times both initiated and contributed to the taking of voluntary care measures with respect to P. In our opinion P. \u2019s need for care can be provided for on a voluntary basis . The application for taking P. into public care should therefore be dismissed . ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "Following the above proceedings , the emergency family home became ORG \u2019s foster home .", "On DATE , the applicant again turned to ORG requesting , firstly , to be reunited with PERSON or , in the alternative , that he be placed at GPE , a special home for care and residence . ORG rejected her first claim but agreed to prepare for his placement at the said institution , which took place on DATE .", "After carrying out an investigation in DATE , the social welfare office found that the applicant \u2019s relationship with P. had improved . It was observed that he spent DATE - and with his mother , every other DATE with his father , and that the applicant participated actively in the treatment of P. at GPE . She came TIME per week to put him to bed . Every other week she consulted a family therapist . In the light of the improvements noted , the office recommended that the care order be lifted and that care be provided at Heimdalsg\u00e5rden on a voluntary basis under a care plan . On DATE the applicant agreed .", "On DATE ORG decided that the care order should be terminated , on the ground that there was no longer any need for maintaining the public care order with respect to ORG , moreover , decided to place P. in voluntary care in a specialised children \u2019s home where he could receive treatment of his ORG problems .", "In the light of the above , ORG decided on DATE to remove the case from its list of cases .", "During DATE , a plan for returning PERSON to the applicant \u2019s home was initiated , but was suspended after he had confessed to the police that he committed arson on a sports centre during DATE .", "During DATE he had a violent outbreak of aggression , whereupon he was returned to GPE for treatment .", "On DATE PERSON returned to live in the applicant \u2019s home and has been reunited with her since .", "Care pursuant to the DATE Act shall be provided for a young person DATE if one of the conditions referred to in sections CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Act is satisfied and if it appears that the necessary care can not be given to the young person with the consent of the person having custody of him and , if the young person himself has reached DATE , with his own consent .", "Under LAW care shall be provided if there is a \u201c palpable risk \u201d ( p\u00e5taglig risk ) of impairment of the health or development of the young person due to ill - treatment , exploitation , lack of care or any other condition in the home .", "According to the preparatory works to LAW , the expression \u201c palpable risk \u201d was intended to indicate the degree of risk which would justify a compulsory care order . A subjective assumption that a young person is in danger was not enough and irrelevant circumstances such as public order could not be the basis of a care order . There had to be concrete or apparent circumstances supporting the fact that there was a risk for the young person \u2019s physical or mental health ( cf . Government PERSON , pp . DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of the DATE ORG may order the immediate taking into care of a young person ( \u201c provisional care order \u201d ) if it is probable that he or she needs to be provided with care under this LAW and a court decision on the matter can not be awaited owing to the risk to the young person \u2019s health or development or because the continuing inquiry can be seriously impeded or further measures prevented . Such a decision by ORG is subject to confirmation by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
