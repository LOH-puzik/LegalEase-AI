The applicant is a NORP national of NORP origin . He was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE . On an unknown date he entered GPE from GPE , where he had arrived also on an unknown date . On DATE he sought asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request on the basis of the fact that his fingerprints had already been registered in ORG , in GPE , on DATE , and in GPE , on DATE . Furthermore , the NORP authorities had accepted the NORP authorities\u2019 request of DATE to take the applicant back into their territory by virtue of LAW no . MONEY ( the \u201c FAC \u201d ) . The ORG further ruled that the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL sisters , who were living in GPE respectively since DATE and DATE , did not fall under the category of \u201c family members \u201d as provided in LAW . Regarding the back problems alleged by the applicant , it considered that GPE was obliged to grant him access to medical treatment and that nothing indicated that those health problems impeded the transfer of the applicant to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG ( the \u201c FAC \u201d ) . He maintained that he had fled his home country GPE because he had been persecuted , detained and tortured there . As established by medical certificates , he had been diagnosed with severe post - traumatic stress disorder , for which he was receiving medical treatment . He was also receiving medical treatment for his back problems . He claimed that the ORG \u2019s decision was in breach of LAW of LAW because GPE was the first member ORG he had entered DATE before . Thus it was the NORP authorities which were theoretically responsible for examining his asylum request . It could not , however , be derived from the fact that he could not be returned to GPE as established in GPE v. GPE and GPE ( [ ORG ] no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) that GPE could return him to GPE . Therefore , the NORP authorities\u2019 request for his return to GPE was in breach of the law because they had known that the NORP authorities were not competent in that matter , and GPE had erroneously accepted the request . According to the applicant , the ORG \u2019s decision also violated LAW which provided that persons who were dependent on relatives who were residing in a member ORG should be kept together with them . In this regard he established that CARDINAL of his older sisters were legally residing in GPE with their families . He claimed that owing to the presence of his sisters he had regained a certain emotional stability in his life . His expulsion to GPE , where he had no family member to care for him , would therefore aggravate his mental health problems in such a way that he would be at risk of irreparable harm contrary to ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It ruled that according to ORG the applicant had to return to GPE , whose authorities had , prior to accepting the NORP request for return , been informed by GPE that the applicant had first entered the \u201c GPE area \u201d in GPE . Furthermore , the FAC considered that in view of the dates of arrival in the respective countries it could not be excluded that on leaving GPE the applicant had left the \u201c GPE area \u201d before entering GPE . Furthermore , it established that the applicant was not so severely ill that he was dependent on the assistance of his sisters . Therefore , LAW was not applicable in his case and neither was LAW . Moreover , the FAC held that with regard to the asylum procedure and the availability of medical treatment for asylum seekers it had not been established that there were structural deficiencies in the NORP reception system and that GPE failed to respect its international obligations in respect of asylum seekers and refugees . Therefore , nothing indicated that the applicant would suffer treatment contrary to LAW in the event of expulsion to GPE . Finally , the ORG stated that it was up to the NORP authorities to inform their NORP counterparts about the applicant \u2019s health problems when they were executing the expulsion .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before this Court the applicant produced in particular a medical report dated DATE establishing that , as a result of trauma allegedly suffered in detention in GPE , he had back problems and showed severe symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder . As a result , the applicant was put on a course of twice DATE psychotherapy sessions with a general practitioner and was prescribeda DATE dose of ORG , an anti - depressant , as well as sleeping pills ( ORG ) and pain - killers for his back ( Tilur ) .", "The report also stated that in the absence of medical treatment the applicant \u2019s health status would deteriorate quickly and put him at a high risk of alcohol or drug abuse as well as suicide . The risk of suicide would be greater should the applicant be returned to his country of origin .", "Moreover , according to the report , the involvment of the applicant \u2019s sisters was \u201c an absolute necessity \u201d ( absolument n\u00e9cessaire ) for him to gain some emotional stability in order to overcome the multiple traumas suffered .", "Upon the recommendation of his doctor , the applicant was allocated an individual apartment unit for asylum seekers . The applicant also submitted his ORG declarations , according to which he was virtually spending the whole time with their families , he was in great emotional need , could not be left alone and spent DATE alone in his apartment . They added that they were willing and able to provide him with emotional support so that he could recover from his trauma ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
