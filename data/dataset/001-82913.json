On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking committed as part of an organised crime group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody , relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question . It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , given the risk that he might tamper with evidence or induce witnesses to give false testimony . The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal against the detention order , likewise his further appeals against some of the decisions extending his detention and his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful . In his applications and appeals he relied , inter alia , on his personal circumstances , in particular a difficult family situation in that a family break - up was imminent . He also argued that his confessions to offences of which he was suspected had not been taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , the applicant 's detention was extended on several occasions , namely on an unknown date , on DATE ( to DATE ) , DATE ( to DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( to DATE ) , DATE ( to DATE ) , an unknown subsequent date , and DATE ( to DATE ) . In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on a strong suspicion , supported by evidence from witnesses , that the applicant had committed the offences in question . They attached importance to the seriousness of those offences and to the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant . These facts gave rise to the courts ' assumption that the applicant , if released , might obstruct the proper course of the proceedings , especially given the fact that some of the suspects were still at large .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with drug trafficking and membership of an organised crime group . There were CARDINAL defendants in the case , all charged with numerous counts of drug trafficking committed as an organised crime group .", "CARDINAL .

During the court proceedings the courts further extended the applicant 's pre - trial detention , namely on DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) , CARDINAL unknown subsequent dates , DATE ( to CARDINAL DATE ) and DATE ( to DATE ) . The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant 's continued detention . They relied especially on the complexity of the case and the large number of coaccused .", "CARDINAL .
