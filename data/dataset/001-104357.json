The applicant is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant went to the home of CARDINAL PERSON and demanded that she give him an obituary card of her sister who had recently died . On being met with a refusal , he forced his way into PERSON home , causing her to fall , and hit her over the head several times . He then made his way over to the sideboard , where he had noticed a stack of documents ; of these , he took DATE a magazine and some giro form stubs DATE before leaving .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the subsequent criminal proceedings it emerged that the applicant was a pathological collector of devotional obituary cards for the recently deceased . Whenever possible DATE on the applicant 's own admission , whenever he was not detained under civil or criminal law \u2013 the applicant would gatecrash funerals in the GPE area . He had met PERSON at her sister 's funeral , from which he had been turned away by the undertaker . At the time of his visit to PERSON home , he had been under the mistaken impression that he had propitiated PERSON by sending her a blessed candle beforehand .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken into police custody DATE on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence . He remained in pre - trial detention pending the criminal proceedings that were subsequently brought against him and the order for his pre - trial detention was duly prolonged .", "CARDINAL . Examinations of the applicant 's mental state by CARDINAL psychiatrists and a psychologist showed that the applicant was , at the time of the crime , suffering from a mental impairment . The report of the psychiatrists diagnosed it as \u201c a paranoid form of schizophrenia in which autistiform characteristics are unusually prominent and ... an obsessive compulsive personality disorder \u201d . Both the psychiatrists ' report and that of the psychologist considered it very likely that the applicant would reoffend if given the chance . Both reports mentioned the applicant 's lack of awareness of his condition , which made him difficult to treat . They concurred in recommending that the applicant undergo compulsory treatment in a closed setting . In addition , a psychologist attached to a mental hospital where the applicant had been held previously , under ORG ( Wet bijzondere opnemingen in psychiatrische ziekenhuizen ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , gave evidence in open court to the effect that the applicant had absconded before and would resist \u201c all possible forms of interference in his personal life \u201d if he could .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal law section of ORG ( rechtbank ) , following adversarial proceedings , convicted the applicant of theft preceded by violence and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . Having found that the applicant was able to understand the unlawful nature of his acts but that on account of the limited development of his mental faculties he could only be held responsible for this offence to a limited degree whereas there was considerable danger of his reoffending , it further imposed a ORG order with confinement in a custodial clinic ( terbeschikkingstelling met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege ; \u201c ORG order \u201d ) . Referring to LAW ) , it further ordered the termination of the applicant 's pre - trial detention as from the moment on which the duration of the pre - trial detention would be equal to the prison sentence imposed . Both the prosecution and the applicant appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer further applied to ORG for the applicant 's immediate release from pre - trial detention on the ground DATE as the applicant had already served the sentence imposed with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention DATE there was no legal basis for his further detention . The prosecution opposed this application , arguing that LAW ruled out the termination of pre - trial detention in a case like the applicant 's where a prison sentence is combined with a ORG order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ' s - ORG held a hearing in camera and ordered the applicant 's immediate release . On DATE , at the request of the public prosecutor , the civil law section of ORG issued an interim admission order ( voorlopige machtiging ) within the meaning of LAW under the procedure set out in LAW . Consequently , after the applicant was released from pre - trial detention on DATE , he was compulsorily admitted to a psychiatric hospital in GPE under the judicial interim admission order . He stayed there until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was heard by the ' s - Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal , which on DATE issued a warrant for the applicant to be taken into pre - trial detention ( gevangenneming ) within the meaning of LAW of LAW . Pursuant to LAW , this order remained in force pending the total further duration of the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , the ' s - ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE on technical grounds , convicted the applicant of theft preceded by violence , sentenced him to DATE imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention and imposed a ORG order with confinement in a custodial clinic .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassation ) with ORG ( PERSON ) , which was dismissed on summary reasoning on DATE . Accordingly , the applicant 's ORG order took effect on DATE , replacing the pre - trial detention order of DATE as the legal basis for the applicant 's detention . However , the applicant was not directly transferred to a custodial clinic but was held in pre - placement detention until a suitable place would become available for him .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE , the Minister of Justice informed the applicant that , given the ORG 's conclusion in the case of Brand v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( PERSON GPE ) had found that financial compensation was appropriate in all cases where pre - placement detention after the end of a prison sentence had exceeded DATE . Starting on DATE , this compensation amounted to QUANTITY ( ORG ) per month and this amount was to be increased by LAW every further trimester . The applicant was further informed that the total amount of compensation would be calculated and paid once he had been admitted to a custodial clinic . The applicant was invited to confirm within DATE whether he wished to avail himself of this compensation offer . This letter has remained unanswered by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to a custodial clinic . On DATE , he was informed by the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) that , as his pre - placement detention had exceeded DATE on CARDINAL DATE , he was offered compensation in a total amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the time spent in pre - placement detention DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's parents informed the Minister of Justice \u2013 in reply to the letter of CARDINAL DATE that they disagreed with the manner of calculation and the amount of compensation . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG replied that there were no reasons for her to reconsider her position in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's representatives informed the ORG that the applicant 's ORG order had been extended by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The statutory rules governing pre - trial detention are set out in ORG CARDINAL of LAW . An order for pre - trial detention can only be issued against persons suspected of an offence carrying a maximum prison sentence of DATE or more or certain other specific criminal acts ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A pre - trial detention order issued by ORG remains in force for DATE after the final judgment ( einduitspraak ) at that instance has been given ( LAW ) . The public prosecutor may file , within DATE after DATE first - instance court , a request for the prolongation of the pre - trial detention order by DATE with the appeal court , which will determine that request . Pre - trial detention between a final judgment of a first - instance court against which an appeal has been filed , and the first hearing on that appeal , is limited to a maximum of DATE ( Article QUANTITY of LAW ) . If , however , the total duration of the detention on remand becomes equal to the prison sentence imposed , the highest competent trial court shall lift the remand order ( LAW ) unless \u2013 in addition to a prison sentence \u2013 a measure entailing deprivation of liberty ( such as , for instance , a ORG order ) has been imposed ( LAW ) . A more detailed overview of the relevant domestic law and practice on pre - trial detention is given in PERSON v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the public prosecutor or relatives of the person concerned ( LAW and LAW ) , ORG can DATE after having heard the person concerned ( Article CARDINAL) and after having considered a report by a psychiatrist who has examined the person concerned shortly before ( Article CARDINAL ) DATE issue an interim order for compulsory admission to a mental hospital . This order can only be issued where the judge finds that the person concerned is suffering from a mental disorder which gives rise to danger which can not be averted by the intervention of persons or institutions outside a mental hospital ( LAW ) . An interim order is immediately enforceable ( bij voorraad uitvoerbaar ) and valid for a maximum period of DATE , which period starts to run on DATE the order is given ( Article CARDINAL ) . At the request of the public prosecutor , ORG can prolong the validity of an interim order .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) enables courts , when dealing with certain serious crimes , to impose a ORG order on a defendant whose mental faculties were inadequately developed or pathologically disturbed at the time of the commission of the offence . If the safety of others or the general safety of persons or goods so requires , the court may further direct that such a person be confined to a custodial clinic in accordance with Article PERSON of LAW . A ORG order with confinement to a custodial clinic can be imposed in conjunction with a prison sentence if the convicted person 's responsibility was merely diminished at the time of the commission of the offence . In such a situation , the ORG order will take effect after the convicted person has served the prison sentence imposed . A ORG order can not take effect before the judgment concerned has become final ( Article MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . Pending admission to a custodial clinic , the person concerned is not released but held in pre - placement detention .", "CARDINAL . A ORG order with confinement to a custodial clinic is not intended to have a punitive effect , but to protect society from any risk posed by the person concerned and enable the latter 's re - socialisation . ORG , of which there were CARDINAL in the GPE at the material time , are top - security institutions as the persons placed there have been found to pose a great danger to society as well as to themselves . The treatment provided in a custodial clinic is geared to individual disorders and personalities . It is aimed at helping persons subject to a ORG order to gain insight into and control over their disorders , to make them aware of their responsibilities and to adjust their behaviour accordingly so that they no longer pose a threat to society .", "CARDINAL . According to Article PERSON of LAW , the ORG order is valid for an initial period of DATE which may be prolonged by the court , at the request of the public prosecutor , for a further period of CARDINAL or DATE . The period of placement can not be extended beyond a total of DATE unless the crime committed by the person concerned was a crime of violence committed against , or causing danger to , CARDINAL or more persons , or such further extension is necessary for the protection of other persons ( Article PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG [ National Jurisprudence Number ] , \u201c LJN \u201d ) ORG , the Provisional Measures Judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of Breda held the following :", "\u201c LAW on confinement to a custodial clinic of persons subject to a ORG order ( PERSON verpleging ter beschikking gestelden ) provides that a person in pre - placement detention shall be placed [ in an appropriate institution ] before the ORG order has run for DATE . ... In view of the judgments of ORG in the cases of Brand ( no . PERSON ) and PERSON ( no . MONEY ) and the decisions of ORG it may be assumed that a time lapse of DATE or more for persons subject to a ORG order is , in principle , wrongful in the light of LAW .", "...", "CARDINAL NORP The structural capacity shortage that has existed since DATE is not a special circumstance in the above - mentioned sense which would justify ( further ) delay in placing [ the plaintiff ] in a ORG clinic . This shortage must remain the responsibility of the Government . The fact that there are visible causes for the lack of capacity and that measures are being taken to reduce or alleviate this shortage does not make any difference in this regard .", "... \u201d", "The Provisional Measures Judge went on to order the plaintiff placed in a ORG clinic DATE after DATE ( the date on which the waiting period had started ) , that is to say by DATE , after which , if the order was not carried out , the plaintiff was to be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , ORG held that it was reasonable in principle that the order in which persons subject to a ORG order were placed in a custodial clinic should depend on their place on a waiting list unless , owing to special circumstances , they were unsuited to detention elsewhere . However , in the particular case the period of pre - placement detention was no longer in proportion to the length of time spent by the person concerned in the execution of his prison sentence . The ORG was therefore ordered to place the person concerned ( the defendant in appeal ) in a custodial clinic DATE , which time - limit was considered long enough for all practical objections ( including the lack of adequate facilities ) to have lost their force .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , the Provisional Measures Judge of ORG of ' s - Hertogenbosch on similar reasoning , the ORG was ordered to place the plaintiff in a custodial clinic by DATE , that is a time - limit of CARDINAL and a half months .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , the Provisional Measures Judge of ORG found that special circumstances obtained which justified ordering the plaintiff to be given priority placement in a custodial institution . The special circumstances consisted of his having been given a ORG order without a prior prison sentence and his being considered unsuited to detention in a penal rather than a clinical setting .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , ORG of The GPE found that the mental condition of the person concerned ( the appellant ) was serious , but not more so than that of others on the waiting list for placement in a custodial clinic , so that there was no justification for giving this person priority over others .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , ORG of GPE declined to order the plaintiff given priority over others on the waiting list absent special circumstances . In so doing ORG had regard to the efforts being made to create more places for persons subject to a ORG order with confinement in a custodial clinic and the fact , as stated by the defendant , that the plaintiff could expect to be placed in such an institution by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , ORG of The GPE found special circumstances justifying priority placement to exist in that the plaintiff had spent DATE in detention after serving a DATE prison sentence and in that CARDINAL custodial clinics existed that were capable of treating him . The defendant was ordered to place the plaintiff in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL clinics no later than DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE in civil proceedings on a compensation claim arising from a wrongful act on the part of the government ( onrechtmatige overheidsdaad ) , ORG ( PERSON ) held that pre - placement detention lasting longer than DATE was unlawful . In reaching this finding , ORG referred , inter alia , to the ORG 's judgments in the cases of ORG v. the GPE ( no .
