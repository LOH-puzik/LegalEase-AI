GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application , he was detained in FAC . He was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG authorised criminal investigations against CARDINAL other persons ( not including the applicant ) to be conducted by CARDINAL undercover police officers , in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL and LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Criminal investigation proceedings on suspicion of drug trafficking had previously been instituted against the CARDINAL suspects . Prior to ORG order , the police \u2019s suspicion against the suspects had been confirmed , in particular , by information obtained via telephone tapping and police surveillance of the suspects .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police decided to attempt to establish contacts between S. and the undercover agents via the applicant , a good friend of S. and business partner for real estate transactions . The applicant , who had no criminal record , was not , at that time , suspected of any involvement in drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , CARDINAL undercover police officers , PERSON and NORP , established contacts with the applicant . They visited him in the restaurant he ran and pretended to be interested in purchasing real property for running a club . In DATE the applicant made a number of offers of real property to the undercover agents and visited the estates with them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently established contacts between the CARDINAL undercover agents and S. for organising an international contraband trade in cigarettes after CARDINAL of the undercover agents had pretended to have a suitable lorry at hand for transporting the cigarettes abroad . PERSON refused , however , to communicate directly with undercover agent P. by telephone and proposed to further communicate via the applicant . When undercover agent NORP disclosed to the applicant on DATE that he considered that the risk of being caught with smuggling cigarettes was too high compared to the possible profits , the applicant disclosed that they ( that is , PERSON and others and himself ) would also traffic in cocaine and amphetamine . He stated that he did not want to be involved in the drug trafficking itself , but would only draw commissions . The undercover agents showed interest in transporting and purchasing drugs .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the applicant , having been telephoned by undercover agent PERSON , explained to P. that he was no longer interested in any business other than the restaurant he ran .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG , having regard to the applicant \u2019s submissions to undercover agent NORP on DATE , extended the court order of CARDINAL DATE authorising investigations so as to cover also the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE undercover agent P. visited the applicant in his restaurant and dispersed the applicant \u2019s suspicions against the undercover agents as well as his fear of having to serve a prison sentence in case the drug deal was discovered . The applicant thereupon continued arranging CARDINAL purchases of drugs ( cocaine and amphetamine ) by the undercover agents from S. on DATE ( QUANTITY of amphetamine paste and QUANTITY of cocaine ) and on DATE ( QUANTITY of amphetamine paste ) . On DATE , the applicant and PERSON were arrested after the delivery of the drugs to the undercover agents . The applicant would have received a commission of more than LAW from S. for having arranged the second contract between PERSON and the undercover agents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having established the facts as described above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL ) , noted that the applicant had confessed to the offences in the hearing . It had further read out in the hearing the written reports of undercover agents NORP and PERSON , drawn up throughout the undercover measure , with the consent of the parties . It noted that the applicant had accepted that these reports were essentially correct . It considered that the applicant \u2019s allegation that it had been undercover agent NORP and not himself who had first come up with the possibility of drug trafficking on DATE , and that he had only responded to that proposal , had not been proven . It noted in that context that the undercover agents had been careful throughout the investigations not to propose illegal business transactions or specific types or amounts of drugs first , but had waited for their respective counterparts to make the first step before becoming more concrete themselves .", "CARDINAL . In fixing the sentence , ORG considered the considerable quantities of drugs trafficked as an aggravating factor . However , there were considerable elements leading to a mitigation of the sentence , which had to be considered as relatively mild in view of the amount of drugs trafficked . The applicant had in essence confessed to the offences and did not have any prior convictions . He had further trafficked mainly amphetamine , which was not a hard drug . In view of the undercover agents\u2019 involvement , there had also not been a risk that the drugs would freely circulate on the market .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG further stated that it was a particularly weighty factor mitigating the sentence that the applicant had been incited ( verleitet ) by a ORG authority to commit offences . Prior to the undercover measure concerning him , there had not been any suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking against the applicant , who did not have a criminal record . The police had only known that the applicant was a friend of S. , against whom there had been strong suspicions of involvement in drug trafficking , and that the applicant had already arranged the sale of real estate together with ORG considered that , nevertheless , the applicant had not been instigated ( angestiftet ) to commit the offences at issue . The undercover agents had waited for the applicant to raise the possibility of arranging an international contraband trade in cigarettes when the arrangement of a real estate transaction had not been successful . The agents had again waited for the applicant to raise the possibility of drug trafficking after the undercover agents had made him understand that they considered that the risk of being caught with smuggling cigarettes was too high compared to the possible profits .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG stressed that the applicant had then renounced any drug business on DATE for fear of punishment . However , the undercover agents nevertheless contacted the applicant again on DATE , when the court order authorising recourse to undercover agents had been extended so as to cover also the applicant , and dispersed his doubts . ORG considered that the way in which the undercover measure had been organised , that is , by contacting the applicant , a person not suspected of an offence , in order to establish contacts with suspect PERSON , had entailed a risk , from the outset , that the applicant became implicated in drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant \u2019s involvement in the offences had been less important than that of S. , as he had only arranged contacts between PERSON and the undercover agents and had shielded off LOC against them . The applicant obviously did not have any contacts with the drug scene apart from his contacts with S.", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment . He complained , in particular , that he had been incited by the police to commit the offences he had later been found guilty of . This had breached the rule of law . There was , therefore , a bar to the criminal proceedings against him , which should have been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . Relying , inter alia , on LAW and on the corresponding provisions of LAW , the applicant complained that he had not had a fair trial . He argued that the undercover agents had incited him to commit drug offences which he would not have committed otherwise . The use of the evidence obtained thereby in the criminal proceedings against him had rendered these proceedings unfair .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the judgment of ORG and the decision of ORG without giving reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional release on DATE after the applicant had served CARDINAL of his sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
