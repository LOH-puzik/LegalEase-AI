NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Ms J. Serrarens , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , and their Deputy Agent , PERSON , both of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE were informed of their right to take part in the proceedings ( LAW ) but did not express the desire to do so .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , a convict prisoner who had been in detention since DATE , was transferred to ORG \u201d in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE ORG of ORG ( PERSON het GPE van Justitie ) informed the Governor of \u201c Dordtse Poorten \u201d about a project for the taking of ORG biometric data ( photographic likenesses and fingerprints ) , referred to by the name of \u201c Biometrics \u201d , which was prompted by the finding that a number of prisoners in a different institution had assumed a false identity . The project , referred to as a \u201c catch - up exercise \u201d ( inhaalslag ) , was intended to constitute the initial phase of a complete overhaul of the prisoner identification system . As part of this project , the Governor of \u201c Dordtse ORG \u201d was asked to take biometric data of certain prisoners in his institution .", "CARDINAL . As CARDINAL of the prisoners chosen , the applicant was informed by letter of the intention of the Governor to take his fingerprints and digital photograph . The letter did not provide information on the storage or use of the data taken . The applicant states that the penal institution \u2019s staff members , when asked , told him that the data would be stored for \u201c DATE \u201d in a national database that would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was asked to submit to the taking of his fingerprints and a digital photograph . He refused to do so , firstly , because he had already given these data when he was admitted to the penal institution and , secondly , because he opposed the fact that his data would be stored in a national database for an unknown length of time and that they would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities .", "CARDINAL . Because of the applicant \u2019s refusal to cooperate , the Unit Director of the penal institution imposed on the applicant CARDINAL days\u2019 solitary confinement in his own cell which included the removal of his television , starting on DATE . DATE , the applicant submitted a complaint against this punishment to ORG ( beklagcommissie ) of the penal institution \u2019s ORG ( GPE PERSON ) , stating that he had complied with his obligations under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) when he had submitted to the taking of his fingerprints and digital photograph during his admittance to the penal institution . He further argued that he was not obliged to submit his data again because they would not be used internally , within the penal institution , but for a national database for which there was no legal basis in LAW or any other act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Unit Director sanctioned the applicant a second time and the institution \u2019s staff members threatened to report the applicant to ORG for refusal to comply with an official order if he continued to refuse to provide his fingerprints and digital photograph . Following this threat , the applicant cooperated and submitted his data . He was , neither then , nor after his release , given any information on the way his data would be stored or used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the penal institution \u2019s ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . It held that the sanction had not been unreasonable because the Governor had been obliged to comply with the instructions of ORG ; because the refusal of a prisoner to comply with an order of the Governor was a disciplinary offence ; and because the applicant had refused to submit his data when ordered to do so by the Governor .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal to ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( PERSON GPE ) the applicant largely restated his arguments . He further submitted that the existence of a Determination of ORG , ORG and Witnesses PERSON ( Wetsvoorstel Wet identiteitsvaststelling verdachten , veroordeelden en getuigen ) , which provided a legal basis for the taking and processing of ORG biometric data in a national database , proved that LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW did not yet confer any such power .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that in practice the identity of prisoners was checked at the time of admission to the institution . It further noted that on entering the institution the applicant had complied with this obligation to submit identifying data as provided for in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . It held that , even though the collection of the data itself had not been unlawful , it had been up to the Governor to explain to the applicant why his data needed to be taken a second time and to provide him afterwards with another opportunity to submit his data . As the Governor had failed to do so , ORG held that the sanction had been unreasonable . ORG awarded the applicant financial compensation in an amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
