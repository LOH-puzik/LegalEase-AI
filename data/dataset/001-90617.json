The applicants are the parents of PERSON , who was born on DATE in a private clinic , I. Immediately after birth the baby was placed in a sterile unit under the constant supervision of the clinic \u2019s staff . Only its doctors and nurses had access to this unit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL photographs of the new - born baby , taken face on , were presented to the second applicant . The photographs had been taken inside the sterile unit by a professional photographer located on the first floor of the clinic . The clinic informed its clients that photography services were available .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained to the clinic \u2019s management about the photographer \u2019s intrusion into a unit to which only the clinic \u2019s staff should have had access , adding that the new - born baby was likely to have been upset by the taking of photographs face on and , most importantly , that they had not given their prior consent .", "CARDINAL . Faced with the clinic \u2019s indifference to their protests and refusal to hand over to them the negatives of the photographs , on DATE the applicants brought an action for damages before ORG , under LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG . Acting on behalf of their child , they claimed the sum of MONEY ( MONEY ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage for the alleged infringement of their child \u2019s personality rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance dismissed their action as unfounded . It found as follows :", "\u201c ... it has not been possible to establish , from the circumstances in which the offending photographs were taken , that the photographer \u2019s conduct was unlawful . In any event , the personality rights of the new - born baby can not have been affected because , just after birth , his psychological and emotional environment had not yet been formed and the recording of his face on a photograph can not have had any negative consequences for his subsequent development . \u201d ( decision no . DATE )", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the court below . It found in particular as follows :", "\u201c ... according to the conclusions drawn from common practice , the personality , emotional environment and mental maturity of a new - born baby , DATE , are not sufficiently developed for it to perceive an infringement of its personality rights , as has been alleged , or for its inner balance to be upset ... \u201d . ( decision no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , represented by the first applicant , lodged an appeal with ORG . In their notice of appeal they pointed out their child \u2019s age at the material time and referred to all the considerations that had led the court below to dismiss their appeal . Their single ground of appeal on points of law concerned ORG interpretation of ORG DATE and CARDINAL of ORG . In their view , that interpretation ran counter to LAW and to LAW . In particular , the applicants claimed that the criterion used by the domestic courts in determining whether the image and , a fortiori , the personality of an individual , could be protected , had been incompatible with the rights to \u201c dignity \u201d and to \u201c the protection of private life \u201d . In addition , the applicants argued that the criterion in question was also potentially dangerous , especially if it were to be applied to disabled children , as they might never reach the requisite level of \u201c mental maturity \u201d with the result that their image and , a fortiori , personality would not be protected .", "CARDINAL .
