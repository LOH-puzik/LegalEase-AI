THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP construction company with limited liability having its registered seat in GPE . In the proceedings it is represented by PERSON M.W.C. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "a. Particular circumstance of the present case", "In DATE and DATE , the applicant company hired employees for work in the GPE from PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \" PERSON \" ) , a company with limited liability having its registered seat in GPE . For the latter company 's employees hired by third companies , ORG ( Allgemeine ORG ) issued secondment certificates ( detacherings - verklaringen ) , so - called E-CARDINAL certificates .", "In accordance with the relevant statutory rules , ORG ( Nieuwe Algemene Bedrijfsvereniging ; \" NAB \" ) enlisted PERSON as a member and decided that the latter had to pay NORP social security contributions for these employees . As PERSON failed to provide the ORG with the necessary information on wages paid , the ORG determined the relevant social security contributions ex officio . PERSON was declared bankrupt in DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , the ORG held the applicant company severally liable ( hoofdelijk aansprakelijk ) for the payment of the social security contributions under LAW ( PERSON ; \" WW \" ) , LAW ( PERSON ; \" PERSON \" ) , ORG ( GPE ; \" ZFW \" ) and ORG ( Wet op de Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering ; \" PERSON \" ) for the employees hired by the applicant company from PERSON GmbH. These contributions amounted in total to MONEY .", "In this decision it was stated that the applicant company would have been exempted from this liability if it would have reported , in accordance with the procedure stated in the decision Nr . DATE of CARDINAL DATE of ORG ( Sociale Verzekeringsraad ) , that it was availing itself of the services of seconded employees and , in addition , if this secondment had taken place under a permit referred to in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of Act on ORG ( FAC CARDINAL beschikking stellen van arbeidskrachten ) issued to the seconding employer . It was found that the applicant company had not complied with either condition .", "The applicant company filed an appeal with ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . In the course of a hearing held on DATE before ORG , the applicant company submitted not to have found any social security contribution demands ( premienota 's ) and , expressing doubts on the actual existence of such demands , raised the question whether under these circumstances it could be held liable for payment of these social security contributions . The ORG replied that the demands existed .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company 's appeal as ill - founded . ORG noted that no payment had been received on the social security contribution demands for DATE which the ORG had addressed to PERSON GmbH.", "As to the question whether the applicant company could be held liable for the payment of these contributions , ORG held that the applicant company had failed to report that it was availing itself of seconded employees and that no permit had been issued to PERSON GmbH.", "Rejecting all arguments advanced by the applicant company in this respect , ORG found that the facts at issue did not constitute a situation of international secondment as referred to in the EEC Ordinances CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It noted that the employees at issue were all NORP nationals and were all residing and working in the GPE at the relevant time . It further noted that ORG had recruited these employees , who until TIME had been insured under the NORP social security system , in the GPE where they had also been assigned to work .", "Having reached this finding , ORG concluded that the NORP social security legislation was applicable to the employees hired by the applicant company and that , as ORG had failed to pay the contributions due , the applicant company could be held liable , pursuant to LAW , for payment of the social security contributions over DATE and DATE in respect of the employees it had hired from PERSON GmbH.", "The applicant company filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) . In its written appeal it stated , inter alia , that it did not appear from the case - file that social security contribution demands had been issued to PERSON GmbH. The applicant company argued that , as long as statutory social security contributions debts had not been formalised in a social security contribution demand , there could be no formally claimable contribution debt . It further doubted that any steps aimed at collecting this debt had been taken against ORG and submitted that , in these circumstances , it was inappropriate that it should be held liable for this debt .", "In its written reply of DATE to the applicant company 's appeal , the ORG stated that social security contribution demands had been issued and , although it had not yet been possible to submit copies of these demands , that it would submit copies of these demands as soon as possible . As to the lack of any debt recovery steps , the ORG submitted that ORG had gone bankrupt in DATE and that it was thus impossible to collect this debt .", "In the course of a hearing held on DATE before ORG , the applicant company also argued that the letters of DATE and DATE from ORG ( ORG ; \" ORG \" ) to PERSON had created a legitimate expectation that no NORP social security contributions would be imposed . It further submitted that , since it still had not received any social security contribution demands addressed to PERSON , no contributions had been imposed and thus no contributions were due .", "The ORG replied that it could not bear any responsibility for acts of another administrative organ which may have led to certain expectations and , as regards the submission of the demands , responded that this had still not been done but that it would be able to submit these demands at the hearing .", "In reply to this offer by the ORG to submit the demands , the President of ORG , referring to LAW ( PERSON ) , stated that additional documents were to be submitted DATE before the date of the hearing .", "When the applicant company submitted that the ORG , in its written submissions of DATE , had only stated that the demands would be submitted as soon as possible but that so far nothing had in fact been submitted , the President of ORG stated that it appeared indisputably from the administrative records that social security contributions demands had been issued ( \" uit de administratie onomstotelijk blijkt dat er premienota 's zijn opgelegd \" ) . The applicant company 's representative responded not to have seen these demands .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company 's appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE .", "It held , inter alia , that it agreed with ORG finding that the employees at issue fell under the GPE social security scheme and that the situation at issue did not concern secondment of employees recruited in GPE . It noted on this point that the applicant company did no longer contest this finding .", "ORG further agreed with ORG that the letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE from the ORG could not be regarded as constituting a violation of the principle of justified expectations ( vertrouwensbeginsel ) to such an extent that the applicant company 's liability could not be maintained . It noted that these letters came from the ORG and not from the ORG and held that , given the manner in which the clauses contained in these letters were formulated , the applicant company could not have attached a decisive importance to them .", "ORG did not deal with the issues raised by the applicant company in respect of the social security contribution demands .", "b. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Under LAW of ORG - ordination LAW ) , social security contributions due by employers are determined by the occupational association to which the employer belongs . According to paragraph CARDINAL of this provision , the occupational association must inform the employer in writing of the amount due and the delay for payment .", "According to LAW para . CARDINAL of ORG - ordination LAW , social security contributions will no longer be determined after a period of DATE has elapsed since the end of the calendar DATE for which such contributions are in principle due . Paragraph CARDINAL of this provision states that payment of social security contributions , which have not been collected within DATE after their determination , can no longer be claimed .", "Pursuant to Article CARDINALa of ORG - ordination LAW , a legal person hiring employees of a third party may in certain circumstances be liable to pay the social security contributions , in principle due by the third party employer , for such employees . CARDINAL such circumstance is the failure of the third party to pay these contributions .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG held that a third party can not be held liable for payment of social security contributions if the initial demand had not issued to the correct debtor . In that case it was held that the real debtor was a company with limited liability whereas the demand stated this company 's director / shareholder in his personal capacity as debtor ( CRvB , DATE , PERSON , Nr . CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW ( PERSON ) the administrative organ against whose decision an administrative appeal has been lodged shall transmit to the court dealing with the appeal the documents relating to the case ( \" de op de zaak betrekking hebbende stukken \" ) within a set time - limit .", "Pursuant to LAW , an administrative court can further request the parties and others to submit documents within a fixed time - limit . Under paragraph CARDINAL of this provision , administrative organs , even if they are no party to the proceedings concerned , are obliged to comply with such a request . Pursuant to LAW , parties are obliged to comply with a request of an administrative court to submit documents .", "Under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW , an administrative court shall give judgment on the basis of the notice of appeal , the documents submitted , the preliminary examination and the hearing before the court . Under the second and third paragraphs of this provision an administrative court may ex officio complete the legal grounds and the facts .", "Under LAW a written decision of an administrative judicial body shall include the grounds on which it is based ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
