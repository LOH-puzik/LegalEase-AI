The appellate court therefore found the applicants guilty of abuse of office , under LAW . The punishment for abuse of office was either imprisonment for DATE , or , as an alternative , a prohibition on taking up a particular activity or working in a certain area . When considering the most effective and just punishment to be imposed on the CARDINAL applicants , ORG underlined that they had committed the crime \u201c within the area of their work and professional activity \u201d , and \u201c performed actions discrediting the title of judge \u201d , and that therefore they should be prohibited from working in law - enforcement , law and order and judicial institutions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

The prosecutor , ORG and the CARDINAL applicants lodged appeals on points of law . The CARDINAL applicants alleged , inter alia , that there had been breaches of procedural requirements when the criminal proceedings had been instituted against them as judges and that the appellate court had wrongly applied and interpreted the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal on points of law , invoking LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW , the third applicant further argued that there had been a breach of the right to the presumption of innocence . Firstly , he contended that pending the pretrial investigation some information about the case had been leaked to the media , including transcripts of telephone conversations between the CARDINAL applicants and comments on those conversations . As a result , an opinion had been formed in advance as to the applicants\u2019 guilt . He had thus not had a fair trial , in breach of LAW . Secondly , before the guilty verdict had been reached , high - ranking ORG officials \u2013 the ORG President and the Speaker of the Seimas \u2013 had on many occasions made public statements to the effect that the applicants were guilty . They had also commented on the crimes which the applicants were said to have committed . In the third applicant \u2019s view , the ORG President had publicly acknowledged in his interviews that he had removed the CARDINAL applicants from office after he had found that they had committed the crimes in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the CARDINAL ORG appeals on points of law . As regards the third applicant \u2019s complaint of an alleged violation of the right to the presumption of innocence , ORG noted that there was no indication that the public disclosure of the facts about the criminal case had had an effect on its outcome . The dismissal of CARDINAL judges was a noteworthy event , about which society had a right to be informed . The publicity had also been unavoidable because the ORG President \u2019s decrees dismissing the applicants had been public documents . Nonetheless , there was no proof that any of the public comments on the case had been made by the prosecutors or judges who had been dealing with it .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the public statements by the ORG President and other ORG officials or politicians could not be examined on points of law since those questions had not been raised before the lower courts . The issue of the presumption of innocence had been mentioned only when the case had been examined on points of law a second time , and it was not for ORG to gather evidence or examine it , because under domestic law its competence was to examine questions of law and to ensure its uniform application . Even assuming that the third applicant had correctly understood the statements by the politicians , there was no reason to find that those statements had prevented the appellate court from impartially and objectively deciding the case and adopting a lawful and reasonable judgment .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG dismissed the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 suggestion that the criminal proceedings against them had been started in breach of domestic law .", "The former Prosecutor General PERSON did not sit on ORG bench .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant started civil proceedings with ORG , alleging that she had been unlawfully removed from office by the ORG President \u2019s decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She argued that by initially suspending her from her duties by the earlier decree , no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the President had already passed judgment on her actions , which had still been the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation . As a result , her removal from office for those actions , before a criminal court had found her guilty , had been a form of political pressure on the criminal courts , and had also been in breach of the right to the presumption of innocence under LAW . She asked ORG to refer questions to ORG about whether decree no . CARDINAL had been in breach of the LAW and the principle of the presumption of innocence .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE the ORG suspended the civil proceedings and asked ORG to rule on the constitutionality of decree no . CARDINAL . It also asked , inter alia , whether the decree in the first applicant \u2019s case , as far as its content and adoption procedure were concerned , had been in conflict with , inter alia , LAW , which establishes the principle of the presumption of innocence , LAW on the grounds for a judge \u2019s removal , or with ORG DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , which regulate judges\u2019 disciplinary liability ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After receiving similar requests in the other CARDINAL ORG cases ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , in DATE ORG joined them in CARDINAL case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a ruling . It found that decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , by which the CARDINAL applicants had been removed from office for discrediting the title of judge , had not been in breach of the LAW or ORG . It also held that the first applicant \u2019s removal from office by the same decree of the ORG President had not been in breach of LAW reasoning is given in paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant asked ORG to discontinue the civil proceedings for unlawful dismissal and reinstatement . The court granted that request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant brought a civil claim with ORG , asking it to quash the ORG President \u2019s decree no . CARDINAL as regarding this applicant \u2019s dismissal . He argued , inter alia , that there had been a breach of the right to the presumption of innocence because he had been dismissed as a judge while criminal proceedings against him had still been pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim . The court considered that the criminal charges against the applicant , as indicated by the prosecutor \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE and given to the ORG President ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had been sufficient to hold that by his behaviour the applicant had discredited the title of judge . The judgment of DATE by ORG , finding the CARDINAL applicants guilty ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had only confirmed that there had been grounds to dismiss the second applicant for discrediting the title of judge . ORG also relied on ORG aforementioned ruling regarding the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 case . The civil court also rejected the argument that the ORG President \u2019s decree on the ORG dismissal had been in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence . In fact , the decree had specified another ground for his dismissal , which was discrediting the title of judge , and not that a crime had been committed . The ORG President \u2019s decree had thus had no influence on the subsequent criminal proceedings against the second applicant . Lastly , the civil court found no breaches of law as regards the domestic proceedings for the second applicant \u2019s dismissal .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the second applicant lodged no appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant challenged the lawfulness of the decision of ORG of DATE , which had recommended that the ORG President remove the CARDINAL applicants from office for having discredited the title of judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The third applicant requested that he be allowed to step down voluntarily , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He also alleged that ORG had committed numerous violations of procedural and substantive legal rules when suspending him from his duties and removing him from office . As it transpires from the summary of the third applicant \u2019s lawsuit , he did not argue that statements by ORG officials in the press had breached his right to the presumption of innocence . However , he argued that the right to the presumption of innocence had been breached because conclusions as to his guilt had been made and he had been dismissed as a judge before the criminal proceedings had finished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the third applicant \u2019s claims as unfounded . Relying on ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the civil court found that ORG had acted lawfully when recommending that the CARDINAL applicants be removed from office . The prosecutor \u2019s request to the ORG President of CARDINAL DATE , where the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 actions had been described ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as well as the fact that criminal charges had been brought against them , had been sufficient grounds to hold that the third applicant \u2019s actions had discredited the title of a judge . The court also dismissed the argument that the ORG President \u2019s decree on the removal of the CARDINAL applicants had been in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence . In fact , the decree had not stated that the judges had been removed for committing a crime . In other words , the applicant had been removed from office not for committing a crime , but for discrediting the title of judge . Lastly , the court found that no laws had been broken during the proceedings for the CARDINAL judges\u2019 removal from office .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant appealed . He argued , inter alia , that the presidential decree on his dismissal had been in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence because after the applicants\u2019 acquittal the ORG President had allegedly acknowledged in the press that he had dismissed the applicants because they had committed a crime . Such statements by the ORG President had also been in breach of the principle of the independence of courts . The criminal courts had subsequently been obliged to find the applicants guilty . Undue influence on the criminal courts had also been exerted by the statements of other politicians in the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG endorsed the lower court \u2019s reasoning . For ORG , the ORG President \u2019s prerogative to dismiss someone for discrediting the title of judge could not be seen as undue influence on the criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused to examine an appeal on points of law by the third applicant . Even so , ORG underlined the fact that the third applicant had erred in his appeal on points of law by ignoring the fact that a judge \u2019s removal from office for committing a crime and discrediting the title of judge , as foreseen in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , were CARDINAL distinct grounds for a judge \u2019s dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a ruling regarding the constitutionality of presidential decree no . CARDINAL ( also see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Firstly , it emphasised that under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) the ORG President retained the right to remove a judge from office who had discredited the title of judge , whether or not there had been disciplinary proceedings before ORG , however , on condition that removal had been recommended by ORG . As that had been the situation in the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 case , decree no . CARDINAL had not been in conflict with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG also underlined the fact that the Law on Courts provided for CARDINAL separate grounds for removing a judge from office \u2013 if a court judgment which has entered into force has established that a judge has committed a crime ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , or if a judge has discredited the title of judge ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) , the latter provision being the relevant legal ground in the ORG case . For ORG , it was paramount that the disputed decree no . CARDINAL of the ORG President did not stipulate that the CARDINAL applicants had committed a crime . Nor did that decree declare that actions for which the CARDINAL applicants had been removed from office had been a crime .", "ORG also held that the principle of the presumption of innocence , as enshrined in LAW , could not be interpreted as prohibiting the ORG President from removing a judge , who by his or her actions had discredited the title of judge , until a criminal court had found that person guilty in criminal proceedings . In fact , LAW contained distinct grounds for a judge \u2019s dismissal , those being \u201c when their conduct discredits the title of judge \u201d in point CARDINAL , and \u201c upon the entry into force of court judgments convicting them \u201d , in point CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Those CARDINAL grounds could not be considered to be the same ( negali b\u016bti tapatinami ) . On the one hand , actions which discredited the title of judge might not necessarily be a crime . On the other hand , conduct discrediting the title of judge might be recognised as a criminal act later by a court conviction . Under point CARDINAL of LAW therefore , a judge could be dismissed for discrediting the title of judge , whether or not the conduct in question was later judged by a court to have been a criminal deed , and regardless of whether a corresponding court conviction came into effect . ORG further noted :", "\u201c ... the content of the principle of the presumption of innocence which is entrenched in LAW CARDINAL of the LAW can not be construed that it , purportedly , implies , inter alia , that the President of the Republic can not dismiss a judge who by his conduct has discredited the title of a judge , until a conviction in regard of that judge has been adopted and come into force . In this context , it should be noted that LAW establishes various grounds for the removal of judges from office , that judges may be removed from office also \u2018 when their conduct has discredited the title of ORG ( point CARDINAL ) , and \u2018 upon the entry into force of court judgments convicting them\u2019 ( point CARDINAL ) . In its ruling of DATE , ORG held that the LAW does not expressis verbis establish any type of conduct by judges which discredits the title of judges ; that the formula \u2018 conduct discrediting the title of judges\u2019 is wide , and includes not only conduct which discredited the title of a judge while implementing his powers as a judge , but also conduct which discredited the title of a judge which has no relation to the implementation of the powers of the judge ; that , under LAW , the legislature , as well as the self - governing institutions of the judiciary , have the discretion to establish what conduct should be regarded as that which discredits the title of a judge , however , neither laws nor the decisions of self - governing institutions of the judiciary may establish any thorough ( final ) list of actions by which a judge discredits the title of a judge . In the said ORG ruling it was also held that when deciding whether the conduct of a judge is such that the title of a judge has been discredited , all the circumstances related to the said conduct and its significance to the case must be assessed each time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also gave weight to the fact that by its judgment of DATE in the applicants\u2019 criminal case ORG had acknowledged that within their area of work and professional activity the applicants had performed actions which had discredited the title of a judge and undermined the authority of the judiciary ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , there were no grounds to find a violation of the right to the presumption of innocence , as enshrined in LAW and in LAW , on account of the ORG President \u2019s decree no . CARDINAL removing the first applicant from office .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the Government informed ORG that Article CARDINAL of the Law on the Bar had been amended , thus having an impact on the applicants\u2019 eligibility to work as advocates ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Government submitted that the applicants were therefore no longer prevented from working as advocates , given that their convictions had expired and the period in the law of DATE after serving their sentence had passed . The ORG also stated that the second and the third applicants had been admitted to the Bar by decisions of ORG on , respectively , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . To the ORG \u2019s knowledge , the first applicant had not addressed ORG with a request to be recognised as an advocate .", "All CARDINAL applicants were informed about the ORG \u2019s letter but none of them commented on it .", "CARDINAL .
