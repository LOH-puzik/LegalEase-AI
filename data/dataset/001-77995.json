In DATE , the applicant arrived in GPE from GPE and sought political asylum . She was initially provided with accommodation by the social services department of GPE and ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . On DATE , the applicant moved into accommodation owned by a housing association . A member of the housing association 's staff assisted the applicant to complete her application for housing and council tax benefit which was submitted to the ORG in DATE . This application was successful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was required by law to renew her application for housing and council tax benefit on an DATE basis . Because of her lack of familiarity with the benefits system and her poor LANGUAGE , the applicant failed to submit a benefit renewal form to the ORG by the required time . In DATE , the applicant received correspondence from the housing association about her rent arrears . As the applicant did not understand the correspondence , she sought assistance from the ORG 's advice office . After obtaining this advice the applicant realised that her housing and council tax benefit had ceased . She therefore submitted a prospective claim as well as a backdated claim for both types of benefit to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prospective claim was successful and the applicant began to receive housing benefit again from DATE , but on CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the application for backdated benefit because the applicant had failed to show \u201c good cause \u201d why she had not claimed the benefits earlier .", "CARDINAL . During the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant lost housing benefit of GBP MONEY , and since her rent in any event exceeded the benefit to which she had been entitled , her rent arrears amounted to GBP CARDINAL . The housing association commenced possession proceedings , seeking the applicant 's eviction for non - payment of rent , and the ORG also brought proceedings based on the applicant 's failure to pay council tax of ORG CARDINAL for DATE . On DATE a court order was made allowing the ORG to deduct GBP CARDINAL per week from the applicant 's income support of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's legal advisers wrote to the ORG requesting that they reconsider their refusal . However , by letter dated DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that they were upholding their initial decision to refuse council tax and housing benefits .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . The case was heard on DATE by GPE and ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . The ORG consisted of CARDINAL Councillors from the ORG . It was advised by a barrister from the ORG 's legal department . The applicant was represented by ORG and the ORG was represented by a ORG benefits officer . The ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal , finding that the applicant must have received some correspondence from the local authority during the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE concerning the council tax she owed , although no such correspondence was produced to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the housing association 's possession proceedings against the applicant concluded with a court order requiring her to pay off the rent arrears at GBP CARDINAL DATE ( in addition to the GBP CARDINAL per week for council tax arrears ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant sought judicial review of the ORG 's decision . She complained that the ORG had acted unlawfully because it had failed to make adequate findings of fact or provide sufficient reasons for its decision . The applicant also alleged that the ORG was not an \u201c independent and impartial \u201d tribunal under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's application for leave to apply for judicial review on the grounds that the LAW had not yet been incorporated into LANGUAGE law , and further dismissed the application on the merits , on the grounds that the ORG 's decision was neither unreasonable nor irrational .

Housing benefit ( \u201c HB \u201d ) is a means - tested benefit payable towards housing costs in rented accommodation . It is not dependent on or linked to the payment of contributions by the claimant .", "CARDINAL . The HB scheme is administered by the local authority . Payments of HB are subsidised by central Government , normally to the extent of PERCENT , although where HB is paid as a result of a decision that the claimant had good cause for a late claim the subsidy is PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . HB is awarded for \u201c benefit periods \u201d and entitlement for each period is dependent on a claim being made in time in accordance with the statutory rules . If a claimant makes a late claim , any entitlement to arrears of HB depends on the claimant establishing \u201c good cause \u201d for having missed the deadline . The case - law establishes that the concept of \u201c good cause \u201d involves an objective judgment as to whether this individual claimant , with his or her characteristics such as language and mental health , did what could reasonably have been expected of him or her .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , a claim to housing benefit was first considered by officials employed by the local authority and working in the housing department . If the benefit was refused the claimant was entitled to a review of the decision , first by the local authority itself , then by a ORG , which comprised CARDINAL elected councillors from the local authority .

In ORG judgment in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment , ex parte Holding and ORG , ORG and ORG , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , Lord PERSON of GPE described the scope of judicial review as follows ( \u00a7 DATE ) :", "\u201c It has long been established that if the Secretary of ORG misinterprets the legislation under which he purports to act , or if he takes into account matters irrelevant to his decision or refuses or fails to take account of matters relevant to his decision , or reaches a perverse decision , the court may set his decision aside . Even if he fails to follow necessary procedural steps - failing to give notice of a hearing or to allow an opportunity for evidence to be called or cross - examined , or for representations to be made or to take any step which fairness or natural justice requires , the court may interfere . The legality of the decision and the procedural steps must be subject to sufficient judicial control . \u201d ...", "Lord PERSON continued that he was further of the view that a court had power to quash an administrative decision for a misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment , and see also Lord PERSON at \u00a7 CARDINAL , Lord PERSON at MONEY and Lord PERSON at \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and , where human rights were in issue , on grounds of lack of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . In Runa Begum ( ORG ) v. GPE of GPE [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , Lord PERSON of PERSON made it clear that a court on judicial review ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... may not only quash the authority 's decision ... if it is held to be vitiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established and relevant fact ... It is plain that the ... judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently tenable conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authority ... . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Since the coming into force of LAW , the NORP courts have considered on a number of occasions the extent to which judicial review can remedy defects of independence in a first instance administrative tribunal .", "CARDINAL . In GPE ( cited above ) , ORG considered the procedure whereby the Secretary of ORG had the power himself to determine certain matters of planning and compulsory purchase , subject to judicial review . Following the ORG 's judgment in PERSON the GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , ORG held unanimously that since the decisions in question involved substantial considerations of policy and public interest it was acceptable , and indeed desirable , that they be made by a public official , accountable to ORG . Although the Secretary of ORG was not an independent and impartial tribunal , he ( or rather , his ORG 's decision - making process ) offered a number of procedural safeguards , such as an inspector 's inquiry with the opportunity for interested parties to be heard , and these safeguards , together with the availability of judicial review ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) was sufficient to comply with the requirement for \u201c an independent and impartial tribunal \u201d in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON explained the democratic principles underlying this approach as follows ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) :", "\u201c In a democratic country , decisions as to what the general interest requires are made by democratically elected bodies or persons accountable to them . Sometimes the subject - matter is such that ORG can itself lay down general rules for enforcement by the courts . Taxation is a good example ; ORG decides on grounds of general interest what taxation is required and the rules according to which it should be levied . The application of those rules , to determine the liability of a particular person , is then a matter for independent and impartial tribunals such as the General or Special Commissioners or the courts . On the other hand , sometimes one can not formulate general rules and the question of what the general interest requires has to be determined on a case by case basis . Town and country planning or road construction , in which every decision is in some respects different , are archetypal examples . In such cases ORG may delegate the decision - making power to local democratically elected bodies or to ministers of the ORG responsible to ORG . In that way the democratic principle is preserved .", "... There is however another relevant principle which must exist in a NORP society . That is the rule of law . When ministers or officials make decisions affecting the rights of individuals , they must do so in accordance with the law . The legality of what they do must be subject to review by independent and impartial tribunals . This is reflected in the requirement in LAW No . CARDINAL that a taking of property must be ' subject to the conditions provided for by law ' . The principles of judicial review give effect to the rule of law . They ensure that administrative decisions will be taken rationally , in accordance with a fair procedure and within the powers conferred by ORG . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG returned to these issues in PERSON ( cited above ) . The appellant had been offered a flat by the local authority , but considered it unsuitable for herself and her children because , she alleged , it was on a housing estate known for drugs and crime and in close proximity to a friend of her ex - husband . She requested a review of the local authority 's decision . The reviewing officer was a re - housing manager employed by the same local authority but who had not been involved in the original decision and who was senior to the original decision - maker . She found that there were no serious problems on the estate and that the relationship between PERSON and her husband was not such as to make it intolerable for them to risk meeting each other .", "CARDINAL . It was accepted that the case involved the determination of civil rights and that the reviewing officer was not , in herself , an \u201c independent and impartial tribunal \u201d . ORG held unanimously that the existence of judicial review was sufficient in this context for the purposes of LAW . In reaching this conclusion , Lord PERSON of NORP considered CARDINAL matters as \u201c particularly pertinent \u201d : first , that the legislation in question was part of a far - reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing , where scarce resources had to be divided among many individuals in need ; secondly , that although the council had to decide a number of factual issues , these decisions were \u201c only staging posts on the way to the much broader judgments \u201d concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation , which the housing officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make ; thirdly , the review procedure incorporated a number of safeguards to ensure that the reviewer came to the case with an open mind and took into account the applicant 's representations . Lord PERSON commented , generally , on the inter - relation between the LAW concept of \u201c civil rights \u201d and the requirement for an \u201c independent and impartial tribunal \u201d , that ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c the narrower the interpretation given to ' civil rights ' , the greater the need to insist on review by a judicial tribunal exercising full powers . Conversely , the more elastic the interpretation given to ' civil rights ' , the more flexible must be the approach to the requirement of independent and impartial review if the emasculation ( by over - judicialisation ) of administrative welfare schemes is to be avoided . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was argued before ORG that when , as in GPE and GPE , the decision turned upon questions of policy or \u201c expediency \u201d , it was not necessary for the appellate court to be able to substitute its own opinion for that of the decision - maker ; that would be contrary to the principle of democratic accountability . However , where , as in PERSON , the decision turned upon a question of contested fact , it was necessary either that the appellate court should have full jurisdiction to review the facts or that the primary decision - making process should be attended with sufficient safeguards as to make it virtually judicial . In response , Lord PERSON ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) underlined that the fact - finding in PERSON had been closely analogous to a criminal trial , since the inspector 's decision that Mr PERSON had acted in breach of planning control would be binding on him in any subsequent criminal proceedings for failing to comply with the enforcement notice . Lord PERSON continued :", "\u201c A finding of fact in this context seems to me very different from the findings of fact which have to be made by central or local government officials in the course of carrying out regulatory functions ( such as licensing or granting planning permission ) or administering schemes of social welfare such as [ housing the homeless ] . The rule of law rightly requires that certain decisions , of which the paradigm examples are findings of breaches of the criminal law and adjudications as to private rights , should be entrusted to the judicial branch of government . This basic principle does not yield to utilitarian arguments that it would be cheaper or more efficient to have these matters decided by administrators . Nor is the possibility of an appeal sufficient to compensate for lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the primary decision - maker ( see PERSON v. GPE [ judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B ] ) .", "But utilitarian considerations have their place when it comes to setting up , for example , schemes of regulation or social welfare . I said earlier that in determining the appropriate scope of judicial review of administrative action , regard must be had to democratic accountability , efficient administration and the sovereignty of ORG . This case raises no question of democratic accountability . ...", "On the other hand , efficient administration and the sovereignty of ORG are very relevant . ORG is entitled to take the view that it is not in the public interest that an excessive proportion of the funds available for a welfare scheme should be consumed in administration and legal disputes ... . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment in GPE , but before that in PERSON , ORG examined whether the ORG procedure at issue in the present application was compliant with LAW , in a case where the determination of the central issues of fact depended on an assessment whether the claimant was telling the truth : PERSON ( NORP on the application of ) v. ORG [ DATE ] EWHC Admin CARDINAL . The Secretary of ORG conceded that the ORG lacked the appearance of an independent and impartial tribunal . On the question whether judicial review proceedings were sufficient to remedy the problem , PERSON observed :", "\u201c There is however , in my judgment , CARDINAL insuperable difficulty . Unlike an inspector [ in a planning case ] , whose position was described by Lord PERSON [ in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment , ex parte Holding and ORG , ORG and ORG , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ; [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL : see Holding and ORG plc v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE ] as independent , the same can not be said of a councillor who is directly connected to CARDINAL of the parties to the dispute , namely the ORG . The dispute was between the claimant and the ORG . The case against payment of benefit was presented by employee of the ORG and relied upon the statement of an official of ORG in the ORG 's Revenue office ) . ...", "The reasoning carefully set out by the ORG enables the court to ensure that there has been no material error of fact . Even in relation to a finding of fact , this court can exercise some control if it can be demonstrated that the facts found are not supported by the evidence . But , in that respect , the court can only exercise limited control . It can not substitute its own views as to the weight of the evidence ... In my judgment , the connection of the councillors to the party resisting entitlement to housing benefit does constitute a real distinction between the position of a [ planning ] inspector and ORG . The lack of independence may infect the independence of judgment in relation to the finding of primary fact in a manner which can not be adequately scrutinised or rectified by this court . CARDINAL of the essential problems which flows from the connection between a tribunal determining facts and a party to the dispute is that the extent to which a judgment of fact may be infected can not easily be , if at all , discerned . The influence of the connection may not be apparent from the terms of the decision which sets out the primary facts and the inferences drawn from those facts . ...", "Thus it is no answer to a charge of bias to look at the terms of a decision and to say that no actual bias is demonstrated or that the reasoning is clear , cogent and supported by the evidence . This court can not cure the often imperceptible effects of the influence of the connection between the fact finding body and a party to the dispute since it has no jurisdiction to reach its own conclusion on the primary facts ; still less any power to weigh the evidence . Accordingly , I conclude that there has been no determination of the claimant 's entitlement to housing benefit by an independent and impartial tribunal . The level of review which this court can exercise does not replenish the want of independence in ORG , caused by its connection to a party in the dispute . \u201d", "The Secretary of ORG was granted leave to appeal against this judgment but , in the event , decided not to appeal .", "The PERSON judgment was approved and followed , after ORG judgment in PERSON , by ORG in NORP ( PERSON and another ) v. ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .
