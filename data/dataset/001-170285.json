Prior to DATE the applicant was staying in GPE on the basis of passports of limited duration , issued by ORG , and temporary residence permits , which were regularly extended by the NORP police . In DATE an extension of the applicant \u2019s residence permit was requested by ORG and granted by the NORP authorities , as at the time access to the NORP territories was problematic .", "CARDINAL .

By a decision of DATE , the court ordered the applicant to pay a fine for violating migration regulations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against the court decisions convicting him of administrative offences , as he had no legal representation and took the view that those decisions would not have any consequences for his stay in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to the migration unit of ORG in GPE to apply for an extension of his residence permit . On the way he was stopped by officers of the migration unit of ORG in GPE , who informed the applicant that there had been an order deporting him from GPE .

Subsequently the applicant contacted a lawyer , who helped him to obtain copies of the decisions concerning his expulsion and to lodge an appeal against them ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Solomyanskyy ORG in GPE issued a decision stating that the applicant should be removed from GPE for violation of migration regulations and banning him from entry to the country until DATE under section CARDINAL of ORG see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .

In support , they provided copies of written statements allegedly signed by the applicant and by a translator .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that he had not been informed of that decision and that the written statements in that regard had been forged by the police . The applicant also argued that he had not been aware that subsequently , in DATE , the police had initiated court proceedings for him to be forcibly removed from GPE .", "CARDINAL . In their written submissions made in the course of those proceedings , the police reiterated the findings in the decision of CARDINAL DATE and requested ORG to order the applicant \u2019s immediate forcible removal and his placement in a facility for temporary detention of foreigners and stateless persons for the period necessary to prepare the removal . In the latter regard , the police argued that there were reasons to believe that the applicant would try to remain illegally in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the case in the absence of the parties , having noted that the applicant had submitted a written statement that he did not wish to be present and that he agreed with the expulsion decision , and also that the police were not able to attend the hearing because of their high workload . The court relied on the findings in the decision of CARDINAL DATE and allowed the claims of the police . In its decision , the court noted that its ruling was to be enforced immediately and that it could be appealed against within DATE under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW . If no appeal was lodged against the decision it would enter into force after the expiry of the DATE period .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was informed of the decision of CARDINAL DATE on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE a lawyer submitted an appeal on the applicant \u2019s behalf , together with a request for renewal of the DATE time - limit , to ORG for further transfer to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal , the applicant argued that he had been studying in GPE DATE . In DATE he had returned from GPE to GPE fearing persecution by the NORP authorities . Without providing any further details , the applicant stated that he had been arrested and tortured by the NORP authorities with the aim of obtaining his confession of cooperation with ORG . The applicant further noted that he was married to a NORP national , that he had been officially allowed to stay in GPE until DATE , and that on DATE the police had seized his identification documents and ordered him to leave GPE . The applicant also expressed the wish to apply for asylum once ORG started accepting asylum applications according to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the first - instance court had failed to examine all the facts pertinent to the case and to hear him . According to the appeal , the applicant had not been informed of the decision of DATE and had not asked the court to hear the case in his absence .", "CARDINAL . He also argued that the first - instance court had not checked whether it was safe for the applicant to return to GPE and had not been informed of the circumstances essential for the outcome of his case . In particular , the applicant argued that the NORP police had withheld the information that he had a valid residence permit and that he had used to be married to a NORP national . The applicant complained that the expulsion decision of CARDINAL DATE had been taken in violation of ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , given the human rights situation in GPE , and in violation of the domestic procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the case in the absence of the parties . It is unknown whether the applicant or his lawyer intended to take part in the hearing and , if so , whether they informed ORG accordingly .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was rejected as unsubstantiated . In particular , ORG relied fully on the findings of the first - instance court and noted that \u201c the claimant , having been removed from GPE , had crossed the NORP border despite the existing entry ban \u201d . The decision entered into force immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG a cassation appeal challenging the factual and legal findings of the lower courts . The applicant also complained that his expulsion from GPE would be contrary to LAW given his personal and family ties with that country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the lower courts\u2019 decisions on the ground that they had failed to examine whether there were grounds preventing the applicant \u2019s expulsion under NORP law . ORG also noted that the lower courts had not given due consideration to the applicant \u2019s private and family life interests in GPE . The case was thus sent for re - examination to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . After another round of examination by the courts at the first and appeal levels of jurisdiction resulting in a decision ordering the applicant \u2019s forcible removal from GPE , in DATE the case was sent back to the start again by ORG , for the same reasons as in its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , to which the case was eventually remitted , refused the application for the applicant \u2019s forcible expulsion .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the applicant \u2019s forcible removal from GPE would be in violation of his right to respect of family life as guaranteed by LAW , having regard in particular to the fact that the applicant was married to a NORP national . It also found that , in the event of his removal to GPE , the applicant \u2019s life and security would be endangered , given the armed conflict on that territory , which would entail a violation of GPE \u2019s commitments under Articles DATE of the Convention . The court took the view that the applicant had grounds to be given the status of refugee or of a person in need of complementary protection . The court also noted that , by operation of the statutory DATE time - limit ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant could no longer be considered as having committed the administrative offences of which he had been convicted in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . That decision was not appealed against and became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an asylum application with ORG . According to the applicant , in his application he stated that he feared persecution by ORG if returned to GPE , as he had been a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during the assessment of his asylum case migration officers questioned him on CARDINAL occasions . They asked formal questions not related to the substance of his allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a written notice dated DATE that his asylum application had been refused by a decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and that he could challenge it before the courts . No copy of the decision was given to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the refusal of his asylum application before ORG . In particular , the applicant argued that he had not been informed of the reasons for that decision , and that this prevented him from effectively appealing against it . The applicant also argued that the examination of his application had not been thorough and objective , as his questioning had been formalistic and no additional information had been sought concerning the general situation in GPE or the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances from other ORG authorities , such as ORG , or from the applicant himself , to check the reliability of his submissions . The applicant stated that he had not been given access to the evidence in the inquiry . He maintained his allegation that he was at risk of persecution by ORG , and also argued that if returned to GPE , as a male NORP he ran a real risk of ill - treatment by the NORP authorities , even though he did not support ORG . In that regard , he referred to the reports of ORG concerning the human rights situation in GPE in DATE . The applicant also contended that ORG had disregarded that , as a NORP refugee registered with ORG and outside its field of operation he was entitled to the same protection in GPE as refugees under LAW to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s case , finding that ORG had examined the matter thoroughly and fully and that the applicant \u2019s arguments were unsubstantiated . In particular , the court noted that the material relating to the applicant \u2019s asylum proceedings demonstrated that he did not run an individual and real risk of persecution by the NORP authorities , as ORG and ORG had entered into negotiations concerning a transitional government for NORP territories ; he had not been subjected to such persecution at any time ; the applicant had not provided any evidence that he would not be able to avail himself of the protection of his country of origin ; he had travelled freely to and from GPE ; all his family lived there ; and he did not face criminal prosecution there . The court also noted that the applicant had left his country of origin voluntarily for economic and personal reasons ; he had had his residence permit in GPE repeatedly extended for personal reasons ; and he had requested asylum only after he had not been able to legalise his further stay in GPE . Relying on the latter ground , the court found that the applicant had missed the time - limit for lodging an asylum application pursuant to LAW of DATE . On the whole , the court found that it had been for the applicant to provide documents or persuasive arguments demonstrating that he had run a real and personal risk of persecution , which he had failed to do .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . In particular , he stated that his allegations of risk of persecution by ORG and by the NORP authorities were , inter alia , supported by the fact that his passport had been issued by ORG associated with ORG , by his registration card issued by the ORG , and by various international reports , which neither ORG nor the court of first instance had sought to obtain or examine . According to the applicant , the court \u2019s review of his case had not been full or thorough , thus falling short of the requirements of ORG in Need of Complementary or LAW of DATE , as interpreted by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , having agreed with the first - instance court in that the applicant had failed to substantiate his asylum application as required by the national law and pertinent international documents , including ORG Directive of DATE on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status and the Guidelines on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under LAW , issued by the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation , stating that the lower courts had not fully examined the material pertinent to his case , which had resulted in a wrong dismissal of his asylum request , in violation of Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . As to Article CARDINAL , the applicant noted that he had studied in GPE DATE , that since DATE he was permanently resident on its territory , and that he was married to a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal , having found no elements demonstrating that the lower courts had erred in the application of substantive or procedural law or that review of the evidence in the case was required .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a new asylum application with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG refused to examine the application , finding that it was wholly unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned that decision , having found that ORG had failed to thoroughly examine the matter . The court in particular found that , although the arguments on which the applicant \u2019s new application for asylum had been based were the same as in the applicant \u2019s initial application , the new application needed to be reconsidered in the light of the decision of ORG of DATE and on the basis of the new LAW , which had entered into force on DATE . It therefore ordered ORG to reconsider the applicant \u2019s new asylum application .", "CARDINAL . The reconsideration of the applicant \u2019s new asylum application is currently pending . According to the Government , by operation of section CARDINAL of the Refugees and Persons in Need of Complementary or Temporary Protection Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this gives the applicant a lawful ground to stay in GPE for the duration of the said reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . As he could not obtain asylum in GPE and in order to use all possible opportunities to legalise his stay in GPE in order to evade expulsion , in DATE the applicant applied for leave to immigrate , principally relying on the fact that he was married to a NORP citizen . ORG refused to examine his application as there were inconsistences in the spelling of his name in the applicant \u2019s asylum seeker \u2019s certificate and in his passport and marriage certificate . The applicant \u2019s requests for the relevant changes to be made in the documents were allegedly ignored by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further claimed that an official from ORG told him that he would have to leave GPE and to apply for leave to immigrate from abroad in order to obtain leave to enter GPE lawfully .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he could not leave GPE as he had nowhere to go . In GPE his life and health would be endangered and he had not maintained close links with the place where he lived before he had moved to GPE . In his view , he could not apply for leave to immigrate into GPE , as he could not be considered as staying on its territory \u201c on lawful grounds \u201d , which was required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the Government , the applicant could not apply for leave to immigrate while his asylum application was being examined . Furthermore , pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW leave to immigrate could be granted to an alien who had been married to a NORP citizen for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . At the time , the applicant \u2019s marriage had lasted for DATE . Thus , no leave to immigrate could be granted to him on that ground .", "CARDINAL . The parties did not inform the ORG of any further developments in that regard ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
