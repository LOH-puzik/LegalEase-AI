The applicant was born in DATE and is a citizen of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the applicant was temporarily staying in GPE ( LOC , GPE ) , the NORP police initiated criminal proceedings concerning sexual assault of juveniles purportedly committed by him during his previous trip to GPE , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was apprehended by the police and taken into custody on suspicion of having committed sexual assault of juveniles . According to the arrest report , the applicant had been identified by an eyewitness whose name was not indicated . The charges against the applicant were explained to him in LANGUAGE by an officer from ORG . The arrest report noted that the applicant had confirmed that he had understood the substance of the report but had refused to sign to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before a judge of FAC , who decided to detain him on remand . The judge filled in a standard pre - typed form by writing her name , the date of the detention order and other details of the case . In substantiating the decision , the judge had simply to underline the pre - typed text of the standard form , choosing from the following list of grounds for detention : risk of absconding , risk of impeding the investigation , risk of committing crimes , severity of the crime the arrested person is suspected of , his or her personality , occupation , state of health , and \u201c other circumstances \u201d . The judge underlined all of the aforementioned grounds , except the \u201c risk of absconding \u201d , the \u201c state of health \u201d , the \u201c occupation \u201d , and the \u201c other circumstances \u201d . The applicant received the LANGUAGE translation of this order on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's attorney appealed against the detention order to ORG on DATE . The attorney did not attend the hearings that had been scheduled for CARDINAL and DATE . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , taken after a hearing with the applicant 's lawyer 's participation , ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that the impugned order had been taken in accordance with the applicable law . No other reasons were given .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant was officially charged with sexual assault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a judge of FAC , on the request of the public prosecutor in charge of investigation , extended the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE . This decision was not written on a standard form with a pre - typed text . According to that decision , the applicant 's detention was extended on the basis of the reasonableness of the suspicion against the applicant , the severity of the crime with which he was charged , the fact that he had no legal and/or fixed residence in GPE , the danger of his absconding and the possibility that he could impede the investigation . It also mentioned the risk that the applicant could put pressure on witnesses or endanger them .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG . According to the requirements of the law , he submitted his appeal , written in LANGUAGE , to the court that had adopted the disputed order , in order for it to be transmitted to ORG . On DATE ORG sent the applicant 's appeal back to ORG , directing that it should be first translated into NORP . It also directed ORG to provide the applicant with an LANGUAGE translation of its decision , which was done on DATE . The competent judge of ORG sent the applicant 's appeal back to him , in order for him to make the translation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained again to ORG . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared that , by compelling the applicant to translate his appeal himself rather than sending it for translation at the ORG 's expense , the first instance judge had \u201c grossly violated \u201d his fundamental procedural rights guaranteed by law . Consequently , ORG suspended the proceedings and ordered ORG to remedy the above - mentioned shortcomings . The case was also reported to ORG , competent in disciplinary matters involving the judiciary . The case was later assigned to another judge of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a judge of the R\u012bga City Centre District Court , on the request of the public prosecutor in charge of investigation , again extended the applicant 's detention on remand , this time until DATE . The reasoning of this detention order was similar to the first CARDINAL orders . The applicant 's detention was extended on the basis of almost the same grounds : the reasonableness of the suspicion against the applicant , the severity of the crime with which he was charged , the danger of his absconding and the possibility that he could impede the investigation . Contrary to the earlier decisions on the applicant 's detention , this order in addition referred to the possibility that he could \u201c flee after having committed an offence \u201d and specifically mentioned the fact that he had no legal and/or fixed residence in GPE as well as no permanent residence permit there .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . Although the decision set out the applicant 's arguments in detail , the court 's reasoning consisted of repeating the reasons given by the court of first instance and declaring that the latter had acted in conformity with the law . ORG further noted that the appeal against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE was still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG finally examined and dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE , by which his detention had been extended until DATE . The court observed that there continued to be grounds for applying the exceptional measure \u2013 detention . Those grounds included the fact that the applicant had been charged with committing a serious crime , that he had no permanent residence permit in GPE and that he had no permanent place of residence there , as well as the grounds mentioned by the judge of the first instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a board of psychiatrists which established that he had suffered from a mental disorder in the past and that he had undergone treatment in a psychiatric hospital in GPE . However , the board declared itself unable to reach a precise conclusion and recommended the applicant 's internment in a psychiatric hospital for further examination . On DATE experts of ORG , after having observed the applicant in a psychiatric hospital over DATE , found that he was of a sound mind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a judge of the R\u012bga City Centre District Court again extended the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE . The reasoning was practically identical to that in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant 's appeal , in which he inter alia complained that the decision to leave him in detention solely because his residence permit had expired was discriminatory , was dismissed by ORG on DATE , which used similar reasoning to the previous decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the competent judge of the R\u012bga City Centre District Court , on the request of the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation , extended the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE . Besides the usual grounds , the judge 's decision noted :", "\u201c ... Having assessed the gravity of the offence allegedly committed , [ as well as ] the particularities of investigating a case where the victims are children , I consider that ... the length of the remand measure prohibiting PERSON from exercising his freedom of movement is consistent with the character of the socially dangerous act of which he has been accused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the aforementioned detention order , repeating in substance the reasons given by the first instance judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor expanded the charges against the applicant , also accusing him of having molested young boys on the occasion of another trip to GPE , in DATE , DATE and DATE . Besides the existing charge of sexual assault , the applicant was accused of having committed aggravated forcible sexual assault , forcible sodomy , inducing or compelling a juvenile to engage in prostitution , and engaging a juvenile under DATE in production of pornography . On DATE the preliminary investigation was completed and the case - file was handed over to the defence , who finished acquainting themselves with the case on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his lawyer were presented with the final bill of indictment and its LANGUAGE translation . On DATE the case was sent to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG adopted a decision to commit the applicant for trial and to keep him in detention . The decision to keep the applicant in detention was reasoned as follows : \u201c The preventive measure has been chosen in accordance with the accused person 's personality and the gravity of the charges brought [ against him ] , and there is no reason to alter [ that measure ] \u201d . There was no possibility to appeal against that decision ( see below paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After having adjourned hearings of CARDINAL and DATE , by a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of all the crimes he had been accused of and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . According to LAW , the court ordered his deportation from GPE after having served the sentence . The applicant appealed against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC acquitted the applicant of the charges of producing child pornography and reduced the penalty to DATE imprisonment . The remainder of the appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then filed an appeal on points of law , by submitting himself a short handwritten letter that was translated into NORP by a court interpreter . On DATE the ORG of ORG by a decision of a preparatory meeting declared the appeal inadmissible for lack of arguable points of law . DATE , on DATE , the applicant 's lawyer tried to submit to the ORG a more elaborate memorial ; however , it was returned to him since the time - limit for appeal on points of law had elapsed and since the applicant 's own appeal had already been examined and rejected .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had served CARDINAL of his sentence , he was released on parole on DATE and was expelled from GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . The former Code of Criminal Procedure ( ORG ) , a legacy of the NORP era which was amended on numerous occasions , was applicable at the material time . It remained in force until DATE , when it was replaced by the new Criminal Procedure Law ( GPE likums ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of LAW of the ORG , a preventive measure could be applied where plausible reasons existed to suspect that the accused would seek to evade investigation or hinder the determination of the truth in the case . CARDINAL types of preventive measure existed : an undertaking not to change one 's residence , personal guarantees , financial guarantees , police surveillance , house arrest , detention in prison and CARDINAL measures specifically applicable to minors and members of the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the ORG , a preventive measure had to be chosen and implemented on the basis of the following criteria : the seriousness of the alleged offence ; the personality of the accused ; the likelihood that he or she would seek to evade investigation and hinder the determination of the truth in the case ; and the accused 's occupation , age , domestic circumstances and health and other relevant criteria . Any preventive measure had to be applied on the basis of an order giving sufficient reasons .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW of ORG , a preventive measure had to be terminated if it had been applied unlawfully or it ceased to be necessary , or could be changed to ad . The termination or alteration of detention on remand applied by a judge or a court during the preliminary investigation had to be effected by a reasoned decision of a prosecutor , or it could be terminated by a court decision in the cases provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL , all decisions given by a judge at the pre - trial stage regarding the detention on remand and its extension could be appealed to a higher instance court by a suspected or accused person or his counsel or representative within DATE after they found out about that decision . The appeal had to be examined and a decision taken within DATE as of its receipt . The decision was final and not subject to further appeal .", "CARDINAL . After drawing up and signing the final indictment , the public prosecutor 's office had to forward the file to the trial court ( Articles CARDINAL of the ORG ) . Within DATE of receiving the file , a single judge of the trial court , without ruling on the accused 's guilt , had to decide whether the file provided a sufficient basis for committing the accused for trial and whether the preventive measure had been chosen correctly . If he had no objections , the single judge adopted a final decision to commit the accused for trial and leave the preventive measure unchanged ( l\u0113mums par aps\u016bdz\u0113t\u0101 nodo\u0161anu tiesai ) . Such a decision could not be appealed .", "CARDINAL . If the single judge disagreed with the conclusions of the bill of indictment or considered that a preventive measure had to be applied to the accused or that the preventive measure that had been applied previously had to be altered , he convened a preparatory meeting ( r\u012bc\u012bbas s\u0113de ) . The preparatory meeting took a decision either to commit the accused for a trial or to terminate the proceedings or to refer the case back for additional investigation . It also had to decide the question about the preventive measure . The order given following a preparatory hearing was amenable to appeal before a higher court .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL set time - limits for examination of a case and provided that the examination of a case before a court had to start no later than within DATE or , under exceptional circumstances , no later than within DATE , after the case was received by the court . However , this provision was very rarely complied with by the NORP courts ( see GPE v. GPE , no .
