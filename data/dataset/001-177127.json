She maintained that the police could obtain all the information on her telephone calls without any judicial control ; that the police could directly access the computer network and database of mobile telephone operators ; and that the scope of the police authority was unknown , given that the agreement was classified as \u201c top secret \u201d ( strogo povjerljivo ) .
