The PERSON is not intended to prohibit the defence of ideas or doctrines calling into question the constitutional framework . Its aim is rather to reconcile freedom and pluralism with respect for human rights and the protection of democracy .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the impugned LAW constitutional . As regards the very existence of such a LAW making provision for the dissolution of political parties and its purpose which , according to the NORP government , consisted of \u201c establishing a model of militant democracy imposing restrictions on political parties , in particular by imposing on them an obligation , not provided for in the LAW , to accept a given political regime or system \u201d , ORG stated :", "\u201c According to the applicant government , the argument set out above is based on references in certain paragraphs of sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON to the \u2018 constitutional values expressed in constitutional principles and human PERSON ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , to \u2018 democratic principles\u2019 ( sections CARDINAL and PERSON ) ) , to the \u2018 system of GPE and to the \u2018 democratic system\u2019 ( sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ORG ) , sub - paragraph ( c ) ) , to the \u2018 constitutional ORG and to \u2018 public peace\u2019 ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , sub - paragraph ( c ) ) . Despite the fact that the legal significance of those references can be grasped only in the context of each of the provisions containing them and that each of the provisions in question must in turn be interpreted in the light of the law and of the legal system as a whole , the NORP government \u2019s submission that there is no place , in our constitutional order , for a model of \u2018 militant democracy\u2019 within the meaning given to that expression by the Government , namely , a model in which not only compliance with , but also positive acceptance of , the established order and first and foremost the LAW is required , must be endorsed ... The impugned LAW allows for no such model of democracy . Right at the outset , the explanatory memorandum lays down the principle of a distinction between the ideas and aims proclaimed by political parties , on the one hand , and their activities , on the other , and states that \u2018 the only aims explicitly vetoed are those which fall within the criminal law\u2019 , so that \u2018 any project or objective is deemed to be constitutional provided that it is not pursued by means of activities which breach democratic principles or the fundamental rights of ORG . Consequently , and as regards the aspect which is of particular interest here , the PERSON lists as grounds for illegality DATE that is to say , acts \u2013 of political parties which , through their activities , and not through the ultimate aims proclaimed in their manifestos , fail to satisfy the requirements of LAW , which the impugned LAW merely mentions .", "... Secondly , and most importantly , it is clear that the principles and values to which the PERSON refers can be none other than those proclaimed by LAW , and that their content and scope depend on the meaning arising out of the interpretation of the positive constitutional provisions as a whole . Thus , in our system , LAW can only be principles specific to the democratic order arising out of the institutional and normative fabric woven by LAW , the actual functioning of which leads to a system of powers , rights and balances giving form to a variant of the democratic model which is precisely that assumed by LAW in establishing GPE as a social and democratic ORG governed by the rule of law ( LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant parties\u2019 argument that the provisions of the PERSON , namely some of the cases referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( tacit support , for example ) , established a \u201c militant democracy \u201d in breach of the fundamental rights of freedom of ideology , participation , expression and information , ORG stated :", "\u201c ... the system established by DATE of LAW PERSON must firstly be described . The first paragraph refers not to a positive adherence of any kind but to simple respect for constitutional values , which must be demonstrated by political parties when engaging in their activities and which is compatible with the broadest ideological freedom . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that a political party may be declared illegal only \u2018 when as a result of its activities , it infringes democratic principles , in particular when it seeks thereby to impair or to destroy the system of liberties , to hinder or to put an end to the democratic system by repeatedly and seriously engaging in any of the conduct described below\u2019 . Lastly , sub - paragraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) list the general criteria for a party to be declared illegal on account of its activities ... As regards paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the PERSON , the flawed drafting of its introduction might suggest that the instances of behaviour described by that provision are in addition to those specified in the preceding paragraph and that they must therefore be interpreted separately . However , an interpretation of these CARDINAL provisions taken together and an interpretation of the whole section which contains them show that the instances of behaviour described in paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL have the general features described in paragraph CARDINAL of the same section . The instances of behaviour referred to in section GPE ) of the PERSON merely specify or clarify the principal causes of illegality set out in general terms in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . A separate interpretation and application of such conduct can be done only on the basis of the cases provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "That having been said , while it is not for ORG to determine whether or not mere failure to condemn [ terrorist acts ] can be construed as implicit support for terrorism , it is clear that symbolic actions can be used , in certain circumstances , to legitimise terrorist acts or excuse or minimise their anti - democratic effects and implicit violation of fundamental rights . In such circumstances it is plainly impossible to speak of a violation of the right to freedom of expression .", "...", "The same can be said , in general , of sub - paragraph ( c ) of section ORG ) of the PERSON , which provides : \u2018 where , through its activities , it repeatedly and seriously violates democratic principles or seeks to impair or to destroy the system of liberties or to hinder the democratic system or to put an end to it by means of the conduct referred to in section CARDINAL.\u2019 It must also be stated in this regard that that provision concerns only the activities of political parties and in no way extends to their aims or objectives . The wording of that provision shows , therefore , that only those parties which through their activities rather than their ideology effectively and proactively seek to \u2018 impair or to destroy the system of GPE are liable to be dissolved . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the NORP government \u2019s complaint that the dissolution measure prescribed by law was disproportionate , ORG stated :", "\u201c ... taken separately , none of the conduct described in section CARDINAL of the PERSON can entail a party \u2019s dissolution . In order for that measure to be pronounced , as stated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the conduct in question must be engaged in \u2018 repeatedly and PERSON . Secondly , it must be pointed out that the existence of a party which , through its activities , collaborates with or supports terrorist violence , jeopardises the survival of the pluralist order proclaimed by the LAW and that , faced with that danger , dissolution would appear to be the only sanction capable of repairing the damage done to the legal order . Lastly , it must be stressed that LAW contains a definition of a party . According to LAW , a party may only be considered a party if it is the expression of political pluralism . Consequently , it is quite acceptable , constitutionally , for a party whose activities undermine pluralism and to a greater or lesser extent destabilise the democratic order , to be dissolved . Similarly , ORG has considered that even though the margin of appreciation left to GPE must be a narrow one where the dissolution of political parties is concerned , where the pluralism of ideas and parties inherent in democracy is in danger , a ORG may forestall the execution of a policy at the root of that danger [ PERSON ( ORG ) and Others v. GPE , nos . ORG , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , DATE ] .", "... it is not sufficient to establish the existence of just one of the acts described by the LAW . On the contrary , those acts need to be engaged in \u2018 repeatedly and PERSON ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) or \u2018 repeatedly or PERSON ( section GPE ) ) . ... To conclude , [ the relevant provisions ] describe particularly serious conduct and establish as grounds for dissolution only those which are manifestly incompatible with the peaceful and lawful means which are an essential part of the process of political participation to which the LAW requires political parties to lend their qualified support . ... The criteria established by the case - law of ORG as regards the dissolution of political parties have therefore been complied with ( ORG of GPE and Others v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ; ORG and Others v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Reports CARDINAL ; ORG ( \u00d6ZDEP ) v. GPE [ ORG ] , no .

CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ; and ORG ( DEP ) of GPE v. GPE , no . GPE , DATE ) . That case - law states that in order to comply with ORG , the dissolution of a party must satisfy certain criteria , namely : ( a ) the law must include the circumstances and causes of dissolution ( that criterion is clearly satisfied by the rules at issue , since they are set out in a formal law ) ; ( b ) the aim pursued must be legitimate ( which , as indicated above , consists in the instant case of protecting the democratic process of political participation through the exclusion of any associative organisation which could be likened to a party exercising an activity not falling within the constitutional definition of political parties ) ; and ( c ) the dissolution must be \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 ( demonstrated in the context of the foregoing analysis of the specific causes of dissolution provided for by law ) .", "... The fact that convicted terrorists are regularly appointed to positions of leadership or entered on lists of candidates for election may appear to constitute an expression of support for terrorist methods which goes against the obligations imposed by LAW on all political parties . Furthermore , the fact that such a practice can be taken into account only if the convicted terrorists have not \u2018 publicly rejected terrorist aims and ORG can not be interpreted as an obligation to disavow earlier activities . The provision in question [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ] is of prospective effect only and applies only to political parties which are led by convicted terrorists or whose candidates are convicted terrorists . It lays down as a cause of dissolution the regular use of people who may legitimately be assumed to sympathise with terrorist methods rather than with any ideas and programmes that terrorist organisations might seek to implement .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as regards the NORP government \u2019s complaint that the principle of non - retrospectivity in relation to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON and paragraph CARDINAL of the sole transitional provision had been violated , ORG held :", "\u201c For the purposes of applying section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON , which lists the factors that can be taken into account in assessing and characterising activities that may give rise to the dissolution of a political party , the aforementioned paragraph characterises as unlawful \u2018 the establishment , on DATE or following the date of entry into force , of a political party which pursues the activities of another party or succeeds that party with a view to evading application of the provisions of this PERSON in respect of it\u2019 . Worded as it is , that provision can not be held to be unconstitutional as it is quite clear that its sole purpose is to enable section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON to be applied \u2018 to activities pursued after the entry into force of this Institutional Law\u2019 , as stated therein . In no circumstances does it make provision for the judging of activities and acts prior to the PERSON , since only those subsequent to the entry into force of the PERSON are deemed to be relevant .", "In other words , the PERSON specifically states that the various causes that may lead to dissolution of a party may be taken into account only after its entry into force . The activities considered separately and \u2018 the continuing nature or repetition\u2019 of the activities mentioned in section ORG ) , to which the transitional provision refers , are subsequent to the entry into force of the PERSON . That said , for the purposes of determining the significance of those activities and assessing their relevance to the overall conduct of the party concerned ( and for that purpose only , since to take account of conduct pre - dating the effective date of the PERSON in order to justify a declaration of unlawfulness would be unconstitutional because it would constitute a breach of the principle of non - retrospectivity enshrined in LAW ) , it is perfectly possible to take into consideration what the PERSON refers to as the \u2018 trajectory\u2019 ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) of the party in question , which trajectory could encompass acts prior to the entry into force of the PERSON , but that can not in any way be considered as a retrospective effect under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the complaints based on the principle of non bis in idem , the lack of foreseeability and the exceptional nature of the PERSON , the specific features of the judicial proceedings and the allegations concerning the system for founding and registering political parties . Accordingly , it dismissed the applicant parties\u2019 claims , stating in paragraph CARDINAL of its reasoning that sections GPE ) , CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and paragraph CARDINAL of the sole transitional provision of the PERSON were constitutional only if \u201c interpreted in accordance with the terms set out in CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL \u201d of the reasoning of its judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The government of ORG subsequently lodged an application with ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) , which was declared inadmissible on the ground of incompatibility ratione personae on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE delivered in the context of criminal proceedings for illegal association ( Article CARDINAL of the NORP LAW ) , central investigating judge no . CARDINAL at FAC had ordered the suspension of GPE \u2019s activities and the closure , for DATE , of any headquarters and offices that could be used by ORG and GPE . The same measure was applied to EH , which is not an applicant before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , implementing an agreement adopted by ORG on DATE , the Attorney - General ( Abogado del Estado ) lodged an application with ORG on behalf of the NORP government for the dissolution of the political parties ORG , GPE and GPE on the ground that they had breached the new ORG on account of various acts which conclusively demonstrated conduct inconsistent with democracy , constitutional values , democratic practice and the rights of citizens .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) also filed an application with ORG with a view to the dissolution of the political parties ORG , GPE and GPE in accordance with sections CARDINAL et seq . of the PERSON . In his application , he asked ORG to find that the parties in question were illegal , and order that they be removed from the register of political parties , that they immediately cease their activities and that the effects of the PERSON be extended to any party newly created in breach of the PERSON or succeeding any of the parties concerned , that their assets be liquidated and that they be dissolved in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sought the referral of a preliminary question to ORG concerning the constitutionality of the PERSON as it was of the view that the PERSON as a whole , and several of the sections thereof taken separately , violated the rights to freedom of association , freedom of expression and freedom of thought , and the principles of lawfulness , legal certainty , non - retrospectivity of less favourable criminal laws , proportionality and non bis in idem , as well as the right to take part in public affairs .", "CARDINAL . By a unanimous judgment of DATE , ORG refused to refer ORG \u2019s question to ORG , pointing out that that organisation \u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of the PERSON had already been examined and rejected in ORG judgment of DATE . It declared PERSON , GPE and GPE illegal and pronounced their dissolution under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on the ground that they were part of \u201c a terrorist strategy of \u2018 tactical separation\u2019 \u201d . It considered that significant similarities between the CARDINAL parties at issue , and between them and the terrorist organisation ORG \u2013 \u201c CARDINAL organisations having substantially the same ideology ... and , moreover , tightly controlled by that terrorist organisation DATE had been established . It concluded that in reality there existed a \u201c single entity , namely , the terrorist organisation ORG , hidden behind an apparent plurality of legal entities created at different times according to an \u2018 operational succession\u2019 devised in advance by that organisation \u201d . It also liquidated the assets of the parties at issue , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the same PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted in its judgment that , while political parties constituted the essential foundations of political pluralism , they had to engage in their activities and pursue their aims and objectives in accordance with the law and democratic processes , stating that activities involving the use of violence or restricting the fundamental rights of others could not be tolerated . ORG referred to the NORP constitutional system , which , in its view , unlike other legal systems , did not constitute a model of \u201c militant democracy \u201d , since the only condition imposed on the expression of differences was respect for the rights of others . It pointed out that the PERSON recognised that any project or objective was constitutional provided that it was not \u201c pursued by means of activities which breach[ed ] democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens \u201d . In that regard , it pointed out that , by law , political parties were liable to be declared illegal only on the basis of \u201c activities \u201d consisting of serious and repeated conduct . In the instant case , according to ORG , the calls to violence justifying the restriction of the freedoms of the parties at issue stemmed from a deliberate apportionment of tasks between terrorism and politics , ORG devising \u201c justification of the need for terrorism as one of the functions \u201d entrusted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind the historical and social context of the fight against terrorism in GPE , ORG held that the terrorist organisation ORG and its satellite organisation , PERSON ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , had been directing ORG since its creation . To reach that conclusion , it relied on evidence demonstrating the existence of hierarchical links between the CARDINAL organisations and revealing , in particular , that ORG , as ORG \u2019s delegate , had controlled the process of appointing the most senior members of ORG and its successors ( EH and GPE ) and had participated in it . ORG held that ORG had been created in response to ORG \u2019s wish to split armed activity and mass activity \u201c organically and structurally \u201d , which resulted in \u201c clear hierarchical submission \u201d of the parties at issue to the terrorist organisation ORG . In that connection , it referred to a ORG internal document which read as follows :", "\u201c ORG ... considers that armed struggle in association with mass struggle and institutional struggle \u2013 the latter serving the former \u2013 is the key to the advance and triumph of the revolution ; mass struggle likewise requires an historical alliance of ORG , the physical manifestation of which is ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u201c operational succession \u201d held to exist between the CARDINAL political parties that had been declared illegal , ORG relied on the fact that the people occupying posts of responsibility within the CARDINAL organisations \u2013 notably their spokesperson , ORG and belonging to different parliamentary groups , were the same . It also took account of the existence of premises used by all the parties at issue . As regards links between the applicant parties and the terrorist organisation ORG , it noted that several of their members , in particular their spokesperson , ORG , had been convicted of terrorism - related offences .", "CARDINAL .

The court held , secondly , that other conduct of which the applicant parties had been accused , such as the harassment of representatives of non - nationalist parties in the municipalities of GPE and ORG , had contributed to the emergence of a climate of civil confrontation intended to intimidate opponents of terrorism and deprive them of their freedom of opinion .", "CARDINAL . It observed , thirdly , that conduct such as publicly describing ORG prisoners as political prisoners or using the anagram of \u201c PERSON \u201d proved that the parties at issue were using symbols reflecting terrorism or violence . It noted , lastly , that the applicant parties had also taken part in activities in praise of terrorist activities .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the need for and the proportionality of the dissolution of the applicant parties , ORG pointed out that it was taking account of the text of the Convention and of the ORG \u2019s case - law , which would serve as a guide in the interpretation of fundamental constitutional rights , in accordance with LAW of LAW . It considered that , in view of the applicant parties\u2019 frequent calls to violence , as established by the above - mentioned evidence , the measure to dissolve the applicant parties had been justified for the purposes of protecting the fundamental rights of others , \u201c a necessary element of democracy \u201d . ORG referred in particular to the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON ( ORG ) and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ) , considering that that judgment imposed on parties claiming to exercise functions in a democratic society a real legal duty to distance themselves from any ambiguous or unclear messages as to the use of violence ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . It pointed out furthermore that the calls to violence at issue in the case before it appeared to be more explicit than those at issue in the case submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . GPE and ORG lodged CARDINAL amparo appeals with ORG against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their appeals , they complained firstly of the lack of impartiality of the President of ORG , who had been the reporting judge in the proceedings leading to their dissolution even though he was the president of ORG , the body which had issued a favourable report on the bill resulting in the PERSON at issue . They submitted that the conflation of jurisdictional and consultative functions in CARDINAL person had resulted in a loss of objective impartiality . GPE relied in that regard on LAW ( right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal ) .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant parties alleged that the guarantees of a fair trial had not been rigorously observed in so far as the dissolution of GPE had been based , inter alia , on the conduct attributed to certain PERSON and PERSON municipal councillors , who had made an alleged member of ORG and an ORG member who had been convicted and had served his sentence honorary citizens ( hijo predilecto ) , facts which had been established ex parte , after completion of the phase of the proceedings during which new evidence could be introduced and without the applicant parties having been able to defend themselves against such allegations .", "CARDINAL . They complained , thirdly , of a violation of the presumption of innocence , submitting that the facts deemed to have been proven in the judgment of ORG had been based on a single press release and that GPE and its members had been deemed to have carried out acts attributable to another political organisation , namely EH . Moreover , they criticised the judgment of DATE for having considered as established fact that ORG had been created on the basis of an agreement between the leaders of ORG and ORG , and that ORG , GPE and GPE were in fact one and the same organisation which had been assigned certain functions by ORG and which acted under the instructions of the latter , while those allegations had actually been based on documents having no probative value and on the statements of expert witnesses working for the NORP government .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , and lastly , the applicant parties considered that their right to freedom of expression , thought and association had been breached as a result of their dissolution .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL unanimous judgments of DATE ORG dismissed the appeals .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment on ORG \u2019s amparo appeal , ORG repeated the arguments contradicting the applicant parties\u2019 submissions concerning \u201c militant democracy \u201d set out in its judgment of DATE . It pointed out that \u201c any project or objective [ was ] constitutional provided that it [ was ] not pursued by means of activities which breach[ed ] democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens \u201d . It also pointed out that \u201c the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of the PERSON ha[d ] been recognised by judgment CARDINAL \u201d and that \u201c the answers to the objections raised by GPE as to the constitutionality [ of the conduct described by the provisions of the PERSON at issue ] could be found in the legal bases of that LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated :", "\u201c The refusal of a political party to condemn terrorist attacks can be seen , in certain cases , as \u2018 [ ... ] tacit political support for ORG [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ORG ] , or \u2018 legitimising terrorist actions for political ends\u2019 [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) PERSON ] , in so far as it may excuse terrorism or minimise the significance thereof ... The failure to condemn terrorist actions also constitutes a tacit or implicit manifestation of a certain attitude towards terror . ... Against a backdrop of terrorism that has been in place for DATE , with those responsible always legitimising terror by claiming equality between the types of forces fighting each other and by presenting it as the only possible solution to an allegedly historical conflict , the refusal of a party to condemn a specific terrorist attack , which undeniably reflects that party \u2019s wish to disassociate itself from the condemnatory stance taken by other parties in relation to such acts , is all the more significant since it reflects the position of a party which has sought to pass off the terrorist phenomenon as an inevitable reaction to the past and unjust aggression of a terrorised ORG . ... Furthermore , ... the refusal to condemn [ terrorist acts ] , combined with serious and repeated acts and conduct , indicates an accommodation with terror which runs counter to organised coexistence in the context of a democratic ORG . ... It must therefore be concluded that it would not appear to be unreasonable or erroneous to take account of facts judicially established in proceedings having observed all the guarantees covering the grounds for dissolution laid down by the PERSON \u2013 whose unconstitutionality in abstracto was ruled out by ORG judgment no . DATE thus ruling out any possibility of a breach of LAW , and that no substantive fundamental right , such as the right of political association ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) , the right to freedom of conscience ( LAW ) and the right to freedom of expression ( LAW ( a ) of LAW ) has been breached . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in the reasoning of its judgment ORG pointed out that in its appeal , GPE had literally alleged that the effect of the PERSON \u201c had been to deprive ideologies linked to terrorism and violence of any possibility of developing lawfully , in breach of the procedural definition of democracy \u201d , and had argued that the PERSON at issue declared unlawful \u201c the mere fact of providing political and ideological support to the actions of terrorist organisations with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order \u201d . It held that this \u201c link with terrorism and violence \u201d ... \u201c fell outside the constitutionally legitimate scope of the exercise of freedom of association and freedom of expression and could therefore be prohibited by the democratic legislature \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards ORG amparo appeal , ORG again referred to its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , in which it had indicated that the various causes of dissolution of parties could only be taken into account as of the entry into force of the PERSON , stating , however , that \u201c for the purpose of determining the significance [ of the activities listed by the PERSON ] and assessing their importance having regard to the overall conduct of the party at issue ( and for such purposes only , since to take account of conduct prior to the entry into force of the LAW in order to justify a declaration of illegality [ would have been ] unconstitutional in that it [ would have ] breached the principle of non - retrospectivity enshrined in LAW ) , it [ was ] perfectly possible to take into consideration what the PERSON called the \u2018 trajectory\u2019 ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) of the party at issue which could encompass conduct prior to the entry into force of the PERSON , without it being possible in any circumstances to consider that to be a case of retrospective application prohibited by LAW . ORG pointed out that the applicant party had not been dissolved because of acts pre - dating the entry into force of the PERSON or conduct attributable to other parties , but because it had been held that GPE , ORG and EH \u201c constituted \u2018 successive units\u2019 of a single reality \u2013 namely a political organisation used as a tool by a terrorist group for unlawful purposes \u2013 , that the successive forms assumed by a single political party had de facto been dissolved , and that the dissolution pronounced by ORG had been based on subsequent facts stated as being entirely attributable to the applicant party on account of the fact that ORG had found the CARDINAL dissolved parties to be materially identical \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG dismissed the complaints of lack of impartiality and failure to comply with the principle of adversarial proceedings as lacking any constitutional basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ended the ceasefire that it had declared on DATE . Since that date , several fatal attacks have been carried out in GPE .", "\u201c Political parties are the expression of political pluralism ; they contribute to the formation and expression of the will of the people and are an essential instrument for political participation .
