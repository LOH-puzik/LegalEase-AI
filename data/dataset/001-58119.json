Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr K .- F. was born in DATE and is a NORP national . He was formerly a lawyer and lives with his wife in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and his wife rented a holiday flat at Ulmen at a DATE rent of CARDINAL or MONEY ( ORG ) . They occupied the flat from CARDINAL DATE and paid DEM CARDINAL rent for their stay in DATE", "CARDINAL . On DATE the landlady of the flat , PERSON , asked PERSON for payment of rent arrears , including telephone calls , of MONEY CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at CARDINAL , Mrs. PERSON telephoned Cochem - Zell police station and reported that PERSON and PERSON had caused a car accident . She added that they had rented her flat without intending to perform their obligations as tenants and were about to make off without paying what they owed .", "CARDINAL . Following that call , QUANTITY police officers went to the flat and took statements from the landlord and the landlady ( PERSON and PERSON ) and the tenants . The owners admitted that , for fear that PERSON and PERSON would make off without paying the rent , they had attempted to stop the couple \u2019s son from driving off ; they emphasised , however , that he had been determined to force his way through at all costs . PERSON and PERSON , on the other hand , said that the accident had been caused by PERSON aggressive and incomprehensible behaviour towards their son .", "CARDINAL . NORP After consulting the appropriate public prosecutor ( FAC ) , the police officers inquired into the address of the applicant and his wife at Bad GPE and discovered that it was merely a Post Office box . The Bad GPE police also informed them that the applicant had previously been under investigation for fraud .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE Detective Sergeant Laux , accompanied by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , arrested PERSON and PERSON and their son and took them to Cochem - Zell police station so that their identities could be checked . The son was released shortly afterwards but PERSON and PERSON K .- F. were provisionally held in police custody . In a report drawn up at TIME the police stated that they strongly suspected PERSON and PERSON of rent fraud ( PERSON ) and that there was a risk that they would abscond . The questioning ended at TIME", "CARDINAL . Inquiries made during TIME into the applicant \u2019s various addresses revealed that he had been the subject of other criminal proceedings on suspicion of fraud and that ORG ) had opened a preliminary investigation in respect of him for the same reason .", "CARDINAL . On TIME ( TIME and TIME ) , PERSON of the Cochem - Zell police questioned the applicant further . His wife was interviewed at TIME", "CARDINAL . At TIME ORG informed PERSON , likewise of the Cochem - Zell police , that he did not intend to issue a warrant for the applicant \u2019s arrest .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr and PERSON were released and taken back to Ulmen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged a complaint against PERSON and PERSON alleging attempted rent fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his wife on the ground that it had not been proved that Mr and PERSON had not intended DATE or had not been able \u2013 to pay the rent owed , as they had paid most of the arrears in DATE and there was a civil dispute over the balance . Furthermore , the incident that had occurred at Ulmen on DATE did not justify concluding that PERSON and PERSON had not intended to pay their debts , as only their son had attempted to drive off and there was no concrete evidence to show that they had sought to make off surreptitiously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr K .- F. lodged a complaint with ORG against the police officers and public prosecutors concerned in the events of CARDINAL and DATE alleging false imprisonment ( GPE ) , attempted coercion ( versuchter PERSON ) and insulting behaviour ( PERSON ) . He maintained that his arrest and detention at Cochem - Zell police station had been unlawful , since he had not committed any criminal offence as only the rent tribunal had jurisdiction to hear disputes over the amount of rent . The police officers had likewise acted unlawfully in recording his personal details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings against Detective PERSON and CARDINAL other police officers who had taken part in the arrest , and against the CARDINAL public prosecutors . The ORG considered that in all the circumstances they had not acted unlawfully . In particular , the police officers who had gone to Ulmen during TIME of CARDINAL DATE had had reasonable grounds for suspecting PERSON and PERSON of defrauding PERSON and PERSON and intending to leave without paying the sums due .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( Generalstaatsanwaltschaft ) , who confirmed the decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) for an order that Detective PERSON and PERSON , PERSON and PERSON be prosecuted for attempted coercion and false imprisonment .", "He described what had happened and said that it had been agreed between his wife and PERSON that the rent would be paid on DATE . That agreement had not been to the liking of PERSON , who had assaulted his son to prevent him driving off . His wife had even called the police for assistance . Furthermore , neither he nor his wife had intended to leave the rented flat ; they had not started to pack any suitcases and their personal belongings were still in the cupboards and drawers . The police ORG brutal searching of him , his wife and his son , the searching of their home , their arrest and their subsequent detention had accordingly been totally illegal for want of any basis in law , as they had not complied with the requirements of either LAW taken together with LAW of LAW ( Strafproze\u00dfordnung \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON application on the ground that there was insufficient cause to prosecute the police officers ( kein hinreichender PERSON ) .", "It held , inter alia :", "\u201c There is sufficient cause to prosecute where , in the light of all the evidence and the prosecution \u2019s assessment of the facts , it is to be expected that the potential defendants will be convicted ( cf . ORG , [ Code of Criminal Procedure ] , CARDINALth ed . , \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ) . The findings of the investigation do not found such an expectation . There would have been sufficient cause to prosecute for false imprisonment ( LAW ) if the accused police officers had unlawfully taken the applicants to the police station and held them there . The investigation did not disclose any such unlawful act . The inquiries made at Ulmen gave the police officers on duty cause to suspect a fraud on PERSON and PERSON [ S. ] ( rent arrears and telephone bills amounting to MONEY ) , especially as the applicants had admitted that they were not then able to find that sum . Furthermore , according to the statements of the witnesses [ J. ] and [ S. ] ( page CARDINAL of file FAC ) and the findings of the accused police officers ( position of the wheels of the vehicle ... \u2013 page CARDINAL of the above - mentioned file ) , the accused police officers had the impression that \u2018 [ K .- F. ] intended to drive off come what might\u2019 . The fact that the accused police officers , in the light of all these circumstances , consequently suspected the applicant of \u2018 attempted rent ORG can not be criticised . The arrest was accordingly , on the facts , likewise justified . At the police station the alleged offenders , who had had the applicants\u2019 address checked , learned that , according to inquiries made at Bad Orb , the address there was \u2018 fictitious\u2019 and that , according to further inquiries made of ORG , several sets of proceedings were pending against the applicants for fraud . The applicants\u2019 detention at the police station was therefore justified . The question whether it was necessary to hold them until TIME can be left open in the instant case as , on grounds of intent at least , the potential GPE conviction on a charge of false imprisonment is unlikely .", "Nor did the investigation disclose sufficient evidence of joint coercion ( LAW ) . On the basis of the information obtained at ORG that has previously been referred to , the accused police officers could reasonably presume that an offence had been committed . It was accordingly lawful in the circumstances to carry out a search ( LAW , third sentence , of LAW ) . Besides , even if it were to be accepted that there had been coercion , the accused police ORG behaviour could not be considered reprehensible within the meaning of LAW . For the purposes of that provision , reprehensible behaviour is behaviour which in all the circumstances is so manifestly objectionable that it calls for punishment under the criminal law as a gross interference with other people \u2019s exercise of free will ( see ORG of ORG , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "Measured against these principles , the accused police ORG behaviour can not be said to have been reprehensible . The findings of the investigation at Ulmen \u2013 before the police officers entered the premises \u2013 and in particular the conduct of the ORG son , who , according to the [ S. ] family , sought to drive off aggressively in his car , could perfectly well have led the police officers to believe that the applicants might also make off without paying their relatively substantial rent arrears .", "ORG was therefore right to discontinue the proceedings , there being insufficient cause to bring a prosecution for false imprisonment and coercion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that no official decision had been taken on the allegations against PERSON of the Cochem - Zell police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued proceedings in that case also . It said that the offences of insulting behaviour were statute - barred . As to the offences of attempted coercion and false imprisonment , it pointed to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE to justify discontinuing the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reopened the investigation in respect of PERSON and took several written statements , including one from Mr K .- F. and one from PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings permanently .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG , which confirmed it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr K .- F. , relying on the same arguments as before ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , made a further application to ORG for an order that PERSON be prosecuted for attempted coercion , false imprisonment and insulting behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application on the ground that there was not sufficient cause to bring a prosecution against the superintendent .", "It held , inter alia :", "\u201c There would be sufficient cause to bring a prosecution for false imprisonment ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) if the accused police officer had unlawfully prevented the applicant from leaving the police station . According to the reasons set out on p. CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( CARDINAL Ws DATE ) , the applicant was held at the police station lawfully . In the aforementioned judgment the ORG had already explained that the question whether it had been necessary to hold the applicant in detention until TIME could be left open as , on grounds of intent at least , the potential defendants ( PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) were unlikely to be convicted of false imprisonment . In his report dated DATE ( pp . CARDINAL et seq . of the file ) Detective PERSON said ( p. CARDINAL ) that \u2018 PERSON and PERSON ] and their son were first taken to the police station so that their identity could be checked\u2019 and PERSON and PERSON ] were held in police custody after consultation of ORG . PERSON . The second sentence of LAW provides that the checking of a person \u2019s identity by police officers must be conducted in accordance with LAW b LAW of that code . A person affected by a measure taken under LAW for the purposes of checking his identity can not be deprived of his liberty for TIME in all . The applicant was detained at TIME on CARDINAL DATE ( page CARDINAL ) and released at TIME on DATE ( page CARDINAL ) . For this detention , which lasted for TIME , PERSON was responsible . On the basis of the evidence as it currently stands , however , it appears unlikely that he would be convicted of false imprisonment as ultimately it will not be possible to establish that he was aware that the maximum permitted period had been exceeded .", "A conviction for coercion ( LAW ) appears equally unlikely .", "As to the applicant \u2019s allegation that he was ordered to leave the district ( GPE ) , the decision to discontinue the proceedings rightly points out that it is far removed from reality . The \u2018 raised fist\u2019 and the assertion that \u2018 sparks are going to fly\u2019 are denied in the accused police officer \u2019s statement . No other evidence , beyond the applicant \u2019s statements , is to be found . On the basis of the evidence as it currently stands , the decision to discontinue the proceedings can not be criticised . For these reasons , no offence of extorting a confession ( LAW ) has been made out either . Given the information to which the ORG has already referred in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the checking of the applicant \u2019s identity was justified . Nor , lastly , can the accused police officer be said to be guilty of coercive behaviour in having forbidden the applicant to enter the flat at Ulmen to collect personal belongings . In the police officer \u2019s view , his behaviour can not be shown to have been reprehensible since he had cause to believe that as the rent for the holiday flat had not been paid as agreed , the landlord was entitled to exercise a lien .", "The application to the ORG against the refusal to prosecute ( ORG ) was at first sight also admissible in respect of the accusation of insulting behaviour , because the reported criminal act within the meaning of LAW also includes the offences of coercion and false imprisonment , which only ORG can prosecute ( PERSON ) . As , however , there is insufficient cause to bring a prosecution for the offences which can be prosecuted only officially , the third sentence of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW again operates to bar ( Sperrwirkung ) the present proceedings to challenge the refusal to prosecute in respect of the alleged insulting behaviour , an offence that can be prosecuted privately ( PERSON ) , so that the ORG is unable to consider the merits of the related accusation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint ( ORG ) with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) alleging a violation of his fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL members , declined to accept the complaint for adjudication .", "CARDINAL .
