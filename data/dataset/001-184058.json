The requests were discussed during the hearing , in the presence of all parties . The prosecutor argued that the request to hear a witness should be rejected , since the family \u2019s income could not be established with witness statements .", "CARDINAL .

On the merits of their appeal , the ORG lawyer argued that all property confiscated had been acquired from the legal income earned jointly by ORG and the first applicant . In this connection , he referred to the accountant \u2019s report included in the file .

In the meantime , the first and second applicants submitted written pleadings complaining that the second applicant had never been summoned to appear before ORG and had never been asked by the courts to submit evidence on how she had acquired the confiscated property . They also claimed that all their assets had been acquired through the efficient management of the family \u2019s lawful income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . The court held that from the high number of criminal acts committed by ORG it could be inferred that he had established a habit in taking bribes which could have started long before the period that had been investigated . At the same time , PERSON and his family , the first and second applicants , had accumulated a considerable fortune in DATE . ORG further observed that it was clear from the evidence in the file that part of the confiscated goods were the direct proceeds of ORG \u2019s crimes , whereas other assets belonged to the first and second applicants . The court concluded that it could be inferred from an analysis of the lawful income of the first applicant and the lack of income of the second applicant that the assets found in their names had also been acquired through ORG criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that there was a considerable discrepancy between the family \u2019s lawful income and its assets , and that GPE and the applicants had not supplied proof that the confiscated assets had been lawfully acquired . The court reasoned as follows :", "\u201c Between CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL while the defendant was under surveillance he received various sums of money and other goods from CARDINAL people who had come to his office for a medical examination in order to obtain a decision on retirement due to loss of capacity to work or to obtain an official certification of their degree of disability in order to benefit from social security benefits . As the lower court also held , the defendant has confessed to all the charges against him and he has been convicted to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment .", "As a result of this criminal conviction , the first - instance court considered that the requirements of LAW had been fulfilled and ordered the extended confiscation of money , flats and vehicles , items which had a value exceeding the income of the defendant and his family in DATE ....", "As regards the income of the defendant and his family , the court observes that he submitted an accountant \u2019s report showing the family \u2019s income starting with DATE , but without mentioning their expenses for DATE .", "In order to establish whether there was a discrepancy between the family \u2019s income and their properties and other goods acquired , the court must compare the amounts of money spent during the period of the acquisition of the properties in question with the income . Based on the documents submitted to the file , including an evaluation report submitted by ORG on DATE , the court concludes that there is a significant difference between the income and the assets accumulated . The above - mentioned report evaluated especially the assets acquired by the defendant \u2019s wife [ the first applicant ] mostly from her salary . Even if this salary had been higher than the defendant \u2019s and even assuming that they also had earnings from real - estate transactions , they could not have accumulated enough money to acquire such a large number of properties and vehicles . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the second applicant , the court held that she was currently a student and there was no proof in the file to show that she had ever had an income . Her allegations that the property found in her name had been acquired from donations from other members of the family had not been proved . Therefore , the conclusion of the first - instance court that the property she owned had been purchased with money from her parents was considered correct .", "CARDINAL . As regards the appeal submitted by the third applicant , the court held that no evidence had been submitted to the file to show that ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL belonged to her and had been given to LOC for safekeeping .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG concluded with final effect that the first - instance court had correctly applied the legal provisions in the case and had even decided to lift the seizure order in respect of certain items ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
