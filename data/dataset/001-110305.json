The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father , PERSON , was chairman and managing director of the ORG and ORG companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lambda , a company representing certain shareholders in ORG and ORG , lodged a complaint for misappropriation of corporate assets , together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , PERSON was sent before ORG on suspicion of having , DATE , as chairman and managing director of ORG and ORG in GPE , knowingly fraudulently misused assets of those companies against their interest , in particular by letting them bear the full cost of an DATE licence fee equal to PERCENT of the CARDINAL ORG turnover , only part of which was justified , for his personal gain or to help another company in which he had a direct or indirect interest .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL agreements were signed for the purpose : CARDINAL on DATE , between ORG and ORG , and the other on DATE , between ORG and ORG . They were adopted by the general assemblies of ORG and ORG on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the prosecution against PERSON time - barred , the starting point for the purposes of limitation being fixed at CARDINAL and DATE , the dates of signature of the agreements by the shareholders . As a result , the court declared the civil party action brought by Lambda inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Lambda and the public prosecutor at the GPE tribunal de grande instance appealed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG confirmed the judgment in all its provisions . Lambda appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE J .- L. Lagard\u00e8re died .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , after declaring that the prosecution had lapsed , this time as a result of the accused \u2019s death , ORG quashed and annulled the judgment of ORG concerning the civil action , considering that the moment at which time had started to run for the purposes of limitation was the presentation of the ORG special report to the general assemblies , which post - dated the signature of the disputed agreements . The case was sent before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Jean - Luc Lagard\u00e8re \u2019s heirs , his widow ORG and the applicant , challenged that court \u2019s competence to judge the civil action .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed that objection , considering that the civil action continued when the offender \u2019s death occurred after a decision on the criminal prosecution had been given .", "CARDINAL . It declared the instances of misappropriation of corporate assets committed in DATE time - barred , but not those committed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court accordingly considered that it had first to determine whether the constituent elements of the offence of misappropriation of corporate assets were established in respect of PERSON late father . To do this it examined \u201c the personal interest \u201d in the signature and execution of the contracts in issue , \u201c whether they were against the corporate interests of ORG and ORG \u201d , and whether PERSON had acted in \u201c bad faith \u201d . It concluded its reasoning in the following terms :", "\u201c the system set in place ... at the request of Mr [ J .- L. ] Lagard\u00e8re ... constitutes the offence of misappropriation of corporate assets to the detriment of ORG and ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that the profit had been MONEY ( ORG ) , or MONEY ( ORG ) , without any real added value for the injured companies .", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of its judgment ORG held :", "\u201c that the constituent elements of the offence of misappropriation of corporate assets to the detriment ORG and ORG are established for that period against Mr ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In view of that finding ORG ordered ORG and the applicant , as the heirs , to pay the civil party ORG in damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , ORG , ORG and ORG at ORG appealed on points of law . In support of his appeal the applicant argued that there had been a violation of LAW because the criminal court had no authority to judge the matter after his father \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion on the appeal the advocate - general at ORG , having examined the different possible solutions and the relevant legal theory and case - law , concluded that ORG had no authority to judge the civil action after PERSON ORG death . He also justified his opinion on principle . First , he pointed out that whatever the place reserved for the victim in the criminal trial , the judgment of the civil action remained contingent on the outcome of the criminal proceedings as it required the prior demonstration of the existence of an offence of which a particular individual was guilty , which ruled out the possibility of continuing the action against the heirs . He cited a passage from an authoritative work ( PERSON p\u00e9nale , by Professors PERSON , GPE and GPE , CARDINALth edition ) : \u201c in our modern law we no longer bring actions against the dead or the memory of the dead \u201d . Next , he explained that the need for a violation of the criminal law which was inherent in any decision of the criminal courts justified the fact that , for the court even to rule only on the civil action , the accused had to be given a criminal trial that respected the \u201c principle that hearings must be oral ... and the adversarial nature of the trial , which was an essential component of a fair trial . In other words , in order for the criminal court to be able to rule , in both the criminal and the civil proceedings , there is a condition : the effective participation of the accused in his trial \u201d . This meant that in order for the criminal court to be able to examine the civil action alone , it would be necessary for the accused \u201c at CARDINAL time or another , to have had an effective opportunity to submit his arguments in full concerning the presence and the solidity of all the constituent elements of the offence with which he has been charged , and his responsibility in the matter \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG declared ORG appeal inadmissible and rejected those lodged by the applicant and ORG", "CARDINAL . Regarding the arguments submitted by the applicant , the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c In overruling the objection that the criminal court had no authority to hear the civil action brought by the heirs of [ J .- L. Lagard\u00e8re ] because no decision had been given on the merits in the criminal proceedings prior to the death of the accused , the judgment states , among other things , that the proceedings and the judgment found that the prosecution was time - barred before the accused died ; furthermore , the criminal court to which the case was remitted by ORG is the only court competent to determine whether the prosecution was time - barred and whether , having regard to the civil claim , the constituent elements of the offence of misappropriation of corporate assets have been made out ;", "In pronouncing itself in those terms the Court of Appeal justified its decision ;", "Trial courts before which action was lawfully taken before the criminal prosecution lapsed continue to have jurisdiction in the civil proceedings ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Ruling on the civil party claim , it quashed and annulled the judgment of ORG solely on the issue of the capitalisation of the interest on the sums owed by ORG heirs . On that occasion it noted that ORG had \u201c found PERSON guilty \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who has personally suffered damage directly caused by a criminal offence may bring civil - party proceedings to seek compensation for such damage . ... \u201d", "\u201c Civil - party proceedings may be conducted simultaneously with the public prosecution and before the same court .", "Civil - party proceedings may be brought for any head of damage , whether pecuniary or physical or non - pecuniary , caused by the acts under prosecution \u201d", "\u201c Civil - party proceedings may also be conducted separately from the public prosecution , before a civil court .", "However , judgment in civil - party proceedings brought in a civil court shall be suspended until final judgment has been given in any public prosecution .", "Setting the public prosecution in motion does not suspend the other actions before the civil court , whatever their nature , even if the decision to bring criminal proceedings is likely to directly or indirectly influence the outcome of the civil proceedings . \u201d", "\u201c A party who has brought proceedings in a civil court may not refer the same complaint to a criminal court unless the prosecution has preferred charges in that court before the civil court has ruled on the merits . \u201d", "\u201c The public prosecution for the imposition of a penalty is extinguished by the death of the defendant or by limitation , amnesty , the repeal of the criminal law and res judicata . \u201d", "\u201c When civil action is taken before a criminal court , limitation is governed by the rules of public prosecution . When the action is taken before a civil court , limitation is governed by LAW .", "When the court has made a ruling on the public prosecution , the investigative measures ordered by the criminal court on the civil claims alone are governed by the rules of civil procedure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When criminal and civil proceedings are brought simultaneously before the criminal court , the civil action is considered contingent on the outcome of the criminal prosecution ( see , for example , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . crim . no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecution is extinguished by the death of the accused during the appeal on points of law . When ORG of ORG decides to discontinue the proceedings , the criminal courts can no longer rule on the criminal proceedings and therefore have no authority to examine the civil action ( Court of Cassation , Criminal Division , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . crim . no . CARDINAL ) . If the accused dies before any decision is reached on the merits , the criminal court has no authority to examine the civil action ( Court of Cassation , Criminal Division , DATE ; CARDINAL DATE , Bull . crim . no .

The criminal courts can rule on the civil action only where a decision has been reached in the criminal proceedings ( Court of Cassation , Criminal Division , DATE , ORG . crim . no . CARDINAL ) .
