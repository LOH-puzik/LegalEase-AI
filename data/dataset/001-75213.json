The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL others , all of whom were charged with fraudulent bankruptcy , were committed for trial in LOC . After numerous adjournments on account of failure to serve proper notice or ORG strikes , a hearing was held on DATE . At the hearing the lawyer retained by PERSON produced a list of witnesses he wanted to be summoned to appear in court . They were mainly people who would say that the applicant had been less directly involved in the management of GPE , a commercial company , after DATE . The president of the court granted the request .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , PERSON was represented by a different lawyer of his choosing , PERSON , whom he had retained on DATE . PERSON produced the list of witnesses again . The court again granted leave for the persons named in the list to be summoned . A number of witnesses were examined on DATE in the presence of the applicant and PERSON", "CARDINAL . NORP In a note deposited with the registry of ORG on DATE , PERSON announced that he was withdrawing from the case . He said that the applicant had been informed accordingly by registered letter sent on DATE . On DATE the court assigned the applicant a defence lawyer , PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr B. was informed of the date of the next hearing ( DATE ) . The note he received did not , however , mention that he had been officially assigned to represent Mr LANGUAGE . No notification was sent to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr B. did not appear at the hearing on CARDINAL DATE , but the applicant did . The court ordered PERSON to be replaced by another official defence lawyer , PERSON , and adjourned the case to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On that date PERSON again failed to appear , but the applicant was present . The court ordered PERSON to be replaced by another official defence lawyer , PERSON of the witnesses called by the prosecution was examined by the prosecution \u2019s representative and cross - examined by the lawyer of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants . The court adjourned the proceedings to CARDINAL DATE and ordered the other witnesses to be summoned .", "CARDINAL . On that date PERSON again failed to appear , but the applicant was present . The court ordered PERSON to be replaced by another official defence lawyer , Mr O. Mr PERSON made a number of spontaneous statements . A witness called by the prosecution was examined . Having regard to the absence of CARDINAL other prosecution witnesses , the court adjourned its examination of the case to DATE . The hearing was not held on that date and the proceedings were adjourned on account of the NORP parliamentary elections .", "CARDINAL . Further hearings were held on DATE and DATE and on DATE and DATE , to which the witnesses on the applicant \u2019s list were not summoned . PERSON , who had still not appeared , was replaced by a different court - appointed defence lawyer each time .", "CARDINAL . The record of the hearing on DATE mentions that the applicant was present , which the applicant himself denies . He states that he attended his trial for the last time on CARDINAL DATE and that after the adjournment of DATE he was not notified of the date of the next hearing ( DATE ) . A notice of hearing had in fact been issued to a person who did not have authorisation ( persona non abilitata ) to receive notices . The Government produced a note ( relata di notifica ) before the ORG , drawn up by a court bailiff , according to which notice of the hearing on DATE had been served personally on DATE on a person identifying himself as PERSON . The applicant maintains that the signature appearing on the note is not his and that on DATE he was not at home , but at FAC in GPE del Tronto , as had been proved by his lawyer in the appeals lodged after his conviction . Furthermore , he alleges , the indication that the notice of hearing was served on him personally was added by the court bailiff DATE after the material time , \u201c at the request of the office of ORG at ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A final hearing was held on DATE . Neither the applicant nor PERSON appeared . PERSON was replaced by a court - appointed lawyer . Witnesses were examined .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the court \u2019s registry on DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not officially informed that the judgment against him had been deposited with the registry . He submits that , not having been aware of the conviction , he was unable to avail himself of his right to appeal within the statutory DATE period .", "CARDINAL . He claims that he did not learn of his conviction DATE which had become final on CARDINAL DATE \u2013 until DATE , when he asked for a copy of his criminal record .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also learnt that PERSON had been appointed to represent him , whereupon he contacted him .", "CARDINAL . Through PERSON the applicant lodged an application on DATE for leave to appeal out of time . He claims that the notice of the date of the hearing of DATE was void on the ground that the court bailiff \u2019s report did not refer to the standing of the person on whom it had been served . Moreover , PERSON appointment was DATE he alleges \u2013 unlawful because his name did not appear on the list of official defence lawyers . In any event PERSON had never been informed of his appointment . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the time - limit for lodging an appeal had therefore never started running .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , again through PERSON , the applicant appealed against the judgment of DATE . He sought an acquittal on the merits and requested the investigation to be reopened for the purpose of hearing evidence from the witnesses indicated in the defence \u2019s list .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG dismissed the application for leave to appeal out of time . It observed that the applicant referred to matters regarding the conduct of the trial at first instance that should have been raised prior to the date on which the judgment of DATE had become final . Leave to appeal out of time was granted only where the convicted person proved that he had been prevented by a case of force majeure from taking certain steps within the statutory time - limit , and not where he alleged procedural defects . In those conditions it was not necessary to ascertain whether the facts of which the applicant complained were genuine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He alleged that ORG had wrongly construed the relevant provisions of domestic law , namely , ORG and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . He stated that , through no fault of his own , he had not been aware of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It observed that the applicant was complaining of flaws in the appointment of his court - appointed defence counsel and the service of the notice of the date of the hearing of DATE . Those flaws could have resulted in certain measures being annulled on grounds of procedural errors , but had been cured ( sanate ) when the conviction had become final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office ordered execution of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Execution was stayed , however .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the application of an alternative measure to detention , namely , probation ( affidamento in prova al servizio sociale ) . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request . On DATE the applicant declared that he accepted the obligations stipulated in the probation order , namely , not to leave the district ( comune ) of PERSON without prior authorisation of the judge supervising enforcement of sentences ; to devote himself fully to his work at the LOC company ; not to leave his house before TIME and not to return after TIME ; not to associate with reoffenders ; and to report to the police station CARDINAL times per week .", "CARDINAL .

The validity of a conviction may be contested by means of an objection to execution under LAW of the ORG , the relevant parts of which provide :", "\u201c Where the judge supervising enforcement establishes that a judgment is invalid or has not become enforceable , he shall , [ after ] assessing on the merits [ nel merito ] whether the safeguards in place for a convicted person deemed to be untraceable have been observed , ... suspend its enforcement , ordering , where necessary , that the person be released and that defects in the service of process be remedied .
