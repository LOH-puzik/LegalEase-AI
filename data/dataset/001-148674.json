On DATE , on an appeal by the applicant , the decision of the administrative commission was revoked by a decision of ORG , which on DATE was forwarded to ORG . At the same time , on CARDINAL DATE ORG approved the recommendation by ORG to transfer the applicant to Daugavpils Prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on DATE the governor of ORG issued an order to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the order was executed despite the fact that the initial decision of DATE had been revoked , and the applicant \u2013 who in the meantime had been admitted to the prison hospital DATE was transferred to FAC .

The court also took into account the actions of the management of FAC and the duration of the applicant \u2019s stay there .", "CARDINAL . ORG partly upheld that decision , after analysing whether the applicant \u2019s transfer to a more stringent regime amounted to a significant infringement of his rights under LAW .
