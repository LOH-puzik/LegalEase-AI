A number of people were killed in the attack , which appears to have been politically motivated .", "Superintendent PERSON was put in charge of the investigation . He discounted a theory advanced by a section of the media imputing responsibility for the attack to the far right and followed up a lead pointing to anarchist groups . In DATE PERSON and his assistants questioned Mr PERSON , a railway worker and member of an anarchist group , at a police station in GPE . At the end of the interview , Mr PERSON was killed in a fall from a window .", "PERSON was subsequently accused at various public demonstrations organised by the far left of killing PERSON . ORG in a newspaper published by ORG , a political movement led by ORG and Mr Pietrostefani , were highly critical of him . Criminal proceedings were brought against him , but he was found to have no case to answer .", "On CARDINAL DATE PERSON was killed in GPE by a young man , who fired QUANTITY shots before making his getaway with an accomplice in a stolen car , a blue ORG CARDINAL . They were involved in an accident before making good their escape .", "On DATE the authorities put the car that had been used by the killers in a garage .", "CARDINAL witnesses provided information on the events during DATE that had preceded the murder and a further CARDINAL on the murder itself . CARDINAL of the witnesses , PERSON , said that he had had a clear view of the killer and would be able to recognise him . Another said that he had seen QUANTITY people \u2013 a man and a woman \u2013 get out of a blue ORG CARDINAL , before getting into another car in which a man had been waiting for them .", "Forensic tests were carried out on the ORG CARDINAL and at the scene of the crime .", "The investigations proved inconclusive .", "On DATE Mr PERSON turned himself into the police . On being questioned on DATE by ORG at ORG he said that he had taken part in the murder of PERSON on the orders of the leaders of Lotta Continua , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . The order had been confirmed by the CARDINAL principals on CARDINAL DATE , following an electoral meeting in GPE . The executive committee of the movement had decided on the killing for political reasons . On DATE Mr PERSON accused Mr PERSON of carrying out the murder . He said that he had waited for him in the blue ORG CARDINAL , which had been stolen TIME before the murder .", "On DATE the GPE investigating judge issued a warrant for the applicants\u2019 arrest at ORG request . The applicants were arrested DATE . The warrant contained a statement of the alleged offence .

On DATE they were released .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicants made a request for the car used by the killers to be tested for fingerprints .", "Confrontations were organised between Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON on DATE and between Mr PERSON and PERSON on DATE .", "The applicants denied involvement in the murder or the existence of an illegal executive committee within the Lotta Continua movement .", "A request by PERSON for the investigating judge to interview CARDINAL witnesses who could testify that he had been in GPE on DATE of the murder was turned down .", "The public prosecutor \u2019s files of evidence against the applicants came to CARDINAL pages .", "In DATE the files were made available to the applicants and their lawyers , who , by law , had DATE in which to set out their defence .", "In view of the large number of documents to be examined , the investigating judge granted a request by the applicants for an extension of time , increasing the period to DATE .", "On DATE Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr NORP and PERSON PERSON were committed to stand trial in ORG on a charge of intentional homicide with premeditation . Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON were also committed to stand trial with other defendants on charges of armed robbery .", "The first hearing was held on DATE . CARDINAL witnesses gave evidence during the course of CARDINAL hearings . They included Mr PERSON and CARDINAL witnesses named by PERSON during the preliminary investigations .", "In evidence , Mr PERSON stated inter alia that he had contacted the carabinieri DATE before he made his formal deposition ( on DATE ) and that only Mr Sofri had attended the electoral meeting in GPE on CARDINAL DATE .", "At the trial at first instance it was discovered that certain items of evidence relating to the murder were unavailable . In particular , the clothes PERSON had been wearing had been mislaid almost immediately after his death , having disappeared after being sent to the Prefecture in GPE . On DATE the ORG CARDINAL used by the killers was destroyed . The vehicle was subsequently deleted from the public register of vehicles ( pubblico registro automobilistico ) , as no road - fund tax had been paid for DATE .", "The bullets that had been removed from PERSON body had disappeared after DATE . Under an order of ORG of DATE all objects used to commit an offence ( corpi di reato ) were confiscated after being preserved for DATE . Those with a commercial value were to be sold at auction and the remainder destroyed . The order was confirmed by a memorandum issued by the president of the court on DATE . On DATE the president of the court noted that a number of objects used to commit offences that had been stored in the court \u2019s archives had been badly damaged by water . He ordered their destruction . In a memorandum of CARDINAL DATE , the director of the office responsible for preserving objects used to commit offences certified that the bullets removed from PERSON body had been destroyed along with a large number of other items , pursuant to the aforementioned orders .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyers issued a statement deploring the destruction or disappearance of pieces of evidence . They pointed out , in particular , that it would have been possible through forensic tests on PERSON clothes to determine the power of the cartridge and whether the gun was long - barrelled or short - barrelled . Tests could have been carried out on the bullets , while an examination of the car would have allowed the accuracy of Mr PERSON \u2019s account of the circumstances in which it had been stolen to be verified .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG sentenced the applicants to DATE imprisonment . Mr PERSON was given an DATE sentence , as his cooperation with the judicial authorities constituted mitigating circumstances . ORG found that he was a credible witness for intrinsic and extrinsic reasons and that his statements were corroborated by various pieces of evidence , such as forensic tests carried out during the course of the investigations and trial , the results of the police inquiries and the statements of other witnesses . ORG considered conversely that the numerous defence witnesses either had a personal interest or were vague in their evidence . They were therefore not credible .", "As regards the evidence that had been destroyed , ORG said that , while undoubtedly regrettable , it had had no real impact on the overall prosecution evidence that had been obtained during the investigation and at the trial . Immediately after the murder the police had analysed evidence from the car used by the killers and CARDINAL sets of thorough forensic tests had been carried out on the bullets . It was true that the destruction of the objects concerned had prevented any further tests or analyses . However , it would , in any event , have been undesirable to repeating them , unless it could help to establish the facts . In the case before ORG , the applicants had alleged , for instance , that it would have been possible to determine from an examination of the car whether , as Mr PERSON had affirmed , the wing mirror had been subjected to pressure from a screwdriver ( a point that was not mentioned in the police reports ) . However , even assuming that any marks so made could have been detected DATE , the fact that there was no external corroboration of Mr PERSON \u2019s affirmations was not in itself capable of casting doubt on their veracity . If , in the light of the available information , his statements were found to be precise and credible , ORG was entitled to rely on them in reaching a guilty verdict .", "The President of ORG , Mr Manlio Minale , had been assigned to ORG on DATE . Mr Minale had started his new duties on DATE , that is to say , before signing the text of ORG judgment , which was lodged at the registry on DATE .", "The second and third applicants appealed against that judgment . They argued , in particular , that Mr PERSON was not a reliable witness and his evidence contained a number of contradictions .", "PERSON asked for a search to be made for PERSON clothes and for the results of the investigation carried out by the ORG before his death to be produced . He also requested ballistic tests in order to establish the type of firearm that had been used for the murder . Lastly , he called for the investigation to be reopened .", "Mr PERSON submitted that the order committing the accused for trial was null and void , as they had been given DATE in which to prepare their defence when they should have been given more time in view of the volume of documents and decisions . He , too , called for the investigation to be reopened .", "PERSON did not appeal . However , by virtue of LAW , which provides for \u201c the extension of the benefit of the appeal \u201d ( estensione dell\u2019impugnazione \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , his case was examined at the hearing in ORG and the courts to which it was subsequently referred .", "On DATE Mr PERSON applied for the case to be transferred to a different assize court of appeal on the grounds that the victim had worked in GPE and the political climate there was hostile to the accused . He also alleged that the judges in GPE were not independent , as , by the time he signed the judgment at first instance , Mr Minale had already taken up his appointment at the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed that application . It noted that there was no trace of political or ideological prejudice among any members of the NORP judiciary . It added that if , as Mr PERSON had alleged , Judge PERSON had been assigned to ORG in order to penalise the accused , ORG would also have been prejudiced against them , so that there would have been no point in transferring the case to a different assize court .", "At the appeal hearing , ORG ordered fresh ballistic tests . However , these were conducted using photographic evidence , as the bullets that had been removed from PERSON body had been destroyed in the interim .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG upheld the first - instance decision . It found that Mr PERSON had confessed to his crime through a genuine desire to repent . His evidence was credible and corroborated by other evidence , including documents and statements by other witnesses . ORG also found that the motive for the killing was clearly established by certain articles that had been published in the Lotta Continua newspaper .", "The second and third applicants appealed to ORG . They argued , inter alia , that the reasoning in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was illogical and that the intrinsic and extrinsic credibility of Mr PERSON \u2019s testimony had not been established .", "On DATE the case was assigned to the full court of ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , the full court set aside the judgment of ORG in so far as it concerned the charges of homicide against the CARDINAL applicants who had appealed and remitted the case to the same court . PERSON also benefited by \u201c extension \u201d from that decision , in accordance with LAW .", "ORG found , inter alia , that ORG had relied in its decision on Mr PERSON \u2019s intrinsic credibility , which had not been proved . It pointed out that the credibility of former accomplices had to be established , firstly , by reference to the following factors : their social , financial and family situation , their past , their links with other accomplices , and the immediate and underlying reasons for their decision to confess and to implicate their accomplices . The intrinsic coherence of their statements then had to be examined with the help of the criteria established by the case - law : notably the accuracy , consistency and spontaneity of the statements . Only after establishing the credibility of the former accomplice ( riscontri ) was the court to examine the evidence corroborating his or her testimony .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG , presided over by PERSON , acquitted the CARDINAL applicants who had appealed and , by \u201c extension \u201d , PERSON and Mr PERSON .", "The judgment , which was drafted by PERSON and ran to CARDINAL pages , pointed to evidence , firstly , that Mr PERSON was genuinely repentant , had not sought to accuse the applicants unjustly and bore them no hatred and , secondly , that there was no plot against the applicants . That evidence indicated that Mr PERSON was , on the face of it , a credible witness . As it had been asked to do by ORG , ORG then turned to the intrinsic coherence of Mr PERSON \u2019s testimony and concluded that his confession had not been obtained through any duress or mental conditioning , especially as he had not been charged with or prosecuted for any other offences and , therefore , had no interest in accusing the applicants . Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence was precise and coherent , in spite of certain contradictions that were no doubt attributable to the time that had elapsed since the murder and the psychological pressure he had been under . It was also necessary to take into account the fact that Mr PERSON came from a different cultural background to Mr PERSON and Mr NORP and had had difficulty in answering the numerous questions put to him by the applicants . As regards corroboration of Mr PERSON \u2019s testimony , there was clear evidence of the existence of an illegal executive committee at Lotta Continua and various statements made by PERSON accorded with the results of police inquiries and the evidence of various witnesses . The lack of fingerprints inside the car used by the murderers was explained by the fact that they had not touched any of the smooth surfaces .", "However , the DATE pages of the judgment of DATE pointed to testimony on CARDINAL factual matters that was insufficiently supported by other evidence and constituted \u201c twilight areas \u201d in Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence . The relevant circumstances were as follows :", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had incorrectly identified the colour of the car used to commit the murder .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his initial statements , he had failed to mention that he knew one \u201c PERSON \u201d , who had allegedly assisted him in preparing the murder and stealing the ORG CARDINAL ;", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that the road - traffic accident that had occurred immediately after the murder had taken place in a car park , whereas an eyewitness said that it had happened elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that he had reversed along a stretch of road just before the murder , but this was denied by eyewitnesses .", "CARDINAL . According to some witnesses , the car carrying the killers was driven by a woman , not by Mr PERSON ( a version that was supported by the fact that the police had found a pair of ladies glasses in the car ) ;", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON could not recall certain items that had been found in the car and which did not belong to the owner .", "In view of those circumstances , it was not possible to conclude that PERSON PERSON \u2019s account was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence , so that his presence in GPE on DATE of the murder could not be considered to have been proved . Since his guilt could not be established , his evidence also had to be regarded as unreliable in so far as it concerned acts allegedly committed by the applicants . As a result , it was not necessary to take into consideration his account of the applicants\u2019 role .", "The applicants affirmed that Judge PERSON disagreed with ORG verdict acquitting them . In a letter of DATE , ORG asked ORG to advise on the basis of the relevant documentation whether this was true .", "In a memorandum from ORG dated DATE , the Government informed the ORG that at the end of the deliberations of ORG , composed inter alia of PERSON , the President of ORG had lodged with the registry , in accordance with LAW , a signed and sealed envelope containing the name of the dissenting judge or judges and details of the issue or issues on which they dissented . The ORG stated that the existence of that envelope showed that CARDINAL of the members of ORG had disagreed with the decision to acquit . The names of the dissenting judge or judges could , however , only be ascertained by opening the sealed envelope . However , the Government considered that the envelope could not be produced to ORG for the following reasons :", "CARDINAL . Envelopes were only to be opened for the purposes of protecting a dissenting judge against court proceedings for professional negligence .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG Act ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) laid down that such envelopes were to be sent to the court in which the Prime Minister had issued proceedings seeking reimbursement of compensation paid to an injured party from the judge who delivered the decision .", "According to the Government , the provisions of domestic law that allowed a derogation to be made from the rules of confidentiality applicable to proceedings in private applied only in special circumstances and could not be interpreted widely by analogy .", "The applicants disagreed with the Government and considered that the refusal to produce the envelope to the ORG was unacceptable . The NORP authorities had thereby prevented the Convention institutions from gaining access to the sole document capable of establishing a vital point in their submissions .", "On DATE Mr Sofri lodged a complaint against Mr Pincioni . He alleged that the judge had drafted a \u201c suicidal judgment \u201d with CARDINAL pages devoted to evidence pointing to the ORG guilt and CARDINAL pages to the areas of doubt that had persuaded ORG to acquit .", "ORG requested that no action be taken on the complaint . It noted that ORG complaints concerned the performance of judicial duties by a judge of ORG . It did not constitute a criminal offence for a judge to make mistakes when drafting a judgment . Any such mistakes could , if appropriate , be used as the basis for an appeal against the judgment . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , the GPE investigating judge granted ORG application .", "PERSON said in response to that decision that he had not appealed to ORG and would not be doing so , as he had been acquitted , not convicted .", "ORG appealed to ORG against the judgment of DATE , arguing that the reasoning was illogical and contradictory .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG set aside the judgment of DATE , holding that the reasoning was illogical , contradictory and insufficient , and remitted the case to a different division of ORG .", "ORG noted that ORG had carefully examined Mr PERSON \u2019s confession and found that it was entirely credible and corroborated by other evidence . However , the last CARDINAL pages of the impugned judgment referred to \u201c obscure \u201d circumstances which it said justified an acquittal . That manner of proceeding was illogical and contradictory , in particular because the \u201c obscure \u201d circumstances had in fact been clarified in the initial part of the judgment in which ORG had explained why they did not cast doubt on Mr PERSON \u2019s version of events . Accordingly , the doubts concerning his credibility were superficial only and not based on any concrete and compelling reason capable of outweighing the evidence of guilt referred to in the initial part of the judgment . ORG was also critical of ORG decision not to examine Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence concerning the applicants\u2019 liability .", "After admitting in evidence A viso aperto , a book containing an interview with Mr PERSON , the suspected leader of ORG , and testimony from one of the members of that organisation , ORG of ORG convicted the applicants and sentenced them to DATE imprisonment in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE . It also ruled that prosecution of the offence of which Mr PERSON was accused was time - barred in view of his mitigating circumstances .", "ORG found that Mr PERSON had genuinely repented , bore no hatred of or hostility to the applicants and had no interest in accusing them falsely . He was a credible witness whose evidence was coherent , precise and consistent , the inaccuracies in his depositions being minimal and concerning aspects of the murder that were of secondary importance . The court found that the existence of an illegal executive committee within Lotta Continua had been fully established and PERSON PERSON \u2019s evidence was consistent with the results of the police investigations .", "The applicants appealed to ORG . They argued that PERSON PERSON was not a credible witness , since despite declaring himself genuinely repentant after the killing , he had continued to commit armed robberies . They also pointed to numerous contradictions in his statements , which , contrary to what ORG had affirmed , had not been eliminated .", "Subsequently , X and Y , CARDINAL members of the jury that had tried the case in ORG , made the following statement in private interviews with journalists and lawyers at DATE . They said that at the end of the deliberations in the jury room , the jurors had been divided ( CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ) between those minded to convict and those minded to acquit . The applicants should therefore have been found not guilty under the \u201c most favourable decision for the accused \u201d rule ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . However , the President of ORG , Mr PERSON , had encouraged jurors to change their vote to avoid \u201c ruining \u201d the judgment and forcing the public prosecutor \u2019s office to appeal to ORG ; at the same time he had assured them that any guilty verdict they returned could be accompanied by a request for clemency for the applicants . Some of the jurors had at that point proposed finding mitigating circumstances to enable the accused to benefit from the statute of limitations . However , Mr PERSON had also advised against that course of action , arguing that it would be tantamount to saying that they were not convinced of the applicants\u2019 guilt . CARDINAL jurors had then changed their minds and voted in favour of a conviction .", "On DATE , after learning of the CARDINAL ORG account of the deliberations of ORG , PERSON lodged a complaint against Mr GPE for abuse of authority .", "On DATE ORG opened an inquiry . On DATE Mr Sofri requested that a statement be taken from a Mrs D. whom he said would be able to testify that well before the end of the trial Mr Della Torre had told her privately that the applicants were undoubtedly guilty . PERSON also made a request for statements to be taken from all the members of the Second and Third Divisions of ORG ( to which the first and second remittals of the case were respectively made ) .", "On DATE Mr PERSON made an application to ORG for an order staying the proceedings pending the outcome of the inquiry into Mr GPE conduct .", "On DATE Mr Sofri requested ORG to interview PERSON and all the members , both full and substitute , of ORG . He referred , in particular , to PERSON conversation with Mr PERSON , and said that PERSON had immediately informed CARDINAL of the defendants of Mr PERSON remarks , who had passed on the information to his co - accused and defence counsel .", "On DATE the newspaper ORG della PERSON published a statement by a person who had served on the jury at the second retrial confirming , in substance , ORG allegations . It did not identify its source .", "On DATE all the members of the jury who had sat at the second retrial were questioned by ORG or the police . They all said that they were bound by LAW to remain silent about the circumstances surrounding the deliberations in the jury room , which were confidential under NORP law . ORG nevertheless urged them to testify , saying that the duty to remain silent had to yield to the duty of persons holding public office to report criminal offences for which a prosecution lay without a formal complaint being made .", "X and Y stood by their depositions . X further stated that in another trial that had ended with the accused \u2019s conviction , Mr PERSON had congratulated the jury on the vote and added : \u201c I hope that in the PERSON trial everyone will be like you and no one will allow themselves to be overawed , as last time they acquitted everybody when they should n\u2019t have \u201d ( PERSON siano tutti come lei , che nessuno si lasci condizionare , perch\u00e9 l\u2019ultima volta hanno assolto tutti , e non dovevano . )", "In addition , Y and Z ( CARDINAL of the substitute members of ORG ) said in evidence that Mr PERSON had recommended that the jurors should focus in their reading on the judgment drafted by ORG and the judgment at first instance . They also said that some of the jurors had had difficulty in obtaining a copy of a pleading filed by ORG at the original trial .", "On DATE PERSON was also questioned by ORG . She said that she was a \u201c very dear friend \u201d of Mr PERSON \u2019s wife , and greatly admired Mr PERSON . During a private conversation before the trial Mr PERSON had said that evidence had been obtained to support the accusations that had been made against the applicants , that Lotta Continua was a terrorist organisation and its members madmen ( scalmanati ) . DATE PERSON had informed Mr PERSON of her conversation with Mr PERSON and said that she was prepared to repeat her account to the authorities .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG questioned Mr GPE and Mr PERSON ( the latter being the other professional judge who had sat at the second retrial ) .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeals , holding that ORG had given logical and correct reasons for its findings on all the issues . It also dismissed PERSON application for a stay , observing that under the relevant provisions of domestic law ( ORG CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) criminal proceedings could only be stayed if their outcome depended on the resolution of a preliminary question of civil or administrative law and that no such measure was available if the preliminary question concerned a point of criminal law . It went on to say that Mr PERSON \u2019s submissions were in any event manifestly unfounded , as an impugned decision could only be declared null and void as a result of the voting procedure at private deliberations in very specific circumstances .", "On DATE , on an application by PERSON , ORG requested the investigating judge to reopen the inquiry into Mr LOC \u2019s conduct , which had been officially closed on CARDINAL DATE . ORG submitted that evidence found in the inquiry into Mr GPE conduct called for new investigations into Mr ORG conduct .", "By an order of DATE , the LOC investigating judge dismissed ORG Office \u2019s application . He observed , inter alia , that ORG had produced no new evidence against Mr Pincioni and that the reference to the investigations into Mr GPE conduct did not appear relevant , as no link could be found between the conduct of the CARDINAL judges , who had been involved at different stages in the proceedings and in an entirely different context .", "On DATE ORG requested that no further action be taken on ORG complaint . As regards the deliberations and the vote in the jury room , ORG had obtained \u201c disturbing evidence \u201d from certain members of the jury ( X , Y and Z ) of conduct on the part of Mr GPE that could be described as abusive and intended to prejudice the applicants . However , those statements had not been corroborated by the other members of the jury or PERSON De PERSON . ORG did not think that X and Y were lying and pointed out that X could not have been politically motivated , as he had been a militant for the far right in the past . The explanation was simply that , in the tense atmosphere produced by such a complex and sensitive trial , the CARDINAL jurors had construed some of Mr GPE \u201c inappropriate remarks \u201d as intended to influence the jury . The notion that ORG had lodged his complaint solely in order to permit him to intervene in ORG proceedings could also be ruled out , as he had reported serious matters that might have had a bearing on the position of the accused in the PERSON trial .", "PERSON opposed the request for no further action to be taken on the complaint . In view of the different accounts that had been given by the jurors , he requested further investigations in order to verify how the vote in the jury room had been taken and a confrontation between Mr PERSON , X and PERSON", "A hearing was held in private before the investigating judge .", "On DATE the GPE investigating judge made an order for no further action to be taken on ORG complaint . He observed , firstly , that legal commentators considered that judges derived their decision - making power directly from the people and consequently could not be guilty of abuse of authority when exercising it . Further , there was no indication that Mr PERSON was driven by \u201c self interest \u201d , and nothing in the case file to suggest that he had sought to damage the accused or pursue unlawful objectives . In addition , ORG should not have ordered the jurors from ORG to answer his questions . The confidentiality of votes cast and opinions expressed in the jury room was intended to guarantee judicial independence and ensure the proper administration of justice . Discussions in the jury room could be animated without being unlawful and the manner in which a court reached its verdict ought not to become the subject of an inquiry . The statements of the members of ORG had therefore been obtained illegally and were inadmissible in evidence . The complaint should consequently have been filed away for lack of supporting evidence , not because it disclosed no criminal offence . Lastly , a decided case on the abuse of authority indicated that ORG could not claim to be a victim of the matters complained of . His opposition to the request for no further action to be taken could not therefore be taken into consideration . In any event , the witness statements which ORG had requested were unlawful in so far as they concerned the subject matter of deliberations in the jury room and irrelevant in so far as they related to other matters .", "The investigating judge nevertheless considered it helpful , \u201c in the interests of accuracy and in view of the sensitive nature of the case \u201d , to analyse the evidence that had been obtained by ORG . He attached little credibility to ORG and ORG statements and considered that there was considerable doubt as to their spontaneity . In particular , there were a large number of discrepancies between their accounts , which were not corroborated by the statements of the other jurors and Mr PERSON , who denied that there had been any attempt by Mr GPE to exert unlawful pressure . In addition , X and Y had initially recounted their story to the press and certain members of the public , rather than to the authorities , and had not expressed dissenting opinions as they were entitled to do by LAW .", "The investigating judge also took into account PERSON evidence , which the representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office had regarded as accurate and credible , but not such as to render Mr PERSON criminally liable , since the matters alleged fell to be considered from a moral and ethical standpoint . The investigating judge noted on the contrary that it appeared highly unlikely that a judge with Mr GPE experience would have revealed his personal conviction that the accused were guilty to someone whom he had just met and who was a \u201c dear friend \u201d of Mr GPE . Moreover , even assuming that he had passed on his views , such conduct did not constitute a criminal offence , but grounds for requiring him to stand down . However , the applicants , who were well aware of PERSON allegations , had not requested him to do so .", "PERSON appealed to ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible , noting that a decision to take no further action could only form the subject of an appeal to ORG if the complainant had not been given an opportunity to challenge the order for no further action to be taken and to obtain a hearing in private , or if the investigating judge had failed to state in his order the reasons why such a challenge was inadmissible . In the instant case , no violation of the complainant \u2019s procedural rights could be discerned and ORG allegations related solely to the merits of the LAW judge \u2019s decision , an issue which ORG had no jurisdiction to decide .", "On DATE the applicants applied to ORG for a review , alleging that there was new evidence to show that they should have been acquitted . They referred , inter alia , to the following evidence :", "\u2013 documents , in particular press articles , a computer presentation of the dynamics of the murder , a reconstitution of the car accident with a witness , the personal diary of Mr PERSON \u2019s partner , PERSON , accompanied by the reports of CARDINAL expert witnesses , CARDINAL a handwriting expert and the other a psychologist ;", "\u2013 a computer presentation showing photographs of a bullet and of a fragment of a bullet ;", "\u2013 a ballistic expert \u2019s report based on the computer presentation ;", "\u2013 statements by certain witnesses .", "According to the applicants , this evidence proved that Mr PERSON was not a credible witness .", "In particular , PERSON , an eye witness , had stated that DATE after the murder , he had been shown photographs by QUANTITY police officers from which he thought he recognised the killer . He had subsequently recounted this episode at police headquarters , but had been highly disconcerted by the indifference of the officials there and resolved not to talk about the matter further .", "Mr T. had said that he had seen PERSON on TIME of the murder in a bar in GPE , QUANTITY from GPE .", "PERSON had said that he had explained to Mr PERSON in DATE or DATE the legal advantages to cooperating with the criminal - justice system . He had also testified that Mr PERSON and his partner were short of money .", "Lastly , it appeared from a psychologist \u2019s report and certain extracts from her diary that PERSON was suffering from a form of schizophrenia , that neither she nor Mr PERSON knew how the murder of PERSON had been carried out and that , contrary to what she asserted , she had been aware that Mr PERSON intended to make a confession . The applicants produced copies of the relevant diary extracts .", "They also requested that the civil parties\u2019 submissions be declared inadmissible .", "In an order of DATE , ORG dismissed the latter application , holding that the civil parties were entitled to express their views on the application for a review .", "In an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the application for a review as being manifestly unfounded . It noted that some of the evidence referred to by the applicants was not new , having previously been examined at first and second instance . As to the remaining evidence , it did not raise any doubts as to the guilt of those who had been convicted .", "The applicants appealed to ORG against the orders of DATE . They argued that , as a result of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the decisions of the courts of first and second instance had been quashed so that evidence that had been presented subsequently had to be regarded as \u201c new \u201d . They also complained that ORG had examined the relevance , not just the admissibility , of the evidence on which their application was based .", "On DATE the public prosecutor sought an order setting aside the orders of CARDINAL and DATE . He relied primarily on the applicants\u2019 grounds of appeal to ORG .", "On DATE a compulsory residence order was made in respect of PERSON on health grounds . However , he subsequently returned to prison .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG set aside the impugned orders and remitted the case to a different division of ORG . It ruled , firstly , that the civil parties could not take part in the proceedings to determine whether the case should be sent for review . Further , it found that any evidence that was presented but not examined at the trial had to be regarded as \u201c new \u201d . It added that in review proceedings account also had to be taken of expert evidence obtained with the help of new methods and techniques . In particular , the computer presentation of the photographs of the bullets was helpful , especially in view of the fact that the original bullets had improperly been destroyed before the start of the trial at first instance and that the ballistic tests had had to be carried out using the photographs . Furthermore , ORG , which should only have carried out a preliminary examination of the admissibility of the application , had in fact conducted a detailed analysis of the relevance of each piece of evidence adduced by the applicants , thereby anticipating the judgment on the merits .", "By virtue of new legislation that had come into force in the interim , ORG had acquired jurisdiction to consider the application for a review .", "In an order of DATE , it dismissed the application . It found , inter alia , that the \u201c new \u201d evidence submitted by the applicants was either inconsistent and contradictory , or manifestly irrelevant , and accordingly could not alter the outcome of the proceedings . Furthermore , it was not capable of corroborating the applicants\u2019 allegations of the existence of a \u201c plot \u201d by certain ORG agents against Lotta Continua .", "The applicants appealed to ORG .", "On DATE the public prosecutor applied for an order setting aside the order of CARDINAL DATE , on the grounds that ORG had examined the \u201c new \u201d evidence separately and not , as it should have done , as a whole .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG set aside the impugned order and remitted the case to ORG . It observed , inter alia , that ORG had examined the items of evidence produced by the applicants primarily with a view to disproving the existence of a plot against Lotta Continua , and had thus omitted to examine whether the applicants had grounds for challenging the findings of the courts that had convicted them on appeal . Furthermore , some of the criticism of the new evidence was illogical and de facto anticipated the judgment on the merits . Nor had the evidence been considered as a whole . ORG added that the applicants had been within their rights when they produced copies of PERSON personal diary and that the question of the authenticity of the copies should have been left to the tribunal of fact .", "In an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the application for a review admissible . It accordingly made an order commencing the review proceedings and provisionally staying execution of the applicants\u2019 sentences . Compulsory residence orders were made against the applicants and they were prohibited from leaving the national territory . These security measures were set aside by an order of DATE .", "ORG added that Mr PERSON , who had not applied for a review , should also be regarded as an accused , his own conviction being potentially null and void if the applicants were acquitted .", "The proceedings began on DATE . After CARDINAL hearings , the expert witnesses previously appointed by ORG were sworn in on DATE . ORG then heard evidence from Mr PERSON , the applicants , a number of other witnesses and expert witnesses who had been appointed by the court of its own motion and the defence . The expert witnesses said , inter alia , that they had concluded from an analysis of the photographs of the bullets and the computer presentation of the photographs that the shots had not been fired from the same weapon , contrary to what Mr PERSON had affirmed .", "In the course of the proceedings , the applicants applied for an order requiring PERSON to testify to the meaning of certain passages in her personal diary . However , she pleaded her right to remain silent under LAW , as the partner of CARDINAL of the accused , Mr PERSON . ORG ruled that that right could also be exercised by a person who , like PERSON , had chosen not to avail herself of it when questioned in the proceedings that had preceded the review proceedings . Moreover , at the review stage , the application was for PERSON PERSON to explain the content of her personal diary , which the defence had produced only after the trial was over ; in other words she was being asked to give evidence on matters that were unconnected with her previous testimony . ORG added that LAW was intended to resolve the conflict between the general interest in ensuring that witnesses to relevant events testified and the private interest arising out of feelings for one \u2019s family which could incite witnesses to lie DATE and thereby to commit perjury DATE in order to avoid harming their relatives\u2019 case . In the situation that obtained in the case before it , the legislature and ORG had decided that precedence should be given to the latter interest .", "On DATE ORG decided to bring the trial to an end .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was adopted after DATE of deliberations in private , ORG dismissed the application for a review and revoked the orders staying execution of the applicants\u2019 sentences . It examined the new evidence that had been produced by the applicants and the evidence that had not been taken into consideration in the proceedings on the merits and concluded that it did not justify acquitting the applicants . Although it was regrettable that the bullets had been destroyed , it was not the fault of the investigating judge or the representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , neither of whom had even been consulted on the subject . Furthermore , the expert evidence adduced by the applicants on the photographs of the bullets and the car did not prove that they were telling the truth , as it was insufficient to support their affirmations .", "ORG found that the fact that PERSON had exercised her right to remain silent during the review proceedings did not make her earlier testimony less credible . In any event , that testimony served only to corroborate Mr PERSON \u2019s confession and , even without it , the applicants should still have been convicted . ORG found in particular that PERSON decision had not been taken on a whim , but reflected her wish not to divulge the strictly private details contained in her personal diary .", "Although the copies of the diary that had been produced by the applicants had to be considered authentic , ORG noted that it was difficult ( if not impossible ) to decipher the exact meaning of the handwritten notes it contained . The applicants had referred , in particular , to the following undated passage :", "\u201c VII purification of the penis and the uterus", "I am in the car with PERSON .", "He stops in front of the town hall and says to me : \u201c The Superintendent now has a post at the town hall . \u201d", "A man ( PERSON ? ) enters .", "He makes himself heard ; he takes him under his arm and they leave together .", "They make their way along a path lined with wild grasses .", "Among the grasses is a stork puppet with a child puppet in its beak .", "I think : \u201c It \u2019s the eye witness . \u201d", "PERSON ( ? ) and the Superintendent head towards the end of the path \u2013 the lake \u2013", "Making my way back I take the child puppet", "as the stork puppet is too big . \u201d", "The parties had also mentioned the following phrases :", "\u201c Is PERSON going to sort his matters out alone ?", "Am I going to write to PERSON ? \u201d", "\u201c DATE , on DATE ( I did not", "know that it was your birthday", "or that a series of horrible things", "were in the process of happening to me ) , in the train ,", "I sat in seat no . CARDINAL and felt", "DON\u2019T NEGLECT ME . \u201d", "ORG noted that PERSON had not given evidence at the hearing or , therefore , provided her own account of the passages concerned . In addition , it was not possible to establish from an analysis of the entries that Mr PERSON \u2019s partner had intended to refer , albeit in an elusive and dreamlike manner , to PERSON murder . In that connection , the evidence of certain witnesses showed that at least some of the statements made in PERSON personal diary were fanciful and totally divorced from reality . Neither the extracts from her diary or the other evidence relied on by the applicants was capable of establishing that PERSON had been aware that Mr PERSON intended to make a confession or that they had prepared his confession together . Moreover , even assuming otherwise , any lies Mr PERSON may have told about the circumstances in which he had made his confession did not automatically call into question the authenticity of the facts he had related , as they had been confirmed by other evidence .", "A statement of the reasons for the ( CARDINAL page ) judgment of DATE was lodged with the registry on DATE .", "PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed to ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed their appeals , holding that ORG had given logical and proper reasons for its decision on all the disputed issues .", "The assize court and the assize court of appeal are composed of a president , another professional judge ( giudice or consigliere a latere ) and CARDINAL jurors ( giudici popolari ) . Substitute jurors attend hearings and replace sitting members if necessary . The votes of the CARDINAL professional judges and of the jurors on any issue of fact or law carry equal weight .", "NORP law does not require the judge who drafts the reasons for the judgment to be chosen from among the majority .
