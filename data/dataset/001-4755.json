AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , living in GPE ( GPE ) . She is the maternal grandmother of the child PERSON , who was born out of wedlock on DATE .", "The applicant is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "On DATE , the ORG ) petitioned the ORG ( LOC ) that the custody of the applicant 's grandchild , PERSON , be withdrawn from the applicant 's daughter and transferred to ORG . The authority submitted that PERSON ' mother did not care for her child , but left it entirely to her son 's grandmother , the applicant , to care for and raise him .", "On DATE , the ORG heard the applicant on the question raised by the ORG . She did not object to the withdrawal of her daughter 's parental rights , confirming that her daughter failed to take care of PERSON . The applicant explained that she , herself , would like to continue to take care of her grandchild .", "On DATE , the ORG approved of ORG petition pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) on the ground that PERSON ' well - being was endangered by his mother 's conduct . On DATE , ORG served its decision on , inter alia , the applicant . PERSON was placed with foster - parents on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to transfer custody of PERSON to her . She alleged shortcomings in the care by the foster - parents and requested that a child - psychologist 's expert opinion be prepared to prove that PERSON ' well - being was better ensured by her than by foster - parents .", "In its decision of DATE , the ORG rejected both requests . It relied on ORG report according to which PERSON had adapted well to his foster - parents who took care of his well - being , and that there had been big improvements in his development . The applicant and PERSON ' mother were entitled to visit him . ORG observed that the transfer of custody of PERSON to ORG was res judicata and could only be amended in the case of new relevant developments . However , the applicant had failed to prove that the foster - parents ' care negatively affected her grandchild 's well - being .", "On DATE , ORG ( Landgericht ) declared the applicant 's appeal inadmissible to the extent that it concerned ORG decision of DATE , on the ground that this decision had become final . It dismissed the remainder as she had failed to submit any new relevant circumstances .", "In these and the following proceedings , the applicant was represented by counsel .", "On DATE , the applicant applied anew to the ORG for the custody of her grandchild to be transferred to her . She submitted that in the course of her visits she had gained the impression that PERSON was not well at the foster - parent 's place , although she could not specify reasons therefor . She once again asked for an expert opinion to be prepared in order to prove that both PERSON ' psychological and physical condition had deteriorated since he had been living with his foster - parents .", "In its decision of DATE , the ORG dismissed the applicant 's request on the ground that the care and custody of the grandchild could only be changed if this were in the child 's interest . ORG observed , first , that the foster - parents had been frequently checked as a result of the applicant 's continuous complaints , but that there had never been any basis found for the applicant 's charges . According to information provided by a psychologist , PERSON was well established with his foster - parents . The ORG further noted that the child 's physical development did not demonstrate any anomaly or sign of under - nourishment . Therefore , it did not consider it necessary to obtain a medical expert opinion . The ORG also noted that PERSON ' mother , who lives in a little house together with the applicant and her infant daughter , did not connect to PERSON at all when he had visited her .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on the ground that , in the absence of any new relevant information , the applicant 's request was barred because of the binding effect of the judicial ruling of DATE . As regards the procedural complaints that ORG did not obtain a medical and child - psychologist 's expert opinion , ORG referred both to ORG report of DATE and the report of ORG psychologist of DATE , as well as the statements made by PERSON ' foster - parents . From all CARDINAL sources , it followed that PERSON had developed well at his foster - parents ' place . For this reason , ORG held that the absence of an expert opinion did not constitute a procedural defect . The ORG finally observed that , even if the situation at the foster - parents ' place had not been satisfactory , this would not have led to the transfer of custody to PERSON ' mother or grandmother , but only to a change of foster - parents .", "As regards the alleged lack of information about the results of ORG investigation , ORG recalled that the right to be heard , pursuant to LAW , was not violated if the parties concerned had had an opportunity to comment in appeal proceedings . ORG observed that the applicant did indeed make use of this possibility .", "On DATE , ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant 's special appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) . ORG noted that the circumstances had not changed since the final judgment of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
