{"ITEMID": "001-5398", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "SOLOMON v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Luigi Ferrari Bravo", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and residing in GPE , the GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant first came to GPE in DATE . He requested asylum or , alternatively , a residence for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature . He submitted that he had been a corporal in the NORP army and that when assisting his uncle , a lieutenant colonel , in the preparations of a coup ORG he was arrested and subsequently sentenced to death . He claimed to have been the only one of the conspirators to escape , and that the others were all put to death .", "The applicant \u2019s requests were rejected by the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris voor Justitie ) , as was his request for revision ( herziening ) . The applicant then filed an appeal with ORG ( Afdeling PERSON ) but his request for an interim measure was rejected on DATE by the President of ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . This meant that he was not allowed to await the outcome of the proceedings before ORG on GPE territory . From TIME he was therefore required to leave the GPE forthwith .", "In DATE or CARDINAL \u2013 the exact date has not been given \u2013 the applicant met a woman of GPE nationality with whom he subsequently entered into a relationship . On DATE he requested a residence permit enabling him to reside in the GPE with his partner . This request was rejected in CARDINAL instances by the Deputy Minister for ORG and in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE by the President of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . ORG considered that the applicant had failed to prove his identity and had failed to prove that he was not married already . In so holding it had regard to , among other things , the way in which the applicant had obtained his NORP passport : by post , instead of through official channels , which meant that e.g. the passport holder had not signed the passport in the presence of an authorised official . Other documents , including the applicant \u2019s birth certificate , contradicted each other and had not been verified .", "The applicant \u2019s partner became pregnant . On DATE the applicant again requested a residence permit enabling him to reside in the GPE with his partner and their soon to be born child .", "In a final decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum claims as unsubstantiated in view of what it considered to be inconsistencies in the applicant \u2019s statement and supporting documentation . The credibility of the applicant \u2019s assessment was not accepted . ORG also found that there were no compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant him a residence permit . The factor of the applicant \u2019s relationship with his partner did not play a role in this decision .", "On DATE the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s request of DATE for a residence permit . She held that , as had been the case at the time of ORG decision of DATE , the applicant was still not in possession of certified documents and as he had also not yet submitted a passport , his identity had not been properly established . The fact that the applicant had argued that he was attempting to obtain the required documents was not considered relevant since he had known for DATE that he needed to produce them . The Deputy Minister further held that the refusal of a residence permit did not constitute an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for family life since he had never held a residence permit enabling him legally to develop family life with his partner in the GPE . As his child had not yet been born , no family life existed between the applicant and the child .", "The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against this decision . On DATE a daughter was born to the applicant and his partner . The daughter has GPE nationality .", "The Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection on DATE , holding that despite the birth of the applicant \u2019s child a refusal of a residence permit did still not constitute an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for family life since he had never held a residence permit enabling him legally to develop family life with his partner and his child in the GPE . Moreover , the Deputy Minister considered that there existed no objective obstacles for the applicant , his partner and their child preventing them from developing their family life in GPE , the more so as the applicant \u2019s asylum claims had been rejected , from which it followed that the applicant was not considered to be in any real danger if returned to GPE .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG of GPE and also requested the President of that ORG to grant him an interim measure so that he would not be expelled pending his appeal .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that in the examination of the question whether LAW imposed a positive obligation on the GPE to grant residence to the applicant , no decisive importance could be given to his daughter \u2019s right under LAW No . CARDINAL not to be expelled . However , given the girl \u2019s GPE nationality she was entitled to be raised and educated in the GPE and therefore her interests should be taken into account as well . Nevertheless , ORG considered that the interest of protection of the national economic welfare outweighed those of the applicant and his daughter . In this respect ORG took into account that the daughter had only been DATE when the Deputy Minister had rejected the applicant \u2019s objection and that the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision did not prevent the applicant from developing his family life in GPE . It had not appeared that his daughter would not be admitted to GPE and her residence there would not affect her right to enter the GPE . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s request for asylum did not constitute an objective obstacle to family life being developed in GPE as this request had been rejected .", "ORG accepted that if the applicant was to take his daughter with him to GPE this would constitute an interference with his partner \u2019s right to respect for family life with her child . However , the interest of protection of the national economic welfare also outweighed the interests of the partner . In this respect ORG took into account that the partner had entered into the relationship with the applicant at a time when he was not allowed to reside in the GPE . There were , moreover , no objective obstacles preventing the partner from developing family life in GPE .", "Also on DATE the acting President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an interim measure .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Given the situation obtaining in the GPE with regard to population size and employment , Government policy was , and remains , aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if : ( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so , as in the case of citizens of ORG or GPE member GPE and refugees covered by LAW relating to LAW ; ( b ) this serves \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d ( wezenlijk Nederlands belang ) , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; ( c ) there are \u201c cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d ( klemmende PERSON aard ) . Relevant policy is defined in FAC ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) of DATE .", "In Chapter CARDINAL , under CARDINAL , of the Aliens Circular it is laid down that the partner of a GPE national may be allowed to reside in the GPE within an existing non - marital relationship or , if both partners are DATE , in a newly - formed relationship provided that both partners prove by means of legalised official documents that they are both unmarried and that they are not closely related . The requirement that both partners be unmarried is waived if the fact of being , or remaining , married to a third party can not be imputed to the person concerned .", "Chapter CCARDINAL of the Aliens Circular lists cases in which the requirement of legalisation can be waived , for instance if the person concerned is a genuine asylum seeker and therefore can not be expected to contact the authorities of his country of origin . However , certain \u201c problematic countries \u201d are listed from which documents are not accepted , save in exceptional cases , without verification by competent GPE diplomatic or consular officials . GPE is CARDINAL of these ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
