NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by PERSON , their Agent .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has thus far submitted CARDINAL applications under LAW ( see PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action ( case no . CARDINALC CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against a private company before ORG s\u00fad ) . He argued that he had title to some forest land , which was being occupied by the defendant company , and that the latter had arbitrarily terminated a lease of that land they had previously concluded . Accordingly , the applicant sought a ruling declaring the defendant company \u2019s termination of the lease null and void .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant requested an exemption from court fees , which was examined and dismissed at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . The question of court fees was subsequently examined again at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction in connection with various procedural applications made by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant was asked to provide further and more detailed particulars of the claim and to support his claim with evidence , particularly in so far as he appeared to be seeking financial compensation in respect of unpaid rent . In response , the applicant specified that his claim amounted to the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "In a letter of DATE , in response to a request by ORG of DATE , the applicant submitted an apology for his \u201c mediocre activity in [ the ] dispute , including [ his ] having missed timelimits because [ at the given time ] [ he ] was also dealing with other , far more serious matters \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE CARDINAL hearings were listed , but the applicant excused himself from them on various grounds .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place on DATE . On DATE , ORG dismissed the action . It found that the applicant had not been the owner of the property at the time the lease was concluded and that the defendant company had therefore been entitled to terminate the lease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) quashed the first - instance judgment following an appeal by the applicant , and remitted the matter to ORG for re - examination . It found that ORG had failed to identify the property in question and to establish whether the lease had been validly concluded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , on the grounds that the applicant had failed to comply with its request of CARDINAL DATE to formulate his claim properly . However , following an appeal by the applicant , that decision was quashed by ORG on DATE , and the case was remitted to ORG for a determination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE CARDINAL further hearings were listed , but the applicant excused himself from them on various grounds .", "CARDINAL . The hearing scheduled for DATE took place despite the applicant \u2019s absence . On DATE , ORG dismissed the action , finding , inter alia , that the property in question had not been described properly , which meant that the lease was void ab initio .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment following an appeal by the applicant . The merits of the case were thereby resolved by a final and binding decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought CARDINAL complaints under LAW , challenging the length of the proceedings in his case . In both complaints , he contested exclusively the part of the proceedings which took place before FAC .", "CARDINAL . His first complaint was lodged on DATE , but was declared inadmissible on DATE . ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) concluded that he had not complied with the admissibility requirement of exhaustion of ordinary remedies . In particular , he could not be regarded as having properly asserted his complaint concerning the length of proceedings before the President of ORG prior to resorting to ORG . In that connection , ORG observed that , as a claimant , the applicant was involved in a considerable amount of litigation before ORG . His vaguely formulated complaints to the President of ORG about the length of \u201c all of his proceedings \u201d before that court , which did not identify any specific set of proceedings , could not therefore be regarded as being in compliance with the statutory exhaustion requirement .", "CARDINAL . The second complaint was lodged on DATE , but was declared inadmissible on DATE .", "While ORG noted that the applicant had still not properly asserted his complaint before the President of ORG , it nevertheless proceeded to examine it in substance by reviewing the course of the proceedings , paying particular attention to the part before ORG , as contested by the applicant .", "ORG observed that in DATE following the bringing of the action until the applicant \u2019s appeal was transferred to ORG for determination , ORG had dealt with the case in a continuous and uninterrupted manner . His appeal had been pending before ORG for DATE and DATE , following which the case had been transferred to ORG for a new determination . It was at this stage that ORG established that there had been a delay of DATE on the part of ORG . However , the case was thereafter pending again before ORG for DATE , and no further delays attributable to ORG could be established .", "As for the applicant , he was found to have contributed to the length of the proceedings by having filed incomplete particulars of claim without supporting documentary evidence , and by having to be assisted by ORG in correcting the shortcomings of his submissions .", "In sum , in view of all the circumstances , the delays on the part of ORG were not sufficiently serious to constitute a situation that was contrary to the applicant \u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time . Thus , his complaint was in any event manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice are summarised in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE and PERSON v.
