On DATE ORG resumed its Extraordinary plenary session at which it deliberated about the item of the Agenda : \u2018 Consideration of the Proposal for Dismissal of Mr. PERSON , Judge of ORG and GPE . ORG established that the procedure for dismissal of a judge of ORG may be defined as an ad hoc procedure of a sui generis nature , for which there are no detailed Rules on how to conduct the procedure . For that reason and by application of Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG , ORG concluded that a fair hearing must be guaranteed to Judge PERSON , including all the principles stipulated under LAW ( \u2018 the NORP Convention\u2019 ) . Furthermore , the Constitutional Court afforded an opportunity to Judge PERSON to state his position in respect of all the allegations contained in the Proposal for Dismissal before all the judges of ORG during the proceedings at the session .

During the course of its extraordinary plenary session , ORG discussed the preliminary issues , examined all available evidence , materials and documentation .... It then conducted deliberations and reached a decision on the merits by consensus that Judge PERSON had to be dismissed from the office of the Judge of the Constitutional Court pursuant to LAW in conjunction with LAW paragraph CARDINAL line CARDINAL of the Rules of the Constitutional Court due to the violation of Rule CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG for the following reasons :", "VII.CARDINAL . Contents of the letter of Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the constitutional principle of the rule of law , ORG must be an independent and impartial constitutional authority . That , in principle , primarily defines its relation to the executive authority . The independence and impartiality of ORG implies that its judges are free , that they do not have to be accountable to anyone and that they are not bound by anyone \u2019s instructions ( cf . the Judgment of ORG GPE , Series A , No . CARDINAL , of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , Series A , No . DATE , of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , it is not only required that the judges of ORG are truly independent but also to appear to be so , which is subject to an objective test ( cf . the Judgment of ORG , ORG and Fell v. GPE , No . CARDINAL , of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL and ff ) .", "CARDINAL . It clearly follows from the contents of the letter that the president of the SNSD , Mr GPE , had been in contact with Judge PERSON ( first page of the letter ) even before the controversial letter was ever written . Judge PERSON responded to those contacts by written communication . Furthermore , Judge PERSON states in his letter that he is \u2018 always at disposal\u2019 of the president of PERSON , offering him openly \u2018 his experience and opportunities\u2019 ( page CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL ) . Moreover , his letter contains an unsolicited request for a higher degree of cooperation , which clearly follows from the statement : \u2018 I am afraid that you do not use my experience and opportunities sufficiently ORG . In addition , Judge PERSON openly discusses the possibility of employing someone from the PERSON personnel in the executive authorities of ORG , giving his opinion and recommendations in respect of those persons and stating that those persons are in consultations with him whenever there appears any major problem ( page CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . According to this , Judge PERSON is in the habit of giving advice to the officials of the executive authorities of CARDINAL of the Entities .", "DATE . Given the contents of the controversial letter and taking into account the fact that Judge PERSON held the office of the first vice - president of the SNSD , prior to taking the office of the judge of ORG , an objective observer gets an inevitable impression that Judge PERSON did not sever relations with his former political party and its president and that he is prepared to continue maintaining such contacts which are useful to that political party . As a matter of fact , he is even initiating them . That may be clearly concluded from the statements made in the letter , offering his expertise and experience , a higher degree of cooperation , and rendering his own opinions and advice to one of the members of his former party \u2018 wherever he has a major problem\u2019 in the Government of the Republika Srpska .", "CARDINAL . Such ties between a judge of ORG and political parties , i.e. executive authorities of CARDINAL of the ORG , may be defined as liaisons incompatible with the institutional and operative independence of ORG , which all judges must endeavour to strengthen . In the public eye , such relations are damaging to the reputation of ORG , in particular as concerns the perception of its independence and impartiality , i.e. the prohibition of preferential treatment of specific parties .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , Judge PERSON , by such statements , has deliberately endangered and inflicted damage on the independence of ORG , thereby undermining both his reputation as a judge of ORG and the reputation of ORG itself , in terms of Rule CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The fact that the controversial letter was not of business but of private nature does not affect this conclusion of ORG and neither does the fact that Judge PERSON and the president of PERSON and the prime minister of PERSON , PERSON , are friends as indicated by Judge PERSON . The obligation of a judge of ORG , as the holder of the judicial authority to safeguard the independence of the court as an institution and his own independence in relation to the holders of the other authority , is in effect in both private and professional relations . Therefore , even if the letter was of private nature , it may still endanger the independence of a judge of ORG and ORG itself as an institution .", "VII.CARDINAL . Public appearances of Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in the interviews given to the DATE magazine ORG on DATE and DATE and at the press conference held on DATE in PERSON , Judge PERSON presented serious accusations against the judges of ORG and ORG itself as an institution , associating them with ( a ) crime ( b ) corruption ( c ) interference of politics with the work of ORG and ( d ) failure to perform the constitutional function it has been entrusted with . Moreover , Judge PERSON claimed he had evidence to substantiate his allegations .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON did not deny the quoted allegations , pursuant to LAW , or in any other manner . On the other hand , on DATE , ORG received a written statement by the journalist of the DATE magazine ORG , PERSON , confirming the authenticity of the quoted statements of Judge PERSON . ORG , therefore , considers the statements given in public by Judge PERSON to be accurately quoted .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON invoked freedom of expression as guaranteed under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( h ) of LAW of BiH and LAW . In his opinion the freedom of expression allows him to express his opinion publicly and in the manner as he has done . Finally , he stated that pressure was applied on him as a judge , on account of which he found it necessary and justified to state his opinion in public .", "CARDINAL . ORG emphasizes that freedom of expression is extremely important for democracy and democratic processes in a society . The state must pay special attention to this particular freedom ... This Article not only protects the information and ideas perceived as positive or considered hazardless or those on which no position has been taken , but also those that offend , shock and disturb . That is what tolerance and pluralism require and without that there is no democratic society ( cf . ORG CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , the judgment of ORG v. GPE , No CARDINAL , of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) . This is particularly the case when it concerns the public personalities or institutions of authority since the threshold of tolerance must be raised to a higher level ( cf . judgment of ORG , PERSON v. GPE , Series A , No CARDINAL , of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the freedom of expression under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( h ) of LAW and LAW is not absolute ... according to LAW , freedom of expression \u2018 may be subject to such formalities , conditions , restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a NORP society , in the interests [ ... ] or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court finds that the sanction of dismissal of a judge from office of the Judge of ORG , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) of LAW in conjunction with LAW paragraph CARDINAL line CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG , i.e. on account of a severe violation of Rule CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG , may be a justified measure for non - compliance with the restrictions of the freedom of expression .", "DATE . Therefore , as previously stated , every judge of ORG must be aware that by accepting his / her judicial office he / she also accepts certain restrictions in terms of public appearances . The goal of such restrictions is to protect public interest \u2013 the confidence of the public in respect of the judiciary , protection of its independence and impartiality , the integrity , reputation and honour of judges . When a judge appears in public , his / her main concern must be the protection of that public interest .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON appeared in public on his own initiative , through written media and by organising the press conference . Judge PERSON was aware that organising a press conference in such a manner was unprecedented as far as ORG is concerned , as he himself stated prior to the press conference . He pointed out that his appearance was contrary to the position of ORG concerning public relations . ORG , further , holds that the purpose of those public appearances was to seriously discredit and raise charges against the other judges of ORG and ORG as an institution and their disqualification . Finally , Judge PERSON publicly presented his claim that ORG did not protect the law and justice , i.e. that it did not perform its duties in a proper and professional manner . Judge PERSON publicly promised that these grave charges against ORG and its judges would be substantiated by evidence , stating : \u2018 I have all the evidence\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . ORG holds these appearances to be completely contrary to the high judicial standards of behaviour of judges . Indeed , even if those statements of Judge PERSON were founded , his conduct was completely unprofessional and inconsistent with the principles of a fair hearing . Namely , a judge , even if he or she claims to be in a possession of evidence for the alleged criminal activity of the individual judges , must not act outside the institution , present his of her position in public and prejudge a conceivable outcome ... ( presumption of innocence ) but must use relevant state system , provided for by the positive regulations of GPE and GPE which makes possible the examination of such claims in accordance with its jurisdiction , relevant procedure and substantive legal grounds . Judge PERSON , prior to presenting his positions and claims in public , did not even attempt to tackle these issues within ORG , although prior to his public appearances he knew that ORG , sitting in a plenary session , would give him the opportunity to discuss the issue of his position in ORG , where he could have presented his allegations and positions . Moreover , according to what ORG learned about this matter , Judge PERSON did not even attempt to submit any evidence to the competent prosecutor \u2019s offices in GPE .", "DATE . Due to aforesaid , the public appearances of Judge PERSON have brought into question the confidence of the public in respect of the constitutional - judicial authority as well as ORG as an institution ... Judge PERSON thereby inflicting damage to the dignity of ORG and its judges . This is best illustrated by the introductory notes of the journalist of ORG in the article dated DATE \u2018 The highest judicial institution of the state , ORG , is dangerously shaken up DATE under the burden of insinuations , corruption charges , political set - ups and party conflicts!\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . According to the established facts , it is not possible to find any reasons which could justify Judge PERSON in his actions . ORG does not find his claim of having been under pressure to be well - founded .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the established facts , ORG concludes that Judge PERSON had consciously overstepped the allowed restriction on freedom of expression of a judge , thereby undermining the reputation and dignity of a judge of ORG in contravention with Rule CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG . In that manner , Judge PERSON inflicted damage to his own reputation and dignity as a judge as well the reputation of the other judges and ORG as an institution .", "...", "VII.CARDINAL . Conclusion", "CARDINAL . ORG emphasizes first and foremost that it operates in highly complex legal and political circumstances . At this stage of the constitutional development of GPE , the role of ORG is very important and difficult while , objectively , its decisions have a significant impact on political processes within the state . ORG resolves , amongst other things , complicated constitutional issues with far - reaching implications , often involving legislative or executive authorities at the state- or entity - level as direct participants . This very fact shows that there exists an undeniable public interest for ORG to build and maintain its reputation , independence and impartiality and not to allow these principles to be endangered or violated . Otherwise , the authority of ORG as an institution and the authority of its decisions shall be lost . ORG , as the distinguished jurists of the highest moral standing , must be aware of these principles at any given moment .", "CARDINAL . ... With his actions , Judge PERSON inflicted great damage on ORG , reflected in undermining of the confidence of the public and the authorities in respect of the independence , impartially and professional work of ORG as well as degrading of the achieved results .", "CARDINAL .
