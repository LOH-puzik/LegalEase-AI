The court noted that the applicant had left his place of residence without informing the authorities and had transgressed the conditions of his residence in GPE despite having already served a prison sentence for unlawful entry into the LOC . The authorities had found him subsequently by chance , whilst carrying out certain investigations concerning another case . As the applicant had been living in GPE unlawfully , the detention and deportation orders had been correctly issued against him on the basis of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON . The court therefore concluded that the decisions to close his file and to issue the aforementioned orders had been lawful .", "On DATE the applicant was taken to GPE airport for deportation . He was deported with a NORP travel document issued by the authorities and a photocopy of his passport . CARDINAL policemen escorted him . Upon his arrival in GPE , the last stop before PERSON , the authorities there refused to allow the applicant to depart to PERSON on the grounds that his escorts did not have a visa and tickets for PERSON .

Because of the structure of the bunk beds , it was impossible to sit up straight on the lower bunk ; the only alternative was to sit on the floor .", "According to the Government all the cells in LAW measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY and could accommodate CARDINAL detainees .
