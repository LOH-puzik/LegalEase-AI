By a deed of DATE , PERSON and PERSON divided their property inter vivos between their CARDINAL legitimate children , PERSON and PERSON the terms of the deed , which was signed before a notary , they retained a life interest by which the legitimate children agreed to let PERSON and PERSON continue to enjoy possession of their property as life tenants for the rest of their lives . The deed also contained a provision for revoking the gift for the purposes of ensuring that the terms and conditions were complied with . Lastly , when the deed was signed PERSON and PERSON declared that the CARDINAL donees were their only offspring .", "CARDINAL . Mr M. died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance declared the applicant to be the illegitimate child of PERSON , after finding that his status of illegitimate child had been fully established .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE deed of inter vivos division ( donation - partage ) was challenged by the applicant on DATE after it had been established in DATE that he was PERSON son . No details have been provided regarding the outcome of that procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother died on DATE . The notary administering the estate informed the applicant by letter of CARDINAL DATE that his rights were confined to the reserved portion of his mother \u2019s estate since she had made a will bequeathing the disposable portion , that is , CARDINAL , to her son J. The notary told him that , as a child born of adultery , he was entitled to CARDINAL the share he would have received if he had been a legitimate child \u2013 namely , CARDINAL . He added that the applicant \u2019s brother and sister , PERSON and ORG , were willing to pay him MONEY ( ORG ) in cash . He pointed out in that regard that in the event of the subsequent birth of a child , only a monetary abatement was possible and in no circumstances an abatement in kind . He asked the applicant to inform him whether A. and ORG proposal was acceptable to him .", "CARDINAL . No agreement was reached between the CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . By a writ of action dated DATE , the applicant brought proceedings in the LAW tribunal de grande instance against the CARDINAL children born of his mother \u2019s marriage : PERSON and PERSON on Article CARDINAL of LAW , he sought an abatement of the inter vivos division , claiming a reserved portion of his mother \u2019s estate equal to the share payable to his joint heirs from the assets of his mother \u2019s estate , namely , CARDINAL of that estate , which was CARDINAL of PERSON and PERSON joint estate .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG had found against GPE in the case of ORG v. GPE , on DATE , GPE passed Law no . DATE of DATE , amending its legislation and granting children born of adultery identical inheritance rights to those of legitimate children . That new PERSON came into force before the dispute that is the subject of the instant case was decided . It stipulated that its provisions were of immediate application to successions were already open on the date on which it came into force . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON specified that , subject to any prior agreement between the parties or final court decision , the provisions relating to the new inheritance rights of illegitimate children whose father or mother was , at the time of their conception , bound by marriage to another person were applicable to successions that were already open on the date of publication of the PERSON in ORG of GPE and had not given rise to division prior to that date .", "CARDINAL . In his recapitulatory pleading of DATE , the applicant relied on the provisions of the PERSON of DATE . In his submission , that PERSON repealed the provisions of LAW DATE stipulating that the rights of heirs entitled as a result of that PERSON to a reserved portion of the estate could not be exercised to the detriment of inter vivos gifts granted prior to the date on which it came into force . He argued that as those provisions of the PERSON of DATE had been repealed , he was entitled to bring an action for abatement under LAW even though the deed of inter vivos division had been signed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the LAW tribunal de grande instance held that the applicant was entitled to bring an action for abatement of the inter vivos division made by PERSON and PERSON in DATE . It observed , inter alia , that section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , which had the effect of depriving illegitimate children of their inheritance rights where their parent had made gifts prior to the date on which that PERSON came into force , was contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The court held that that provision was also contrary to LAW , even if the latter had not expressly repealed the aforesaid section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE . The court also found as follows :", "\u201c Section GPE ) of the PERSON of DATE provides that this PERSON is applicable to successions already open on the date on which it comes into force ; subject to any prior agreement between the parties or final court decision , the provisions of this PERSON are applicable to successions already open on the date of publication of the LAW in the NORP Official Gazette where these have not given rise to division prior to that date .", "In the present case there has not yet been division of PERSON estate ; accordingly , the provisions relating to the new inheritance rights of illegitimate children whose father or mother was , at the time of their conception , bound by marriage to another person will apply .", "Consequently , the repeal by the Law of DATE of the provisions of LAW introduced by LAW DATE render the new provisions incompatible with section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , this latter provision being already contrary to LAW .", "Indeed , it can not reasonably be argued that the legislature , in enacting the LAW , intended to maintain a provision contrary to the spirit and aim of the new PERSON .", "Mr PERSON must therefore be deemed entitled to bring an action for abatement under LAW even though the deed of inter vivos division was signed on DATE .", "... This court must therefore hold , in accordance with LAW , that Mr PERSON has the same inheritance rights as his brother and sister with regard to his mother \u2019s estate . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The children born of the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s marriage appealed . In a judgment of DATE , ORG set aside the lower court \u2019s judgment and declared that the applicant was not entitled to bring an action for abatement of the inter vivos division made on DATE by PERSON and PERSON between their legitimate children . It held that such a ruling was not inconsistent with the general principle of equality of rights regardless of birth , as guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It observed that the sole purpose of section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE was to prohibit heirs who had acquired rights to a reserved portion of the estate under that LAW and extended by LAW DATE from exercising them to the detriment of inter vivos gifts granted prior to CARDINAL DATE , without depriving the said heirs of their inheritance rights . It considered , above all , that there was objective and reasonable justification for section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE in the light of the legitimate aim pursued , namely , ensuring peaceful family relations by securing rights acquired in that context \u2013 sometimes long - standing ones \u2013 without at the same time creating an excessive imbalance between heirs . It pointed out that the provisions of the impugned section CARDINAL were of limited scope both in terms of time and the type of voluntary disposition concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . In his opinion , which was communicated to the parties , the advocate - general at ORG recommended dismissing the appeal . He made the following submissions to the judges of ORG of ORG :", "\u201c ... The difficulty submitted for your examination does indeed arise from the different approach proposed by the transitional provisions of DATE . Whilst neither successions already opened , nor inter vivos gifts granted prior to the coming into force of the Law of DATE , could be challenged under that PERSON , the PERSON of DATE allows illegitimate children whose father or mother was , at the time of conception , bound by marriage to another person to assert inheritance rights in respect of successions already open prior to publication of that PERSON .", "That difference justifies a non - restrictive application of the provisions of the Law of DATE . Only where there has been actual division , or an agreement has been reached between the parties or a final court decision delivered can the new inheritance rights of such children be excluded where the succession has already been opened . On account of the action for an abatement , the succession already opened on the date of publication of the Law of DATE can not have \u201c given rise to division \u201d on the date of publication of that PERSON .", "I therefore find the submission that the LAW DATE is not applicable difficult to sustain . The terms of LAW CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , however , are entirely unambiguous . Heirs who have acquired rights under this PERSON to the reserved portion of the estate can not exercise those rights \u201c to the detriment of inter vivos gifts granted before the PERSON came into force \u201d . Should , then , these provisions be deemed to have been tacitly repealed ?", "Without having regard to the time factor , the applicant maintains in his supplementary pleadings that it must be concluded from the clear contradiction between the transitional provisions of the CARDINAL Laws that those governing the Law of DATE have been tacitly repealed . Whilst the approach is different between the transitional provisions enacted in DATE and those enacted in DATE , they do not , however , appear to me to conflict .", "By excluding any challenge to inter vivos gifts granted prior to the coming into force of the PERSON of DATE , the legislature intended to guarantee the legal security required by such gifts . There is nothing to justify calling that legal security into question in DATE , since the earlier transitional provisions complement those laid down by DATE .", "It is on those grounds that I invite you to dismiss the first ground of the appeal : the inter vivos gift made on DATE can not be called into question on account of inheritance rights arising from new rules concerning the determination of filiation . In that connection , whilst it remains debatable whether there had actually been division prior to publication of the LAW , the existence of an inter vivos gift granted prior to the coming into force of the LAW of DATE is not in dispute . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE . It found that the effect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW DATE , in the version applicable to the facts of the present case , was that , subject to any prior agreement between the parties or a final court decision , the provisions relating to the new inheritance rights of illegitimate children whose father or mother was , at the time of conception , bound by marriage to another person were applicable only to successions that were already open on DATE and had not given rise to division before that date . It found that as there had been division on PERSON death DATE that is , prior to DATE \u2013 the above - mentioned provisions were not applicable .", "CARDINAL . An inter vivos division ( donation - partage ) is a deed by which a person divides his or her property during his lifetime among all his presumptive heirs ( including , since the PERSON of DATE , children born of adultery ) . The deed must be drawn up before a notary and an inter vivos division can concern only present , not future , property . All the heirs must participate in the inter vivos division . The property being divided is valued on the date of the gift , and can not subsequently be revalued .", "When making an inter vivos division , the donor determines the share of property to be distributed to his or her heirs . He or she can either divide the property into equal shares or give a larger share to CARDINAL of his or her children , provided that this does not reduce the portion statutorily reserved to the heirs .", "Each child is entitled to a minimum share ( the \u201c reserved portion \u201d ) in his or her GPE estate and can bring an \u201c action for abatement \u201d ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) if the division of the estate at the time of death infringes that right .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Anyone shall be entitled to divide and distribute his assets and his rights among his presumptive heirs .", "This voluntary disposition may be made in the form of an inter vivos division or a will .
