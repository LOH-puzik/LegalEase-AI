{"ITEMID": "001-66663", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "JOHANSSON v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Ms S. Westerberg , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant had an accident at work and injured his back . As a consequence thereof , he received a sickness allowance ( sjukpenning ) . On DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4krings - kassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of ORG sent a letter to the applicant informing him that he had been referred to a physician , a psychologist and a physiotherapist for examinations of his health condition and the possibilities for rehabilitation , to be conducted on CARDINAL and DATE . He was further informed that failure to appear without a valid reason could result in a withdrawal or reduction of his sickness allowance . On DATE the applicant , questioning the competence of the persons supposed to examine him and the need for and expediency of those examinations , stated that he refused to appear without his legal counsel and asked for the examinations to be postponed . On DATE the ORG replied that it considered that the medical material available to it was not sufficient to make an appropriate examination of his right to a continued sickness allowance and that the aim of the requested medical examinations was to remedy those deficiencies .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the request for medical examinations . On DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE dismissed the appeal stating that the ORG could , under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , request that the applicant undergo an examination of his health situation and the possibilities for rehabilitation . According to the preparatory works to the relevant provisions , measures taken by the ORG should be seen as part of the handling of the case and could thus only be subject to appeal when there had been a decision to withdraw or reduce the allowance in question . Since the measure in question had not had any direct consequences for the applicant , ORG found that it was prevented from examining the applicant \u2019s appeal and thus dismissed it .", "The applicant did not appear for the medical examinations and was given a new appointment , with CARDINAL chief physicians , for DATE . In letters to the physicians , he again criticised the examinations . He eventually appeared for the appointment accompanied by his legal counsel . He declared that he was not opposed to being examined but that he was not there of his own free will but under the threat of having his allowance withdrawn . The physicians considered that the applicant was not consenting to the measure and therefore did not proceed with the examination .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant had appealed against ORG decision to dismiss the appeal regarding the request for medical examinations . On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE remitted the case to ORG as , according to the legal procedure , the ORG should have reconsidered ( ompr\u00f6vat ) its decision before the examination by ORG . On DATE the ORG , upon reconsideration , drew the same conclusion as ORG had done on DATE . On DATE ORG again dismissed the appeal .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal on this issue .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that it was considering discontinuing payment of his sickness allowance and invited him to submit observations . The applicant availed himself of that opportunity .", "By a decision of DATE the ORG discontinued payment of the applicant \u2019s sickness allowance as from DATE as it had not been shown that his ability to work was reduced to such an extent that he was entitled to such an allowance . The ORG had regard to complementary medical records and reports which it had obtained concerning the applicant and the opinion of CARDINAL of its own medical doctors ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsl\u00e4kare ) . Upon the applicant \u2019s request , the ORG reconsidered its decision on DATE . It upheld the decision , stating , inter alia , that there had been reasons to request complementary examinations , that the applicant had refused to cooperate and , that , accordingly , his entitlement to an allowance had not been shown .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . Observations received by the court from the ORG were submitted to the applicant .", "The applicant later lodged appeals with the court against other decisions taken by ORG . Thus , on DATE he appealed against a decision concerning the level of income on the basis of which his sickness allowance was to be calculated ( sjukpenninggrundande inkomst ) and on DATE he appealed against a decision by which the ORG rejected his applications for a disability pension ( f\u00f6rtidspension ) and a life annuity ( livr\u00e4nta ) . The applicant \u2019s appeals were considered in parallel by ORG .", "The applicant submitted observations to ORG on DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL May and DATE . On the latter date he requested an extension until DATE of a time - limit to submit further observations . This was granted by the court . On DATE he submitted observations and requested a further extension until DATE , noting that there was no opposite party in the proceedings who could be harmed thereby . Also this request was granted by the court . Further submissions were made by the applicant on DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s case file was sent on loan to ORG for use in the proceedings concerning the request that the applicant undergo medical examinations . The file was later forwarded to ORG for the same purpose . The file was returned to ORG on DATE .", "On DATE and DATE and on DATE and DATE ORG received additional observations and documents from the applicant .", "On DATE ORG delivered judgments in all the applicant \u2019s cases . In upholding the ORG \u2019s decision to withdraw the applicant \u2019s sickness allowance , it found that the ORG had had reasons to request complementary information in order to determine whether his health situation had improved to such an extent that he would be able to go back to work . Although a medical examination could probably not be performed against a person \u2019s will , the refusal to undergo such an examination could , under the provisions of LAW , lead to the loss of the benefits in question . The applicant \u2019s stance in this regard had led the physicians to conclude that it was not possible to conduct an examination and he had consequently prevented the ORG from obtaining the necessary medical evidence which , by law , it was competent to request . For these reasons , the applicant \u2019s entitlement to a sickness allowance under LAW could not be properly assessed .", "On DATE the applicant lodged appeals with ORG against ORG judgments . He also asked for time until DATE to specify the relief sought and the grounds for the appeals . The court granted his request . Observations were received from the applicant on DATE and , on DATE , the court asked the ORG to comment before DATE , a time - limit later extended twice , ultimately until DATE . The ORG \u2019s reply was received on DATE and sent to the applicant for information .", "On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted observations and medical certificates to the appellate court . On DATE he requested time until DATE to submit further observations . This was granted by the court . On DATE the applicant submitted observations and medical certificates . He also asked for a further extension until DATE , again noting that this would not cause detriment to any opposing individual party .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the appellate court ordered the applicant to conclude his case no later than DATE . The receipt of the order was acknowledged by the applicant on DATE , following CARDINAL reminders sent by the court .", "On DATE the applicant submitted observations and reiterated his request for an extension , at least until DATE . The ORG submitted comments on these observations on DATE which were forwarded to the applicant for information . On DATE the appellate court granted an extension until DATE and informed the applicant that further extensions were unlikely to be granted .", "On DATE the applicant submitted further observations and again reiterated the request for an extension until DATE . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the appellate court ordered him to submit any additional material within DATE of receiving the order .", "On DATE the appellate court received observations from the applicant in which he requested an extension until DATE . He stated that he did not consider it correct to deny him the extension which he had requested and needed , as the opposing party in the case would not be harmed thereby but rather favoured by such a measure . By a decision of DATE the appellate court ordered the applicant to submit any additional material by DATE .", "On DATE the appellate court received observations from the applicant in which he requested an extension of the time - limit until DATE . He maintained that the court could not be criticised for having protracted the proceedings , since he had himself asked for the extension and his request was well - founded . On DATE the appellate court ordered the applicant to submit any additional material by DATE . It also stated that it might rule on the question of leave to appeal even if he failed to abide by the order .", "By decisions of DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal in all cases .", "On DATE the applicant lodged appeals with ORG . He asked , inter alia , that the cases be remanded to ORG for further extensions of the time - limit to submit observations . He also requested an extension before ORG until DATE in order to submit additional medical evidence . The latter request was granted . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested further extensions until DATE and DATE , respectively . Also these requests were granted .", "On DATE the applicant submitted observations to ORG . On DATE he requested a further extension of the time - limit until DATE . The request was granted .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant submitted further observations and a medical certificate . On DATE he requested an extension until CARDINAL DATE . The request was granted .", "On DATE the applicant submitted further observations . On CARDINAL DATE he requested an extension of the time - limit until DATE , noting that it would not cause detriment to anyone but himself . The request was granted .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant requested further extensions until DATE and DATE , respectively . The requests were granted .", "On DATE the applicant submitted observations to ORG and requested that the previously granted extension until DATE should continue to apply .", "On DATE the applicant requested a further extension until DATE . On DATE , he submitted his final observations in all cases , including the case concerning the sickness allowance .", "The cases are at present pending before ORG .", "Sickness allowances are , insofar as relevant to the present case , regulated in chapter CARDINAL , sections DATE and CARDINAL a and chapter DATE , section CARDINAL of LAW . A person is entitled to such an allowance if his or her sickness reduces the ability to work by PERCENT . ORG should , if necessary for the assessment of an application for an allowance , request the person in question to undergo an examination of his medical state and working disability and the need and possibility for rehabilitation . If the person refuses without a valid reason to undergo treatment , examination or rehabilitation , the sickness allowance may be refused , entirely or partially , until further notice , provided that he or she has been notified of this consequence .", "According to the preparatory works of chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL a of LAW , the decision of a local insurance office to request an individual to undergo additional medical examinations is to be regarded as constituting part of the office \u2019s procedure for dealing with the matter of the individual \u2019s entitlement to a continued sickness allowance . The preparatory works therefore conclude that such an action by the office should be subject to appeal only in connection with a subsequent decision to reduce or discontinue payment of the allowance in question ( Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
