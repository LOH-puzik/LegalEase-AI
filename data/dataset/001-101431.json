The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police arrested the applicant . On DATE ORG in ORG accused her of forgery and attempted fraud . She and another person were suspected of having attempted to cash CARDINAL cheques for QUANTITY ( ORG ) and MONEY ( ORG ) in DATE . Those cheques were considered to have been forged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant denied involvement in any unlawful action . She maintained that the cheques had been issued by foreign investors interested in a business activity which she had been planning to launch in GPE . She further argued that the NORP bank concerned had never contested the validity of the cheque in pounds sterling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG remanded the applicant in custody with effect from DATE . Her detention was considered necessary as there was a risk of her absconding within the meaning of LAW ( a ) of LAW . The judge considered it relevant that the applicant was a foreign national and that she risked a prison term of DATE for the offences in issue . Reference was also made to LAW . ORG heard the applicant and referred to the statement of the applicant 's co - accused and available documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention to DATE . It held that , in addition to the above - mentioned grounds , her detention was also necessary as she might influence witnesses or otherwise hamper the investigation within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW . In particular , important witnesses had to be heard in GPE whom the applicant had contacted by phone and fax prior to her detention . ORG found no delays in the investigation and noted that the authorities of GPE , GPE and GPE had to be asked for assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . As the NORP authorities had not complied with the requests for legal assistance it had been impossible to complete the investigation . It risked being jeopardised if the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Regional Court granted a further extension of the detention , until DATE . That decision was justified by the fact that ORG had requested the assistance of the NORP authorities in obtaining witness statements and that those statements had not yet been submitted . The statements were necessary to establish the relevant matters in respect of which the statements of the accused differed . Reference was also made to the applicant 's nationality , the serious nature of the offence of which she was accused and the risk that she might influence witnesses if released . ORG relied on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL(a ) , ( b ) and CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It noted that no procedural steps had been taken DATE . That was , however , due to the absence of a reply from the NORP authorities . ORG expressed the view that the applicant 's detention was strictly necessary until DATE only and that the preliminary proceedings should be completed before that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for release , with reference , inter alia , to LAW ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . She argued that the reasons invoked for her detention had fallen away and requested that the court dealing with the request hear her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the request . With reference to the applicant 's arguments , the evidence and the statements of witnesses and the applicant 's co - accused it considered that the accusation of the applicant was justified and that the reasons for her detention , as specified in the earlier decisions , persisted . In particular , the applicant might influence witnesses and the law foresaw a minimum penalty exceeding DATE imprisonment for the offence imputed to her .", "CARDINAL . ORG decided in camera . Its decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE and DATE . The applicant lodged a complaint on DATE and again on DATE . On DATE the ORG dismissed the complaint .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant and her co - accused were indicted before ORG . On DATE that court dismissed the applicant 's request for release . It pointed to the applicant 's nationality and the heavy penalty for the offence of which she was accused . It had been established in the course of preliminary proceedings that in her correspondence the applicant had attempted to influence witnesses . ORG decision was served on counsel for the applicant on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant lodged a complaint . On DATE ORG dismissed that complaint .", "CARDINAL . In parallel , on DATE the Prosecutor General petitioned for a further extension of the detention of the applicant and her co - accused , until DATE . The applicant contested that request . She stated , in particular , that all witnesses had been heard and that her foreign nationality did not in itself justify her deprivation of liberty . She argued that the case was not complex and that there had been delays in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It noted that the applicant was accused of having attempted to cash CARDINAL forged cheques and that the suspicion against her and her co - accused persisted . It invoked the risk of the applicant 's absconding with reference to the heavy penalty for the offences imputed to her and the fact that she was a foreign national . Her detention was therefore necessary within the meaning of LAW ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG further admitted that witnesses had been heard . Nevertheless , the applicant 's detention within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(b ) of LAW remained necessary as the file contained correspondence , which had been written by the applicant or addressed to her , indicating that she had attempted to influence the investigation in the case . The criminal activity imputed to the accused persons was inseparable . There was a risk that they could influence each other or witnesses even at the trial stage of the proceedings . No particular delays in the proceedings had been established ; the relevant procedural steps had been delayed for objective reasons . ORG decided in camera in accordance with the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG petitioned ORG for a further extension of the applicant 's detention . It was argued that the reasons for her and her co - accused 's detention still existed and that the proceedings risked being jeopardised if they were released . On DATE the applicant 's counsel submitted written observations on that request . She argued that there had been no progress in the case following the indictment and that the length of the proceedings and her detention was excessive . The applicant also requested that ORG hear her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at a meeting held in camera , extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It based its decision on the fact that the applicant was a foreign national and held that the indictment indicated that her prosecution was justified . Both the applicant and her co - accused were foreign nationals residing abroad . Considering also the heavy penalty set down in law for such offences , their detention was justified within the meaning of LAW ) and QUANTITY of the Code of Criminal Procedure . Specific reasons for which it had been earlier concluded that the accused might influence witnesses and hamper the proceedings persisted . Reference was also made to ORG decision on the applicant 's request for release given on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the case was complex from both the factual and the legal point of view . The file comprised CARDINAL pages . Given the short period of time which had lapsed after the filing of the bill of indictment , ORG had not yet had sufficient time to prepare the main hearing and decide on the case . The above extension by DATE of the applicant 's detention should suffice to bring the criminal proceedings to a close .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG returned the case to the public prosecutor for further investigation . It decided that the applicant should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision in the part ordering the case to be returned to the public prosecutor . In particular , it did not consider relevant the argument that the file , to the extent that it concerned the applicant 's co - accused , had to be translated into LANGUAGE . ORG ordered ORG to examine the charges against the applicant and her co - accused and dismissed their complaint against the decision ordering their continued detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE following the belowmentioned order of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . She returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The main hearing in the criminal proceedings was scheduled for CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant was absent for health reasons . ORG decided to deal with the charges against her in a separate set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG that she insisted on the charges against her being determined in her presence and that she still could not attend a hearing for health reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discharged the applicant 's co - accused and ordered his release . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and returned the case to the public prosecutor for further investigation . ORG noted that witness statements included in the file were contradictory . The facts of the case had not been sufficiently established . In particular , the public prosecutor had proceeded erroneously in that he had abstained from having a witness examined in GPE prior to the filing of the bill of indictment on DATE . Such evidence could have shed light on the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the applicant 's case to the public prosecutor for further investigation , with reference to ORG judgment of DATE . Subsequently the charges against the applicant and her co - accused were again examined jointly and the authorities of GPE , GPE and GPE were asked for assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the investigator that she was unable , because of serious health problems , to undergo a crossexamination with a witness scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP authorities decided to request their NORP counterpart to hear a representative of the bank concerned as a witness . The proceedings are pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . She specified that she sought the finding of a breach of LAW ( c ) and CARDINAL of the Convention in the proceedings leading to ORG above - mentioned decision of DATE . In the reasons for her complaint the applicant also invoked LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . She argued that there had been no relevant reasons for her continued detention , that she had not been released , that ORG had neither heard her nor had it addressed the arguments which she had submitted in writing , and that she had been informed of the decision in issue on DATE only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint as being manifestly ill - founded . It held that neither the way in which ORG had proceeded nor the conclusion which it had reached were contrary to the applicant 's rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention a breach of which she had formally ORG considered to be relevant and sufficient , that her continued detention was still necessary within the meaning of the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a second complaint with ORG . She alleged a breach of LAW ( c ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention in the proceedings leading to ORG decision of DATE to extend her detention to DATE . In particular , the applicant argued that there had been no relevant reasons for her continued detention , that it had lasted an excessively long time , and that ORG had not heard her . The applicant requested ORG to order reimbursement of the costs of her legal representation in the constitutional proceedings , which amounted to CARDINAL NORP korunas ( CZK ) , plus value - added tax .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that ORG had breached the applicant 's right under LAW in that it had failed to hear her prior to its decision of DATE to extend her detention . It quashed that decision , ordered ORG to release the applicant immediately and to reimburse CARDINAL NORP korunas ( the equivalent of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in respect of the costs of her legal representation . In view of this conclusion ORG considered the examination of the applicant 's other complaints unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW applicable at the material time are relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a person charged with a criminal offence can be detained , inter alia , where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would abscond ( sub - paragraph ( a ) of LAW ) , influence the witnesses or the co - accused or otherwise hamper the investigation ( subparagraph ( b ) ) or continue criminal activities , complete an attempted offence or commit an offence which he or she had prepared or threatened to commit ( sub - paragraph ( c ) ) .", "CARDINAL .

In justified cases ORG may extend its duration to a maximum of DATE and , in cases of particularly serious offences , DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL obliges investigators , prosecutors and judges to examine , at each stage of criminal proceedings , whether reasons for the accused person 's detention persist .", "CARDINAL .

Under paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , ORG is bound by a request from a plaintiff for proceedings to be started unless the LAW expressly provides otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , a complaint must indicate , in addition to the information mentioned in LAW , the fundamental rights or freedoms the violation of which a plaintiff alleges . Paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL requires that plaintiffs who seek a just satisfaction award should specify its extent and indicate the reasons for their claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG has declared itself bound , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , by a party 's submission aimed at initiating proceedings before it . ORG has expressly stated that the above was particularly relevant as regards the order which parties seek to obtain as it can only decide on matters which a party requests to be determined ( see , for example , decisions III . \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE or III . \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
