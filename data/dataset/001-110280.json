The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE prison no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG communicated the application , asking the parties about the compatibility of the applicant \u2019s life sentence , which had resulted from his conviction for murder of a police officer , with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted their observations on the admissibility and merits of the case , which the ORG transmitted to the applicant , who was represented by PERSON ( \u201c the applicant \u2019s first representative \u201d ) at that time . The representative was invited to submit observations on behalf of her client by DATE but failed to do so . ORG then extended of its own motion the relevant timelimit until DATE , but the representative still failed to submit any observations .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the ORG , noting her persistent failure to submit observations on behalf of the applicant , advised PERSON that it would proceed with the examination of the case as its file stood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s first representative , claiming to have lost the case materials , requested the ORG to provide her with a copy of the file . The ORG granted that request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and PERSON informed the ORG of their designation as additional legal counsels for the applicant ( \u201c the new representatives \u201d ) and expressed their intention to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of the case in the near future . The ORG replied on DATE , reminding the new representatives of the applicant \u2019s unjustified failure to submit observations within the previously allotted and extended time - limits , in breach of the relevant procedural rules . The ORG stated that no further extension of the relevant time - limit could be allowed at that stage and advised the new representatives to contact their colleague , PERSON , in order to obtain the necessary documents and additional information about the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new representatives again requested the ORG to give them another time - limit for the submission of observations . The ORG rejected that reiterated request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new representatives requested the ORG to provide them with another copy of the case materials , explaining that the applicant \u2019s first representative had not shared the materials with them . In reply , the ORG , noting that the relevant materials had already been sent to the first representative , still granted , as an exception , the new representatives\u2019 request on DATE by providing them with another copy of the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s new representatives reiterated for the third time their readiness to submit observations on behalf of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father enquired with the ORG about the state of the proceedings . He complained that he had been in a complete information vacuum as regards the development of the case and also requested to be provided with a copy of the case materials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted , as part of their observations on the merits , a copy of the final and enforceable decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . As disclosed by that decision , ORG , granting ORG request of DATE , had commuted the applicant \u2019s life sentence to the CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in the light of amendments to LAW mitigating criminal responsibility for the offence he had committed . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s new prison term would expire and result in his release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the mode of the execution of his life sentence under NORP law was incompatible with LAW of the LAW . This provision reads as follows :", "\u201c No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In their observations on the merits of the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , the Government raised CARDINAL preliminary objections . Firstly , referring to the fact of the commutation of his life sentence by ORG on DATE , they submitted that the applicant had lost victim status . Secondly , the ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s failure to inform the ORG of such a focal development of his case amounted to an abuse of the right of individual petition , within the meaning of LAW of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , the applicant \u2019s new representatives , apart from maintaining the complaint on the merits , briefly commented that they had first learnt of the commutation of their client \u2019s life sentence during a meeting with him at DATE . They added that the applicant himself had learnt of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE only in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG points out that , according to Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG , applicants , acting in person or through their legal representatives , are under the continuous obligation to keep the ORG informed of all important circumstances regarding their pending applications . It recalls that an application may be rejected as abusive under LAW of the LAW if , among other reasons , it was knowingly based on untrue facts ( see ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; and GPE v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to an abuse of the right of application , especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information ( see PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; and GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Furthermore , the ORG reiterates that it can not be its task to deal with a succession of ill - founded and querulous complaints or with otherwise manifestly abusive conduct of applicants or their authorised representatives , which creates gratuitous work for the ORG , incompatible with its real functions under LAW DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Returning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG first finds that the conduct of the applicant \u2019s first representative , ORG , was deplorable . Apart from the fact that she had failed to submit observations on the admissibility and merits of the case despite the extension of the relevant time - limit , had lost the case materials twice , had failed to cooperate with the applicant \u2019s other representatives and had apparently left the applicant \u2019s family in ignorance as regards the developments of the case , which omissions naturally resulted in an additional , gratuitous administrative workload for ORG , her negligent attitude went as far as withholding from the ORG the crucial information about the commutation of the applicant \u2019s life sentence to the fixed prison term , which fact related to the very core of the subject matter of the present application .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s new representatives , the ORG finds it unacceptable that they , legal professionals who had assumed responsibility for the case DATE as on DATE , did not learn about the commutation of their client \u2019s life sentence , which occurred in DATE , until DATE . In any event , pursuant to their obligations under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Court , both the applicant and his representatives should have informed ORG of that critical development of the case immediately upon its discovery , which important circumstance would then have been taken into consideration by the ORG upon the examination of the admissibility of the application on DATE . Unfortunately , they failed to do so and did not even provide a justifiable explanation for that serious procedural omission .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thus considers that the conduct of the applicant and of his representatives , in particular that of PERSON , was a \u201c vexing manifestation of irresponsibility \u201d ( see ORG , the decision cited above ) , incompatible with the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the LAW , and significantly impeded the proper functioning of the ORG . In general , lawyers must understand that , having due regard to the ORG \u2019s duty to examine allegations of human rights violations , they must show a high level of professional prudence and meaningful cooperation with the ORG by sparing it from the introduction of unmeritorious complaints and , once proceedings have been instituted , then meticulously abide by all the relevant rules of the procedure and urge their clients to do the same . Otherwise , the wilful or negligent misuse of the ORG \u2019s resources may undermine the credibility of ORG work in the eyes of the ORG and even , if done systematically , may result in them being banned from representing applicants under LAW ( b ) of ORG ( see Petrovi\u0107 , the decision cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , the ORG considers that the ORG \u2019s preliminary objection is well - founded and the present application is abusive within the meaning of LAW ( a ) in fine of the LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
