THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Art. 6-1;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and , at the time of the introduction of his application , was serving a sentence of life imprisonment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was living with his family in GPE , where his father was an ORG Corporal serving in ORG of FAC . On DATE the applicant was charged with the murder of a young civilian woman who had been working in ORG and whose body had been found in woods near to the army base .", "CARDINAL . As a family member residing with a member of ORG , the applicant was subject to military law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The NORP authorities waived jurisdiction pursuant to ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commander of ORG was appointed to act as the applicant \u2019s Commanding Officer . The latter decided to refer the case to ORG with a view to the applicant being tried by general court - martial . ORG submitted the case for trial by general court - martial , and the court - martial was convened by the Commanding Officer ( henceforth , \u201c the Convening Officer \u201d ) . The applicant obtained military legal aid on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant \u2019s father was posted to GPE and returned there on DATE . Despite his father \u2019s return , the applicant remained subject to military law as the proceedings had already commenced ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant returned to GPE in DATE where he was detained . His father was discharged from the army in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was returned to GPE in time for his court - martial which commenced on DATE . The court - martial board was composed of a President , who was not a permanent president , and CARDINAL ordinary members . CARDINAL of the members were senior officers , all of whom were subordinate in rank to the Convening Officer and the President and CARDINAL of whom was within the Convening Officer \u2019s chain of command . CARDINAL members were civilian civil servants , who came from GPE solely for the purpose of the trial , and were placed under LAW command while in GPE , although they were not in his reporting chain .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s representative submitted , inter alia , that the trial of a young civilian by court - martial was inherently unfair and oppressive and thus an abuse of process . The atmosphere in a military court would be very different from that of a civilian court and the applicant would not do himself justice . In particular , it was unfair and oppressive that he should be returned to stand trial in GPE after he had spent DATE in detention in GPE and after his father had ceased to be subject to military law . Lastly , if tried by jury , a majority of CARDINAL to CARDINAL votes would be necessary to convict him , whereas a simple majority vote would suffice in a trial by court - martial .", "CARDINAL . These submissions were considered by the Vice - Judge Advocate General and were rejected , as was an application for an adjournment to allow proceedings for judicial review to commence . The trial ended with the applicant \u2019s conviction on CARDINAL DATE . In accordance with the provisions of LAW CARDINAL , the verdict of the court - martial was confirmed by a Confirming Officer ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , which had the power to quash the conviction if it considered it unsafe . The Lord Chief Justice , Lord PERSON of PERSON , giving judgment on DATE , held , dismissing the appeal :", "\u201c ... We have some considerable sympathy with the appellant \u2019s complaint . With the benefit of hindsight , it seems plain that the trial could have been conducted in GPE without undue difficulty . It would in our view have been preferable if this young appellant , whose subjection to military law was purely vicarious and involuntary , had been tried here with all the procedural safeguards which procedure in the ordinary criminal courts affords . We can not , however , stigmatise these proceedings as abusive . They were strictly in accordance with a procedure prescribed by ORG to apply in such cases . There was not , as is accepted , any attempt to over reach or oppress or prejudice the appellant . He had all the safeguards which a defendant in any court - martial is entitled to enjoy . Steps were taken to ensure that all members of the tribunal save CARDINAL were not under the command of the convening officer , and also to ensure that the convening officer and the confirming officer were not the same person . Had the appellant been held in GPE to await trial , as he could have been , his claim to trial in GPE would have appeared weaker . Whether or not it proved necessary in the event to adduce the oral evidence of NORP factual witnesses , the greater availability of such witnesses as a trial in GPE was a legitimate reason for favouring trial there .", "We are satisfied that these proceedings were not an abuse of process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appeal court certified a question of law for ORG as to whether proceedings conducted in accordance with LAW could be considered abusive . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal . Having heard the applicant \u2019s legal representatives , on DATE ORG unanimously dismissed the appeal . Lords PERSON of GPE and Hope of PERSON expressed the view that at first sight the decision to prosecute the applicant \u2014 a civilian aged DATE at the time of the murder \u2014 by court - martial had been inappropriate . However , as Lord Hope explained :", "\u201c It is not difficult to understand the utility of [ section CARDINAL of the Army Act DATE : see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , in view of the greatly increased opportunities which were by then available for families and other civilian personnel to accompany the forces when serving overseas . Had the law not been changed in this respect , civilians and followers would have had to have been brought to trial in the local civil courts in the language and according to the procedures in use in those courts and , if sentenced to imprisonment , to serve the sentence in a local prison . ...", "Fundamental to the appellant \u2019s argument in the present case is the proposition that the purpose of [ the extension of jurisdiction in section CARDINAL of LAW : see paragraph CARDINAL below ] was to extend to murders committed abroad the right of every person in this country who is accused of murder to have his or her guilt declared by means of a jury trial . ... It seems to me that another , and more likely , explanation is that the legislation was enacted to ensure that the grave offences with which it deals should not go unpunished when committed abroad by a NORP citizen . ...", "In view of what I have said above I do not believe that the proceedings by way of court - martial in this case can be said in themselves to have been an abuse of process . ... The question to which I now turn is whether there is any basis in the information which is available to us for describing any of the decisions taken by those in authority at the various stages in this case as so unfair and wrong as to show that the conviction in this case was unsafe . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope went on to examine the factors which would have had to have been taken into account when considering whether to prosecute the applicant by court - martial in GPE or by jury trial in GPE :", "\u201c The timing of any consideration of the matter by ORG would , in my view , have been of critical importance to a decision as to whether there was any unfairness in this case which might be said to render the conviction unsafe . It can not be assumed that the Director would have been willing to take proceedings in GPE without knowing more about the factors which he would have wished to take into account . CARDINAL obvious factor , I would have thought , was the availability of witnesses . In his letter of DATE to the Attorney General ORG had stated that many of the witnesses were NORP and that they could not be forced to attend a trial in GPE . Further details were provided at the request of the Attorney General in a letter by ORG dated DATE . In this letter it is stated that there were CARDINAL NORP witnesses who could be divided into CARDINAL categories \u2014 those who saw the appellant in the woods near the scene of the murder , those concerned with the finding of the body and police and forensic experts . The defence had not yet indicated what evidence would be agreed . The Director thought that , while some of their evidence might be agreed , it was unlikely that this would include the police and forensic experts . He believed that they were the witnesses who would be most unlikely to cause difficulties if asked to travel to GPE to give evidence . He added that CARDINAL of the forensic scientists who was responsible for examining secretions and bloodstains \u2014 a matter which was of crucial importance in this case as there were no eyewitnesses \u2014 was being difficult to deal with and would only attend meetings if they were arranged through the NORP public prosecutor in the nearest large town . He explained that these witnesses were NORP because the police investigation was commenced by the NORP civil police as it was initially assumed that a NORP civilian had committed the crime . ...", "I have not forgotten that Lord PERSON of PERSON [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] said in his judgment that it was clear , with the benefit of hindsight , that the trial could have been conducted in GPE without due difficulty . But ORG would have had to have taken his decision well before the trial , in view of the arrangements which would have had to have been made for the appellant to be transferred into the hands of the civil authorities in GPE and for the attendance of the witnesses . In the event , as the respondent has recorded in his written case , no agreement was reached , despite several written requests and reminders , about any of the evidence until the commencement of the trial when the evidence of the witnesses was agreed piecemeal during DATE . This account of what happened strongly suggests that at the stage when ORG would have had to have taken his decision he would have had to assume that the important evidence of the NORP witnesses would not be agreed before the trial and that the attendance of the NORP witnesses would be necessary . ...", "Conclusion", "... The proceedings were conducted within the rules laid down by ORG . There is no sound basis for thinking that , at the time when a decision about this would have had to have been taken , a prosecution in the NORP courts within a reasonable time would have been seen to be practicable . The alternatives lay between taking proceedings by way of court - martial in GPE , leaving the matter in the hands of the NORP public prosecutor or taking no proceedings at all . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Since LAW DATE , where a civilian defendant is to be tried , civilian ORG servants can be detailed as members of the court - martial . In practice , most criminal offences allegedly committed by a civilian dependent would be tried by ORG ( similar to a ORG ) , with trial by court - martial reserved for the most serious offences .", "CARDINAL .
