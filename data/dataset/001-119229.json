Prior to the enactment of the DATE Act , no NORP citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary , i.e. general , election in GPE , other than members of the armed forces or ORG servants .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a parliamentary committee , ORG , published a report on ORG which recommended that NORP citizens living in what were then Member GPE of ORG should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period . The Government \u2019s response to that report recommended a DATE limit for all overseas voters , expressing the view that a person \u2019s links with GPE were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to NORP citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in GPE within DATE . The bill originally proposed a DATE period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short . Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time - limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with GPE were also raised .", "CARDINAL . The DATE period was extended to DATE by virtue of section QUANTITY of the Representation of the People Act DATE . The bill which led to the LAW was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time - limit to DATE . During parliamentary debates , the Secretary of ORG acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut - off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who , although resident abroad for some time , had retained close and continuing connection with GPE and those who had \u201c cut adrift \u201d from such links much earlier . Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views , with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act was subsequently repealed and replaced , with retention of DATE , by section CARDINAL and Schedule CARDINAL of the Representation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on ORG . It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced . The relevant extract of its report reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Representation of the People Act DATE introduced a right for NORP citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and NORP elections for DATE following their move overseas . This period was increased to DATE under the Representation of the People Act DATE . The peak year for actual registrations under the LAW was in DATE when CARDINAL registered ; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in DATE , when the total stood at CARDINAL , followed by a further fall in DATE to CARDINAL . Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote . Professor PERSON argued that the system meant that \u2018 an expatriate living QUANTITY away , for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation , carrying memories of NORP politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live , can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019 . Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate . ORG and GPE NORP representatives both suggested that DATE was perhaps too long . Professor PERSON suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the GPE or to an intention to return .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and , for ORG , PERSON indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue . It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the GPE and are those most likely to be planning to return . A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy ( because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available ) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home . ORG reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for DATE period to be lowered but from people who had been resident overseas for DATE arguing for it to be increased .", "CARDINAL . On balance , we take the view that DATE maximum period within which a NORP citizen overseas may retain the right to vote is excessive and that the earlier limit \u2013 DATE should be restored . \u201d ( emphasis in original ; references omitted )", "CARDINAL . The DATE period was subsequently reduced to DATE pursuant to section CARDINAL(a ) of the Political Parties , LAW . The bill preceding the LAW proposed a reduction to DATE . During parliamentary debates , the relevant Government minster explained that the proposed DATE period struck a balance between the various strongly - held views expressed . During the bill \u2019s passage through ORG , the ORG minister proposed an increase to DATE in response to concerns aired during the debate . While the minister accepted that the amendment represented a broad - brush approach , he considered it to be the most equitable approach that could be adopted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the passage through ORG of the bill which led to the Political Parties and Elections Act DATE , an amendment was proposed to raise the period for overseas voting from DATE . The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows :", "\u201c The first is that we live in an era of increasing globalisation and internationalisation of economic activity , a process which has gathered pace since the reduction of the qualifying period in DATE . Secondly , we need to reflect the different nature of modern society and the mobility of populations . Thirdly , I seek to reflect the fact of GPE \u2019s membership of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government minister defended the DATE period , noting the absence of any compelling argument or evidence that would justify a change . He considered that the focus should be instead on raising the registration rate of overseas voters , noting that CARDINAL overseas voters were registered in GPE and GPE as of DATE . The amendment was not passed .", "CARDINAL . During a short debate in ORG on DATE regarding voting arrangements for overseas electors , some members called on the ORG to reconsider the DATE period . Attention was drawn to the fact that those who worked abroad for international organisations did not have the same voting rights as members of the armed forces , ORG servants and employees of ORG , who were not subject to the DATE limit . The Government minister acknowledged that the Government ought to address the issue of overseas votes , noting that of CARDINAL NORP citizens resident abroad , CARDINAL actually voted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the passage through ORG of the bill which led to ORG , an amendment was proposed in ORG to remove the DATE rule . The reasons for the proposed amendment were explained as follows :", "\u201c According to ORG , CARDINAL NORP citizens currently live abroad . The shocking truth is that although , as of DATE , CARDINAL of them were of voting age , CARDINAL were registered for an overseas vote , according to ORG electoral statistics . Out of CARDINAL potential overseas voters , only CARDINAL,CARDINAL-odd are actually registered ! ...", "...", "In most other countries , both developed and emerging , voting rights for parliamentary elections depend solely on nationality , not on an arbitrary time limit . For example , GPE nationals can vote in presidential , congressional and state elections , regardless of where they reside in the world . Similarly , NORP nationals can vote in the equivalent elections there , no matter where they live . However , the most startling example comes from our nearest neighbour . NORP citizens in the GPE have just elected a new President and taken part in parliamentary elections for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Members of ORG whose job it is solely to represent NORP people abroad ....", "The right of NORP abroad to vote is enshrined in article CARDINAL of the NORP constitution . ...", "...", "[ A]ll NORP citizens living abroad have the same right to vote in ORG elections as fellow citizens living in their home country . The simple fact is that the citizens of the GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and all these other countries have better voting rights for their citizens abroad than we do for NORP citizens living abroad .", "For a democracy as ancient as ours , it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a stain on our democratic principles that our citizens are placed at such a disadvantage when they have moved abroad compared with citizens from those other countries . Her ORG is very happy to collect tax from most of the enormous number of people involved , but denies them the vote . \u201d", "...", "\u201c The states in which these NORP citizens reside do not allow them to vote as residents , because voting rights are based on nationality and not residence , and they can not vote in the GPE on the basis of the current rule , for which there is no obvious rationale . I challenge the Deputy Leader of the ORG to state where there would be any disadvantage in abolishing the rule . The consequence of the rule is that many NORP citizens living abroad are in a state of electoral limbo , unable to participate in any election whatsoever . That seems to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government minister replied that the Government would give the issue \u201c serious consideration \u201d . The amendment was subsequently withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . A similar amendment to the bill was proposed at the ORG stage in ORG on DATE . The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows :", "\u201c The fundamental issue at stake here is the complete exclusion of so many NORP citizens living abroad for DATE from the right to vote here . According to ORG , PERCENT of those who moved abroad in DATE did so for work - related reasons , PERCENT for study and PERCENT for life in retirement . With an ageing population , and increased opportunities for work and study abroad , people are likely to continue to leave GPE in substantial numbers . Many of them will reside abroad for DATE . In the countries to which they move , voting rights rest overwhelmingly on nationality , not residence . Apart from CARDINAL ORG countries \u2013 mainly islands in GPE \u2013 I understand that no state permits NORP citizens to vote in its principal national elections . They therefore exist in an electoral limbo .", "...", "Within ORG , GPE compares unfavourably with most of its partners . Of the CARDINAL ORG members , CARDINAL countries allow their expatriate citizens the right to vote , without any restriction on the period of residence outside the home country . That is apart from GPE , which restricts it to DATE for expatriates living outside the ORG . Just CARDINAL countries , GPE and GPE , restrict the period for voting rights : the GPE to DATE and GPE to CARDINAL . In CARDINAL countries \u2013 GPE , GPE and GPE \u2013 expatriates have no right to vote .", "The world has become much smaller . NORP overseas can listen to our radio via their computer , they can watch NORP television and read NORP newspapers just as rapidly as anyone living here , if they subscribe to them electronically . I make a confident prediction that this debate in our ORG DATE will attract CARDINAL of the largest television online audiences abroad that your Lordships have had . I have met many NORP overseas residents who are as well , if not better , informed about NORP political affairs than the average voter here . So the old argument about expatriates\u2019 inability to make an informed judgment about the great issues in our political life no longer holds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government minister responded that the question whether the time limit was appropriate was a wider question which remained under consideration within Government . He noted that there were valid arguments on both sides which needed to be carefully considered alongside any practical issues before any informed decisions could be taken . The amendment was withdrawn but it was subsequently reintroduced on DATE during the Report stage of the bill , with further debate taking place . Again , the Government minister indicated that the issue was under consideration by Government and the amendment was withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG handed down judgment in the case of GPE v ORG and Lord President of the ORG . The claimant was a long - term resident of GPE who sought judicial review of the DATE rule under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act . He argued that he had a directly effective right under ORG law to move to and reside in other Member GPE and that the DATE rule operated unjustifiably to interfere with the exercise of that right .", "CARDINAL . The court found that there was no evidential basis for the contention that the DATE rule created a barrier of any kind to free movement . The matter therefore did not fall within the scope of ORG law . That being so , the issue of justification did not arise . The court nonetheless indicated that it considered the rule to be a proportionate interference with the right to free movement . It was of the view that the Government were entitled to hold that there was a legitimate objective which the rule was designed to achieve , namely to remove the right to vote from those whose links with GPE had diminished and who were not , for the most part at least , directly affected by the laws passed there . It observed :", "\u201c DATE . ... [ T]he DATE rule is designed to establish a test to identify when the absence of residence can fairly be said to have diluted the link with the GPE sufficient to justify the removal of the right to vote . The fact that some residence tests do not properly or proportionately measure the strength of commitment does not mean that the adoption of a non - residence test can not legitimately measure the weakening of commitment . This rule does not fix on non - residence at some particular point in time ; it requires a consistent period of non - residence . In my judgment that is a justified way to measure the dilution of commitment . Thereafter the choice of a bright line rule is inevitable . It would in my view be wholly impracticable to adopt a rule which required consideration of the personal circumstances of all potential expatriate voters ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found that decisions of this ORG upholding residence rules were \u201c highly material \u201d ( referring to GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ; and PERSON GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court considered that the exceptions to the DATE period for certain categories of citizens were justified as the individuals concerned were resident in other GPE at the request of GPE in order to look after its national interests .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of ORG on both the question of the existence of an interference with free movement rights and the question of justification . Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment for the court and , on the latter issue , noted in particular :", "\u201c CARDINAL . First , ORG was entitled to hold ... that the DATE rule had a legitimate aim , i.e. to test the strength of a NORP citizen \u2019s links with the GPE over a significant period of time by measuring past commitment to the GPE and seeing whether it was sufficiently diminished or diluted to justify removal of the right to vote in parliamentary elections . That aim was legitimate for the purpose of confining the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with an ascertainable , continuing , close and objective connection with the GPE , whose government made decisions and whose ORG passed laws that most directly affected those NORP citizens resident in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the residence of a citizen is not ... an arbitrary measure of connection with a country : far from it , residence is a relevant , rational and practicable criterion for assessing the closeness of the links between a NORP citizen and the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the DATE rule is proportionate to the aim . The length of the period represents CARDINAL NORP terms . It provides a substantial opportunity for continued voting by NORP citizens who have moved to reside in another ORG country .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , it is impracticable for the franchise criteria to be other than bright line rules capable of reasonably consistent practical application . It would be unworkable and disproportionate for the electoral authorities to have to make individual merits assessments of the particular circumstances of each resident in another ORG country on a case - by - case basis in order to determine how close a connection there is between that particular individual and the GPE despite prolonged absence .", "CARDINAL . Fifthly , there is no objectionable inconsistency of treatment arising from the excepted categories of overseas residents , such as members of the armed services and ORG employees . In general , they do not move to reside overseas as a voluntary exercise of the right to free movement ... [ T]heir circumstances are distinguishable from those of the claimant and others who , like him , have chosen , for their own personal reasons , to live in another Member ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Most of the citizens in NORP countries who are temporarily working or staying abroad are registered in the Voters\u2019 List in their country of origin .

It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . CARDINAL question arises from the aforesaid facts : why do most of the states decide to adopt the concept that links the right of a citizen to vote with his or her residence ? The methodology of voter registration determines the distribution of the polling stations , and accordingly results in the layout of the electoral districts . But , citizens who are abroad on DATE in the same ORG member states may exercise their right to vote in the diplomatic and consular offices or by mail . However , according to the legislation of the same countries , they would have to return to their country and cast their vote in the polling station located in the municipality where their last residence was before they left the country . Not all of them might be in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . In our view , the country of origin should find a formula to encompass this category of voters who reside abroad and want to exercise their right to vote , but can not come to their country on DATE . It is up to the citizen to decide whether or not he / she wishes to exercise this right . The same approach should be applied to the legal requirement for passive suffrage ... This approach is particularly important for countries with a large numbers of its nationals living abroad , who , at the same time , maintain relations with [ the ] state ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A subsequent opinion on ORG DATE ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) adopted by ORG in DATE noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The right to vote as CARDINAL of the fundamental political rights is also fundamental for the fulfilment of a number of civil and social rights . At the same time the principles of universality , equality , freedom and secret ballots are the CARDINAL pillars of the NORP electoral heritage and they are introduced into the constitutions and electoral legislation of the member and observer states of ORG . In this respect the abolition of existing restrictions on the right to vote should be of interest to states and it should also serve as an issue for further activities of ORG and other international organisations .", "CARDINAL . In some member and observer states of ORG , the implementation of existing standards and general principles is deeply influenced by customs , and traditions , but most of all by the level of political culture . In a number of cases and situations in countries of LOC and elsewhere various norms and practices have been established which restrict the right to vote to certain categories of people . Such restrictions are problematic from a human rights perspective . NORP institutions and in this case ORG of ORG are working to overcome such restrictions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The opinion concluded that ORG was following the achievements in the area of democratic elections and in respect of voting rights as one of the basic human rights which would continue to influence improvements in international and national legislation .", "CARDINAL . A report on ORG in LOC , adopted by ORG in DATE ( CDL - AD ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , noted , on the question of overseas voters :", "\u201c CARDINAL . External voting rights , e.g. granting nationals living abroad the right to vote , are a relatively new phenomenon . Even in long - established democracies , citizens living in foreign countries were not given voting rights until DATE ( e.g. GPE , GPE ) or DATE ( e.g. , GPE , GPE ) . In the meantime , however , many emerging or new democracies in LOC have introduced legal provisions for external voting ( out - of - country voting , overseas voting ) . Although it is yet not common in LOC , the introduction of external voting rights might be considered , if not yet present . However , safeguards must be implemented to ensure the integrity of the vote ..... \u201d", "DATE . In DATE ORG adopted a report on ORG Voting ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) . The report noted the complexity of the issue of the right to vote of overseas electors and indicated that it was within the scope of the ORG \u2019s own sovereignty to decide whether to grant the right to vote to citizens residing abroad . The report identified the following arguments in favour of out - of - country voting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Legal recognition of citizens is based on the principle of \u2018 ORG . The citizens of a country therefore enjoy , in principle , all the civil rights recognised in that country .", "CARDINAL . The principle of \u2018 out - of - country ORG enables citizens living outside their country of origin to continue participating in the political life of their country on a \u2018 remote\u2019 basis ...", "CARDINAL . Out - of - country voting guarantees equality between citizens living in the country and expatriates .", "CARDINAL . It ensures that citizens maintain ties with their country of origin and boosts their feeling of belonging to a nation of which they are members regardless of geographical , economic or political circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Discussing the nature and effects of restrictions imposed , the report observed :", "\u201c DATE . In the case of states whose citizens live abroad in large numbers , to the extent that their votes could appreciably affect election results , it seems more appropriate to provide parliamentary representation for the citizens resident abroad by pre - defined numbers of members of parliament elected by them ...", "CARDINAL . Given that , in the case of national elections at least , it is exceptional for foreign nationals to have the right to vote in their place of residence , citizens residing abroad are likely to be unable to vote anywhere if they do not have the right to vote in their country of origin . Denying them that right is therefore equivalent to a derogation from the right to vote . It should be possible to find a solution more in keeping with the principle of proportionality by placing certain restrictions on voting rights of citizens residing abroad .", "CARDINAL . Restrictions of a formal nature or based on the voting procedure make it possible to exclude persons having no ties with the country of origin \u2013 who will probably not vote anyway . The mere fact of requiring registration on an electoral roll , usually for a limited period , calls for action on the part of potential voters .", "CARDINAL . One might also wonder whether , instead of excluding citizens residing abroad completely , it would not be preferable to restrict the right to vote to those who have lived in the country for a certain time , and to set a limit on the period for which they retain the right to vote after leaving the country ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the loss of the right to vote after a specified period of absence , the report added :", "\u201c DATE . ... it would nevertheless be preferable for the situation to be reconsidered , rather than for provision to be made for the right to vote to be purely and simply lost . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report concluded that national practices regarding the right to vote of citizens living abroad and its exercise were far from uniform in LOC . However , developments in legislation pointed to a favourable trend in out - of - country voting , in national elections at least , as regards citizens who had maintained ties with their country of origin . The ORG accepted that the denial of the right to vote to citizens living abroad or the placing of limits on that right constituted a restriction of the principle of universal suffrage . However , it did not consider at this stage that the principles of the NORP electoral heritage required the introduction of such a right , namely a right for all expatriate citizens to vote in their ORG of nationality which was subject to no residence qualification . The Commission nonetheless suggested , in view of ORG mobility , that GPE adopt a positive approach to the right to vote of citizens living abroad , since this right fostered the development of national and NORP citizenship", "CARDINAL .
