CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , an advocate practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother , ORG , became the owner of a QUANTITY plot of land in GPE and was registered as such in the land register . It would appear that the land in question was sequestered on DATE by the NORP authorities .", "Meanwhile , in DATE the applicant \u2019s mother had built a garage and a QUANTITY residential building comprising of CARDINAL flats on it , but without recording them in the land register .", "The applicant claims that in DATE , her mother and she were forcibly evicted from the building by the NORP authorities without any formal decision . She further claims that no proceedings leading to appropriation of the building were ever instituted , nor was it ever transferred into social ownership and registered as such in the land register .", "During the NORP regime , the authorities awarded the flats in the building to various persons under specially protected tenancies ( stanarsko pravo ) .", "On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s request , ORG ( Zemlji\u0161noknji\u017eni odjel ) of ORG ( PERSON ) recorded the building and the garage in the land register , and registered the applicant \u2019s mother as their owner , on the ground that the applicant \u2019s mother , who died in DATE , had until then been recorded in the land register as the owner of the plot of land on which those constructions had been built . Once the proceedings concerning her late mother \u2019s estate ended ( inheritance proceedings ) , on DATE the applicant , as her heir , registered herself as the owner of the property in question .", "On DATE A.S. and A.B. , the tenants of CARDINAL flats located in the building at issue , brought a civil action against the applicant in ORG seeking : ( a ) a declaration that in DATE the building had been nationalised and transferred into social ownership , ( b ) a declaration of nullity of the applicant \u2019s and her mother \u2019s registration as owners in the land register , and ( c ) deletion of those entries from the land register and registration of the property in the name of GPE . GPE later intervened in the proceedings on the side of the plaintiffs .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action and ruled in favour of the applicant . The court held that , while LAW and Construction Land of DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) had indeed provided that residential buildings conforming to certain criteria were nationalised and transferred into social ownership by its mere entry into force ( ex lege ) , it had also required the authorities to issue individual decisions determining which buildings had been nationalised under that LAW . Thus , in the absence of an individual decision issued in respect of the building in question , the court concluded that it had not been nationalised .", "Following an appeal by the plaintiffs and the intervener , on DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) reversed the first - instance judgment and ruled for the plaintiffs . It held that under LAW all residential buildings conforming to the criteria set forth in that LAW had been nationalised ex lege and that the individual decisions to be issued by the authorities had only been of a declaratory nature . Thus , the failure of the NORP authorities to issue such a decision in the applicant \u2019s case did not mean that the building in question had not been nationalised . The relevant part of ORG judgment read as follows :", "\u201c The gist of the dispute between the parties is whether the building [ in question ] , in which the plaintiffs were holders of specially protected tenancy in respect of the flats in it , could be considered nationalised by the operation of law on DATE of the entry into force of [ LAW ] .", "...", "The first - instance court correctly found , given the absence of a decision on nationalisation of the said building ( ... ) , that as a preliminary issue it had to be determined whether the provisions of [ the DATE LAW ] could be applied to the building in question .", "Relying on section CARDINAL of [ the DATE LAW ] , the first - instance court established beyond dispute that the building at issue has CARDINAL flats or CARDINAL small flats , as it did at the time the LAW had been passed , and that [ the LAW ] accordingly applied to it .", "... However , the first - instance court is of the view that a decision on nationalisation should also have been rendered in order to establish which building or part of a building was nationalised , [ which meant that ] \u2018 those buildings and parts of buildings in respect of which the competent authority did not establish that they were nationalised DATE in a decision rendered in the proceedings prescribed by [ the DATE LAW ] DATE were not nationalised.\u2019", "This view of the first - instance court is incorrect , primarily because it contradicts section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of [ LAW ] .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act expressly provided that buildings , parts of buildings and construction land passed into social ownership on DATE of [ its ] entry into force .", "Therefore , what is important is the date of the entry into force of [ LAW ] and not the delivery of a decision .", "On DATE of the Act \u2019s entry into force all immovable property to which [ it ] was applicable was by the operation of law nationalised and became social property . [ Accordingly ] , from that date the former owners were no longer able to exercise any prerogatives of an owner in respect of those buildings , and the decisions issued in implementation of that Act were of a declaratory character .", "...", "Therefore , the fact that a certain immovable property was nationalised by the operation of law on DATE of the entry into force of [ LAW ] , is not altered by the fact that a potential decision on nationalisation was not issued or executed in the land register , or even by the fact that , as in the present case , the property itself was not recorded in the land register .", "...", "As regards the arguments raised in reply to the appeal , it should also be said that even though the legal system of GPE no longer recognises social ownership , for certain legal relations derived from social ownership it is sometimes still necessary to interpret provisions of statutes enacted [ during the NORP regime ] . This does not mean that nationalisation is being carried out retroactively , because , as already stated above , it occurred in DATE , on DATE of the entry into force of [ the DATE LAW ] .", "However , the protection of the rights of [ third ] persons acquired in the implementation of that and other statutes enacted in that period depends on their correct interpretation . In the present case that means protection of the rights of plaintiffs who acquired specially protected tenancy of ( and thereby the right to purchase ) the flats [ located ] in the building [ in question ] . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance judgment alleging violations of her constitutional rights to a fair hearing and ownership . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed her complaint . The relevant part of ORG decision read as follows :", "\u201c LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "The right of ownership shall be guaranteed .", "ORG protects the right of ownership at the constitutional level in a manner that it prevents restriction or taking of that right by the state authorities , unless a restriction or taking is provided for by law .", "ORG , having regard to the reasons [ adduced by ] the second - instance court ... , finds that the constitutional guarantee [ of ownership ] was not breached .", "The provision of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW , which provides that ownership may be restricted or taken in accordance with the law and in the interest of GPE subject to payment of compensation equal to its market value , is not relevant in the present case because it [ the case ] concerns [ a ] fact which occurred on DATE . \u201d", "The relevant part of the Ownership and Other Rights In Rem Act ( Zakon o vlasni\u0161tvu i drugim stvarnim pravima , ORG nos .
