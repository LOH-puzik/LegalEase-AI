NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was brought up by his mother , who is of NORP origin and speaks little LANGUAGE . He was DATE at the time of the events in question .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was a registered pupil at FAC , a ORG secondary school in GPE , GPE . The CARDINAL - CARDINAL academic year was his final year of compulsory schooling . In DATE he was due to take ORG examinations in CARDINAL subjects as well as a GNVQ ( vocational qualification ) in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not have a history of being a disruptive pupil . However , on DATE he assaulted the school \u2019s canteen manager . He was seen by her to be pushing his way into the canteen queue and , when she told him to stop , he abused her verbally . Despite attempts by several teachers to calm him down , the applicant knocked a sandwich out of the canteen manager \u2019s hand and then grabbed her wrist and twisted it . The applicant caused injury to her wrist which required hospital treatment and CARDINAL GPE sick leave from work .", "CARDINAL . The school authorities took the view that the level of violence used and threatened by the applicant was extremely intimidating . The Headteacher decided that the applicant should be permanently excluded from the school . This decision was approved by ORG and he was so notified in a letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant exercised his statutory right of appeal to ORG ( ORG ) . The hearing took place on DATE . The ORG considered written and oral evidence from the applicant and other witnesses . It did not , however , hear evidence concerning the views of the teaching staff and their unions as to whether it would be possible to reintegrate the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG delivered its decision by a letter to the applicant \u2019s mother dated DATE , as follows :", "\u201c After careful consideration of your representations both oral and written and those of ORG and in the light of the available evidence , the Panel concluded to direct [ the applicant \u2019s ] reinstatement , with a view to a staggered reinstatement , with [ the applicant ] back in full - time education by CARDINAL term . You are advised to contact the Headteacher of ORG to arrange an appointment .", "In coming to their decision , the ORG accepted that :", "\u25aa [ The applicant ] did what he was alleged to have done and this was supported by the evidence presented both by the school and [ his own ] admission .", "The ORG then took into consideration the guidance from the Secretary of ORG before coming to their decision . In this instance , the panel felt there were exceptional circumstances and after considering all the relevant factors , that permanent exclusion was not the appropriate sanction . The reasons for the panel decision were as follows :", "\u25aa [ The applicant ] previously had a relatively unblemished record ;", "\u25aa [ The applicant ] behaved \u201c out of character \u201d and possible medical factors could have contributed to his behaviour ;", "\u25aa Took into consideration the stage in [ the applicant \u2019s ] education .", "The ORG then considered the broader interests of other pupils and staff in school , as well as those of [ the applicant ] and ... though it was reasonable of the school to consider permanent exclusion , it was felt that long term fixed exclusion would have been the most appropriate sanction in this instance .", "In conclusion , the ORG endorsed your suggestion that [ the applicant ] be provided with a packed lunch in future . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Headteacher did not agree with the ORG \u2019s decision but he informed the staff at the school that he was under a legal duty to provide the applicant with an education . On DATE the representative at the school of ORG ) , of which the majority of the teaching staff were members , sent an e - mail to all members of staff at the school informing them that the ORG members had decided to call for \u201c a ballot not to teach or supervise the student who was reinstated on appeal after assaulting a member of staff \u201d . The Headteacher was also informed by the other ORG union represented at the school that its members would vote in favour of industrial action if asked to teach the applicant . The Headteacher therefore formed the view that if he directed the teaching staff to accept the applicant back into the class - rooms they would vote in favour of industrial action and refuse to teach him . He therefore informed the applicant \u2019s mother that , if the applicant wanted to continue to be educated at the school , this would take place in a room on his own . In the alternative , he could attend classes in ORG and LANGUAGE at a local further education college , with a personal tutor to teach him ORG .", "CARDINAL . Initially , the offer of college provision was refused because the applicant wished to continue to be educated at his school . The family enlisted the help of a local councillor to seek to persuade the school to take him back , but the representatives of the ORG refused to talk to him .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant decided to accept the limited tuition being offered at the further education college , because he felt that being taught in isolation at the school , without being allowed any contact with his friends , would make him \u201c feel like a criminal \u201d . At the college he received CARDINAL ORG tuition DATE in Maths and English Literature . Until DATE he did not receive any teaching in any of his other ORG or PERSON subjects , nor in any of the other national curriculum subjects such as physical education , other than DATE of coaching in ORG and DATE in ORG provided by external tutors who taught him in isolation in a room at the school .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant issued proceedings for judicial review of the school \u2019s decision . On DATE representatives of the ORG wrote to PERSON at GPE indicating that they intended to hold a ballot of their members at the school . On DATE the Headteacher and Chairman of ORG were informed that , following a ballot , the ORG would commence industrial action on DATE . This would initially take the form of a refusal to teach , supervise or otherwise work with the applicant , but could escalate to a strike if disciplinary measures were taken against an ORG member as a result .", "CARDINAL . The High Court gave judgment on DATE . The applicant had argued , inter alia , that the offer to teach him in isolation did not amount to \u201c reinstatement \u201d ; that the Headteacher had been too greatly influenced by the threat of industrial action ; and that the school owed him a statutory duty , which it had not met , to provide him with tuition in the national curriculum subjects in which he had planned to take GCSEs . PERSON held , inter alia , that the position taken by the ORG had to be respected , unless it could be shown to be a sham , and that the \u201c reinstatement \u201d required by the ORG \u2019s decision did not have to include reinstatement to the class - room as before . During the course of the proceedings the school had given an undertaking to use its best endeavours , without using ORG teachers , to supply the applicant with tuition in his other ORG subjects , and in the light of this undertaking the judge did not consider it necessary to decide whether the applicant was owed a statutory duty . He was \u201c unpersuaded that the reaction of the Headteacher to the industrial discontent among the majority of the teaching staff was unreasonable or disproportionate \u201d and concluded :", "\u201c In my judgment the maintenance of the regime must be regularly tested , and its reasonableness and the reasonableness of its continuation depend upon the facts . On the evidence before me the imposition of the regime was reasonable in all the circumstances . It might well have been that there would have come a time when it became unreasonable to continue that regime . However , it is quite plain that the industrial difficulties which the school faces preventing complete reinstatement continue as of now . I conclude that the imposition of the regime was not unlawful , and that , accompanied by the without prejudice undertaking , the continuation remains lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following this judgment and the undertaking given during the proceedings , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant received TIME tuition DATE at the school , using external tutors , in ORG studies , LANGUAGE Literature and ORG . The applicant sat ORG and GNVQ examinations in DATE . He failed to achieve a grade C or higher in any of them and was not , therefore , able to continue to study for A Levels as he had hoped . In addition to the academic consequences , the applicant had no contact with his former teachers or fellow pupils at the school for the entirety of DATE . He was not permitted to take part in any extra - curricular activities or to mix with pupils during breaks .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . His appeal was dismissed by a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG and Another [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . ORG commenced by observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . This is a troubling case , as any school exclusion case is likely to be . There are particular factors here which give rise to concern . The applicant ... has been brought up by his mother alone and she speaks little LANGUAGE . He has clearly had a number of hurdles to overcome . He is now in DATE , leading to ORG exams DATE . He is currently in course of taking , as I understand it , CARDINAL ORG subjects . He has generally had a good record . On any view , it is tragic that his education has been disrupted at this critical period as a result of what everyone agrees was a CARDINAL - off and uncharacteristic incident .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the function of this court is very limited and is concerned simply with any legal defects in the school \u2019s response to the problem . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued by finding that the case could not be distinguished from ORG ( see Relevant domestic law , below ) . In that case ORG held that the term \u201c reinstate \u201d in the applicable legislation connoted restoration of the legal relationship between the pupil and the school community . Once the pupil had been reinstated , the management of his further educational regime had to be consistent with his status as a pupil of the school and was a question of reasonableness and proportionality on the facts of each case . He observed that ORG in ORG had made clear that the threat of industrial action was a relevant matter which the Headteacher was entitled to take into account and he concluded that :", "\u201c Short of perversity in response to that threat , I see no basis on which it can be said to give rise to an error of law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . He considered that the question whether the school owed the applicant a duty under LAW CARDINAL to provide tuition as required by the national curriculum was \u201c potentially important and ... far from straightforward \u201d . However , he held that PERSON , in the exercise of his discretion , had been entitled to take the view that it was better to accept the undertaking offered by the school as being the most practical way forward :", "\u201c That being the case , it would be wrong for this court to interfere unless the judge \u2019s approach was outside the bounds of his discretion . Although other judges might have taken a different view , I can not see error of principle in his approach \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( section CARDINAL ) and the Education ( LAW ) ( ORG ) ( England ) DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) regulation CARDINAL ) provide that ORG must set up independent appeal panels ( \u201c IAPs ) to enable the parents of children permanently excluded from maintained schools to appeal against that exclusion .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , following an appeal , the ORG may : ( a ) uphold the exclusion ; ( b ) direct that the pupil is to be reinstated ( either immediately or by a date specified in the direction ) ; or ( c ) decide that because of exceptional circumstances or for other reasons it is not practical to give a direction requiring his reinstatement , but that it would otherwise have been appropriate to give such a direction .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the decision of an ORG to reinstate a pupil is binding on the Governors of the school in question , the school \u2019s Headteacher and the applicable ORG .", "CARDINAL . The constitution of IAPs is set out in the Schedule of the Exclusion Regulations CARDINAL . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL , an ORG must have either CARDINAL members . CARDINAL member must be a lay member with no experience of managing a school . If it is a CARDINAL - member ORG , the other members must be : CARDINAL person who is , or has been in DATE , the Headteacher of a maintained school and CARDINAL person who is , or has been in DATE , the Governor of a maintained school . If the panel is made up of CARDINAL members , there are CARDINAL ORG and CARDINAL Governors on the panel as well as the lay member . The consequence is that the ORG always has a majority of members who have experience in matters of school discipline and have been , or are , involved in the management of a school .", "CARDINAL . In R v Governors of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , ORG held that where an ORG ordered the \u201c reinstatement \u201d of a permanently excluded pupil , that pupil could still be regarded as \u201c reinstated \u201d where he was effectively permitted no contact with the rest of the school community for the remainder of his time at the school and was taught in isolation by a retired teacher . ORG held , by CARDINAL majority , that a school which treated a pupil in this way following an order of an ORG had complied with the order to \u201c reinstate \u201d the pupil even if it made no effort to reintegrate him . In that case , the time spent in isolation was DATE of DATE . In the L case , like the applicant \u2019s , the reason that the pupil in question was taught in isolation was that the teachers had threatened industrial action . Although some members of ORG were strongly critical of the teachers , the view of the majority was that , given the effect on the rest of the school of the teachers striking , it was a rational managerial decision for Headteacher and Governors to educate the pupil in question for DATE in isolation from the rest of the school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE as judgment was handed down in the L case , ORG handed down a judgment in P v ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . It concerned an application brought by a pupil under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( \u201c TULCRA \u201d ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , an individual who is affected by unlawful industrial action may bring a claim in ORG against the union or person that had induced others to take part in the industrial action . The claimant in the P case was a pupil whom teaching unions had refused to teach . He argued that the refusal constituted \u201c unlawful industrial action \u201d as it was not part of a \u201c trade dispute \u201d within the meaning of ORG section CARDINAL and therefore was not protected pursuant to section CARDINAL . ORG rejected the claim . It held that there was a dispute between employees and employers which related to the job the employees were required to do , and/or a dispute as to the terms and conditions on which the teachers were employed . The dispute was , ORG concluded , a \u201c trade dispute \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL . It was , therefore , not unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The ORG incorporates the ORG into GPE law .
