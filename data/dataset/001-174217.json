De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON and FAC , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants owned a piece of land in GPE , GPE , consisting of a rural building and an adjoining piece of land . No building permit existed at the relevant time in regard to this land .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE or thereabouts works were being carried out in the valley situated below the applicants\u2019 land . At the same time part of the applicants\u2019 land was being used as a road in order to provide temporary access , for large vehicles and machinery , to the valley where the works were being carried out . At the time the applicants tolerated this situation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the road was tarmacked by the authorities . It appeared that ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) considered that this temporary access road , as well as an adjoining piece of land ( also owned by the applicants , which had been used by ORG to build a football ground in DATE or thereabouts , despite a lack of authorisation ) , were government property .", "CARDINAL . At the time the applicants permitted the use of their land by third parties , and raised no objections to ORG actions , because they had no pressing need of the property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG claimed that the land ( both the road and the land used for the football ground ) was public property .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants instituted civil proceedings ( before ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction ) for eviction , on the grounds that ORG was occupying the part of the land used as a football ground without title . Employees from the then ORG testified that the land in question had never been public property and had never been the subject of a declaration of expropriation in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . During those proceedings a constitutional complaint was also raised .", "CARDINAL . A decision in the case appears to have been delivered on DATE . The applicants made no reference to the outcome of this case in their application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants built walls around the land owned by them , with the result that access to the road was no longer possible . On DATE ORG instituted civil proceedings against the applicants , arguing that they were blocking the road , that there had been spoliation of the road , and that they were preventing ORG from exercising its duty to administer and maintain the road .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , although the applicants\u2019 legal counsel appeared at the relevant hearing and made submissions , the applicants themselves failed to participate in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its ordinary civil jurisdiction , found against the applicants . The court noted their absence and the lack of any evidence put forward by them , despite the repeated attempts of their legal counsel . Moreover , the case being an actio spolii \u2013 which had to limit itself to the question of possession and not to the actual ownership of the land \u2013 the court found that the plaintiffs ( ORG ) had satisfied the CARDINAL conditions for the success of such an action by proving , inter alia , that they had possession of the land in question at the time the walls were built .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the first - instance judgment , to the effect that ORG had possession of the land at issue , since it was ORG which maintained the road and traffic regularly used it .", "CARDINAL . Pending the conclusion of the above proceedings , in DATE the applicants submitted an application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for a permit to develop their land ( including the land at issue ) . They wished to develop it into a single - storey gymnasium / fitness centre .", "CARDINAL . ORG objected on several grounds , including the fact that the proposed development was located on a public road used by both pedestrians and vehicles .", "CARDINAL . In a report drawn up by a ORG case officer , it was proposed to reject the objections raised by ORG . He considered the development acceptable and suggested that the necessary building permit be issued .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG recommended that the permit be granted .", "CARDINAL . The ORG board considered that the applicants\u2019 pending application depended on the outcome of ORG ( PC ) application ( see below ) , therefore it chose to postpone its final assessment until the outcome of that application .", "CARDINAL . Following the outcome of the PC application ( see below ) , on an unspecified date ORG changed its position and recommended that the application be refused , on the grounds that the proposed development would encroach beyond the proposed official building alignment as set out by the ORG \u2019s Land Surveyor .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed an appeal with ORG . A decision in the appeal is still pending . The applicants allege that ORG is awaiting the outcome of the application before this ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a PC application to the ORG , requesting that the existing road be formalised and thus considered a schemed road .", "CARDINAL . The applicants objected , since no such road existed in any formal plans , while the ORG argued that , since it was being used as a road , it had to be considered a road .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG PC application was approved , resulting in the existing road being recognised as a schemed road , in the interest of proper planning .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , no avenue of appeal against such a decision existed , in accordance with LAW ( LAW of LAW ) , since LAW ( LAW of LAW ) had not yet come into force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings , asking ORG ( FAC ) , in its constitutional competence , to find a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and declare the ORG decision in favour of ORG PC application unlawful , and requesting compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in its constitutional competence , decided not to take cognisance of the merits of the case , in so far as the applicants had not exhausted ordinary remedies which could have sufficiently addressed the infringements of their rights . Referring to the general principles of the ORG \u2019s case - law , it considered that the applicants had an effective remedy , namely an ordinary civil remedy , which they had not used . Indeed , the applicants had instituted ordinary civil proceedings ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL JZM , see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) in relation to that part of the land where a football pitch had been built , despite their also raising a constitutional complaint under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention in that case . Therefore , there was no reason why the applicants could not have utilised the same ordinary remedy with regard to the part of the land which had become a road , instead of instituting constitutional redress proceedings in this regard . While it was true that , in the present case , the applicants were claiming compensation in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage , such claims were to be made only after a finding in favour of the applicants by the ordinary court .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court held that , in relation to their claim against the ORG decision , while it was true that no avenue of appeal existed against it , the applicants had failed to utilise the judicial review procedure ( Article CARDINALA of the Code of ORG ) . While that procedure was limited in the form of redress it could give ( Article CARDINAL A(CARDINAL ) ) , the applicants could nevertheless have asked the court to annul the ORG decision in favour of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed , claiming that they did not have an ordinary , effective , just and adequate remedy available to them . In particular , they argued that , while it was normal to lodge an eviction action against ORG occupying the land used as a football ground , it could not lodge an eviction action in relation to a piece of land which was not physically occupied , but solely a projected road on paper .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the ORG claims and upheld the decision of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , by a judgment of DATE , ORG had confirmed that ORG had possession of the land . It followed that an ordinary civil action for eviction was possible . As to the remedy of judicial review , while it was true that such a review was not intended to deal with human rights violations , and that , according to domestic case - law , [ LAW ] sub - article CARDINAL ( a ) referred to constitutional violations other than those arising from fundamental human rights and freedoms , in the present case the applicants should have used that remedy : requesting that the court annul the ORG decision on application CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the grounds that it had been made on the basis of an allegedly unlawful premise ( namely , a false declaration made by the ORG as to the existence of a road ) . Coupled with this , the applicants could have used ordinary civil proceedings for a declaration that the passage or road in question was their property and to seek the eviction of ORG therefrom in so far as they claimed that ORG was occupying the land illegally in the absence of an expropriation according to law ; as well as requesting compensation for the unlawful occupation of LOC . According to ORG , these were ordinary , effective , efficient , and available remedies which should have been exhausted before the applicants instituted extraordinary constitutional redress proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of ORG , LAW of LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Saving as is otherwise provided by law , the courts of justice of civil jurisdiction may enquire into the validity of any administrative act or declare such act null , invalid or without effect only in the following cases :", "( a ) where the administrative act is in violation of the LAW ;", "( b ) when the administrative act is ultra vires on any of the following grounds :", "( i ) when such act emanates from a public authority that is not authorised to perform it ; or", "( ii ) when a public authority has failed to observe the principles of natural justice or mandatory procedural requirements in performing the administrative act or in its prior deliberations thereon ; or", "( iii ) when the administrative act constitutes an abuse of the public authority \u2019s power in that it is done for improper purposes or on the basis of irrelevant considerations ; or", "( iv ) when the administrative act is otherwise contrary to law .", "( CARDINAL ) In this article -", "\" administrative act \" includes the issuing by a public authority of any order , licence , permit , warrant , decision , or a refusal to any demand of a claimant , but does not include any measure intended for internal organization or administration within the said authority", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
