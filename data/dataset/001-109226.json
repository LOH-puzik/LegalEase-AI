CARDINAL on the prevention , discovery and punishment of acts of corruption ( \u201c PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201d ) . Thus , LAW no .

When the proceedings resumed the applicant submitted that the final judgment of DATE could only be challenged by means of an appeal in the interests of the law and not by an application to have it quashed , and that there were no plausible reasons to justify his pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , upheld the application , quashed the judgment of DATE and , on the merits , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the ground that the aforementioned judgment had incorrectly interpreted LAW no . LANGUAGE . It considered that the application of the amendments to PERSON no . CARDINAL and to the ORG led to the conclusion that the legislature \u2019s intention had been to ensure a single set of rules concerning pre - trial detention , namely that it was to be ordered by a single - judge bench sitting in private , whatever the nature of the offence .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the case file , which contained sufficient information to suggest that each of the persons under criminal investigation could have committed the offences with which they had been charged , ORG also held that their pre - trial detention was justified .", "CARDINAL .

Otherwise , we would be arrested . That being so , my colleague PERSON asked to be assisted by a lawyer of his choosing . The prosecutor replied that the CARDINAL women present , who were officially appointed lawyers , would assist them . PERSON refused their assistance and said that he would not make a statement . The prosecutor started to insult him , calling him a peasant , and told him that he would be arrested even if he did n\u2019t make a statement and that he would never see his family again if he did n\u2019t cooperate .

Consequently , they were given a CARDINAL - point questionnaire to which they responded in writing .", "After having obtained their agreement and in the interests of the efficiency of the investigation , I decided that the statements would be made simultaneously in the ORG meeting room because it would have taken TIME to question them individually .
