The second applicant expressed her opposition to the use of morphine or other drugs to relieve distress . She told the doctors that in the event that the first applicant 's heart stopped she would expect resuscitation , including intubation . PERSON considered that this would not be in the first applicant 's best interests , and stated that if death were inevitable all that was on offer was \u201c morphine and TLC [ tender loving care ] \u201d . PERSON case notes recorded that :", "\u201c These replies [ of the second applicant ] are contrary to decisions particularly previously made and I do not believe that further intensive care is in [ the first applicant 's ] best interest .

PERSON contemporaneous notes on the matter state :", "\u201c The position appears to me to be precarious . He may recover with the antibiotics but the inability to cough secretions makes it possible that he will deteriorate and die . I have discussed the latter scenario . Mother says that she would like bag and mask but understands that it would not be appropriate to go on to full intubation and ORG treatment . This is as discussed with PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON and the second applicant also discussed on that occasion the use of morphine in therapeutic doses . The applicants point out that Dr ORG recognised that :", "\u201c In the event of total disagreement we should be obliged to go to the courts to provide support for decision . Mother says she does not understand this . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant 's condition deteriorated . He was admitted to PERSON Hospital on DATE , and then again on DATE following respiratory failure .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was treated over the course of DATE . His condition was reviewed on separate occasions by CARDINAL doctors , both of whom expressed serious concern about his prospects of surviving . Dr PERSON observed that the first applicant looked \u201c ghastly \u201d and \u201c exhausted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , the medical opinion was that the first applicant \u201c was going into the terminal phase of respiratory failure \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , PERSON noted that the first applicant was \u201c dying from his lung disease \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The doctors treating the first applicant advised that diamorphine should be administered to him , believing that he had entered a terminal phase and required pain relief . The second applicant and other members of the family did not agree with the doctors ' view that her son was dying and were very concerned that the administration of diamorphine ( previously morphine had been mentioned ) would compromise his chances of recovery . The second applicant voiced her concerns at a meeting with PERSON and ORG and ORG of ORG . A woman police officer was also present . The hospital persisted in its wish to give the first applicant diamorphine , while the second applicant was given an assurance that he would only be given \u201c the smallest possible dose \u201d . According to the applicants , the Chief Executive of ORG had an influential role at the meeting and made it clear to the second applicant that diamorphine would be given to the first applicant . They refer in this connection to a letter written by ORG to the applicants ' MP on DATE , in which he stated that he had instructed the doctors to administer diamorphine to the first applicant at the minimum dosage over DATE period . The Government assert that the Chief Executive had no role to play whatsoever in the exercise of clinical judgment in the first applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . The notes of PERSON , PERSON and ORG all stressed that the administration of morphine was not intended to kill the first applicant but to relieve his distress . PERSON observed in his notes that the doctors who had met with the second applicant had stressed that the \u201c use of morphine is NOT euthanasia \u2013 it is to relieve [ the first applicant 's ] distress ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant subsequently expressed the wish to take the first applicant home if the doctors were correct in their view that he was dying . A police officer in attendance advised her that if she attempted to remove him , she would be arrested . The hospital also indicated that unless the family members present allowed the doctors to commence diamorphine the police would remove them also . The second applicant tried without success to contact her solicitor , including at the latter 's home .", "CARDINAL . A diamorphine infusion was commenced at TIME on DATE . The applicants maintain that the dose administered , namely QUANTITY , was in reality an adult dose and excessive for a child of the first applicant 's age . The Government deny this and point to the first applicant 's weight and to the fact that previous treatment with opiates had rendered the first applicant more tolerant to them .", "CARDINAL . A dispute broke out in the hospital involving the family members ( but not the second applicant ) and the doctors . The family members believed that the first applicant was being covertly euthanased and attempted to prevent the doctors from entering the first applicant 's room . The hospital authorities called the security staff and threatened to remove the family from the hospital by force .", "CARDINAL . A do - not - resuscitate order ( DNR ) was put in the first applicant 's medical notes without consulting the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The dosage was reduced by CARDINAL at TIME on DATE in response to the family 's continuing objections . The Government draw attention to the views of the doctors that the dose administered to the first applicant had improved his condition . PERSON found that it was :", "\u201c a real relief and pleasant to see [ the first applicant ] peaceful and settled ... and his overall condition including agitation and distress had markedly improved \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The following day the second applicant found that her son 's condition had deteriorated alarmingly and was worried that this was due to the effect which the diamorphine was having on him . The family became extremely agitated and demanded that diamorphine be stopped . PERSON stated that this was only possible if the family agreed not to resuscitate or stimulate the first applicant . The Government contend that PERSON objective was to prevent the family from disturbing the first applicant by creating undue noise and touching him , since at that time he was peaceful , breathing deeply and was not in distress .", "CARDINAL . The family tried to revive the first applicant and a fight broke out between certain members of the family and PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant successfully resuscitated her son while the fight was going on . At some stage the police were summoned to the hospital in response to the assaults on FAC and PERSON . Several police officers were injured and the mother of another patient on the ward was pushed against a wall . All but CARDINAL of the children on the ward had to be evacuated . The injuries sustained by ORG and PERSON were such that they were unable to perform their normal duties for a time .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's condition improved and he was able to respond to stimuli from his relatives . He was able to be discharged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant states that the ORG made no arrangements for any alternative care on discharge for the first applicant . They mention that the Trust did not arrange for him to be given an antidote for diamorphine and that the second applicant had to acquire equipment for measuring his oxygen saturation . In this connection , the Government draw attention to a report by PERSON , which states :", "\u201c It was felt that further care within the hospital setting was impossible and that he would be better managed at home , provided that we could obtain oxygen for the home . Arrangements were made to obtain oxygen and I discussed with his general practitioner to take on the responsibility of caring for his major chest problems at home . I then telephoned the Clinical Director at ORG to enquire whether they would accept him if he had to be readmitted in view of the severe disturbances to the hospital staff . I discussed going home with his mother who agreed to this and we then made telephone calls to community nurses and made arrangements for home oxygen . Following this transport was arranged to take the patient home . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE some of the family members involved in the fracas with the doctors were convicted of assault and ordered to be excluded from the hospital . On DATE their sentences were reduced on appeal . On DATE the Trust had dropped its civil action for trespass against the second applicant for want of a legal basis .", "On DATE the Medical Director of the Trust notified the second applicant in a letter that the paediatric staff at the hospital were anxious about a repetition of the problems which arose when her son was last admitted and were no longer confident of being able to give him the treatment he required . The letter continued :", "\u201c Unfortunately [ ORG ] believe that all we could offer [ the first applicant ] would be to make his remaining life as comfortable as possible and take no active steps to prolong life . This obviously means withholding or giving treatment with which you may not agree . As there seems no easy way to resolve these differences it would be sensible , if [ the first applicant ] required further inpatient care , for this to be provided at another hospital . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was informed that ORG , QUANTITY from her home , was willing to admit and treat her son should he suffer a further attack .", "CARDINAL . The family 's general practitioner subsequently contacted ORG with a view to discussing arrangements for the first applicant 's admission in the event of a future emergency .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant applied for judicial review of the decisions made by the Trust with regard to the medical treatment of her son . The matter came before Mr Justice PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON ruled that the ORG 's decision was not susceptible to review because the situation had passed and would not arise again at the hospitals managed by it or , it was to be hoped , at any other hospital . He added :", "\u201c If there is serious disagreement , the best interests procedure can be involved at short notice and the court will resolve it on the basis of the facts as they are then . They will almost inevitably be different from the facts as they were in DATE . ... In any event it is unclear precisely what the facts were in DATE on the evidence that is before this court . ... Furthermore , if there is a crisis in the future , I am confident that if the matter is brought before the court ORG will again provide assistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In Mr Justice PERSON view , judicial review was too blunt an instrument for the sensitive and on - going problems of the type raised by the case . In particular , he considered that it would be very difficult to frame any declaration in meaningful terms in a hypothetical situation so as not to restrict unnecessarily proper treatment by the doctors in an on - going and developing matter . He stressed in conclusion :", "\u201c Nothing , I would finally say , should be read into this judgment to infer that it is my view that [ ORG ] in this case acted either lawfully or unlawfully . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant applied for permission to appeal to ORG . The application was refused on DATE . Giving judgment , Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , was of the view that the considerations which might arise in relation to the first applicant and other children who suffered from similar disabilities were almost infinite and for the courts to try and produce clarity would be a task fraught with danger . He stated :", "\u201c There are questions of judgment involved . There can be no doubt that the best course is for a parent of a child to agree on the course which the doctors are proposing to take , having fully consulted the parent and for the parent to fully understand what is involved . That is the course which should always be adopted in a case of this nature . If that is not possible and there is a conflict , and if the conflict is of a grave nature , the matter must then be brought before the court so the court can decide what is in the best interests of the child concerned . Faced with a particular problem , the courts will answer that problem . ...", "... The difficulty in this area is that there are conflicting principles involved . The principles of law are clearly established , but how you apply those principles to particular facts is often very difficult to anticipate . It is only when the court is faced with that task that it gives an answer which reflects the view of the court as to what is in the best interests of the child . In doing so it takes into account the natural concerns and the responsibilities of the parent . It also takes into account the views of the doctors , and considers what is the most desirable answer taking the best advice it can obtain from , among others , the Official Solicitor . That is the way , in my judgment , that the courts must react in this very sensitive and difficult area . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON disagreed with Mr Justice PERSON view that the applicants had used the wrong legal procedure . In his opinion , \u201c particularly in cases regarding children , the last thing the court should be concerned about is whether the right procedure has been used in the particular case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant complained to ORG about the conduct of the doctors involved in her son 's care , in particular that they had assaulted him by administering heroin to him against her wishes and without a court authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded that its investigation revealed that the doctors involved had not been guilty of serious professional misconduct or seriously deficient performance and that the treatment complained of had been justified in the light of the emergency situation which confronted the doctors at the material time . According to ORG , the test for bringing disciplinary proceedings against the doctors was not satisfied on the evidence . It had asked itself in this connection whether the doctors put themselves in a reasonable position from which to arrive at the decision they did and whether the decision reached was so \u201c outrageous \u201d that no reasonably competent doctor could have reached it .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also complained to the GPE police about the conduct of the doctors who had treated her son . An investigation was opened . The doctors were interviewed and a report sent to ORG .", "On DATE the second applicant 's solicitors informed her that ORG had decided not to bring charges against the doctors involved for lack of evidence . In a letter dated DATE to her solicitors , ORG indicated the reasons which led to this finding as well as the various materials relied on in reaching its conclusion on the advisability of bringing charges against the doctors in relation to the offences of attempted murder and conspiracy to murder and offences under the ORG against LAW .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG guidance \u201c Seeking patients ' consent : the ethical considerations \u201d provides :", "\u201c Where a child under DATE is not competent to give or withhold the informed consent , a person with parental responsibility may authorise investigations or treatment which are in the child 's best interests . This person may also refuse any intervention where they consider that refusal to be in the child 's best interest , but you are not bound by such a refusal and may seek a ruling from the court . In an emergency , where you consider that it is in the child 's best interest to proceed , you may treat the child , provided it is limited to that treatment which is reasonably required in an emergency . \u201d", "In Re J. ( A ORG ) ( PERSON : Medical Treatment ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG ) , PERSON , Master of the Rolls , stated :", "\u201c The doctors owe the child a duty to care for it in accordance with good medical practice recognised as appropriate by a competent body of professional opinion ... This duty is however subject to the qualification that , if time permits , they must obtain the consent of the parents before undertaking serious invasive treatment .", "The parents owe the child a duty to give or withhold consent in the best interests of the child and without regard to their own interests .", "The court when exercising the parens patriae jurisdiction takes over the rights and duties of the parents , although this is not to say that the parents will be excluded from the decision - making process . Nevertheless in the end the responsibility for the decision whether to give or to withhold consent is that of the court alone .", "...", "No - one can dictate the treatment to be given to the child \u2013 neither court , parents nor doctors .

The court or parents for their part can refuse to consent to treatment A or B or both , but can not insist on treatment C. The inevitable and desirable result is that choice of treatment is in some measure a joint decision of the doctors and the court or parents .", "... \u201d", "In A ORG v. NORP ( [ DATE ] ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , it was held :", "\u201c The court 's clear respect for the sanctity of human life must impose a strong obligation in favour of taking all steps capable of preserving life , save in exceptional circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In that case , the court accepted the views of doctors treating a child that resuscitation of the child in the event of respiratory or cardiac arrest would be inappropriate .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , LANGUAGE law recognises that it may be in the best interests of a child or of an adult to be treated with medication which relieves his symptoms but has the side - effect of hastening death .", "According to Part CARDINAL of ORG guidance \u201c Withholding and withdrawing medical treatment : guidance for decision making \u201d :", "\u201c ... where there is reasonable uncertainty about the benefit of life - prolonging treatment , there should be a presumption in favour of initiating it , although there are circumstances in which active intervention ( other than basic care ) would not be appropriate since best interests is not synonymous with prolongation of life ... If the child 's condition is incompatible with survival or where there is broad consensus that the condition is so severe that treatment would not provide a benefit in terms of being able to restore or maintain the patient 's health , intervention may be unjustified . Similarly , where treatments would involve suffering or distress to the child , these and other burdens must be weighed against the anticipated benefit , even if life can not be prolonged without treatment . \u201d", "Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the DATE ORG guidance \u201c Withholding and withdrawing life - prolonging medical treatment \u201d states :", "\u201c Those with parental responsibility for a baby or young child are legally and morally entitled to give or withhold consent to treatment .

However , parents can not necessarily insist on enforcing decisions based solely on their own preferences where these conflict with good medical evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the time of the facts giving rise to the instant application , guidance had been published by ORG indicating the procedures that should normally be followed in the event of a parent dissenting from the opinion of the health - care team that treatment should be withheld from a child .

Paragraph CARDINAL states :", "\u201c In most cases , with proper explanation and adequate time , parents can accept medical advice , but if the parents do not consent to withdrawal or withhold consent , a second opinion should be obtained and then the courts should be consulted . ORG can be telephoned for advice which will help clarify the need for court involvement . \u201d", "Guidance published by ORG in DATE , entitled \u201c Consent : working with children \u201d , deals explicitly with the situation where clinicians believe that treatment which the parents want is not appropriate .
