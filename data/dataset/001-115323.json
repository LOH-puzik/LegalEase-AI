NORP The applicant Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is unemployed and has been receiving welfare benefits for himself and his CARDINAL children for DATE . Under LAW ( PERSON ) , he is entitled to DATE payments and , in addition , to certain extra allowances and non - cash benefits as specified by law and upon specific request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG , seeking temporary pecuniary assistance ( GPE ) in addition to the benefits already received , without specifying an amount . By an oral decision of the same day ORG granted him MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the applicant \u2019s request , provided him with a written copy of the above oral decision . The applicant , who was not satisfied with the amount granted , appealed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and lowered the amount to ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with ORG and asked for an oral hearing . He argued that ORG decision had been unlawful , in that ORG had not been competent to take the impugned decision , its decision was not sufficiently reasoned and it had not applied the provisions of ORG correctly . The authorities should have granted him a rent allowance equivalent to the full amount of rent paid by him , because rents were high in GPE and they had not objected to the applicant moving to a bigger apartment with his children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that ORG had been competent to take the impugned decision and had decided properly on the applicant\u2019", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant had complained that he should have been entitled to full reimbursement of the rent paid by him , ORG found that , in accordance with the law , a rent allowance was linked to the specific size of an apartment , with a fixed maximum amount for certain sizes . Only in very special circumstances could a higher amount be granted . The applicant had , however , failed throughout the proceedings to give any specific reasons , corroborated by evidence , as to why he should receive a higher rent allowance . The mere indication that rents in GPE were high was not a sufficient argument within the meaning of LAW . With regard to the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing , ORG found that the present case concerned only questions of law which , in line with the ORG \u2019s case - law , did not necessitate a hearing , and accordingly dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG , seeking an additional allowance from DATE , without specifying an amount .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted his request , awarding him EUR DATE . On DATE the applicant , who was not satisfied with the amount granted , appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s appeal and raised the amount to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG against this decision and requested an oral hearing . He submitted the same arguments as in his complaint to ORG concerning his request of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint and his request for an oral hearing for the same reasons as in its decision of the same day relating to the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG seeking an additional allowance from DATE , reimbursement of the costs incurred for the repair of his washing machine and the payment of several electricity , gas and rent bills ; this was granted by several decisions of ORG , including those of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to transfer jurisdiction to the superior authority , on the ground that ORG and ORG itself had already decided on the matter and had granted the requested benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with ORG , together with an application alleging a breach of the administrative authorities\u2019 duty to decide ; he also requested legal aid and asked the court to hold a public hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to provide further information about his complaint . The applicant complied on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint ; this decision was served on his counsel on CARDINAL DATE . ORG listed in detail the decisions taken by ORG and ORG between DATE and CARDINAL DATE in response to the numerous requests lodged by the applicant during this period , from which ORG had concluded that the applicant \u2019s request of DATE had been decided upon . They had , therefore , taken proper decisions , satisfying all the statutory requirements . In such a situation the applicant could not merely claim that CARDINAL of his requests had not been decided upon , but had to substantiate his allegations by referring to details . Since he had not done so , ORG had acted correctly in dismissing his request for transfer of jurisdiction . With regard to the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing , ORG found that the present case only concerned questions of law which , in line with the ORG \u2019s case - law , did not necessitate the holding of a hearing and therefore dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL .

That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG , seeking an additional allowance for the period from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request of DATE to transfer jurisdiction to the superior authority on the ground of ORG failure to decide ; being competent to decide the matter itself , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request by a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having been granted legal aid , the applicant filed a complaint with ORG against this decision and asked the court to hold a public hearing . He argued that the authority had incorrectly applied the law and had not properly reasoned its decision , and that the facts of the case needed to be supplemented , since the calculation of his resources had taken into account alimony payments for his son PERSON from his former wife which he had not actually received . This point therefore needed to be further developed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint without having held a hearing . ORG found that the authority had properly reasoned its decision and had applied correctly the relevant provisions of ORG . With regard to the applicant \u2019s argument that the authority should not have taken account of alimony payments from his former wife for his son PERSON , ORG found that , even if it accepted the applicant \u2019s position , namely that he had not received payments to which he had been entitled and that they should not therefore be taken into account when assessing his income , that income was still above the statutory limit ( ORG ) , so that he was not entitled to an additional allowance . Lastly , referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG found that in the present case it had only to deal with questions of law which could adequately be resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties\u2019 written observations , and therefore dismissed the request for a hearing .", "CARDINAL .
