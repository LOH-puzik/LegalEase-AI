GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s father , then a NORP citizen , owned an estate of QUANTITY in ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c ORG estate \u201d ) , on the territory of the former GPE ( GPE ) . The applicant \u2019s father emigrated to GPE ( GPE ) in DATE and obtained GPE citizenship in DATE . The ORG estate was initially leased to ORG in GPE ( GPE f\u00fcr Land- PERSON in der sowietischen Besatzungszone ) , which was subsequently appointed as a ORG . In DATE a legal - entity certificate ( PERSON ) was issued , declaring the ORG estate to be the property of the GPE ( ORG ) . When his father died in DATE , the applicant inherited the ORG estate as well as the entitlement to claim any compensation that might be paid by a government in respect of the estate . The applicant subsequently declared before ORG in GPE that he wished to renounce his hereditary rights in favour of his sister , a NORP citizen . In DATE the applicant withdrew the renunciation with his sister \u2019s consent .", "In DATE the GPE went into bilateral negotiations with GPE over unresolved financial and property issues . In DATE the NORP government declared the ORG estate as property requiring compensation by the GPE .", "DATE the GPE concluded several \u201c Lump Sum \u201d Agreements ( Globalentsch\u00e4digungsabkommen ) with ORG . The GPE thus concluded with the NORP government , on DATE , an Agreement under which the GPE was to pay the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) on the basis of unresolved property and financial issues . The Agreement entered into force on DATE . After NORP reunification , GPE ( FRG ) succeeded to that treaty pursuant to LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) in conjunction with the proclamation of DATE on the expiration of international agreements between the GPE and GPE ( GPE \u00fcber das GPE v\u00f6lkerrechtlicher GPE ORG ) .", "During the negotiating of the relevant Lump Sum Agreement , the GPE disagreed on whether CARDINAL particular estates , among them the ORG estate , should fall within the scope of the ORG . The GPE delegation was of the opinion that , because of its size , the ORG estate had to be regarded as PERSON ( land which comprised CARDINAL hectares and which was situated in LOC of GPE after the Second World War ) , and , being covered by the land reform ( PERSON ) , would not give rise to compensation . The GPE further argued that the estate had become its property ( ORG ) . All claims that the CARDINAL delegations did agree upon had been added to a list prepared by the NORP delegation which was distributed upon the conclusion of the Agreement . Because of the above - mentioned dispute , the ORG estate had not been included on that list .", "Article CARDINAL of the Lump Sum Agreement provided that all unresolved property and financial issues between the parties should be settled exhaustively and with final effect upon entry into force of the Agreement . The desire to settle these issues comprehensively had also been expressed by GPE in the LAW .", "Upon her application , the applicant \u2019s sister received , from the lump sum , an amount of MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of the ORG estate .", "In DATE the ORG was registered as the owner of the ORG estate in the land register . The applicant subsequently instituted proceedings for the return of the property . On DATE the GPE an der Oder Regional Court ordered the ORG to return the ORG estate and to approve the rectification of the land register . The court found that the applicant \u2019s claim had not been extinguished by the NORP government \u2019s payment of MONEY , under LAW , to his sister . The court held that LAW only concerned claims of NORP citizens with regard to property situated in the GPE , whereas the applicant held GPE citizenship .", "On appeal by the defendant , ORG , on DATE , quashed the GPE an der Oder ORG judgment of DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . ORG noted that the GPE an der ORG had not been provided with the relevant and decisive facts regarding LAW . Even though his father \u2019s property had not been formally expropriated by the GPE , the applicant \u2019s claim had been extinguished by the entry into force of LAW which also comprised the ORG estate , despite the fact that the latter had been the subject of debate between the CARDINAL parties to the treaty . In return for the payment of the lump sum by the GPE , the NORP government had waived any claims of its citizens regarding property situated in the GPE .", "Applying Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW on LAW of DATE ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , ORG found that the LAW also comprised the ORG estate . Even though ORG noted that this conclusion could not be derived directly from the wording of the LAW , the interpretation of LAW and CARDINAL in conjunction with the Preamble showed that GPE had opted for a final and exhaustive solution to all property issues . ORG considered the materials from the negotiations and found that the NORP government had not been content with the original amount of compensation proposed by the GPE delegation . The NORP delegation had insisted that compensation was also to be paid in respect of the CARDINAL estates which were the subject of debate , in order to avoid any liability for damages in relation to the individuals who claimed to be the owners of these estates . The GPE had thus raised the lump sum by a fixed amount ( a so - called GPE ) , which would enable GPE to pay compensation to each of the individuals who claimed to be the owners of the disputed estates once the claimants from the list distributed upon the conclusion of the Agreement had been satisfied . In raising the amount of the lump sum by the GPE , the GPE did not have to give up its legal view on those estates and avoided recognition of corresponding claims . ORG held that the fact that the ORG estate had not been included in the list of claims did not prove that it was not covered at all by the ORG , but rather that compensation had been paid from the GPE .", "ORG also considered a statement on the matter by ORG ( which the applicant had submitted ) but found that , even though ORG had suggested a different assessment of the LAW , it was based on the same facts and consequently did not lead to a different interpretation in the present case . ORG noted that , on the contrary , the statement had been submitted together with a report of ORG in charge of distributing the lump sum to the legitimate claimants . In that report , ORG explained that it had informed the claimants in respect of the CARDINAL estates at issue , among them the applicant \u2019s sister , that their claims could be satisfied by the GPE . The claimants had not objected to this procedure . Moreover , ORG regarded the fact that the applicant \u2019s sister had accepted and received an amount from the lump sum as a further indication that the ORG estate had been covered by the ORG . Taking into account the relatively high amount of the lump sum , a proper reading of LAW and CARDINAL showed that the ORG was not only binding under public international law upon the CARDINAL GPE parties , but that it had also settled , with final effect , private claims of NORP citizens against the GPE . The distribution of the lump sum to the claimants would have been incomprehensible if they had retained their private claims against the GPE .", "The question of the validity of the applicant \u2019s renunciation of his hereditary rights in DATE , in favour of his NORP sister , was not decisive in the view of ORG . Because of the then existing political situation , the applicant , as a GPE citizen , could not have expected the conclusion of a similar lump sum agreement between the GPE and the GPE . The renunciation had represented the applicant \u2019s only option if his family were to receive some compensation in respect of the ORG estate through the NORP government . The fact that he had only withdrawn the renunciation in DATE , after the historical context had changed , proved that the applicant had originally accepted that the payment from the lump sum to his sister settled all claims in respect of the ORG estate with final effect . Irrespective of his GPE citizenship , the Agreement was therefore also binding on him . ORG further found that it did not matter whether or not the LAW had been incorporated into the domestic law of the GPE in accordance with the applicable provisions .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on DATE . The applicant subsequently brought proceedings for restitution and submitted material that he had previously submitted only to ORG . ORG dismissed his application on DATE . The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It did not rule on whether the applicant had exhausted all available remedies before the ordinary courts in view of the possibility of lodging an appeal on points of law against the CARDINAL DATE judgment of ORG . ORG found that ORG interpretation of LAW , which after reunification had also become binding on the ORG , had not violated any of the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . It stated that , in principle , it was for the ordinary courts to apply and interpret international treaties , subject to review by ORG which would apply the same standards as for the review of the application of domestic law by the ordinary courts . It found that the right of property , as enshrined in LAW , was not applicable on the territory of the former GPE . Hence it reviewed the judgments of ORG from the angle of the prohibition of discrimination ( PERSON ) under LAW in conjunction with the principle of the rule of law ( LAW of LAW ) . ORG found that there would have been a violation of LAW of LAW only if the interpretation of the ordinary courts had been manifestly erroneous . This had not been the case . ORG view that the applicant \u2019s property claim had been extinguished upon the entry into force of the Agreement had been based on the principle of diplomatic protection whereby , through the person of its nationals , a ORG can assert its own right to ensure respect for the rules of international law . Therefore , GPE \u2019s waiver of the property claims in return for receiving the lump sum was valid under international law for the applicant as well as the claimants , irrespective of whether or not GPE had been entitled to make the waiver under domestic law . Moreover , ORG interpretation of LAW and its application of LAW seq . of LAW could not be regarded as arbitrary . Referring to a judgment of ORG ( GPE cases , Preliminary Objections , ICJ Reports DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG stated that the object and purpose of an international treaty could take priority over its wording . In so far as the applicant complained about a breach of LAW ( a ) of LAW , because the non - inclusion of the ORG estate in the list of claims had not been regarded as decisive by the domestic courts , ORG held that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that the list had become an integral part of the LAW . It found that ORG had sufficiently considered the list when dealing with the purpose of the LAW and the course of its negotiation . ORG reasoning on the applicability of the LAW to the applicant \u2019s case as well as its analysis of the negotiations leading to the LAW , in particular the fact that the GPE did not recognise the applicant \u2019s sister \u2019s claim while GPE , at the same time , had to insist on the claim in order to avoid its own liability , was regarded as being in accordance with LAW ) .", "Pursuant to its LAW , the Lump Sum Agreement covers property and financial claims of GPE as well as of NORP citizens and legal persons with regard to property which was under GPE administration , provided that they were so entitled both on DATE and on the date of the signing of the Agreement . Article CARDINAL provides for the payment of ORG CARDINAL by the GPE to GPE as compensation for the property and financial claims covered by LAW .", "Under LAW all unresolved property and financial issues between the parties were to be settled exhaustively and with final effect on the entry into force of the LAW . In the LAW to the LAW , GPE expressed the desire for a comprehensive settlement of these issues .", "\u201c CARDINAL . A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose .", "CARDINAL . The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise , in addition to the text , including its preamble and annexes : ( a ) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty ; ( b ) any instrument which was made by CARDINAL or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty .", "CARDINAL .
