The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor charged the applicant and the managing director of company X before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) with CARDINAL counts of aggravated tax fraud and CARDINAL counts of tax fraud , as they had allegedly produced false invoices to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninverovirasto , l\u00e4nsskatteverket ) . They were also charged with an accounting offence ( count CARDINAL ) , as they had allegedly entered false data in the accounts of X. The prosecutor claimed that the applicant was responsible for the offences together with the managing director as , even though he did not have an official status in the management of the company , he had in fact participated in its management .", "In the indictment dated DATE , count CARDINAL , for example , read as follows :", "On DATE [ the managing director ] and [ the applicant ] together , [ the former ] as the managing director of [ company X ] and chairman of the board of directors and [ the latter ] as a person who was de facto responsible for the management of the company , submitted the company 's application for a NORP refund in the amount of FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] as regards DATE to ORG of GPE . The application stated that [ company Y ] had sold electrical relays to [ company X ] for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] and the latter company had sold the said products further to an NORP company for ORG CARDINAL [ EUR CARDINAL ] . The invoice relating to the sales transaction between [ company X ] and [ company Y ] was fabricated . By submitting such false information which affected the amount of taxes to the authorities for the purposes of taxation , [ the managing director ] and [ the applicant ] have attempted to evade taxes .", "Applicable law : LAW , section CARDINAL of the Penal Code \u201d", "As a further example , count CARDINAL , which concerned the co - defendant H.A. , read as follows :", "By preparing the invoice in the amount of FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL referred to in count CARDINAL , and by handing it over to [ the managing director ] and [ the applicant ] to be attached to the application for a tax refund , [ H.A. ] , on DATE , intentionally furthered the criminal act committed by [ the managing director ] and [ the applicant ] .", "Applicable law : LAW , CARDINAL and LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty , arguing that he did not have such a status in company X and therefore could not be held responsible for the alleged offences . Furthermore , he argued that he had not been involved in compiling the documents and that the transactions concerned had not been forged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the business transactions referred to in the relevant invoices were not genuine , that the invoices were false and that the applicant had , together with the managing director , produced false information to ORG and entered false data in the accounts of ORG referred to the evidence given by the co - accused and the witnesses , finding it proved , inter alia , that the applicant had actually acted in the company in such a position that he was to be held responsible for the offences together with the managing director . Thus , ORG convicted them both as charged and sentenced them to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment . The co - defendant , PERSON , was also convicted as charged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) against his conviction . He maintained that since he had not had any legal or de facto status in X , he had not produced any documents to ORG and he had not entered false data in GPE 's accounts . Furthermore , the invoices had not been fabricated . He also claimed that the witness evidence was contradictory and that ORG assessment of it was erroneous . At the end of his writ of appeal , he stated :", "\u201c ... [ C]onsidering that the conduct of [ the applicant ] , on the whole , can not be considered aggravated , he could not be found guilty of more than aiding and abetting a tax fraud if he were , against all reason , to be found guilty of any offence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor did not submit any written response to the applicant 's appeal . In its response to the applicant 's appeal ORG did not refer to a reclassification of the offences as aiding and abetting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing at which the parties and the witnesses were heard . It appears that there was no discussion as to whether the applicant 's alleged conduct could be classified as aiding and abetting the above offences .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of aiding and abetting an aggravated tax fraud and CARDINAL counts of aiding and abetting a tax fraud and an accounting offence and sentenced him to a term of DATE suspended imprisonment . ORG reasoned inter alia :", "During the pre - trial investigation [ the managing director ] stated that [ the applicant ] had given instructions to [ H.A. ] as to the details to be included in the documents that were attached to the applications for a tax refund ... and had also otherwise taken care of matters and the business transactions of [ company X ] .", "[ H.A. ] stated during the pre - trial investigation that he had prepared documents to be attached to applications for a tax refund ... in accordance with [ the applicant 's ] and [ the managing director 's ] instructions . According to [ H.A. ] , [ the applicant ] was in practice responsible for the operation of [ company X ] .", "Witness [ V.M. ] stated in ORG that he had dealt with the invoice ... together with [ the managing director ] and [ the applicant ] .", "In the light of the statements given by [ the managing director ] and [ H.A. ] during the pre - trial investigation , and of the witness statement of [ V.M. ] , which supports those statements , it has been established that [ the applicant ] participated in the planning of the offences referred to in the indictment and in the preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences .", "... [ the applicant ] did not have such a position in [ company X ] as would have made it possible for him to commit , as a principal offender , the offences with which he was charged . When participating in the planning of the offences and in the preparation of the documents needed for the commission of the offences , however , he contributed to producing false information to ORG and [ on count CARDINAL ] to entering false data in the accounts . Thus he intentionally furthered the criminal acts of which [ the managing director ] has been found guilty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , arguing that he had been convicted of offences differing from those with which he had been charged . He submitted that the public prosecutor had not even claimed that he had been involved in the planning of the offences and compiling the documents . During the proceedings the applicant had not been informed of the nature and cause of these accusations and was thus not given any opportunity to defend himself against them . Furthermore , the assessment of the evidence was unfair since ORG had found the evidence sufficient even though the oral statements were contradictory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , in force at the relevant time , provided that a person who , during or before the commission of an offence by someone else , intentionally furthers the act through advice , action or exhortation , shall be convicted of aiding and abetting the principal offence . The sentence imposed on the person who aids and abets shall be reduced to CARDINAL of the maximum penalty prescribed for the principal offence .", "CARDINAL . The present case was commenced and therefore also concluded under the then provisions on criminal procedure in LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . The rule according to which an accused might not be convicted of an offence other than the one with which he had been charged was not included in the legislation until the coming into force on DATE of LAW ( laki oikeudenk\u00e4ynnist\u00e4 rikosasioissa , lag om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ng i brottm\u00e5l ; Act no . CARDINAL ) . The rule was however established through case - law and it was codified upon the enactment of the new Act .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW provides that the court may only pass a sentence for an act for which a punishment has been requested . The court is not bound by the heading or the reference to the applicable provision in the indictment . The court is however bound by the conduct described in the indictment . The prosecutor is under an obligation to define the alleged offence and the accused must be provided with an opportunity to defend himself or herself within the limits of the indictment .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the court may e.g. convict an accused of aiding and abetting a tax fraud even if the prosecutor has charged him or her with the principal offence , as long as the conduct described in the indictment is not altered . This is based on the principle of jura novit curia , i.e. on the principle that the court itself is responsible for the legal assessment of the criminal act in question without being bound by the views of the prosecutor or of the accused . This was contested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , of LAW reads in relevant part :", "\u201c Leave to appeal may be granted only if it is important to bring the case before ORG for a decision with regard to the application of the law in other , similar cases or because of the uniformity of legal practice ; if there is a special reason for this because of a procedural or other error that has been made in the case on the basis of which the judgment is to be reversed or annulled ; or if there is another important reason for granting leave to appeal . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-a", "6-3-b"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
