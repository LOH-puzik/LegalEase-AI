Decisions of the ORG not to prosecute have been subject to applications for judicial review in ORG .", "In NORP v. ORG ex parte C ( DATE ) CARDINAL CAR , p. CARDINAL , Lord Justice PERSON held , concerning a decision of the ORG not to prosecute in an alleged case of buggery :", "\u201c From all of those decisions it seems to me that in the context of the present case this court can be persuaded to act if and only if it is demonstrated to us that the Director of Public Prosecutions acting through ORG arrived at the decision not to prosecute :", "( CARDINAL ) because of some unlawful policy ( such as the hypothetical decision in GPE not to prosecute where the value of goods stolen was below \u00a3 CARDINAL ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) NORP because ORG failed to act in accordance with his own settled policy as set out in the code ; or", "( CARDINAL ) because the decision was perverse . It was a decision at which no reasonable prosecutor could have arrived . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. the ORG and Others ex parte PERSON the ORG on DATE quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the ORG \u2013 that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury - required further explanation .", "CARDINAL . R. v. ORG ex parte PERSON and PERSON ( decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) concerned the ORG \u2019s decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner , although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death - there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous . The ORG reviewing the case still concluded that the ORG would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence . The Lord Chief Justice noted :", "\u201c ORG makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review : see , for example , NORP v. Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte C [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON . But , as the decided cases also make clear , the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised . The reasons for this are clear . The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by ORG to the Director as head of an independent , professional prosecuting service , answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest , and to CARDINAL else . It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the ORG , as it was here , and not by the Director personally . In any borderline case the decision may be CARDINAL of acute difficulty , since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried , a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial . If , in a case such as the present , the Director \u2019s provisional decision is not to prosecute , that decision will be subject to review by Senior ORG Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment . The Director and his officials ( and Senior ORG Counsel when consulted ) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match . In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant , if brought , would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before ( in a serious case such as this ) a jury . This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength , by the end of the trial , of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences . It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it . So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law , on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere . At the same time , the standard of review should not be set too high , since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied . \u201d", "As regards whether the ORG had a duty to give reasons , the Lord Chief Justice said :", "\u201c It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute . Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet PERSON conditions set out above , we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of ORG to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute . But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights . It is put at the forefront of the LAW . The power to derogate from it is very limited . The death of a person in the custody of the ORG must always arouse concern , as recognised by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) , ( CARDINAL)(b ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Coroner \u2019s Act DATE , and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the ORG that concern must be profound . The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official , the coroner , in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry ( see ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who , although not named in the verdict , is clearly identified , who is living and whose whereabouts are known , the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow . In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons , we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case : to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given , to vindicate the Director \u2019s decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet ORG expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given . We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of ORG whose constituents have died in such circumstances . We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves . We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision . But the number of cases which meet PERSON conditions is very small ( we were told that since DATE , including deaths in police custody , there have been CARDINAL such cases ) , and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review . In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require . \u201d", "On this basis , the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the ORG in that case were in accordance with the Code for ORG Prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute . It found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute . The decision was quashed and the ORG was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . In the Matter of an Application by PERSON for ORG , ORG in GPE on DATE considered the applicant \u2019s claim that the ORG had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police . It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the ORG under the DATE Order to give reasons and considered that not duty to give reasons could be implied . The fact that the ORG in GPE and GPE had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons , whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim \u2019s families , was a matter for his discretion . It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the PERSON case ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) would the ORG be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice PERSON ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) were infringed . Notwithstanding the findings in the civil case , they were not persuaded that the ORG had acted in such an aberrant , inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted .", "CARDINAL .

In the report on its visit to GPE and GPE from DATE , published on DATE , ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( the ORG ) reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill - treating persons .

In the view of the ORG , the creation of a fully - fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development . Such a body should certainly , like the ORG , have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers . Further , in the interests of bolstering public confidence , it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the ORG for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought .", "In any event , the ORG recommends that the role of the \u2018 chief officer\u2019 within the existing system be reviewed . To take the example of CARDINAL ORG officer to whom certain of the chief officer \u2019s functions have been delegated ( the Director of the FAC [ Criminal Investigations Bureau ] ) , he is currently expected to : seek dispensations from the ORG ; appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work ; determine whether an investigating officer \u2019s report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed ; decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer \u2019s report , and liase with the ORG on this question ; determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges ; in civil cases , negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court . It is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way .", "CARDINAL . ...
