In addition , the first and second applicants complained against police officers who had taken them to the investigating judge on DATE and DATE for ill - treating , beating and insulting the CARDINAL of them on those occasions .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that on DATE the third applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the investigating judge against LAW and several other unidentified police officers . No copy of this complaint has been provided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG issued a report concerning the legality of police actions during the arrest and pre - trial proceedings . According to the report , a special internal control team was formed , which identified all the police officers involved in the action . A total of CARDINAL interviews were conducted , both with the police officers and with family members of some of the arrested persons , apparently including the father of the first applicant as well as the owner of the house in which the seventh applicant had been arrested . None of the CARDINAL latter mentioned any force being used against the first and seventh applicants . The police officers involved denied all unlawful actions . ORG stated that none of the arrested persons had been tortured to her knowledge . The investigating judge stated that they had complained about torture and that their statements to that effect had been noted in the interrogation TIME . Medical reports issued in prison stated that the first , second and sixth applicants had no visible injuries , the fifth applicant had \u201c several scratches and suffusion \u201d and the seventh applicant \u201c redness the size of MONEY \u201d on his left shoulder . The report suggested that the injuries observed in respect of CARDINAL other detainees arrested on the same occasion had been inflicted when these persons had confronted the police officers during the arrest , on which a special official record had been made . On the basis of such findings ORG could not confirm that there were any grounds for establishing the involved ORG responsibility . However , it was decided that all the relevant documents should be submitted to ORG for further consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the main hearing ( glavni pretres ) , the fourth applicant stated that he had been beaten at the police station on his head and body , and his ribs had been broken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted to ORG ( PERSON dr\u017eavni tu\u017eilac ) the name of GPE , a police officer who had been on the same shift as the officer who had allegedly ill - treated him on DATE and who therefore presumably knew the name of that officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants urged ORG ( ORG dr\u017eavno tu\u017eila\u0161tvo ) in GPE to act upon their criminal complaint . The first applicant also submitted the number of the police badge of CARDINAL of the officers who allegedly had boasted in front of another detainee of having personally beaten the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant submitted to ORG the name of one of the officers who had been present during his questioning in the police station . At the same time he urged the ORG to deal with his criminal complaint , to identify all the officers who had been involved in his arrest as well as to establish the treatment meted out to him during police detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant urged ORG to deal with his complaints . He also submitted the names of some of the police and prison officers who had allegedly ill - treated the applicants on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . He reiterated that there had been other officers and special unit members who had ill - treated them , who were still unidentified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prison doctor examined the seventh applicant and noted in a medical report that he had reported pain in his spine going back DATE , which pain had become more acute over DATE , that he was urinating more often , his blood pressure was CARDINAL/CARDINAL , he could not walk on his toes , and that his lungs were fine . A part of the medical report was illegible due to bad handwriting .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant submitted to the ORG a medical report issued by a private hospital in GPE on DATE . During this medical examination the fourth applicant stated , inter alia , that he had been beaten by the police in DATE , but that he had not consulted a doctor about that . The medical report stated , inter alia , that he had an old double fracture of the fourth rib , as well as an old fracture of the right clavicle ( klavikula ) . The doctor had diagnosed high blood pressure and prescribed treatment for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fifth applicant was examined in a private ambulance , and the medical report issued on that occasion stated that he had a chronic post - traumatic stress disorder .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that none of the above criminal complaints or their further supplements has been processed by the authorities to date .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not lodge a compensation claim with regard to the alleged ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a chamber composed of CARDINAL judges , found the first , second , third , sixth and seventh applicants guilty of associating for the purposes of anti - constitutional activities and preparing actions against the constitutional order and security of GPE . In particular , it was established that in the period DATE and DATE the first and second applicants , with CARDINAL other co - accused , had met with some members of the so - called ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) in the wider area of GPE , GPE , GPE and the GPE , and created an association the aim of which was to undermine the constitutional order and security of GPE and create within GPE a territory with special status , inhabited by persons of NORP ethnicity , contrary to the LOC constitutional order . Subsequently , DATE and seventh applicants had become members of this organisation . The fourth and fifth applicants were found guilty of illegal possession of weapons and explosives .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , the second applicant to DATE , the third , sixth and seventh applicants to DATE each , the fourth applicant to DATE and the fifth applicant to DATE . By virtue of the same judgment a large variety of weapons , ammunition , and various other objects , such as military clothes , caps , gloves , binoculars , and flags with the ORG logo , were confiscated from the first and second applicants , as well as a diary belonging to the first applicant . A certain number of weapons and some explosives were confiscated from the fourth and fifth applicants . All the applicants , save for the third one , were ordered to pay court fees ( po osnovu pau\u0161ala ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was based on the following evidence : the statement made by the first applicant to the police , his diary and its translation done by the first applicant at the police station , written confirmation of the search of the first and second ORG flats and other LOC , TIME of the searches , an official report on the weapons found , an official receipt on objects seized from the first and second applicants and relevant photo - documentation , terrain search , including in caves , weapons , ammunition and explosives found there and relevant photo - documentation , TIME of the searches of some of the other co - accuseds\u2019 flats and other LOC , statements of some of the other co - accused , evidence obtained through measures of secret surveillance , including transcripts of a number of telephone calls , reports on border crossings , the statements of CARDINAL police officers who had conducted the searches , a statement of the first applicant \u2019s police - appointed lawyer who was present during the first applicant \u2019s interrogation at the police station , the opinion of expert witnesses and a search warrant issued by ORG investigating judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not take into account other evidence , such as , inter alia : the statements given by the second , third , fourth and fifth applicants at the police station , as these applicants had not been properly advised that they were entitled to use their own language and to have the assistance of an interpreter ; and TIME of the searches of several other co - accuseds\u2019 flats , as the witnesses who had attended the searches were related to those whose flats had been searched ( wife , son , sister - in - law ) .", "CARDINAL . The High Court considered that the first applicant \u2019s rights had not been breached in the pre - trial proceedings ( u pretkrivi\u010dnom postupku ) and that the search of his flat and other LOC had been conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW . In particular , the search warrant had been issued by the investigating judge on DATE at TIME , and the search had been conducted on DATE between CARDINAL and TIME While the search had not been attended by CARDINAL witnesses , this was allowed by a relevant provision of LAW , which provided for a search without witnesses if it was impossible to secure the presence of any at once and there was a danger that the relevant action would be postponed ( postoji opasnost od odlaganja ) . The reasons why the search had been conducted without witnesses had to be noted in the search TIME ( moraju se nazna\u010diti u zapisniku ) . CARDINAL of the police officers who had conducted the search testified that it had been impossible to find CARDINAL witnesses at the time as the search had been conducted TIME . According to him , this was not mentioned in TIME had been made on the spot ( zapisnik o pretresanju sa\u010dinjen na licu mjesta i zbog toga nijesu navedeni razlozi za pretresanje bez prisustva svjedoka ) . However , the search had been attended by the first applicant himself , who had duly signed the TIME and had no objections to them .", "CARDINAL . The High Court further established that the first applicant had been questioned at the police station on DATE at TIME in the presence of a police - appointed lawyer with whom he had consulted before making a statement . The lawyer testified that the first applicant had been questioned in accordance with the law and that he had not noticed any injuries on him . The first applicant had confirmed during the questioning that he had been writing a diary , and that he could translate it as it was written in NORP . The lawyer was present during the translation of the diary as well .", "CARDINAL . The sixth and seventh applicants were convicted on the basis of the first applicant \u2019s statement made at the police station and the contents of his diary , the CARDINAL being compatible . In particular , it was established , on the basis of these CARDINAL pieces of evidence , that the seventh applicant had arrived from the GPE in GPE on DATE , that he had been informed about the plans of the association and had attended a subsequent meeting . In this way , the court concluded , the seventh applicant had manifested his membership of the association and participation in its preparatory work . It was further found , on the basis of the same evidence , that on DATE the sixth and seventh applicants had been informed that the war in the relevant part of GPE should begin on DATE , in which way the sixth applicant had manifested his membership of the association , as well as by accepting an invitation to go to the next meeting taking place in FAC . On DATE several persons , including the sixth and seventh applicants , had met in PERSON and had agreed on how to carry out the planned acts . In particular , the seventh applicant had expressed his support , said he had been to GPE himself to explore the realisation of the plan ( radi izvi\u0111anja mogu\u0107nosti realizacije plana ) , and wondered if their plans would affect GPE \u2019s independence . The meeting was concluded by another co - accused \u2019s statement that the GPE army would enter GPE \u201c around DATE , that is on DATE , and [ that ] they want[ed ] to do their job \u201d . ORG concluded that the first applicant \u2019s defence during the pre - trial proceedings was in logical connection with the contents of his diary . This evidence was found to be further supported by a report on their border crossings , which data entirely coincided with the dates and times of border crossings mentioned in the first applicant \u2019s diary and his statement made at the police station . Lastly , both the statement and the diary were further supported by an official police report of DATE , which confirmed the existence of all the objects and places described in the diary .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the first - instance court did not accept that the criminal offences contained in the indictment had been committed in an organised manner as the indictment did not claim that the motive was profit or power , this being one of the mandatory conditions for a criminal offence to fall within the notion of organised crime .", "CARDINAL . All the applicants appealed against the High Court judgment . The first , second , fifth , sixth and seventh applicants\u2019 appeals , contained in the case - file , included a complaint about the torture and ill - treatment , and a lack of an investigation in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG judgment was upheld by ORG . In particular , it was held that there had been no procedural violations in the first - instance proceedings and that the first - instance judgment was based on legally valid evidence , including the statement made by the first applicant at the police station , TIME of the search conducted in his flat and other LOC , as well as the evidence obtained by that search , including his diary .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was considered to have been interrogated in accordance with all the procedural guarantees , as confirmed by his police- appointed lawyer , who had not noticed any injuries on him . The same lawyer had also been present when the first applicant had translated the diary , and had signed the interrogation TIME afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The search of the first applicant \u2019s flat was held to have been conducted in accordance with the law and , therefore , all the evidence obtained thereby was legally valid , including the diary . In particular , the investigating judge had issued the search warrant DATE before the search . The search had not been witnessed by CARDINAL adults as it was impossible to find any witnesses in TIME . No statement to this effect was included in TIME as they had been drafted on the spot . This conclusion was based on the testimony of CARDINAL of the officers who had conducted the search . As regards the diary , it contained a clear and convincing description of the criminal acts undertaken . The contents of the diary were further supported by the first applicant \u2019s defence in the pre - trial proceedings , and were further compatible with the border crossing reports , the evidence obtained through measures of secret surveillance , transcripts of telephone conversations , and the weapons found on the terrain ( in caves ) .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court had established all the facts , in particular on the basis of the statement the first applicant had made in the pre - trial proceedings and his diary . The first applicant had admittedly changed his statement during the main hearing claiming , in substance , that what he had said during the pre - trial procedure had been extorted by torture . However , this was rebutted by a statement of his police - appointed lawyer , who had been present at the time when the statement had been made . The validity of this evidence was not called into question ( nije dovedena u pitanje ) by any other evidence , but was actually further supported thereby . Membership of an association could be manifested in various ways , and the sixth and seventh applicants , in particular , had manifested it by taking part in the meetings where the activities for achieving the association \u2019s goal were discussed .", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed that the criminal acts of which the accused were convicted had not been committed in an organised manner as the indictment did not allege that their motive was profit or power .", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the applicants on DATE at the earliest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled on the first , second , third and fourth ORG appeal on points of law ( zahtjev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosna\u017ene presude ) . They challenged , inter alia , the conclusion that there had been no time to find CARDINAL adults to witness the search of the first applicant \u2019s flat and the composition of the first - instance court . ORG , in substance , endorsed the reasoning of ORG and ORG . In particular , the composition of the first - instance court was in accordance with the law , as LAW explicitly provided that a CARDINAL - judge bench would try criminal acts of organised crime , and the trial of all the accused was based on an indictment of ORG . The fifth , sixth and seventh applicants did not lodge an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the first , second , third and fourth applicants lodged constitutional appeals with ORG . The third and fourth applicants complained , inter alia , about torture , inhuman and degrading treatment . On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional appeal considering , in particular , that the complaint about torture , inhuman and degrading treatment was unsubstantiated given that the applicants had failed to submit any evidence in that regard . DATE and the seventh applicants would not appear to have lodged a constitutional appeal .", "CARDINAL . The sixth applicant submitted CARDINAL medical reports , issued by a prison doctor on DATE and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . The report issued in DATE is largely illegible . The legible part states that the sixth applicant complained about pain in his right shoulder and problems in moving it ( ote\u017eane pokrete ) . There was a diagnosis of naevus sebaceus , i.e. a mole on a sebaceous gland .", "CARDINAL . The copy of the medical report issued on DATE is partly illegible . The legible parts state that the applicant had pain all over his body with frequent headaches and poor sleep . His blood pressure was DATE , walking on toes and heels was nearly impossible , and it was recommended that an X - ray of the spine be done . CARDINAL medications were prescribed together \u201c with the usual treatment he [ was ] taking \u201d . He was diagnosed with \u201c ORG , lumbago , and suspected kind of ( illegible ) discus \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted the entire medical file of the sixth applicant . While part of the medical reports is illegible , from the legible part transpires the following .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when he was remanded in custody , the sixth applicant was examined by a prison doctor . On that occasion the sixth applicant claimed that he had been beaten and that he had high cholesterol . The doctor noted that there were no visible injuries on the sixth applicant \u2019s body , and that he already had the treatment prescribed for high cholesterol .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was examined CARDINAL times in total : twice in DATE , CARDINAL times in DATE and CARDINAL times in DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the examinations in DATE the applicant complained about pain in his right shoulder and in general in his arms and joints . He was diagnosed with chronic rheumatism and sinusitis , and the necessary treatment was prescribed . Both times his blood pressure was optimal , and his heart , lungs and other organs were free of any illness .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the sixth applicant was examined by a number of specialists including a dermatologist , a psychiatrist , a physiatrist , and a specialist in internal medicine , who all prescribed the necessary treatments . He also had a number of tests done , such as laboratory blood analysis , CARDINAL ultra - sounds of the kidneys and abdomen , ORG , and an X - ray of the upper part of the spine and CARDINAL X - rays of the right shoulder , and his blood pressure was checked on various occasions .", "CARDINAL . The examinations showed that the sixth applicant had slightly increased triglycerides and high cholesterol and that he had been under treatment for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for DATE already ; he had an ongoing ossification in his right shoulder , which was stated to be usual for his age , as well as in his neck ; he also had a cyst in the right kidney , and the mole on the sebaceous gland for which the treatment was surgery but not urgently required . The medical analysis of his liver , spleen , and left kidney were fine .", "CARDINAL . DATE , during the interrogation by the investigating judge , and in the presence of lawyers of their own choice , the first , second and fifth applicants confirmed that their mother tongue was NORP , but that they spoke NORP well and that they did not need an interpreter . It is also clear from the case file that the first applicant is a school teacher of the NORP language in GPE . The other applicants were interrogated with the assistance of an interpreter . The first and second applicants confirmed that they had officially - appointed lawyers in the police station . While the first applicant had consulted his police - appointed lawyer before having made a statement , the second applicant would appear to have spoken with his after having made a statement . After having consulted the lawyers of their own choice at the interrogation before the investigating judge the first , second , third and seventh applicants said they would not answer any questions or present their defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicted CARDINAL police officers for torturing and ill - treating the father of the first and second applicants on the occasion of their arrest . On DATE , after a remittal , the defendants were acquitted , which judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed a constitutional appeal , which had been lodged against these decisions on DATE by the first applicant on behalf of his father , who had passed away in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . In a statement made to his lawyer on DATE the sixth applicant wrote that the medical report issued in DATE contained a recommendation that he should have another dermatological check - up in DATE , which check - up had not taken place , and that , contrary to what was in the report , he had not had any physiotherapy . He also maintained that he could not communicate with the doctor as the doctor could not speak LANGUAGE or NORP . The sixth applicant claimed that his health situation was far from regular and referred to the shoulder pain , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , permanent headache , sleeplessness , dizziness and total exhaustion . He stated that \u201c numerous appeals \u201d made by him personally , his lawyer and ORG personnel , seeking a competent medical examination , had remained unanswered . No details with regard to these appeals have been provided in the case file . There is also no evidence that this statement of the sixth applicant has ever been submitted to anyone except his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The sixth applicant also submitted a letter addressed to the President of ORG , apparently written by a Consular Officer of ORG in GPE on DATE . The letter stated that the sixth applicant , during regular visits of a representative of ORG , consistently complained about his medical problems , in particular about the growth of a mole on his face and a shoulder pain . It further transpires from the letter that the sixth applicant had been visited by a dermatologist on DATE , but that it was impossible to take a sample of the mole as no appropriate equipment was available in the prison . The letter went on to say that the sixth applicant had been prescribed treatment for the shoulder pain , but that he had stopped taking it as it made him nauseous . The submitted copy of the letter bears no logo of ORG , no signature of an authorised person , and no stamp indicating that it has ever been submitted to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
