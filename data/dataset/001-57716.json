On DATE Mr ORG brought a private prosecution for defamation ( \u00fcble GPE , LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against the applicant and the other signatories of the criminal information .

ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON - \" the Regional Court \" ) decided on DATE to order the discontinuance of the proceedings under LAW para . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It found that the publication did not constitute the criminal offence defined in LAW , since the case did not concern the wrongful attribution of a certain ( dishonest ) behaviour , but only value - judgments ( ORG ) on behaviour which , as such , had been correctly described .", "CARDINAL . On appeal by Mr Grabher - Meyer ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , composed of Mr PERSON , as President , and Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , quashed the above decision on CARDINAL DATE . It held that for the average reader the publication must have created the impression that a contemptible attitude ( ver\u00e4chtliche Gesinnung ) was ascribed to Mr ORG . The authors had disregarded the standards of fair journalism by going beyond a comparative and critical analysis of his statements and insinuating motives which he had not himself expressed , in particular by alleging that he had been guided by ORG attitudes . Accordingly , the case was referred back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defamation proceedings against the signatories of the criminal information other than Mr Oberschlick were severed from the main proceedings by ORG and referred for decision to ORG PERSON ) , on the ground that those persons had not been associated with the publication in Forum . On DATE the former proceedings were discontinued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the publication in Forum of information about the defamation proceedings against the applicant ( section CARDINAL of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This decision was confirmed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , during which it heard evidence from Mr ORG and the applicant .", "The latter offered evidence that what he had written was true ( GPE ) , claiming that in this respect it was sufficient to establish that a criminal information had actually been laid in the terms published in Forum . He argued that by reporting his suspicions he had been fulfilling a legal duty and that he was therefore exculpated under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The fact that the legal qualification of Mr Grabher - Meyer \u2019s statements might have been erroneous could not be held against him because he was not a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of defamation ( LAW and sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings or , in default , to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . ORG also made the following orders against the owners ( ORG ) of ORG and ORG ( ORG der Redakteure und ORG ) : the seizure of the relevant issue of Forum , the publication of its judgment ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) , and the award to Mr Grabher - Meyer of compensation of MONEY ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . In addition , they were declared to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that it was bound by the opinion expressed by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Therefore the objective conditions for the offence of defamation were satisfied .", "Mr PERSON also fulfilled the subjective requirements because he had acknowledged that he had intended to draw attention to what , in his opinion , was the National Socialist way of thinking of Mr Grabher - Meyer . Mr PERSON had , however , not established the truth of his allegations nor justified them . In ORG view , it was not sufficient that this politician had made the criticised statements and that a criminal information regarding it had been laid in the terms published in Forum . The statements in question did not necessarily show the intentions PERSON had inferred therefrom . It could also be understood as a proposal to reallocate the notoriously limited resources of ORG in favour of NORP in order to stem the influx of migrant workers . This admittedly revealed a xenophobic way of thinking , but did not yet amount to a ORG attitude or to a criminal offence .", "The fact that the publication involved only a reprint of the criminal information did not exculpate the applicant . Whilst everyone was free to report to the police facts which he considered constituted a criminal offence , it went far beyond the mere reporting of a criminal suspicion to publish the text of the information in a periodical and thus to make it accessible to the general public . There was no justification for doing so . In this respect , the applicant could not invoke a legal duty under LAW , namely to draw the public \u2019s attention to the ( allegedly ) NORP mentality of a high - ranking official of a governing party . That allegation came under the general rule that a person who had made an attack of this kind through the media had to prove that it was true .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON subsequently requested on several occasions to be supplied with a copy of the record of the hearing , but without success . It seems that it was not until after the communication of the written judgment on DATE that the record reached the applicant . On DATE he applied for a rectification of the trial record which , according to him , failed to mention certain statements by Mr ORG which were of importance for assessing the evidence concerning the truth of the applicant \u2019s allegations . He had allegedly stated at the trial , inter alia , that he was opposed to excessive immigration of foreigners ( PERSON ) and that for tactical reasons he approved the \" stop foreigners \" campaign ( \" PERSON \" ) which had been conducted by a right - wing political party and had subsequently been prohibited . He had also allegedly admitted having considered social - policy measures directed against the children of foreign workers in NORP schools .", "On DATE ORG rejected this application , after having consulted the transcriber , on the ground that after DATE the judge had no recollection of the detailed statements . It nevertheless pointed out that although the latter did not appear in the transcriber \u2019s notes , similar statements did .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of the same judges and again presided over by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( GPE ) .", "In relation to a complaint concerning ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph DATE above ) , ORG observed that this decision was final . Furthermore , it did not appear that ORG had failed to determine any requests made during the trial concerning the record . In any event , the statements in question were irrelevant for the judgment on the merits of the matter .", "CARDINAL . ORG then dealt with the substantive issues . In its view , ORG had not been legally bound by ORG \u2019s earlier decision concerning the qualification of the offence . ORG , however , saw no reason to depart from that decision . What was decisive was that Mr Grabher - Meyer was alleged to have had motives which he himself had not expressed . The case therefore did not concern the ( possibly incorrect ) legal qualification of his statements , but allegations putting a stain on his character which objectively could not be inferred from those statements .", "According to ORG , ORG had rightly held that what had to be proved was the truth of the critical inferences as to Mr ORG character made in the article and had rightly found that the applicant had failed to bring this proof . The fact that a short report on the criminal information against this politician would not have been punishable did not justify the conclusion that a full reprint of it was not punishable either . The publication in the form of a criminal information was intended to ensure that the accusation as to his character made therein would have a particularly telling effect on the average reader . Neither the right to report a criminal suspicion ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) nor the exception provided for in LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) justified the publication because it was not appropriate ( mangels Anlassad\u00e4quanz ) : it had been insinuated , without a sufficient basis in the facts , that Mr Grabher - Meyer held ORG attitudes .", "CARDINAL .
