SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON , PERSON and their CARDINAL daughters are nationals of GPE and GPE , and were born in DATE , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE respectively . They are currently in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicants are ethnic NORP from the province of GPE in GPE and GPE . In DATE the first applicant travelled to GPE and applied for asylum . This request was refused and he was deported to GPE in DATE .", "On DATE the first applicant again came to GPE and , on DATE , he submitted an application for asylum and a residence permit to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) . On DATE the second applicant joined her husband in GPE and , DATE , she also joined his application for asylum and a residence permit . Before ORG , they stated that , upon arrival in his home country in DATE , the first applicant had been detained TIME by the border police and had been instructed to report to the police in GPE . He had done so with the result that he had been detained there for DATE and questioned about the activities of NORP in GPE . DATE , the police had showed up at his home and had questioned him and all the members of his family about the activities of NORP in the neighbourhood . Subsequently , the police had on repeated occasions passed by the applicants\u2019 home and questioned the first applicant . In DATE he had been contacted by a lawyer who had informed him that he was suspected of having connections with the ORG ( PERSON DATE ORG ) . Although the police had never accused him of this , the first applicant had decided to return to GPE to avoid more problems . In DATE the police had come to the applicants\u2019 home and had asked the second applicant about her husband \u2019s whereabouts . They had , again , showed up in DATE at which time they had taken the second applicant to the police station and questioned her . She had been released after TIME but the police had threatened to imprison her if her husband did not show up within DATE . For these reasons , the second applicant had travelled illegally to GPE .", "On DATE ORG refused the ORG request for asylum . It considered that the harassment of which they had been the victims in their home country had been of a general character but not of a serious kind , and that they had not shown that they would be of special interest to the national authorities if they were to be returned to GPE . Thus , they could not be granted asylum . Moreover , the applicants had presented no grounds on which they could be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , adding to their claims that , due to the deteriorating situation in GPE , it would be impossible to enforce the deportation order against them .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicants temporary residence permits for DATE , as of the date of the decision , due to the very unstable situation in GPE at that time .", "Upon the expiry of their temporary residence permits , the applicants renewed their request for asylum and residence permits to stay in GPE . On DATE ORG rejected the request and , on DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision in full and ordered the applicants to leave GPE within DATE from the date of the decision .", "To avoid having to return to GPE , the applicants travelled to GPE and applied for asylum there . However , in accordance with LAW , they were sent back to GPE in DATE and , once again , lodged a new application for asylum and residence permits with ORG . They stated that there was nothing left for them to return to in GPE as they would have nowhere to live and unemployment was very high . Moreover , they claimed that since they had not been in GPE since DATE and their CARDINAL children were born in GPE , it would be inhuman to send them back . Furthermore , the second applicant was depressed and anxious , and she received medication for these problems .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicants had only invoked humanitarian grounds and they had not claimed that they would risk persecution in their home country . Thus , ORG found that they were not in need of protection in GPE , and stated that they could not be granted residence permits only because their financial situation would be difficult in GPE . Moreover , it noted that the CARDINAL children were very young and did not have a strong connection to GPE and that the second applicant \u2019s mental health was not so poor that the family could be granted leave to stay based on these grounds .", "The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG , maintaining their earlier claims and adding that the first applicant was in poor mental health , suffering from anxiety and depression , and the second applicant \u2019s poor mental health had deteriorated further . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision and reasoning in full and ordered the applicants to leave GPE within DATE from the date of the decision .", "The applicants remained illegally in GPE and lodged a new application for residence permits with ORG , claiming that since they had been outside of GPE for DATE it would be inhuman to send them back , in particular since their children were born in GPE . Thus , it would not be in the best interests of the children to deport them to a , for them , completely foreign country . Moreover , they alleged that the situation in GPE was unstable and that they were in need of protection in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first observed that it had already considered the applicants claims in its earlier decision and found no reason to change it . Moreover , it stressed that it was the applicants\u2019 own choice to have been away from GPE for DATE since , in spite of several negative decisions from the NORP immigration authorities , they had remained illegally in GPE .", "The applicants lodged yet another new application for residence permits on humanitarian grounds , relying on the second applicant \u2019s deteriorating mental health . She had been diagnosed as suffering from ORG and depression , and she had entertained thoughts of committing suicide .", "On DATE ORG also rejected this application , finding that the second applicant\u2019", "On DATE ORG rejected yet another application lodged by the applicants as they had invoked no new circumstances .", "The applicants submitted CARDINAL medical certificates . The first , dated DATE , had been issued by PERSON , a psychologist , and the second certificate , dated DATE , had been issued by ORG , a chief physician .", "The certificates stated that the second applicant suffered from ORG ( PTSD ) with recurring depressive instances , including suicidal thoughts , due to which she had been admitted to a psychiatric clinic on CARDINAL occasions ( the certificates did not specify the dates ) . Her poor mental health was the consequence of traumatic experiences in her home country and of the long , insecure waiting in GPE . She was very afraid of returning to GPE .", "As concerned the CARDINAL children , it was observed that they only knew life in GPE and had integrated into NORP society . However , they had developed aggressive behaviour , suffered from nightmares and were afraid of sudden noises . According to the certificates , a deportation to GPE , where the children had never been , could cause them to develop identity problems of a serious nature .", "No information was provided as to the first applicant \u2019s state of health .", "On DATE the applicants requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of their deportation to the province of GPE in GPE and GPE .", "On DATE the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL . He further decided to request ORG to submit a recent , independent assessment of the physical and mental health of the second applicant .", "On DATE the Government informed the ORG that , on DATE , ORG , following the ORG \u2019s request , had decided to stay the deportation of the applicants until further notice .", "On DATE the Government provided the ORG with a medical report concerning the second applicant , dated DATE , by PERSON , doctor in psychiatry and psychosomatics and chief physician at the psychiatric clinic of ORG . The report was based on the medical documents available in the case and on a personal examination of the second applicant by the physician . The report stated that the second applicant had suffered from anxiety and sleeplessness already in her home country and that her mental health had deteriorated in DATE when she had been informed that her father and brother had been found in a mass grave in GPE . It had triggered a panic attack and she had been committed to closed psychiatric care DATE , diagnosed as suffering from an adjustment disorder . Following a rejection of CARDINAL of their applications for asylum by ORG , she had had a crisis reaction and again been committed to closed psychiatric care DATE . DATE , DATE , she was again taken into care and treated for depression . Since then she had taken medication to treat her anxiety and sleeplessness and , periodically , anti - depressants . During the personal examination of the second applicant , she had told the physician that she and the children mostly lived with her sister - in - law and her family because the first and second applicants had problems in their relationship . Moreover , she had stated that she only had sporadic contact with the health services and that , from time to time , she would get suicidal thoughts but that she had to live for the sake of her children .", "According to the physician , the second applicant appeared tired and dejected but she showed no signs of being psychotic and had no physical health problems . He considered that she suffered DATE of anxiety , depression and nightmares which emanated from traumatic experiences in her home country , together with the protracted insecurity of her present situation and her complicated relationship with her husband . Her depressive symptoms appeared to have become chronic but she did not show any suicidal tendencies . The physician found that the second applicant \u2019s poor mental health was not so serious that , in itself , it could justify granting her leave to stay in GPE on medical grounds . However , he considered that the family \u2019s situation as a whole , and in particular the children \u2019s vulnerability , had to be taken into account before deciding to deport them to their home country . He concluded that the second applicant \u2019s state of health was not an impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
