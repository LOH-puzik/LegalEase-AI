According to domestic human rights monitors , prison conditions have somewhat improved over DATE . However , these groups reported that prisoners did not receive adequate food or warm clothing and were often denied a bed , sheets , change of clothes , and restroom privileges .

Systematic violations of civil and political rights and the deprivation of NORP citizens ' right to effectively take part in the conduct of public affairs continue to be observed . Human rights protection mechanisms remain extremely weak , and there is no national human rights institution . The judicial system is still subservient to the executive branch and there is no genuine independent legislative branch ...", "Administration of justice and law enforcement , the death penalty , disappearances and summary executions", "CARDINAL . Since his last report , the Special Rapporteur has remained concerned that GPE is the last country in LOC to apply the death penalty . The situation in the country is still characterized by harsh conditions of pretrial detention , the practice of torture and other inhuman treatment , and excessive use of force by the police .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it is alleged that judges virtually never refer to the LAW or international treaties when they hand down rulings and that the decisions of ORG are often ignored . Trials are often held behind closed doors without adequate justification , and representatives of human rights organizations are denied access to courts to monitor hearings . Punishments are often totally disproportionate . The right to appeal is limited as ORG acts in many cases as the court of first instance , leaving no possibility for appeal . Before and after the presidential elections , CARDINAL people were reportedly summarily put on trial without access to a defence lawyer . Concerns were expressed regarding respect for their right to a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PACE Resolution No . DATE reads insofar as relevant as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The situation in GPE has been the focus of close attention by ORG since DATE , when the NORP parliament was granted PERSON status . GPE ' lack of progress in the field of democracy , human rights and the rule of law , however , led to the suspension of this status in DATE , and to the freezing of GPE ' membership application to ORG following year . The ORG continues to look forward to the time when GPE meets the conditions to be a member of ORG and its authorities undertake a firm commitment to live up to the standards of the Organisation and embrace its values .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , important developments have taken place in GPE : DATE , CARDINAL opposition figures considered as political prisoners were released , including former presidential candidate PERSON . As a result , since then , in GPE , there have been no internationally - recognised political prisoners . The ORG welcomes this tangible progress and calls for it to be made irreversible .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also welcomes the registration of the opposition movement For Freedom ! , as well as the possibility for CARDINAL independent media outlets ORG , PERSON and Uzgorak \u2013 to be published in GPE and their inclusion in the state distribution network . However , media freedom is far from being respected in GPE , especially with regard to broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . It also considers as a positive development the setting up of a number of ORG , under the aegis of the Presidential administration and other state bodies , as fora where the authorities can engage in a constructive dialogue with representatives of non - governmental organisations and civil society . The ORG hopes that the outcome of the discussions taking place in the Consultative Councils will lead to inform legislative and policy measures .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the disappearance of CARDINAL political opponents in DATE , the ORG notes with satisfaction that none of the senior officials named in Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) as being strongly suspected of involvement either in the disappearances themselves or in their cover - up still occupies a position of responsibility . But it strongly regrets that the investigations into these crimes have still not been allowed to progress any further , despite the elements provided in the ORG 's report .", "CARDINAL . What adds to the importance of these developments is that they respond to precise demands coming from NORP organisations , and that they have been undertaken in the context of the resumption of political dialogue with the NORP leadership .", "CARDINAL . In effect , following the release of all political prisoners in GPE , in DATE ORG took the decision to resume contacts with the NORP leadership at the highest level and to suspend , even if partially and temporarily , the visa - ban against a number of high - ranking NORP officials , including President PERSON . This suspension was extended for DATE in DATE . The willingness of ORG to normalise relations with GPE was epitomised by the visit of ORG , Mr PERSON , to GPE and his meeting with President PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . GPE is also CARDINAL of the CARDINAL countries that will participate in ORG , a new instrument designed to strengthen political and economic co - operation between ORG and its ORG and NORP neighbours , with a view to enhancing their stability and supporting democratic and market - oriented reforms . The level of GPE ' participation will depend on the overall development of its relations with ORG . In this context , GPE attended the ORG summit in GPE , on DATE . ORG also intends to establish LAW with GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , for its part , has recently intensified its contacts with the NORP authorities : following a visit by a delegation of the ORG 's ORG in DATE , Minister PERSON conducted an official visit to GPE , in DATE , in his capacity as Chair of ORG . DATE , the NORP authorities had finally given their consent to the opening of an infopoint on ORG in GPE , an idea initiated by the ORG itself and developed by the NORP Chairmanship of ORG . The opening ceremony of the NORP took place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in DATE , ORG decided to grant observer status to ORG of ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Despite recent positive developments , however , and the resumption of contacts with NORP organisations , the situation in GPE continues to be a cause for concern .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the parliamentary elections of DATE were a missed opportunity for a decisive change towards democracy , as they failed to meet NORP standards of freedom and fairness . As highlighted by the ORG , serious shortcomings affected all stages of the electoral process , from the availability of pluralist information for voters to the lack of transparency of the vote count . These shortcomings inevitably cast a doubt over the representativeness of the present ORG , where no single opposition candidate managed to gain a seat . It is , however , to be welcomed that , following the final ORG assessment , the NORP authorities agreed to work with the OSCE / ODIHR on the reform of the country 's electoral legal framework and practice , in order to align them with GPE ' PERSON commitments .", "CARDINAL . As regards respect for political freedoms , harassment and intimidation of opposition activists , in particular youth , continue to take place through various means , such as unwarranted searches of private houses , unlawful requisition of equipment , police brutality during demonstrations and forced conscription into the military service despite previous declarations of being unfit for service . In addition , a number of political activists are under house arrests and the criminal record of those political prisoners who were released has not been erased , with the result that they face limitations in the exercise of some rights , including the right to run for elections .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also takes note of the fact that , as of DATE , CARDINAL entrepreneurs , who are currently in detention , as well as other persons who are subjected to limitations of personal liberty , are considered by the NORP opposition as political prisoners or , at least , as victims of an abuse of the criminal justice system for political reasons . The ORG calls for an independent investigation to be conducted into these cases , in order to clarify whether they are political prisoners and , if so , to secure their release .", "CARDINAL . The situation regarding freedom of association also gives rise to concerns : even if the political opposition movement For Freedom ! was finally registered in DATE , other opposition and human rights organisations continue to face obstacles in obtaining registration by ORG , the latest example being the human rights organisation PERSON , and its members risk prosecution for membership in a non - registered organisation , under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG regrets that , despite the inclusion of CARDINAL independent publications in the state distribution network , the other independent media outlets can not benefit from this scheme and can not even be printed in GPE . Absolute governmental control over the printing and the distribution of the press as well as over broadcasting is a flagrant violation of media freedom . Similarly , the ORG expresses concern at the difficulties encountered by foreign journalists in obtaining press accreditation and by foreign media , such as the satellite channel ORG , in obtaining registration by ORG . It takes note , however , of the numerous statements emanating from the NORP leadership on their willingness to ensure that the new media law is not implemented in such a way as to restrict freedom of expression . The ORG wishes that the same could be said for the implementation of the PERSON on counteraction against Extremism , which has recently led to the suspension of the publication of the magazine ORG , later withdrawn following international pressure .", "CARDINAL . It also regrets that capital executions can still be carried out in GPE , despite the reduction of the categories of crimes for which they can be inflicted , a decrease in the number of death sentences handed down in such cases and the fact that no executions have been carried out since DATE according to official statements . The ORG recalls that , in DATE LAW , the death penalty is considered as a transitional measure and that no legal impediment prevents either the President or the ORG from introducing a moratorium on executions . While no public statistics are available , the ORG also takes note of the information provided by the authorities that currently there are no capital sentences whose execution is pending .", "CARDINAL . Considering that , although GPE is far from ORG standards in the field of democracy , the rule of law and human rights , its authorities have recently taken important steps in the right direction , the ORG resolves to encourage the continuation of this process by engaging in a political dialogue with the authorities , while at the same time continuing to support the strengthening of democratic forces and civil society in the country ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . \u201c ORG in DATE \u201d in respect of GPE noted , in particular , disregard for political freedoms , including police violence and arrest of political activists .", "CARDINAL . The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in its DATE Report on Human Rights in LOC noted that the most frequent victims of ill - treatment were participants in peaceful demonstrations who were taken to police stations and placed in pre - trial custody . With respect to the judiciary , the ORG said that \u201c the judicial system remained dependent on the executive power and the courts acted as executors of state ideology ... The political engagement of the judiciary was confirmed in their rulings on politically motivated cases . \u201d", "As to prison conditions , the ORG observed :", "\u201c In many cases , conditions in pre - trial facilities ... were poor enough to amount to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .", "As a rule , the average floor area per inmate in pre - trial facilities and prisons was QUANTITY ( including bed ) , in dirty , poorly ventilated cells without necessary hygiene facilities . It was reported that inmates sometimes had to sleep in turns , for lack of a bed for everyone .
