On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case . It noted that in assessing whether or not traffic could be diverted to other routes , the authority had reckoned on the participation of CARDINAL demonstrators , as per the applicant \u2019s notification , and that it had established that lawful parking and traffic circulation in the neighbourhood would become impossible should the event take place . The court agreed with the police \u2019s decision in that although the right to assembly was a constitutional fundamental right , it was not absolute and must not give rise to a violation of the fundamental rights of others , and could therefore be restricted . The court was satisfied that the decision had been lawful as the police had adequately established the facts , complied with the procedural rules and applied clear assessment criteria , and the assessment of the evidence had been logical ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
