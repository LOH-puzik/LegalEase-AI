In so doing , the court of ORG will base itself on the following facts and circumstances :", "- The present case began in DATE . The applicant was arrested on DATE and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment by ORG on DATE . The [ applicant ] took part in the proceedings . The [ applicant ] appealed against this judgment and the first appeal hearing took place on DATE .", "- The [ applicant ] was released on DATE .", "- It was not possible to hold the hearing on the merits on DATE as planned because the investigating judge had not finished hearing witnesses .", "- On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel transmitted the information that the [ applicant ] had been arrested in GPE on DATE on suspicion of having violated LAW of LAW , to wit , unlawfully importing a large quantity of narcotic substances . The [ applicant ] was to remain in pre - trial detention until DATE . The hearing on the merits could therefore not be held on DATE , DATE and DATE as planned and was moved to CARDINAL and DATE .", "- The [ applicant ] has therefore brought it on himself that he can not now attend the appeal hearing independently ( dat hij niet zelfstandig tegenwoordig kan zijn bij zijn berechting in QUANTITY beroep ) .", "- The [ applicant ] has indicated , following his arrest , that he wishes to attend the appeal hearing .", "- The Advocate General has , on DATE , drafted a request for mutual assistance , in consultation with ORG and GPE ( ORG Noordwest en GPE ) ( ... ) requesting the NORP authorities to transfer the [ applicant ] to the GPE temporarily under LAW .", "- The NORP public prosecutor replied on DATE that the [ applicant ] \u2019s temporary transfer was not possible because GPE had entered a reservation relevant to LAW [ of LAW ] . The request for temporary transfer would have to be made via ORG .", "- The Advocate General has , on DATE , prepared a draft request for mutual legal assistance setting out the request to the NORP authorities to transfer the [ applicant ] to the GPE under LAW [ of LAW ] .", "- On DATE the head of ORG ( afdeling ORG in ORG ) of ORG informed ORG that LAW [ of LAW ] provides only for the possibility to transfer temporarily as witnesses or for purposes of confrontation . Temporary transfer of an accused for trial requires extradition or surrender procedure ( uitleverings- of overleveringsprocedure ) to be followed , in which case there must be a valid GPE title for detention .", "- The Advocate General prepared a draft extradition request on DATE .", "- On DATE the head of ORG informed the Advocate General that it was not possible to request the [ applicant ] \u2019s extradition from GPE because there was no GPE title for his detention . This means that CARDINAL of the documents referred to in LAW ( a ) is missing . The ultimate conclusion is that since neither extradition nor temporary transfer within the meaning of mutual assistance in criminal matters ( kleine rechtshulp ) is possible , there is no possibility to allow the [ applicant ] to attend the hearing in his criminal case on DATE .", "- Counsel and [ applicant ] have had sufficient time to prepare the defence before the hearing on the merits [ planned for ] CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , which hearing was postponed until CARDINAL , DATE and DATE only shortly before [ it was due to begin ] . Counsel has also had the opportunity to discuss the case with the [ applicant ] and prepare for the hearing before those new hearing dates . It does not make any difference that the [ applicant ] was arrested in GPE on DATE . Moreover , in DATE counsel visited the [ applicant ] in GPE to prepare DATE \u2019s hearing , it being worth noting in this connection that it is open to [ counsel ] in consultation with the [ applicant ] himself to make use of [ this possibility ] more frequently , the NORP authorities having imposed no restrictions in this respect .", "- Counsel has been explicitly authorised ( uitdrukkelijk gemachtigd ) to defend the [ applicant ] at the hearing .", "ORG considers , in these circumstances , that in weighing the various interests against each other the general interest , including due process ( het belang van een behoorlijke rechtspleging ) and the interest of bringing the case to a close within a reasonable time must now prevail over the [ applicant ] \u2019s right to take part in the hearing in person . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The hearing was continued on DATE . The applicant \u2019s counsel conducted the defence in the applicant \u2019s absence .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal gave judgment on DATE . It convicted the applicant of complicity in causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death , abduction and transporting and possessing an unspecified quantity of hashish . It sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) . He complained of a violation of his right to attend the hearing in person as a result of ORG refusal to order an adjournment until he could be present . His arguments were the following :", "Firstly , the starting point should be that an accused had the right to attend the hearing in his case in person ; as long as he did not waive that right , he was in principle entitled to an adjournment if he was prevented from so doing . This starting point was not reflected in ORG reasoning .", "Secondly , it did not appear that ORG had considered the seriousness of the charges . Considering the charges in issue , and the sentence imposed on appeal ( which added years to the sentence imposed at first instance ) , ORG decision was misconceived .", "Thirdly , the presence of counsel and the length of the proceedings , relied on by ORG , were irrelevant . The length of proceedings in particular would be imputable to the suspect if an adjournment was requested by the defence .", "Fourthly , ORG had failed to respond to the suggestion made by the defence to await the outcome of the proceedings in GPE , after which the applicant could return of his own accord or the execution of any NORP sentence could be taken care of in the GPE , thus enabling the applicant \u2019s attendance .", "Fifthly , ORG had failed to explain why \u201c due process and the interest of bringing the case to a close within a reasonable time \u201d were given priority over the applicant \u2019s attendance rights on DATE given that those interests had never previously stood in the way of an adjournment of the case .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General ( advocaat - generaal ) to ORG submitted an advisory opinion ( conclusie ) in which he expressed the view that , in the light of Article CARDINAL taken together with LAW ) , ORG had been called upon to decide whether the interest of the examination of the case at the hearing required the hearing to be adjourned . The advisory opinion continues ( footnotes omitted ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ In the light of the principle stated , ORG findings ] do not reflect an incorrect understanding of the law ; nor , in view of the following , is it incomprehensible . ORG has established as fact that [ its own ] Advocate General has made several unsuccessful attempts to have the suspect \u2013 who is detained in GPE DATE transferred to the GPE so that he can exercise his right to attend the hearing in person . This finding implies that ORG has considered the question whether it was possible for the suspect to be placed at its disposal for the purposes of the appeal but has answered it in the negative . Moreover , it does not appear likely that the applicant will return to the GPE shortly after the end of the criminal proceedings in GPE and will be able to appear at a further hearing . Contrary to what is argued by the drafter of the ground of appeal , ORG therefore sufficiently examined the possibilities of mutual legal assistance . The fact that ORG did not react in so many words to counsel \u2019s suggestion that the outcome of the NORP criminal proceedings should be awaited does not change this . After all , in refusing to order an adjournment ORG is not bound to answer every detail of the argument explicitly . [ The sentence reflecting the decision that all parts of the request had been refused ] was sufficient . That also implies the refusal to await the outcome of the NORP criminal proceedings , so that the suspect would be able to attend the hearing in the GPE by his own means or by way of transfer of the execution of the NORP sentence , if any .", "Furthermore , the suspect appeared at the first instance hearings alongside his counsel , in addition to several appeal hearings which he attended together with his counsel . It follows that the suspect had the opportunity to exercise his right to attend hearings and state his version of events to a court , notwithstanding the fact that the merits of the case were not dealt with at the appeal hearings referred to . The summonses for the appeal hearing on DATE at which hearing the suspect did not appear \u2013 were served in accordance with the law . Moreover , the defence could be conducted at this hearing on the applicant \u2019s behalf by the applicant \u2019s counsel , as in fact was the case .", "In addition , ORG adjourned its examination of the case at the appeal hearing of DATE already , at the request of counsel , because of the suspect \u2019s detention in GPE . The examination of the case at the hearing in appeal had been adjourned CARDINAL times already , whereas the appeal proceedings lasted DATE in total . The criminal acts with which the applicant was charged were committed in DATE [ the drugs crimes ] and DATE [ the crimes against the person of E. ] respectively , so that at the time of the appeal hearing of DATE at which hearing the request for an adjournment was made DATE and DATE had already passed . Finally , in the cases of the co - suspects , which were dealt with simultaneously with [ the present case ] but not joined with it , CARDINAL of them , PERSON , did appear at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to the argument made by the drafter of the point of appeal , ORG was under no obligation to consider the seriousness of the charges against the applicant in deciding on the request for an adjournment but it was at liberty to consider the presence of counsel authorised to conduct the defence and the length of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The limpidity of ORG reasoning is not impaired by ORG reliance , in refusing the request for an adjournment , on due process and the interest of bringing the case to a close within a reasonable time , even though these arguments supposedly did not stand in the way of adjournments of earlier appeal hearings . I note in this connection that the adjournments , from DATE , were connected , at least in part , with the need to ensure due process : the hearing of witnesses and the realisation of the suspect \u2019s right to attend the hearing in person . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on summary reasoning .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant returned to the GPE at some time in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served the remainder of the sentence given by ORG . He was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of drugs offences and sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Appeal reduced the prison sentence to DATE . It appears from the judgment that on DATE the applicant had been caught red - handed importing QUANTITY of cannabis .
