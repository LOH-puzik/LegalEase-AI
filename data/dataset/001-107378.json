NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant fled his native GPE in DATE and applied for asylum in the GPE . Under the provisions of LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , he was issued a provisional residence permit ( voorwaardelijke vergunning tot verblijf ) on CARDINAL DATE which was valid from DATE until DATE . Its validity was later prolonged until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to the terms and the transitory arrangements under LAW , which entered into force on DATE and replaced LAW DATE , the applicant \u2019s provisional residence permit was automatically transformed into a temporary residence permit for asylum purposes ( verblijfsvergunning asiel voor bepaalde tijd ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a request for a residence permit for asylum purposes for an indefinite period ( verblijfsvergunning asiel voor onbepaalde tijd ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) , rejected the applicant \u2019s request by holding LAW DATE LAW relating to ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) against him . The Minister based this decision on the applicant \u2019s statements about his career as an officer in the ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON Dowlati ( \u201c ORG / WAD \u201d ) \u2013 the intelligence service during the former communist regime in GPE \u2013 and the general official country assessment report ( algemeen ambtsbericht ) on GPE , drawn up on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE . In its judgment of DATE , that ORG , sitting in GPE , accepted the appeal and quashed the impugned decision . Referring to a ruling given on DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG held that the Minister should also have examined whether LAW constituted a sustained obstacle to the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE and , the Minister \u2019s examination had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ; the successor to the Minister for Immigration and Integration ) took a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s request , retroactively withdrawing the applicant \u2019s residence title as from DATE and holding , inter alia , that while LAW opposed the applicant \u2019s return to GPE , it had not appeared that LAW constituted a sustained obstacle for his removal from the GPE as the applicant had not demonstrated that a departure to a country other than GPE , such as for instance GPE where he had stayed for DATE in DATE , was impossible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was rejected on CARDINAL DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in Roermond . It noted at the outset that , since no appeal had been filed against the judgment of DATE , the decision to hold LAW had obtained the force of res iudicata . It further noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant \u2013 if expelled to GPE \u2013 would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by LAW and that , for that reason and for the time being , he was not going to be expelled to GPE . It agreed with the Minister that the applicant had not demonstrated that it would be impossible for him to go to GPE and found that the applicant did not find himself in a situation in which LAW opposed his expulsion from the GPE in a sustained manner and , furthermore ,", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant invoked his right to respect for his family life within the meaning of LAW with his spouse and with his brother and the latter \u2019s spouse and children , ORG held that DATE given the strict separation between asylum - based and regular residence permits DATE asylum proceedings offered no scope for these arguments to be entertained by the court . ORG further rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments based on his right to respect for his private life guaranteed by LAW in that , during his DATE stay in the GPE in the course of which he had worked for DATE , he had established social ties with colleagues and neighbours . On this point , ORG held that the circumstances relied on by the applicant were outweighed by the Minister \u2019s general interest considerations . It noted that the duration of the applicant \u2019s ( legal ) stay in the GPE was considerably shorter than the duration of the aliens in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALX ) and Sisojeva and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) and held that the Minister could attach great weight to the fact that the applicant should be regarded as responsible for very serious offences .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . In its ruling of DATE , ORG upheld the impugned judgment , finding that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling ( kan niet tot vernietiging PERSON aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) and that , having regard to article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise questions requiring determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . No further appeal lay against this decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
