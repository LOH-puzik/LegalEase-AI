The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , at the time a married couple , bought a plot of land of QUANTITY in the village of GPE , on LOC coast . The seller , Mr O. , had acquired the property in DATE from the agricultural co - operative that existed at the time , in exchange for another plot of land of his .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 possession of the land remained undisturbed until DATE , when other persons took possession of it . The applicants discovered then that the land had been collectivised after DATE and that in DATE the heirs of the pre - collectivisation owner , PERSON , had instituted restitution proceedings under the relevant provisions of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Their restitution request had been allowed in a court judgment of DATE and in a decision issued by the competent administrative body \u2012 the local agricultural land commission \u2012 on DATE .

It relied on the provision of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , holding on its basis that of the CARDINAL rival claims to the same land the law gave priority to the CARDINAL based on restitution .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeal , on DATE ORG reversed that decision and allowed the applicants\u2019 action . It considered in particular that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG was not applicable to the case as it had only been introduced in DATE , that is to say after the restitution decision in favour of PERSON heirs and after the applicants had bought the plot of land .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal , in a final judgment of DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 rei vindicatio claim . It took the view that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , introduced in DATE , had to be considered to be applicable with effect from the ORG \u2019s entry into force in DATE because it was merely clarifying its general restitution provisions . As to the exception contained in section CARDINAL ) of the Regulations for the ORG \u2019s implementation , also introduced in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG considered it inapplicable to the case ; in its view , section CARDINAL ) only precluded the restitution of properties which had been the subject of transactions prior to the ORG \u2019s entry into force in DATE , whereas the applicants had bought their plot in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
