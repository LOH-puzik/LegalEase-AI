On DATE ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE sent a preliminary consideration ( \u00f6verv\u00e4gande ) to the applicant informing him that it was considering disallowing the deduction he had made for the interest he had paid on debts in the amount of MONEY ( SEK ) , as well as his declared capital gains for the sale of stocks in the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , that he had made in his tax return for DATE . Further , it was considering imposing tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( MONEY [ ORG ] ) , i.e. PERCENT of the increased tax liability on the sum of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The preliminary consideration was based on an investigation of a company which had done business with a substantial number of private persons . As concerned the applicant , it appeared that he had borrowed SEK CARDINAL from the company and commissioned it to buy stocks for the same amount on his behalf . The applicant then sold the stocks back to the company at a fixed date , upon which he had made a capital gain . At the same time , he repaid the loan together with interest to the company . As the capital gain corresponded to the interest , they were set off against each other . In ORG view , the transactions had in reality never taken place and the applicant had simply received CARDINAL statements of account and a promissory note in order to use them to obtain tax advantages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was requested to submit any comments he might have to ORG by DATE , which he did . He claimed that the transactions had taken place and that his tax return should be approved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to follow its preliminary consideration . With regard to the imposition of tax surcharges , it found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information about the purported transactions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision , disputing ORG findings . He maintained that there were no grounds for disallowing the deductions or imposing tax surcharges on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made its obligatory re - assessment of its decision of DATE but upheld it . It then forwarded the appeal to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal after having held an oral hearing . It agreed with ORG conclusion that no transactions had in reality taken place between the applicant and the company , for which reason they could not be included in his tax return . Moreover , the court found that the applicant had submitted incorrect information to ORG and that there were no grounds on which to remit the tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , maintaining his claims . On DATE he made further submissions to the court , stating inter alia that his rights under LAW had been violated as he had not had access to the same material as ORG , and since the tax surcharges had been incorrectly imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full , without giving any new reasons of its own .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , relying on the same grounds as before the lower courts and expanding them further .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sued ORG , through the Chancellor of ORG , before ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . He sought SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in damages on the grounds that ORG and the administrative courts had not afforded him a fair procedure , having withheld certain information from him , and that the proceedings had been of excessive length . He invoked national legislation as well as the LAW and its case - law .", "CARDINAL . The State contested the suit , claiming that it had not caused the applicant any injury , either by fault or neglect , for which he could claim damages .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . As concerned the length of the proceedings , the court considered that the administrative courts\u2019 examination of his tax case had not taken so long as to incur the ORG \u2019s liability for damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) , maintaining his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full .
