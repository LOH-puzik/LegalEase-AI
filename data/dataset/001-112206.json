The first applicant , PERSON , is the mother of CARDINAL minor children , the second and third applicants , PERSON and GPE", "CARDINAL . Following reports to ORG ( which forms part of ORG and has as its aim the enhancement of the lives of people in need , through the provision and availability of professional care and support ) , an investigation by specialised social workers was undertaken in respect of the family . Meetings took place between the parents , social workers , professionals ( doctors , police and lawyers ) and the directors of the relevant agency . Finally , on the recommendation of ORG , on DATE the Social Policy Minister issued a care order under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) placing the CARDINAL minors , GPE and GPE , in an institution run by nuns . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , after having heard the first applicant \u2019s objections , ORG confirmed the care order . It further solicited the social services to complete the fostering assessment of the maternal grandparents to enable the children to reside with them if it was found to be in their best interest .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , criminal proceedings were brought against the first applicant and her partner , X. , who is the alleged father of the minor children .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG as a court of criminal judicature found X. guilty of cruelty towards the CARDINAL children and failure to protect them , causing them slight injuries , and of excessive correction of the CARDINAL minors ( DATE ) . X. was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . His appeal having been withdrawn , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . By the same judgment , PERSON was found guilty of cruelty towards the CARDINAL children and failure to protect them , and excessive correction of the CARDINAL minors ( DATE ) . She was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE . PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . Having assessed the evidence the court found that PERSON had been present when X. repeatedly beat the children , aged DATE , and , possibly because of his threats , had not had the courage to report him or ask the relevant authorities for assistance , with the result that the children were severely bruised . They also suffered from bald patches and lice - infested hair , symptoms of serious neglect on the part of the mother . She had also repeatedly behaved roughly towards her children . She was therefore guilty of the first charge by acts of commission and omission ( in so far as she had not taken the requisite steps to protect her children ) . The court also confirmed her guilt regarding the charge of excessive correction of the CARDINAL minors . Considering it appropriate , in the event that the children were ever returned to her , the court confirmed the sentence handed down by the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law the provisions of LAW were applicable to a conviction for an offence under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . At the start of the criminal proceedings the relationship between GPE and X. ended . While the care order was in place , PERSON was given supervised contact with her children for TIME a week and eventually TIME a week . Later , in DATE , the children spent DATE and public holidays with her .", "CARDINAL . Attempts to persuade the Minister to revoke the care order failed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , in her own name and on behalf of her children , instituted constitutional redress proceedings . She relied on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , particularly on the basis that there existed no remedy under the LAW providing for re - examination by an independent and impartial tribunal of an issued care order , since such a revision depended solely on the discretion of the Minister who had issued the order . The circumstances having changed , she requested the court to revoke the order and grant any other necessary remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( FAC ) rejected a plea of non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies by the ORG ( namely , in reference to that provided in ORG CARDINAL ) since no proof had been submitted in corroboration at that early stage of the proceedings . It therefore decided to examine the case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) held that PERSON could only act in her own name , and did not have a right to act on behalf of her minor children . Indeed , according to LAW , when a care order was issued the relevant parent was deprived of the right to represent his or her children or to sue on their behalf , and care and custody of the children concerned were entrusted to the Minister . It noted that in the proceedings nobody had requested the court to provide the children with a representative ad litem ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of PERSON , the court found a violation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention in that the law did not provide access to court to challenge the care order , but no violation of Article CARDINAL . It observed that the care order issued was a permanent one ( valid until the minors reached DATE ) . The Act provided for an objection to the care order to be lodged within DATE of the order being issued , and that such an objection would be dealt with by ORG . However , the applicant complained that it was not possible for an individual to request a revision of the order subsequently . The court considered that termination of custody fell under the concept of civil rights , particularly because a care order did not imply the end of natural ties between children and their parents . Consequently , a parent \u2019s right of access to court and to the possibility to regain custody of his or her children was a living right . The court considered that the remedy relied on by the ORG , namely judicial review proceedings , would not be appropriate in the circumstances . Judicial review was concerned with assessing the decision - making process , but not the merits of a decision itself , as the court would not act as a court of appeal from the body involved . In the event that an administrative decision was quashed the court could only remit the case to the authority for reconsideration , at most requesting the authority to bear in mind the reasons for the quashing . Moreover , ORG ( LAW ) was simply an advisory board subject to the authority and discretion of the Minister . Therefore , it could not be considered an impartial and independent tribunal . It followed , from an analysis of LANGUAGE law , that there was no remedy granting access to court for the applicant or anyone in her position seeking re - examination of the merits of a care order . This constituted a violation of LAW , which absorbed LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW it held that the care order had been in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim . While bearing in mind that PERSON had made improvements and was changing her life , it considered that the grounds on which the care order was based had not disappeared and in view of the frequent reviews of the situation by the social services it could not be said that her rights under LAW had been breached .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the claim for the revocation of the care order but , in accordance with LAW , it ordered that a copy of the judgment be sent to the Speaker of ORG for consideration by parliament in respect of a possible amendment to the law , as the only remedy that could provide redress to the applicant was a legislative change providing for access to court in such a situation .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG observed that on DATE when the care order was issued PERSON had lost care and custody of her children in favour of the Minister , and therefore it confirmed that in the absence of an appointment by the court , PERSON could not represent her children in the proceedings . Moreover , following her conviction , PERSON had lost all authority and rights over her children in view of the automatic application of LAW and therefore , in the absence of any request to the court for representation of the minors , she could not act on their behalf according to LANGUAGE law ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , notwithstanding any different procedure which might be applicable before ORG . In this light , in relation to the merits of the complaints under LAW , the court considered that in the present case , PERSON having lost all her parental rights as a result of her conviction , could not exercise any right in respect of which she was deprived of access to court . It followed therefore that no violation of DATE could ensue . The situation would have been different had the applicant been affected only by the care order ( which solely took away the rights relating to care and custody ) and not the subsequent conviction . Neither could it be said that any rights under LAW came into play , since the applicant had regular contact with her children . However , the first - instance judgment in relation to whether the LAW contravened the applicant \u2019s LAW had become final , as no appeal had been lodged in this connection .", "CARDINAL .
