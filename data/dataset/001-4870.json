GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is a lawyer by profession . He also brings the application on behalf of his daughter , born in wedlock in DATE .", "A.", "In DATE the applicant and his wife PERSON separated . The ensuing divorce proceedings before the GPE am ORG ( ORG ) , sitting in family matters ( PERSON ) , concerned inter alia the question of custody over the spouses\u2019 children PERSON and PERSON , born in wedlock in DATE , and involved the taking of psychological expert evidence . ORG was granted on DATE . Moreover , upon the spouses\u2019 common proposal , custody of the daughter PERSON was awarded to the applicant , and custody of PERSON was awarded to PERSON", "Subsequently , PERSON remarried . The applicant married again in DATE and his son PERSON was born in DATE .", "In DATE PERSON applied to ORG to be awarded custody of PERSON . She submitted that PERSON did no longer wish to live with the applicant . The applicant contested these submissions . It appears that he also requested that he be awarded custody of PERSON ; these proceedings were conducted separately .", "On DATE ORG , having twice heard PERSON , issued an interim injunction provisionally transferring the right to determine PERSON \u2019s place of residence ( GPE ) to PERSON has been living with PERSON since . On DATE the applicant withdrew his appeal following a hearing before ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) which had also questioned the child .", "On DATE the ORG amended the decision of DATE and awarded the custody of PERSON to PERSON", "ORG , referring to section CARDINAL of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) and the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , observed that decisions on custody should only be changed , if there were valid reasons seriously affecting the child . Having heard the parents and in particular PERSON , the court found that the child did no longer wish to live with the applicant , but with PERSON It considered that PERSON \u2019s wish had to be respected . She had unequivocally expressed her wish in court on DATE and DATE . As stated in the opinion submitted by the competent youth office , she had made the same statement when heard at the youth office . In the court \u2019s view , the argument that this wish had been influenced by third persons was not valid . In particular , she had decided to live with her mother although she could expect the difficulties of being involved in court proceedings . Her statements in court had appeared true and genuine , and she had upheld her position over a lengthy period during which she had regularly access to the applicant , including holidays .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "ORG , having heard the applicant and PERSON , PERSON and an employee of the competent youth office , found that the custody decision had to be changed in the interest of the child . In this respect , it noted that , upon divorce , custody of PERSON had been awarded to the applicant in accordance with the spouses\u2019 common proposal . Following the preliminary injunction issued by ORG in DATE , after having heard PERSON twice , she had been living with PERSON In this period , PERSON had changed from primary to secondary school without problems . The competent youth offices had confirmed that both parents were capable of educating children . PERSON was meanwhile living together with her brother PERSON . Given the bonds between brother and sister , as confirmed at the hearing , it was also in PERSON \u2019s interest that they grew up together . Moreover , at least in the meantime , a closer relationship had developed between PERSON and PERSON repeated questioning had shown that she felt safer with her mother and had more personal care and definitively wished to live with PERSON There was no indication that PERSON \u2019s statements had been caused by PERSON and did not reflect PERSON \u2019s own wish . Although PERSON had not yet completed the age of CARDINAL and had no formal right of veto , the statement of her will had to be respected as act of self - determination . In these circumstances , ORG regarded as decisive that PERSON \u2019s future well - being and development would suffer , if her firm wish to live with PERSON was broken and she be forced to return to the applicant . Awarding custody to PERSON was , therefore , in the interest of PERSON \u2019s well - being .", "Furthermore , as regards the applicant \u2019s subsidiary request for joint custody , ORG , referring to the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , observed in particular that joint custody presupposed both GPE willingness to share the responsibility for the child after divorce . However , PERSON had refused joint custody , arguing that the applicant was not ready for cooperation and would impose his will . ORG considered that a parent refusing joint custody was in a position to exclude the other parent from custody . However , such a refusal was not necessarily abusive and therefore irrelevant . Rather , the child \u2019s interests were of paramount importance . In the absence of any willingness to cooperate in the child \u2019s education , joint custody could not be regarded as being in the interest of the child \u2019s well - being .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that , in case of the GPE divorce , the competent court decided on which parent should have custody of a common child , and took the decision which was in the interest of child \u2019s well - being ; the child \u2019s bonds , especially to its brothers and sisters , were to be considered . A common proposal by the parents was only to be disregarded if necessary in the interest of the child .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared unconstitutional paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of Section DATE , according to which custody had to be awarded to CARDINAL of the parents in case of divorce . ORG considered that a joint right to custody was possible in case of divorce if there is a common proposal by the parents to this effect , showing their willingness to share the responsibility for their child after their divorce .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , the competent courts may change their decisions relating to custody matters at any time , if necessary in the interest of the child ( i m Interesse des Kindes ) .", "The relevant legislation has been amended on the basis of the Government PERSON of DATE on the reform of the law on family matters . This reform of DATE , which has entered into force on DATE , harmonises the rules regarding children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock . Section CARDINAL of LAW , as amended , provides that , in case of a definite separation of parents who jointly exercise custody , each parent can request for a sole exercise of custody . The competent court will grant the request if ( CARDINAL ) the other parent agrees , unless the child having completed the age of DATE disagrees , or if ( CARDINAL ) the termination of joint custody and award to the CARDINAL parent most likely serves best the child \u2019s well - being . According to section DATE , as amended , the competent courts shall change their decisions if there are valid reasons seriously affecting the child ( triftige , das Wohl des Kindes nachhaltig ber\u00fchrende LOC ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
