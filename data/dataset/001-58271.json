The applicant is the author of a book entitled \u201c History in Mourning , CARDINAL bullets \u201d ( PERSON , QUANTITY Kur\u015fun ) , which won the Yunus Nadi Prize .", "The book was published in DATE , with a second edition appearing in DATE . It is accompanied by a preface attributed to PERSON , a well - known pro - NORP politician and leader writer whose main theme was the NORP question in GPE and who was murdered in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the course of a criminal investigation he was conducting in respect of PERSON , the public prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) requested a single judge of that court to order the seizure of the above - mentioned book as an interim measure .", "By an order made on that date the judge allowed this application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating separatist propaganda . Noting that in his book Mr PERSON had contended that there were various nations within GPE , described the NORP nation as barbarous , maintained that the NORP were the victims of constant oppression , if not genocide , and glorified the acts of insurgents in south - east GPE , he called for the application of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and confiscation of the book . The indictment included the following extracts from the book :", "\u201c ... the position of the NORP in LOC is very interesting ... Having arrived as a wave of nomads , they invaded the territories of nations which were CARDINAL times more civilised than them and , not having a superior culture of their own , attempted to control these peoples - the NORP , the NORP and the NORP , for example - by tyranny , violence and inhuman acts . Is it now to be expected that such an organisation , this barbarous mechanism founded on violence , this ORG order , will implement democratic decisions ? That would be a vain hope ... Even DATE , it is this mentality which prevails in GPE . For example , if one were to say that GPE belongs to the NORP , GPE to the NORP , \u2018 Lazistan\u2019 to the \u2018 Laz\u2019 and the territory of PERSON to the \u2018 R\u016bmis\u2019 , what would be left for the NORP ? ... In the LOC and LOC there is not a single people whom [ the NORP ] have not persecuted . That is why DATE the NORP realise that the NORP , the NORP ... and , internally , the NORP regard them as enemies . As a result , it has become axiomatic among [ the NORP ] that , as the saying has it , \u2018 A NORP \u2019s only friend is another Turk\u2019 . ... Several groups , such as the NORP , the NORP and the NORP , have won their freedom from this barbarous administration . Only the NORP remain . Both NORP and NORP are at a loss to know what to do about this situation . A NORP from NORP denies the NORP who lives in GPE . A GPE may neither give his father \u2019s forename to his son nor choose his name ... [ preface , pages CARDINAL ]", "... that being said , the revolt of the NORP peasants at Silopi had led to reactions on a larger scale ; the NORP exploded in fury against the massacre of their fellow NORP . The NORP people , who once took command of the peoples of LOC in their struggle against NORP despotism , were announcing , through their resistance , the joyful news of DATE when they would tear down the fortress of violence of NORP chauvinism ... [ chapter entitled \u201c The infinity of NORP \u201d , pages CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant denied the charges . He argued in particular that he could not be held responsible for the content of the preface written by PERSON . That argument was not accepted by the judges because PERSON , who had been heard by them as a witness , had explained that he had never intended to write a preface for the book but had merely handed over to the applicant , at his request , a periodical containing an article he had written DATE before .", "The applicant also submitted that in writing the book his intention had never been to work towards separatist ends but to set out his thoughts about incidents that had taken place in GPE , his native province , and had claimed the lives of CARDINAL peasants , including members of his family .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered the book \u2019s confiscation .", "In its judgment it noted in particular that in order to criticise ORG policy he had related without objectivity in his book certain events which had occurred in eastern and south - eastern GPE , and that he had maintained that the NORP were oppressed and crushed by the violence of the gendarmerie , which sometimes even shot them down , and that the fundamental rights of the NORP people had been trampled on . It held in particular :", "\u201c In the book certain parts of the national territory are referred to as the NORP region or provinces and it is explained that these must belong to the NORP , that they form their country , called GPE ; moreover , it is stated that the NORP , coming from NORP , have driven the NORP out of GPE and that this region has entered into a general war and is in a state of resistance . \u201d", "The ORG emphasised the extreme importance for society of being informed of the events in question and of the facts which had led to them , which should be related without comment , but stated that the content of the book , although presented as research findings , went well beyond such an aim .", "Accepting the prosecution submissions , ORG held that the theme which could be discerned throughout the book , and particularly in its preface , amounted to separatist propaganda based on racial considerations and intended to weaken patriotic sentiment , and that this justified Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) came into force . It repealed , inter alia , LAW , on which the applicant \u2019s conviction had been based . As a result , by a further judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared Mr PERSON \u2019s conviction null and void and ordered the return of the confiscated copies of the book .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s book was republished on DATE .", "On DATE the public prosecutor asked ORG to order its seizure on the ground that its republication contravened section CARDINAL of Law no . ORG , which prohibited all propaganda against \u201c the indivisible untiy of the State \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE a single judge of the court rejected this application on the ground that the constituent elements of the offence had not been made out .", "The public prosecutor repeated his application on DATE , arguing in particular that the acts which constituted the offence contemplated in former LAW of LAW did not differ in any way from those made punishable by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG . He submitted that it was illogical not to find that the book constituted propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State when its seizure had been ordered on CARDINAL DATE on the ground that it conveyed separatist propaganda ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On CARDINAL DATE the single judge rejected the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the public prosecutor , ORG ordered the principal public prosecutor at ORG to lodge an appeal in the interests of clarifying the law against the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG dismissed that appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , on the ground that it was for the judge dealing with the case to assess the expediency of an interim measure and that the question whether the content of a publication was contrary to the law could be determined only by a judgment on the merits .", "CARDINAL . In an indictment of CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor accused PERSON and his publisher of disseminating propaganda against \u201c the indivisible unity of the ORG \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "He reproduced the extracts included in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and referred to other passages in the book , including the following :", "\u201c ... The NORP people , who until recently were utterly disorganised , in disarray and torn in different directions , have called \u201c Halt ! \u201d , refusing this destiny imposed on them , and have now begun to take giant strides towards the accomplishment of their own destiny . Those who for DATE have kept these people in chains and exploited their labour panicked when they saw the seeds of resistance [ the NORP ] had cherished in their hearts in the face of such injustice and indignity beginning to sprout . As one of the main features of the special war , and in order to serve rulers who responded with massacres to the resistance of the great majority of the NORP people against the policies of deportation , threats , arrest , torture and oppression , the special forces have found no better way of expressing their feeling of defeat at the hands of the ORG militants than to massacre peasants . The slaughter of the peasants at Silopi announced the advent of a new epoch in the developments taking place in those regions where NORP form a majority of the population . The special war being conducted in that region between the security forces and ORG guerillas was coming to an end . A new era of total war was beginning \u2026 The ORG , which for DATE had been mobilising troops in large numbers and sending them to the Botan region DATE particularly the Cudi mountains \u2013 had not been able to prevent [ the ORG \u2019s ] armed raids and , once the ORG had realised that its latest operations [ against the ORG ] \u2013 whose scale was so much exaggerated by the press \u2013 had led to nothing , it decided to follow the historic example of the repression of the rebellion of PERSON and implement the final solution \u2013 genocide . From then on , every effort would be made to reach that solution . They began with Silopi ; the squadrons of death tried by every means they had to make progress with their manhunt . Like the counter - insurgency agents , the gangs and the village guards let loose in the NORP regions , those clan leaders who were in the pay of the government also received the order to drink NORP blood \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before ORG the applicant once more contested the charges brought against him , arguing in particular that the book was based on real events and on his observations as a journalist . He had done nothing more than relate certain events in the context of his professional activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of disseminating propaganda against \u201c the indivisible unity of the ORG \u201d and sentenced him , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG , to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY .", "In its judgment ORG made it clear at the outset that the fact that the applicant \u2019s previous conviction had been declared null and void on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) did not stand in the way of fresh charges being brought against him on the basis of a different provision of criminal law . As to the merits of the case , the court referred to certain passages of the book and \u2013 following in large part the same line of reasoning as in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 held that the applicant had intended to incite citizens of NORP origin to rebel against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG . In order to prove that Mr Anter was in fact the author of the preface , he asked for a witness to be heard . He maintained that the first part of the book related in a dramatised form a historic event and that the second part was only a collection of recent articles . In addition , his conviction for criticising the oppression of the NORP population constituted a serious threat to his freedom of expression .", "On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it was out of time . The applicant then appealed to ORG . Repeating the arguments set out above , he contended that to convict someone for expressing his thoughts was unacceptable in a modern society and that a country could not be said to have any \u201c unity \u201d or \u201c integrity \u201d if even the preface of a book was thought capable of endangering them .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment against Mr PERSON in a judgment of DATE , holding that the assessment of the evidence conducted by ORG justified the rejection of the applicant \u2019s grounds of appeal .", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of former LAW , repealed by PERSON no . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A person who , prompted by racial considerations , by any means whatsoever spreads propaganda aimed at abolishing in whole or in part public - law rights guaranteed by the LAW or undermining or destroying patriotic sentiment shall , on conviction , be liable to a term of imprisonment of from DATE .", "...", "CARDINAL . Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through publication , the penalty to be imposed shall be increased by CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Law no . ORG was promulgated on DATE . Section CARDINAL , ( subsequently repealed by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ) was worded as follows :", "\u201c Written and spoken propaganda , meetings , assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of GPE or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited , irrespective of the methods used and the intention . Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not CARDINAL and not more than five years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of from CARDINAL to MONEY . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to ORG withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility , especially on religious grounds ( LAW ) or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the ORG ( section CARDINAL of PERSON no . PERSON \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor \u2019s decision included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time - barred , that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence . Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed , that there had been no unlawful intent , that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified .", "Furthermore , the Government submitted a number of decisions of ORG as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above - mentioned offences had been found not guilty .
