After a number of periods in prison and hospital the applicant was admitted to ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) from prison under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE on DATE . He remained an in - patient until DATE , when he was discharged by ORG . DATE he was arrested and charged with a number of offences and was admitted , from prison , to a medium secure unit in DATE . In that unit he became increasingly psychotic , aggressive and violent . He was placed in seclusion and transferred to GPE on DATE . While at LOC he has been secluded on a number of occasions for the protection of others : between CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL March\u2013CARDINAL DATE . Each period of seclusion involved confinement to his bedroom or another room ; however , during each period of seclusion , the applicant was allowed periods of association either with staff or other patients . These periods ranged from TIME to over TIME . In the first period of seclusion , he had DATE half ORG association in total ; in the second , CARDINAL ORG association ; in the third , CARDINAL hours\u2019 association ; and in the fourth , CARDINAL NORP association . There was DATE , DATE , when the applicant was not allowed any association at all .", "CARDINAL . Each period of seclusion was made by LOC pursuant to its seclusion policy ( \u201c the policy \u201d : see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) . There is a national Code of Practice , issued by the Secretary of ORG under LAW , which includes a section on seclusion of psychiatric patients ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) . The applicant maintains that the hospital \u2019s seclusion policy differs substantially from the LAW , particularly by reducing the number and frequency of reviews of his seclusion by a doctor from that laid down in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant first challenged LOC \u2019s seclusion policy on this basis in ORG in DATE . On DATE , ORG found that the hospital \u2019s policy , by reducing the frequency of review of a patient \u2019s seclusion below that provided for in DATE , was unlawful and was not justified by the fact that the hospital was a maximum secure hospital . In particular , the failure after DATE of seclusion to have twice - daily medical reviews of the continuation of seclusion was not justified .", "CARDINAL . Ashworth did not change its policy and the applicant commenced further judicial review proceedings on DATE . In DATE , the hospital adopted a new policy , providing for medical review of the continuation of the use of seclusion twice DATE on DATE of the seclusion and thereafter CARDINAL reviews a week by a doctor and a DATE multidisciplinary review . The applicant continued to challenge the legality of the policy on the grounds that DATE CARDINAL onwards it did not comply with the review procedures found necessary by ORG . He also argued that LAW suggested that there should be medical reviews TIME . Finally he argued that the hospital \u2019s policy was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE , ORG ruled that the minimum level of severity required for DATE was not met and there was no breach of LAW . It also found that LAW was merely guidance . ORG also accepted the evidence of GPE that the applicant had not remained in seclusion for longer than had been necessary , and that there was no evidence that more frequent reviews would have reduced the time spent in seclusion .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG and , on DATE , it allowed his appeal . Relying on X v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , Decisions and Reports ( GPE ) CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ( cited in the judgment as A. v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ) , it found that seclusion of a detained psychiatric patient was capable of amounting to a breach of Article CARDINAL . On the basis of this ORG \u2019s ruling in PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII , it also found that LAW , in so far as it regulated seclusion , had to have a status and weight consistent with the ORG \u2019s obligation to avoid ill - treatment of patients detained by the ORG . Where there was a risk that agents of the ORG would treat their patients contrary to LAW , the ORG should take steps to avoid this through the publication of LAW , which its agents were obliged to follow unless they had good reason to depart from it .", "CARDINAL . ORG also held that seclusion would breach LAW unless it could be justified under LAW . In considering the need for any interference to be \u201c in accordance with law \u201d in terms of LAW , it found that the transparency and predictability required by this provision were supplied by LAW . It found :", "\u201c It would fly in the face of the original purposes of the LAW if hospitals or professionals were in fact free not to follow it without a good reason . It is clear that section PERSON ) ( see para CARDINAL above ) can not have been intended as a \u2018 take it or leave it\u2019 provision . In relation to those matters where a patient \u2019s human rights are or may be engaged , the arguments for according the Code the greater status are compelling . Where there is a risk that agents of the state will treat its patients in a way which contravenes LAW , the state should take steps to avoid this through the publication of LAW which its agents are obliged to follow unless they have good reason to depart from it . Where there is an interference with the rights protected by LAW , the requirement of legality is met through adherence to LAW again unless there is good reason to depart from it . The same will apply where the LAW deals with the deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article CARDINAL .... We conclude that the Code should be observed by all hospitals unless they have a good reason for departing from it in relation to an individual patient . They may identify good reasons for particular departures in relation to groups of patients who share particular well - defined characteristics , so that if the patient falls within that category there will be a good reason for departing from the Code in his case . But they can not depart from it as a matter of policy and in relation to an arbitrary dividing line which is not properly related to the PERSON \u2019s definition of seclusion and its requirements . \u201d", "It concluded that the hospital \u2019s seclusion policy was unlawful . While the court considered LAW on its own motion , relying on this ORG \u2019s rulings in PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , PERSON GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , it found that seclusion did not amount to a further deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . Ashworth appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG ( by a majority of CARDINAL ) allowed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the lead speech , Lord PERSON ( with whom Lord Hope and Lord PERSON agreed ) found that LAW was only guidance and he was satisfied that the hospital had shown good reasons for departing from it . He stated :", "\u201c DATE . It is in my view plain that the Code does not have the binding effect which a statutory provision or a statutory instrument would have . It is what it purports to be , guidance and not instruction . But the matters relied on by PERSON show that the guidance should be given great weight . It is not instruction , but it is much more than mere advice which an addressee is free to follow or not as it chooses . It is guidance which any hospital should consider with great care , and from which it should depart only if it has cogent reasons for doing so . Where , which is not this case , the guidance addresses a matter covered by section PERSON ) [ of LAW DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , any departure would call for even stronger reasons . In reviewing any challenge to a departure from the LAW , the court should scrutinise the reasons given by the hospital for departure with the intensity which the importance and sensitivity of the subject matter requires .", "CARDINAL . The extensive evidence adduced by the ORG makes clear that the LAW was very carefully considered . This is indeed evident from the policy itself , which reproduces important parts of the LAW and contains cross - references to it . But the policy did depart from the LAW in providing for less frequent medical review after DATE . As the [ High Court observed ] , the Trust \u2018 has explained the justification for the policy in very considerable GPE . ...", "CARDINAL . In considering the frequency of medical review after DATE the Trust were in my opinion entitled to take account of CARDINAL matters in particular . First , as pointed out in the Introduction to the policy , the LAW was directed to the generality of mental hospitals and did not address the special problems of high security hospitals , containing as they inevitably do the most potentially dangerous patients in the country . Secondly , the Code did not recognise the special position of patients whom it was necessary to seclude for longer than DATE . It has been the experience of the Trust that the condition of those secluded for DATE does not change rapidly , and that it is in any event unsafe to rely on an apparent improvement without allowing enough time to pass to give grounds for confidence that the improvement will endure . Thirdly , the statutory scheme , while providing for the Secretary of ORG to give guidance , deliberately left the power and responsibility of final decision to those who bear the legal and practical responsibility for detaining , treating , nursing and caring for the patients .", "CARDINAL . The witness statements submitted by the Trust are very strongly challenged in statements and evidence on behalf of PERSON , PERSON and ORG . This is a highly controversial subject , on which professional opinions differ . The DATE divide between short - term and long - term secluded patients is criticised . So is the practice , adopted at LOC , of allowing secluded patients to spend periods of time , sometimes lengthy periods , in closely supervised association with other patients . There are differences of practice , not all of them fully explained , between GPE , ORG and ORG . It is not , however , for the courts to resolve debatable issues of professional practice , but to rule on issues of law . If a practice is supported by cogent reasoned justification , the court is not entitled to condemn it as unlawful . In the present case , even with the intense scrutiny called for , I can not regard the long and detailed statements submitted by ORG as failing to show good reasons for adopting the policy it has adopted , even though there are many eminent professional experts who take a different view . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE found that Article CARDINAL was not breached by the policy . He held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... Despite much learned argument addressed to the ORG , I do not find it necessary to discuss the extent or probability of the risk or the extent to which it must be foreseen . For I agree with [ ORG ] that the policy must be considered as a whole , that the policy , properly operated , will be sufficient to prevent any possible breach of the article CARDINAL rights of a patient secluded for DATE and that there is no evidence to support the proposition that the frequency of medical review provided in the policy risks any breach of those rights . The patient must be the subject of recorded observation by a nurse at least TIME and of recorded review by CARDINAL qualified nurses TIME , CARDINAL of them ( where practicable ) not involved in the decision to seclude . In the ordinary course of things it is the nurses who know the patient best , and the nurse in charge of the ward can terminate seclusion at any time . There must be a DATE review by a ward manager or site manager of a different ward : these , as the evidence shows , are senior and experienced people . There must be CARDINAL medical reviews DATE , CARDINAL of them involving the patient \u2019s responsible medical officer . There must in addition be a DATE review by a multi - disciplinary patient care team , including the patient \u2019s RMO [ Resident Medical Officer ] . The seclusion of the patient must be monitored by the hospital \u2019s ORG , which includes the medical director , the hospital director , the head of psychology , the senior nurse , the head of social care , CARDINAL nurses , the ward manager and a non - executive director of the Trust , some of whom must have seen the patient . It reports to the hospital \u2019s ORG . ORG must be informed once a patient has been secluded for DATE and must thereafter receive regular progress reports : as already noted , it has statutory power to visit and investigate any complaint . The patient may , wherever possible , be visited by a relative . The patient or his representative may appeal to the medical director or his deputy , who must review the case and take account of any representations made . The patient may seek judicial review of the decision to seclude him or continue to seclude him , or to challenge the conditions in which he is secluded . It can not in my opinion be said , bearing in mind that the standard set must obtain in all member states of ORG , that a policy containing these safeguards exposes a patient secluded for DATE to any material risk of treatment prohibited by article CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Lord PERSON endorsed ORG finding that it did not apply and added :", "\u201c The approach to residual liberty which appears to have prevailed in GPE ( see PERSON v The Queen ( DATE ) CARDINAL DLR ( CARDINALth ) CARDINAL ) does not , as I understand , reflect the jurisprudence of ORG . I do not for my part regret this conclusion since , as ORG pointed out ( in para CARDINAL of its judgment ) , improper use of seclusion may found complaints under article CARDINAL or article CARDINAL , and article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that a successful challenge should result in an order that the detainee be released , not in an order that the conditions of his detention be varied . I would not , for example , understand article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) as enabling a prisoner , lawfully detained , to challenge his prison category . In any event , the LOC policy , properly applied as CARDINAL must assume , does not permit a patient to be deprived of any residual liberty to which he is properly entitled : seclusion must be for as short a period and in conditions as benign as will afford reasonable protection to others who have a right to be protected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Convention , Lord PERSON doubted that seclusion , when properly used in order to protect others from violence and intimidation and when used for the shortest period necessary , was an interference with a patient \u2019s LAW . He considered that \u201c a detained patient , when in his right mind or during lucid intervals , would not wish to be free to act in such a way [ to be violent or intimidating ] and would recognise that his best interests were served by his being prevented from doing so . \u201d However , for Lord PERSON , if there were an interference then the \u201c in accordance with law \u201d requirement of LAW had not been breached . He found ( at paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) :", "\u201c The requirement that any interference with the right guaranteed by article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) be in accordance with the law is important and salutary , but it is directed to substance and not form . It is intended to ensure that any interference is not random and arbitrary but governed by clear pre - existing rules , and that the circumstances and procedures adopted are predictable and foreseeable by those to whom they are applied . This could of course have been achieved by binding statutory provisions or binding ministerial regulations . But that was not the model ORG adopted . It preferred to require the Secretary of ORG to give guidance and ( in relation to seclusion ) to call on hospitals to have clear written guidelines . Given the broad range of institutions in which patients may be treated for mental disorder ... it is readily understandable why a single set of rules , binding on all , was thought to be undesirable and perhaps impracticable . It is common ground that the power to seclude a patient within the hospital is implied from the power to detain as a \u2018 necessary ingredient flowing from a power of detention for treatment\u2019 treatment \u201d : see ORG in R v ORG , ORG , H and D ( DATE , unreported ) and ORG judgment in the present case , para CARDINAL . The procedure adopted by the Trust does not permit arbitrary or random decision - making . The rules are accessible , foreseeable and predictable . It can not be said , in my opinion , that they are not in accordance with or prescribed by law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope , in agreeing with Lord PERSON , stated :", "\u201c In my opinion there is nothing that is arbitrary about the way in which LOC has departed from the LAW in the framing of its Policy . A careful reading of it shows that it is based very substantially on the PERSON \u2019s guidance , and that where it departs from it \u2013 with regard to the frequency of reviews in DATE it does so because of its perception of the way seclusion needs to be used in the special circumstances that obtain at LOC . The system that it lays down has been carefully designed to deal with its use for much longer periods than the Code \u2019s guidance was designed for . Its purpose is to ensure that its use for these longer periods is not resorted to at random or arbitrarily . Following the Code \u2019s example , that is the whole purpose of the Policy .", "CARDINAL . As for the question whether LOC was free to depart from the Code as a matter of policy , and not just in relation to individual patients or groups of patients , I do not see why this should be so , provided of course that it can demonstrate that it had a good reason for doing so . The distinction which ORG made between a departure in the case of individual patients or groups of patients and a departure which takes the form of a written policy for dealing with a particular form of intervention is elusive , and I do not think that it can be regarded as acceptable . There is an obvious danger that , if the Code could be departed from in the case of individual patients or groups of patients where no written guidance was available , decisions to do this would be open to attack as being arbitrary because their consequences were unregulated and unpredictable . That , precisely , is what ORG Policy seeks to avoid . Good clinical and medical practice dictates that seclusion should only be used in particular situations to protect others and subject to particular conditions to ensure that the patient is not harmed or secluded for any longer than is necessary . The purpose of the Policy is to ensure that the conditions under which it is to be resorted to are clearly understood and carefully observed so that decisions that are taken about the management of this procedure are consistent and not arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . I am in full agreement with all that my noble and learned friend Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood has said about this case except with regard to the issues raised by article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , as to which I have the misfortune to disagree with him . The point that divides us is whether the practice of seclusion carried out at LOC in accordance with the Policy is \u201c in accordance with the law . \u201d As his quotation from para CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and ORG ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL reminds us , it is the quality of the law that matters rather than the form it takes . The touchstones by which its quality is measured are , as Lord PERSON says , its transparency , its accessibility , its predictability and its consistency . Where these qualities are present the measure protects against the abuse of power and against conduct which is arbitrary . There is no doubt that the LAW satisfied these tests , notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation to comply with it . In my opinion Ashworth \u2019s Policy , which is careful in all these respects to follow the PERSON \u2019s example , does so too . It is , of course , true that LOC could alter its Policy . But if it did so every departure from the Code would have to be justified in the same way as the Policy itself has had to be justified . I do not think that the fact that LOC has its own Policy opens the door to further departures from the LAW that could be described as arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . Assuming , of course , that LOC has shown - as it has - clearly , logically and convincingly that it had cogent reasons for departing from the LAW in these particular respects in favour of its own Policy , I would hold that its decision can not be said to have been unlawful . Concerns that a departure from the LAW in this instance will lead to widespread variations in practice and undermine its status generally or that your Lordships\u2019 judgment lowers the protection offered by the law to mentally disordered patients are misplaced , in my opinion . The requirement that cogent reasons must be shown for any departure from it sets a high standard which is not easily satisfied . The protection which the law provides to ensure that any departures are compatible with Convention rights is an additional safeguard . This has been amply demonstrated in practice since the LAW was promulgated . ORG is the only place where a hospital has departed from what the PERSON says about seclusion in favour of its own policy . While I would respectfully endorse everything that Lord PERSON says in the last paragraph of his speech [ paragraph CARDINAL , quoted below ] , I believe that it would be wrong to see this judgment as opening the door to substantial departures from the Code on the part of individual hospitals . The decision of the majority should not be seen as an invitation to other hospitals to do this and resort to their own policies . The status of the Code remains unchanged , and so does the need to show cogent reasons if in any respect it is departed from .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , in agreeing that LOC \u2019s policy was in accordance with the law for the purposes of DATE , emphasised the duty the hospital owed to protect patients and staff from harm . Once it was accepted that LOC had no statutory obligation to have a seclusion policy that conformed in every respect to the LAW and that LOC \u2019s seclusion policy was rational and reasonable in itself despite its divergences from the Code , there could be no room for any suggestion that the implementation of LOC \u2019s seclusion policy for the safety of other inmates was otherwise than in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON concurred in respect of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL and dissented in respect of Article CARDINAL . He did not find that the hospital \u2019s policy was \u201c in accordance with law \u201d for the purposes of LAW , since it did not have sufficient \u201c quality of law \u201d . In his view , for the requirements of LAW to be met , LAW had to be given the higher status of the force of law , disentitling individual hospitals to depart from it on policy grounds . He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Not without some considerable hesitation I have reached the conclusion that the Code must indeed be given this higher status . Without such a Code the legal position would be this . The only authority for seclusion would be , in the case of patients detained under LAW , the implied power of control over those lawfully detained ; in the case of informal patients , the common law doctrines of necessity and self - defence . The actual use of seclusion in individual cases would not be regulated save insofar as each hospital practising it would be required to adopt , publish and practise a rational policy of its own . That , of course , is precisely what LOC does . But by the same token that LOC is permitted to adopt its own policy , so too may other hospitals . Much of the factual focus of the appeal was upon those of LOC \u2019s patients who are detained for DATE . But LOC \u2019s policy departs from the PERSON much earlier than this : only for TIME does LOC conduct medical reviews at CARDINAL TIME intervals as specified by the Code ; from then until DATE such reviews occur twice ( rather than CARDINAL times ) DATE . Other hospitals too may think it unnecessary to conduct reviews as frequently as provided for by the Code . And of course there is nothing to stop LOC altering its policy whenever it thinks it right to do so . The policy of an individual hospital can be changed with infinitely greater ease than the LAW itself .", "...", "CARDINAL.The Secretary of ORG \u2019s Foreword to the DATE issue of the PERSON stated that : \u2018 the LAW should be followed\u2019 until necessary new legislation came into force . It ended :", "\u2018 The LAW provides essential reference guidance for those who apply the LAW . Patients and their carers are entitled to expect professionals to use it.\u2019", "Under the ruling proposed by the majority of your Lordships , patients and their carers must be reconciled instead to substantial departures from the LAW on the part of individual hospitals who may prefer to follow a different policy of their own . It is my reluctant conclusion that not only will these patients and carers be disappointed in their expectations but that the practices in the event adopted by any such hospital ( rational though I acknowledge they must certainly be ) will not have the necessary legal quality to render them compatible with the rule of law . Unless it is to the LAW that one can look for regulation carrying the force of law it is not in my opinion to be found elsewhere . Hospital policies themselves provide too insubstantial a foundation for a practice so potentially harmful and open to abuse as the seclusion of vulnerable mental patients . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON dissented on all CARDINAL points . On Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL he approved the reasoning of ORG . On the status of LAW , by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( which directs the Secretary of ORG to prepare such a code ) he found :", "\u201c ... in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ORG had authorised a LAW with some minimum safeguards and a modicum of centralised protection for vulnerable patients . This is inconsistent with a free - for - all in which hospitals are at liberty to depart from the published LAW as they consider right . Indeed , it seems unlikely that ORG would have authorised a regime in which hospitals may as a matter of policy depart from the LAW . After all that would result in mentally disordered patients being treated about seclusion in a discriminatory manner , depending on the policy adopted by the managers and clinicians in particular hospitals . \u201d", "He also found LAW to be applicable , stating as follows :", "\u201c Under LANGUAGE law a convicted prisoner , sentenced to imprisonment , retains all his civil rights which are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication : PERSON v Honey [ DATE ] ORG , at CARDINAL G , per Lord PERSON . To that extent the prisoner has a residual liberty . The concept of residual liberty is a logical and useful one as demonstrated by the decision of ORG in PERSON v The Queen ( DATE ) CARDINAL DLR ( CARDINALth ) CARDINAL . The reasoning in PERSON shows that in a case of a prisoner where solitary confinement is unlawfully and unjustly superimposed upon his prison sentence the added solitary confinement can amount to \u2018 prison within a prison\u2019 : it is capable of constituting a material deprivation of residual liberty", "...", "It would also be wrong to assume that under the jurisprudence of the ORG residual liberty is not protected . There is relevant NORP authority not placed before ORG . In GPE , App No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , albeit in an admissibility decision , considered the point . The complaint was a comparatively weak CARDINAL : the prisoner had been confined to her cell , unlawfully it was said , for TIME . The evidence was that she was a heroin addict who objected to that restriction on her residual liberty . In NORP terms the case simply did not reach the necessary threshold of severity . ORG dealt with the legal principles arising under the ORG as follows :", "\u2018 It is undisputed in the present case that PERSON was lawfully detained in GPE prison pursuant to a court order remanding her in custody pending sentence for a criminal offence . Nor is it disputed that the prison was an appropriate establishment for that type of detention or that there was anything inappropriate concerning her place of detention within the prison . The principal issue is whether the decision of the prison officers to leave PERSON in her cell until lunchtime - a period of TIME - in itself disclosed an unjustified and unlawful deprivation of her liberty within that prison .", "The court does not exclude that measures adopted within a prison may disclose interferences with the right to liberty in exceptional circumstances . Generally however , disciplinary steps , imposed formally or informally , which have effects on conditions of detention within a prison , can not be considered as constituting deprivation of liberty . Such measures must be regarded in normal circumstances as modifications of the conditions of lawful detention and therefore fall outside the scope of LAW ( see Application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , dec . CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , PERSON , p CARDINAL . In appropriate cases , issues may arise however under articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG", "( My emphasis )", "Plainly , the ECtHR has not ruled out as a matter of principle the concept of residual liberty . On the contrary , it accepts that there is scope for such a doctrine . It will be noted also that the ECtHR observed that in such cases \u2018 in appropriate cases , issues may arise however under articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention\u2019 . To that it must be added that , if substantial and unjust seclusion of a mentally disordered patient can not in our domestic law be protected effectively under articles CARDINAL and DATE , the case for protection under article CARDINAL becomes ever stronger . It follows that a substantial period of unnecessary seclusion of a mentally disordered patient , involving total deprivation of any residual liberty that the patient may have within the hospital , is capable of amounting to an unjustified deprivation of liberty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the speech of Lord PERSON in the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in the present case ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL .
