He is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was tried before a jury at ORG on a charge of murdering his girlfriend ( \u201c T. \u201d ) at her home .", "The court heard that the police were called to T. \u2019s home in TIME of DATE and found her body in the kitchen . The applicant was lying on the floor with his head resting on her stomach . T. had been stabbed CARDINAL times , most of the wounds being to her left hand . There were CARDINAL deep wounds , one to her face and one to her left breast area .", "According to PERSON who carried out the post mortem analysis on behalf of the ORG , either of those wounds was fatal . PERSON also examined stab wounds , CARDINAL in all , found on the applicant \u2019s body . He advised that there was no evidence of defensive injuries either to the applicant \u2019s arms or hands . At the same time , PERSON was unable to determine whether or not the wounds were self - inflicted or inflicted by CARDINAL party .", "ORG , a friend of the deceased , testified at the trial that the applicant telephoned her shortly after TIME on DATE and exclaimed that :", "\u201c T. \u2019s dead and I \u2019m dead . \u201d", "When she arrived at ORG house , the applicant was holding a kitchen knife . He told her :", "\u201c I \u2019ve killed T. , I \u2019ve got to kill myself . \u201d", "According to CARDINAL police officers who arrived at the scene , the applicant stated :", "\u201c Well lads , I \u2019ve done it now but I tell you what , I love her . \u201d", "The police recovered CARDINAL blood - stained carving knives from the kitchen , either of which could have caused the injuries to T. and the applicant .", "The applicant was taken to a hospital where he underwent lengthy surgery for his injuries . He remained in intensive care for a period of time and was finally discharged on DATE . He was taken directly to a police station . Although a doctor had expressed the opinion on DATE that the applicant was not fit to be interviewed , a contrary opinion was given by another doctor who examined him on TIME of DATE and found that , although in pain , he was fit to be interviewed . The applicant was subsequently interviewed between TIME and TIME on DATE .", "The applicant was cautioned as follows in the presence of his solicitor :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court . Anything you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s solicitor advised him not to answer police questions and referred to the pain which the applicant was suffering as well as his lack of sleep . On the strength of that advice the applicant made no comment to the questions put to him during the interview . The questions centred on his presence at the deceased \u2019s house , the presence of blood on his clothes and body , his being in possession of knives when the police arrived at the scene and the injuries which he had sustained . He was also questioned about the defence injuries to the deceased \u2019s body and the absence of any defence injuries to his own body .", "On DATE the applicant was charged with ORG \u2019s murder .", "At his trial the applicant did not dispute that he had stabbed T. However he pleaded that he had acted in self - defence . In the alternative , he relied on the defence of diminished responsibility under the terms of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Homicide Act DATE , as well as that of provocation .", "As to the latter defences , he relied on the testimony of Dr PERSON , a clinical psychologist , and PERSON and PERSON , both consultant psychiatrists . PERSON stated that , in his opinion , the applicant was suffering from a mild to moderate depressive illness at the time of the incident . In PERSON opinion the applicant was suffering from a moderate depressive illness at the time . They both expressed the view that the applicant was suffering from an abnormality of mind sufficient to impair substantially his mental responsibility . As to the defence of provocation , Dr ORG testified that if the court concluded that the applicant had not got over his mother \u2019s death and that his condition arose out of inadequacies in his personality , and if it were accepted that the applicant was suffering from mild to moderate depressive illness at the time of the offence , that would be relevant to explaining the applicant \u2019s reaction and his susceptibility to some types of alleged provocation . PERSON observed that the applicant had real difficulty in processing multiple sources of information , a failing which could be linked to possible brain damage which the applicant sustained in a traffic accident when he was young . The other doctors had earlier stated that their conclusions would be reinforced by evidence of brain damage .", "In connection with his plea of self - defence the applicant told the jury that ORG had become argumentative when they went back to her home after TIME spent at a club . T. suddenly began to stab him with a kitchen knife and he defended himself with a fork . T. then attacked him with a bigger knife . He stated in his testimony that he must have taken out a knife from the kitchen drawer during this time . He tried to wrestle her to the floor , but she continued to stab him . He must have lashed out and caused the injury to her face , but did not remember doing so . Eventually she stabbed herself in the chest , telling him that she loved him . He then pulled the knife out of her body . The witness , PERSON , arrived at some stage and he had to smash a glass panel to let her into the house . He told her : \u201c I think T. is dead . I love her , I \u2019m going with her . \u201d With those words , he stabbed himself in the throat and on the chest and lay down on the kitchen floor with his head resting on T. \u2019s stomach .", "When cross - examined as to why he did not give this account of the incident to the police on DATE during interview , the applicant replied that he wanted to answer the questions put to him but :", "\u201c [ that his ] solicitor said I was in no condition to answer . I would have tried my best to answer the questions . I understood what they said . It was fuzzy to me . My recollection was I could n\u2019t recall , but it came back to me in flashbacks . I could n\u2019t remember everything . ... I had to keep trying to remember . I tried to remember the best I could . ... I must have been responsible for it , cos she would n\u2019t be dead . \u201d", "When asked by prosecution counsel what he had remembered on DATE of the interview , the applicant replied that he knew that T. had attacked him , that she had deliberately plunged a knife into him and that he had reacted as he did in self - defence .", "He was then asked whether he could have told the police about these matters on TIME of the interview . The applicant replied in the affirmative adding :", "\u201c ... I was advised not to say anything . On ill health , because I was so drugged up from the hospital . Like , I was hurting bad \u2013 and they knew I was hurting bad . \u201d", "In the course of the trial , the prosecution invited the judge to leave the jury with the option of drawing adverse inferences from the applicant \u2019s silence during police interview on the ground that the applicant \u2019s account of the incident had been fabricated before interview and that he knew that it would not withstand police questioning .", "Counsel for the applicant , with reference to ORG judgment in NORP v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports , p. CARDINAL ) contended that adverse inferences could only be drawn from an accused \u2019s silence under caution when the failure to mention facts in interview which are later relied on at the trial can only be explained in terms of their fabrication after the interview .", "The trial judge rejected the applicant \u2019s submission . At the close of the trial the judge in his summing up reminded the jury of the answers given by the applicant under cross - examination . He directed the jury in the following terms :", "\u201c Those were questions asked by [ prosecution counsel ] in cross - examination , members of the jury . You will remember that [ counsel ] was asking them to establish what the defendant said was his state of knowledge at the interview . He was telling you in evidence that at the interview he knew full well that [ T. ] had struck him the first blow , was the aggressor . He knew full well that she had caused a situation where he was acting in self defence . He knew full well that , in the end , she had plunged that knife deliberately into her chest .", "Now those are all matters which you heard about in evidence , but which the officers in the interview ... did not hear at all , because when they asked questions directed to these matters the answer was no comment .", "You have been rightly told as to what the law is in relation to inferences that you can draw . I told you TIME that I would come to the law on this subject after I had dealt with the answers the defendant had given in his evidence before you as to why he did not mention those facts at the time of the interview . I now , therefore , give you this direction in law . As it is a direction in law , you must take the law from me . The facts , of course , are for you .", "The defendant , as part of his defence , has relied on facts which he alleges . Those facts include the fact that [ T. ] attacked him and struck him first , and that what he did was only in self defence . She then plunged the knife into herself . He admits that he did not mention those facts when he was questioned under caution , before being charged with the offence .", "The prosecution case is in the circumstances , when he was questioned , he could reasonably have been expected then to mention those facts . If you are sure that he did fail to mention them when he was questioned , and he accepts that , then you decide whether , in the circumstances , they were facts which he could reasonably have been expected then to mention . If they were , the law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to mention these matters at that time .", "Failure to mention such a fact can not on its own prove guilt but , depending on the circumstances , you may hold it against him in deciding whether he is guilty . That is , take it into account as some additional support for the prosecution case . You are not bound to do so . It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so .", "There is evidence before you , on the basis of which [ defence counsel ] invites you not to hold it against him that he failed to mention these facts . That evidence I have just reminded you of . It is evidence as to the state of his health at the time , the pain that he was experiencing and that he was acting on legal advice . If you think that that amounts to a reason why you should not hold the defendant \u2019s failure against him , do not do so . On the other hand , if it does not , in your judgment , provide an adequate explanation , or you are sure that the real reason for his failure to mention these facts was that he had no answer , or none that would stand up to cross - examination , then you may hold the adverse inference against him .", "Let me warn you as to CARDINAL inference which I direct you is one that you may not draw against him . You may not draw against him an inference that his account was only made up after the interview , and that it is therefore a post interview fabrication . That is because in his trial he was cross - examined . He said at the interview he was fully aware , when the police officers were questioning him , that T. had attacked him , that she had plunged the knife into herself , and that he had been acting only in self defence .", "When he gave those answers in the witness box , the prosecution did not challenge that account . They accepted it . The inference they invite you to draw was not that it was made up after the interview . It is a different one . The inference they invite you to draw is that the account was false , and had already been made up on DATE of the interview . But , on DATE , the defendant was simply not prepared to expose the account to critical questioning and examination , which he feared would expose its falsity , in that it would not stand up to questioning and cross - examination at all .", "That is the law in relation to inferences . You are entitled to look at the situation in that light , and come to the conclusion whether you will draw inferences against the defendant , or whether you will not . \u201d", "In a separate direction the trial judge also directed the jury that if they were to find the applicant guilty of manslaughter by reason of his diminished responsibility at the time of the offence they had to be satisfied that the applicant was suffering from an abnormality of mind , that that abnormality was caused or induced by disease or injury and that the abnormality \u201c substantially impaired \u201d the applicant \u2019s responsibility for his act . The judge stated with reference to the expert medical witnesses called by the applicant and to the statutory requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Homicide Act DATE :", "\u201c You will probably be quite satisfied that the defence has established an abnormality of mind , has established that it was caused by disease . It will be the third element that you will move on to . Abnormality of mind proved to the necessary standard by the defendant . Abnormality induced by disease , the disease of a depressive illness , again proved .", "So you would have to go on to the third question , which is whether the defendant \u2019s mental responsibility was or was not substantially impaired by that abnormality of mind . You will want to consider the views of the experts on that question . But as you have heard , and as is the law , the decision as to whether or not his responsibility was substantially impaired is a matter for you , the jury . \u201d", "The trial judge subsequently advised the jury on the issue of \u201c expert evidence \u201d and the approach which they should take to the evidence given by the medical experts called by the applicant . He noted that PERSON had stated under cross - examination that even if all CARDINAL of the requirements contained in the Homicide Act DATE were satisfied , his view depended on what he had been actually told by the applicant after the commission of the offence . The trial judge concluded his summing up by stating that the decision as to whether or not the applicant \u2019s responsibility was \u201c substantially impaired \u201d was a matter for the jury to decide and that they were not bound by what the medical witnesses had said . The jury was told that if there was no evidence to cast doubt on the medical evidence , then they must accept that evidence . The judge then dealt with the issue as to what the defendant had said to the doctors on the basis on which they had formed an opinion . He reminded the jury that PERSON had acknowledged that if that evidence was undermined , the basis for his opinion would disappear .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of murder . He was given a mandatory life sentence .", "On DATE the Single Judge refused the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal against conviction .", "The applicant \u2019s renewed application was heard by ORG ) . In his perfected grounds of appeal , the applicant asserted , inter alia , that the trial judge had misdirected the jury by leaving them the option of drawing an adverse inference in circumstances where the prosecution had not alleged that his account at the trial had not been recently fabricated . He maintained in the alternative that the trial judge was wrong to leave the jury the option of drawing adverse inferences in circumstances where the applicant had given unchallenged evidence that he could have given his account of the incident in interview .", "The applicant also maintained before ORG that the trial judge had misdirected the jury as regards the medical evidence which supported his defence of diminished responsibility . He referred in particular to his concerns that the judge \u2019s first directions on this matter were contradictory and that the judge had failed to say what evidence pointed against the medical experts\u2019 opinion .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in its judgment delivered on DATE . Lord Justice PERSON stated with respect to the issue of adverse inference :", "\u201c The third suggested ground of appeal arises CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act with regard to inferences that the jury might draw from the \u2018 No comment\u2019 answers in interview . In his summing - up the learned judge reminded the jury of what had happened and in particular of the fact that the defendant \u2019s solicitor had advised him not to answer questions at that stage . He referred also to the parts of the evidence where the defendant had been asked about this , and in particular he quoted the defendant \u2019s answers which were as follows : \u2018 My solicitor said I was in no condition to answer . I would have tried my best to answer the questions . I understood what they said . It was fuzzy to me . My recollection was I could n\u2019t recall , but it came back to me in flashbacks . I could n\u2019t remember everything.\u2019 He said , \u2018 I had to keep trying to remember . I tried to remember the best I could.\u2019 He tried to work out what went on .", "He was also asked : \u2018 You had the ability DATE to say all of those things to the police , did you not?\u2019 He said he could have said them to the police . He was asked , \u2018 You could have said those things?\u2019 , and said , \u2018 But I was advised not to say anything . On ill health , because I was so drugged up from the hospital . Like , I was hurting bad \u2013 and they knew I was hurting bad\u2019 .", "Then the learned judge proceeded to consider the question of inferences , and he gave the jury an extended direction ... He concluded as follows :", "\u2018 When he gave those answers in the witness box , the prosecution did not challenge that account . They accepted it . The inference that [ they ] invite you to draw was not that it was made up after the interview . It is a different one . The inference they invite you to draw is that the account was false , and had already been made up on DATE of the interview . But , on DATE , the defendant was simply not prepared to expose the account to critical questioning and information , which he feared would expose its falsity , in that it would not stand up to questioning and cross - examination at all.\u2019", "It was , in other words , not put to the defendant that he had invented or fabricated his account after the interview .", "The submission made to us , as it was made to the learned judge in the course of the trial , was that no inference was possible and therefore the jury should have been directed , since the prosecution did not rely upon that inference , that no inference should be drawn by them against the defendant . This had been the subject of a ruling on DATE before speeches began . The judge ruled that it was unnecessary for the defence to call the solicitor who had given the advice because there was no suggestion of recent fabrication , meaning post - interview intervention .", "We would hold that the submission which [ prosecution counsel ] made , and which the learned judge upheld , was correct . The inference described by the learned judge to the jury was a possible inference for the jury to draw . It would mean that the defendant already had it in mind to say that he had acted in self - defence , and the question would remain , if that was in his mind , why should he not say so ? We therefore reject that suggested ground of appeal also . \u201d", "As to the issue of how the trial judge dealt with the applicant \u2019s defence of diminished responsibility , Lord Justice PERSON stated that he had no hesitation in holding that the trial judge \u2019s directions on the matter were sufficient since he had made it clear to the jury that the doctors had agreed at the trial that their opinions were based on what the applicant had told them after the offence about his mental condition . It was in that context that the jury had to consider whether or not the applicant \u2019s account to them was truthful .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence , evidence is given that the accused \u2013", "( a ) at any time before he was charged with the offence , on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed , failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings ; or", "( b ) ... being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned , charged or informed , as the case may be , subsection ( CARDINAL ) below applies .", "CARDINAL .
