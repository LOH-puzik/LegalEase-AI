The ORG delivers its judgment at a public hearing ( Article NORP DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG has ruled that the procedure before the ORG did not infringe the rights of the defence in that it ruled on the basis of documents without informing the parties of the accredited doctor \u2019s opinion ( PERSON . soc .

In its DATE report ( p. CARDINAL , section on suggestions for legislative or regulatory amendments ) , published in DATE , ORG expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the procedure before the ORG with the guarantees of the right to a fair trial enshrined in LAW , in respect of :", "- the composition of the tribunal , whose members include civil servants who are part of a hierarchy , in violation of the right to an independant and impartial tribunal ;", "- the fact that it rules solely on the basis of documents , in violation of the principle of the public character of proceedings ;", "- the prior examination of the file by an accredited doctor , which circumvents the adversarial principle if the opinion is not communicated to the parties . In this connection ORG considered that even if the accredited doctor did not have expert status , the communication of his opinion to a doctor the interested party has been invited to designate should be envisaged .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments on DATE ( ORG . no . CARDINAL ; DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , ORG , sitting as a full court , departed from its case - law and found the procedure applicable before the ORG incompatible with LAW CARDINAL points singled out by ORG in its above - mentioned report .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions on CARDINAL of these cases , for the attention of ORG , Advocate - General P. ORG explained , inter alia :", "\u201c It is evident not only that the civil servants who sit on the ORG enjoy no specific guarantee as to their freedom of decision in the discharge of their judicial duties , but that the minister in charge of the administrative entity to which they belong has control over ORG through a directorate of his ministry and the regional directors of health and social affairs , who themselves , on behalf of the ORG and under the authority of the regional ORG , have control over the primary social security funds and the areas they cover .", "However , the decisions challenged before the ORG are decisions of the social security funds , and these funds are more often than not also parties to the proceedings . ...", "The fact that these civil servants are appointed for unlimited periods and that their judicial activities may be terminated at any time makes their situation more precarious and adds concern about their independence to the doubts about their impartiality .", "... As regards the other categories of members of the ORG , their appointment by the Minister responsible for ORG or the fact that the minister draws up the list from which they are chosen , even if the trade organisations do make proposals DATE leaving the possibility for the minister to make choices DATE , the fact that they are all appointed for an unlimited period , which means that the minister can remove them at any time , including judges , who are therefore not irremovable , with the exception of those representing employees and employers , who are appointed for DATE but whose term of office the minister may or may not renew , and the lack of guarantees in the discharge of their judicial duties are all factors that undermine the independence and impartiality of this tribunal .", "... What clearly applies to the composition of the ORG also applies to how it operates and could also be raised of the tribunal \u2019s own motion .", "Thus does the national court actually operate with the compulsory assistance , in every case , of an \u201c accredited doctor \u201d and a rapporteur , who is generally not a member of the tribunal : however , not only are these collaborators remunerated on a case - by - case basis , from the budget of the Ministry in charge of ORG , but they are chosen from lists drawn up by the same ministry , and most of the rapporteurs are active or retired members of the ministry \u2019s staff , or active or former employees of the social security funds ...", "Furthermore , Article R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Social Security Code provides for the minister responsible for ORG \u2013 whose powers over this court are to all appearances already great \u2013 to be able to submit written or oral observations to the ORG . This provision \u2013 which he does not seem to have made use of in any of the cases before you \u2013 is clearly an infringement of equality of arms , and therefore of the right to a fair trial and LAW . In particular , this possibility of presenting oral observations means that the minister must be informed of the hearing and familiar with the accredited doctor \u2019s opinion and the report , CARDINAL \u201c privileges \u201d denied to the other parties ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

By virtue of Article NORP CARDINAL - CARDINAL the procedure for communicating memorials and documents remains unchanged and is the responsibility of the secretariat of the tribunal ( see old rules , above ) .
