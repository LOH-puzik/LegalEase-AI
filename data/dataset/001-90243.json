On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant .", "In DATE the police also received complaints from other minors , who alleged that on various occasions the applicant had extorted from them or robbed them of petty cash and various objects , such as an ice - cream cone or a school bag . Having found out about these complaints , the applicant \u2019s mother , cousin , and , according to contested accounts of some minors , his advocate , visited the ORG families . On several occasions the applicant \u2019s mother returned to the families the amounts of money claimed to have been stolen by the applicant .

In DATE the applicant was further charged with hooliganism . In particular , he was accused that in DATE jointly with ORG he had beaten ORG in a public place .", "During the pre - trial investigation , CARDINAL minors , including those whose parents had attempted to retract their complaints in DATE , testified that the applicant had extorted from them or robbed them of their money and possessions .", "On DATE the applicant and ORG were committed to LOC ( ORG \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 ORG \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456 , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for trial .", "On DATE ORG allowed the requests submitted by minors FAC , GPE , GPE and the parents of GPE , GPE , ORG and ORG to hold hearings in camera , in view of pressure purportedly exerted on them by the applicant \u2019s entourage to retract their allegations .", "In the course of the hearings , ORG questioned PERSON and his father , who confirmed their earlier testimonies that the applicant had taken MONEY from GPE and given him some forged bills .", "CARDINAL other minors ( ORG , GPE , ORG , ORG and GPE ) confirmed their testimonies given to the police concerning petty extortion and robbery . ORG , GPE and ORG corroborated each other \u2019s statements concerning some of the episodes . The parents of GPE , ORG and GPE corroborated the statements of their children and explained that the children had earlier complained to them on several occasions about the applicant \u2019s conduct . The mother of ORG , the seventh minor , who was absent from the courtroom , spoke before the court in support of her son \u2019s testimony given to the police concerning the theft of a school bag and several episodes of petty extortion . Those individuals who had earlier attempted to retract their accusations against the applicant contended before the court that they had done so under pressure from the applicant \u2019s entourage .", "The judge further announced that another CARDINAL minors , who had been questioned by the investigation under pseudonyms , had lodged requests to be dispensed from attendance at the hearings for fear of reprisals by the applicant \u2019s entourage and that in these requests they had confirmed their earlier statements given to the police . The judge then read out the depositions given before the police by these minors , and other documentary evidence . According to the case file materials , the applicant , represented by the lawyer , did not question or challenge these testimonies before FAC .", "Further , the ORG heard GPE ( the applicant \u2019s co - accused on the charge of hooliganism ) and CARDINAL other witnesses , who gave details predominantly concerning the beating of GPE and GPE \u2019s character .", "On DATE ORG found that the applicant was guilty of CARDINAL counts of robbery and CARDINAL counts of extortion in respect of the injured parties who had been examined in the courtroom .

The court further found it unnecessary to add up the CARDINAL full terms and determined the final punishment as DATE imprisonment . However , in view of the applicant \u2019s age , other personal circumstances and the nature of his offences , the applicant was released from punishment subject to CARDINAL years\u2019 probation .", "The applicant , represented by a lawyer , appealed , seeking to be acquitted . He pleaded that the case had been falsified by the police in retaliation for his mother \u2019s complaints that he had been beaten during the first questioning , in DATE . Hence the victims who gave evidence against the applicant at the trial had done so under threats from the police to institute proceedings against them for their own transgressions , as they were all on the police juvenile offenders\u2019 register . The episodes in respect of the anonymous victims had been completely falsified . Moreover , the testimony of GPE , one of these alleged victims , was improbable , as on the date of the purported offence the applicant had not attended the school in which he had allegedly committed it . No specific challenge was raised to the accounts of events contained in the testimonies of other absentee victims . The applicant further challenged various details of the testimonies obtained during the hearings as unreliable . Lastly , he complained that the hearings had been held in camera .", "On DATE the ORG ( GPE \u0441\u0443\u0434 ORG \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456 ) upheld the judgment of DATE , having found no violation , in that the hearing had been held in camera and that the case file materials contained sufficient evidence to find the applicant guilty of repeated extortion and robbery of minors .", "The applicant appealed in cassation before ORG of GPE , raising essentially the same arguments as before ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "On DATE the applicant and his mother instituted civil proceedings against the Kamyanets - Podilsky Police Department , seeking monetary compensation for the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage allegedly suffered as a result of their unlawful actions when investigating the applicant \u2019s case .

On DATE his appeal was dismissed by ORG .", "On DATE the applicant was taken by police officers to the police department , where he was questioned in connection with the case above .

No injuries were recorded . According to the applicant , the expert refused to record injuries .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a doctor , who established that he was suffering from cerebral concussion , injury to the left kidney and hepatitis . It was only then that the applicant told his mother that he had been beaten by the police officers .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers for the alleged ill - treatment of her son .", "On DATE the Kamyanets - Podilsky Prosecutor \u2019s Office decided not to bring any charges against the police officers . It found , inter alia , that there was no evidence that the officers had committed the alleged offences , other than the applicant \u2019s own allegations . Furthermore , regard being had to the lapse of time between the interrogation and the date on which the injuries were discovered by doctors , the injuries could have been sustained elsewhere .", "On DATE the ORG annulled this decision and ordered the applicant to undergo an additional medical assessment and additional measures to be taken to find possible witnesses .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother withdrew her complaint .

He found that the applicant had no injuries at the time of the assessment . As regards the injuries recorded at DATE , it was not possible to determine whether the applicant \u2019s version of events was probable , on account of the lapse of time between the purported ill - treatment and his first application to a doctor and the further lapse of time before the present assessment .", "In light of the above , on DATE PERSON Prosecutor \u2019s Office dismissed the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s request for the institution of criminal proceedings .", "According to Section CARDINAL , repeated robbery is punishable by DATE imprisonment .", "According to Section CARDINAL , repeated extortion is punishable by DATE imprisonment .", "According to LAW , an injured party in the criminal proceedings may request security measures to prevent a real threat of harm to his life , limb or property .

The judge in this event is obliged to disclose his testimony to the defendant and to give him an opportunity to comment on it . The defendant and other parties to the proceedings may ask questions of the witness ( injured party ) , which are answered in the absence of the defendant .", "Further relevant provisions of the LAW concerning the rights of defence in respect of examination of witnesses can be found in the admissibility decision in the case of PERSON v.
