He is represented before the ORG by Mr O. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant used to be employed by the municipality of ORG as a civil servant in charge of a division ( ty\u00f6keskus , arbetscentralen ) subordinated to ORG ( perusturvalautakunta , bastrygghetsn\u00e4mnden ) . The applicant was , among other things , in charge of purchasing within that division . His post was , however , abolished and he was given notice on DATE due to economic reasons and a reorganisation of the organic chart of municipal staff . On DATE ORG confirmed his dismissal .", "The applicant appealed to ORG of Oulu ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , arguing , among other things , that the decision to dismiss him was unlawful , since he should instead have been given the post as head of purchasing , which was vacant at that time and which he had applied for . ORG , finding that the applicant should have been given another post within the municipality , overturned the decision on DATE .", "However , the decision by ORG was overturned , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , by ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) on DATE . It found that there were no vacant posts available to the applicant as the municipality in DATE had decided not to fill the post as head of purchasing . Thus , the dismissal of the applicant became final .", "No oral hearing was held at any time of the proceedings , nor did the applicant request that such a hearing be held . He was represented by counsel at least before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
