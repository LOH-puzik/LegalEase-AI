AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr C. PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant got married . He and his wife lived together until DATE .", "After the applicant had moved out of his wife \u2019s house , he had an intention to commence divorce proceedings . However , approximately at this time , he found out that his wife was pregnant . Believing that he was not the father of the yet unborn child , in DATE he requested ORG not to list him as the biological father in the birth certificate upon the child \u2019s birth .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s wife gave birth to a daughter . Despite the applicant \u2019s earlier request , based on a statutory presumption of paternity , ORG issued a birth certificate mentioning the applicant as the child \u2019s father . As the applicant and his wife were separated and no longer lived together as a family , on DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay child support to his wife .", "The applicant then instituted civil proceedings , disputing his paternity and asking the court to strike out his name as the child \u2019s father from the relevant civil status documents . He claimed that , on TIME after his wedding , he discovered that his wife was not a virgin as he expected . He was shocked by this and refused to continue the sexual intercourse with her . He further maintained that thereafter he had never had any sexual intercourse with his wife and that the child had been conceived in an adulterous relation with another person .", "After a preliminary hearing , on DATE the Ali - Bayramli District Court ordered a biological expert examination to determine the paternity . On DATE , an expert of ORG issued an opinion on the applicant \u2019s paternity . The expert performed an ORG blood group test by comparing the applicant \u2019s , the child \u2019s and the mother \u2019s blood types and , based on its results , concluded that the applicant \u201c could be the child \u2019s father \u201d . The expert noted that a DNA test would yield a more precise conclusion , but the expert did not possess adequate medical inventory to perform such a test .", "Relying on the results of the ORG blood group test , the fact that the applicant and his wife lived together at the time of the child \u2019s conception , as well as the witness testimony concerning the relations between the applicant and his wife , on DATE the FAC dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "The applicant filed an appeal , arguing that ORG judgment was arbitrary , because the expert opinion used by the court did not provide a definite conclusion and because the results of the ORG test could not be considered as a reliable source for identifying the child \u2019s biological father . He further argued that only the DNA test could provide a conclusive answer to the question of paternity .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first instance court \u2019s judgment , holding that the applicant failed to substantiate his arguments or present any new evidence proving that he was not the child \u2019s father . In its judgment , the court was silent about the applicant \u2019s request for a DNA test . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation , on DATE ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim .", "In DATE the applicant filed an additional cassation complaint with the President of ORG , requesting that the proceedings be reopened . On DATE the President rejected this request .", "However , in DATE the proceedings were reopened and the case was referred to the Plenum of the ORG based on an application by the President of ORG . On DATE the ORG found that ORG breached the procedural requirements by ignoring the applicant \u2019s request to order a DNA test . It further noted that such a test would constitute the \u201c principal type of evidence \u201d in this case . The ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE and the related judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG .", "On DATE ORG instructed ORG and Pathologic Anatomy Department of ORG to conduct a DNA test of the applicant , his former wife and her child . Despite having been notified about the time and place of the DNA testing , the applicant failed to appear for the test without any good reason . According to the Government , the applicant received several such notifications .", "Furthermore , although they had been informed about the time and place of the appeal hearing , neither the applicant nor his former wife appeared for the hearing . In such circumstances , on DATE ORG noted that it had been impossible to obtain DNA evidence due to the applicant \u2019s failure to cooperate . It therefore found that the parties ( and in particular , the applicant ) were not interested in obtaining new evidence that would enable the court to reach a different conclusion . For these reasons , ORG again upheld the Ali - Bayramli District Court \u2019s original judgment of DATE .", "No cassation appeal was filed against ORG judgment of DATE within the statutory DATE period for filing cassation appeals .", "\u201c [ T]he ORG shall be the highest judicial authority with regard to civil ... , criminal , administrative and other disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the general and specialised courts .", "ORG [ is ] a court of cassation instance ... \u201d", "\u201c The Plenum of the Supreme Court shall be composed of the President , Vice Presidents and judges of ORG , the President of ORG , the President of ORG and the President of ORG of GPE . ...", "The Plenum of ORG ... shall , in the manner established by law , review cases under the procedure of additional cassation ... , on submission of the President of ORG , or pursuant to a protest by ORG or appeal by the defendant ... \u201d", "\u201c The President of ORG ... shall , in cases and under the procedure provided by law , submit cassation - instance decisions for the review of the Plenum of ORG ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
