On DATE he was arrested by NORP police in GPE , GPE , on suspicion of having made false accusations against a third person .

He described the conditions of his detention in prison no . CARDINAL as follows . On DATE he was placed in a cell measuring QUANTITY . m with CARDINAL other people , which left very little space for each detainee . In the absence of any work or other activities , he had nothing to do and spent most of his time in the cell .", "CARDINAL . No bedding was given to the applicant and he had to ask his relatives to bring him some . The same was true of items of personal hygiene . He had to wear the same clothes he had been wearing when he was admitted to the prison , since no clothes were provided by the prison administration .", "CARDINAL . Water from a single tap was available during DATE but not at TIME , and owing to the number of detainees in the cell it was not always possible to have access to it . Food was scarce and of very poor quality . The library contents were old and there were no reading materials about the Convention . The applicant also claimed that he had been given insufficient medical treatment in both detention facilities .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the space available to the applicant in various cells of prisons no . CARDINAL and DATE always exceeded CARDINAL sq.m . In particular , in prison no . CARDINAL he was held in a detention block for working prisoners . The first cell he was detained in measured CARDINAL sq.m and accommodated CARDINAL people .

Again , living space was often restricted in some of the dormitories , a situation which was partially alleviated by an open - door policy within the sections .", "CARDINAL . Except in the Lipcani Re - education ORG , where the efforts made in this respect regard are to be highlighted ... the quantity and quality of ORG food everywhere is a source of grave concern . The delegation was inundated with complaints regarding the absence of meat and dairy products . The findings of the delegation , regarding both stock levels of food and the menus , confirm the credibility of these complaints . The delegation \u2019s findings also confirm that in certain places ( Colonies CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) the food served was repulsive and virtually inedible ( for instance , insects and vermin were present ) . This is hardly surprising , given the general state of the kitchens and their modest equipment .", "The NORP authorities have always claimed financial difficulties in ensuring that prisoners receive adequate food . However , the ORG reiterates that this is a fundamental requirement of life that must be ensured by the ORG to persons in its care , and that nothing can exonerate it from such responsibility .
