On an unknown date in DATE the applicants wrote a letter to the highest authorities of the ORG , namely ORG , the President of ORG and ORG , while the procedure for the appointment of a director of the ORG \u2019s multi - ethnic public radio station was still pending . In the letter , they voiced their concerns regarding the procedure for the appointment of a director of the ORG \u2019s multi - ethnic public radio station . They criticised the authorities for having disregarded the principle of proportional representation of ethnic communities in the public service of ORG set out in LOC . In this connection they stated :", "\u201c ... We acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put into creating a multi - ethnic radio ... Unfortunately , it appears that there was a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture . The panel for the selection of the director [ of the radio ] was created in contravention of the Statute of Br\u010dko District . It is composed of CARDINAL NORP members , CARDINAL NORP and one PERSON . Thus , yet again , the ( BD ) Statute , which requires proportional representation of the CARDINAL constituent peoples in public institutions , was disregarded . ORG established several cases of non - compliance with this principle regarding employment of staff in the public sector , including the BD radio , to the disadvantage of ORG and NORP , and requested that the Governor correct this imbalance . Unfortunately , nothing has been done to correct this . That this is true is confirmed by the unofficial information that PERSON was proposed for the position of the radio \u2019s director by the NORP members of the ( selection ) panel , who are in the majority , although the former director was PERSON . This proposal is unacceptable , all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The letter continued as follows :", "\u201c According to our information ( na\u0161im informacijama ) , the lady in question", "( CARDINAL ) NORP stated in an interview published in \u2018 ORG , commenting on the destruction of FAC in GPE , that NORP were not a people ( ORG nisu narod ) , that they did not possess culture and that , accordingly , destroying FAC could not be seen as destruction of cultural monuments ,", "( CARDINAL ) as an employee of the BD radio demonstratively tore to pieces on the radio \u2019s LOC ( demonstrativno kidala ) the calendar showing the schedule of religious services during DATE ,", "( CARDINAL ) on the radio \u2019s LOC covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of ORG ,", "( CARDINAL ) as an editor of the cultural programme on the BD radio banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value .", "We firmly believe that the above - described acts absolutely disqualify PERSON as a candidate for the position of director of the multi - ethnic ORG of GPE and that a PERSON should be appointed to that [ radio \u2019s director ] position , which would be in compliance with the Statute of [ BD ] and the need to rectify the ethnic imbalance regarding employment in the public sector .", "We hope that you will react appropriately to our letter ...", "In the absence of any action on your part , we will be forced to address the public ( obratiti se javnosti ) and [ to contact ] international and other competent representatives . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards , still in DATE , the letter was published in CARDINAL different DATE newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought civil defamation proceedings claiming that in the above letter the applicants had made defamatory statements which had damaged her reputation and discredited her as a person and a professional journalist .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the first - instance court admitted a considerable volume of evidence , including oral statements from CARDINAL witnesses ( apparently all employees of the BD public radio ) regarding the veracity of the CARDINAL allegations contained in the ORG letter ; it also admitted oral statements from the plaintiff and from GPE and GPE , the members and statutory representatives of CARDINAL of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . As described in the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON stated that she had learned of the letter shortly after it had been sent by the applicants , but that she did not know who had given it to the media . She confirmed that she had removed from the wall in the premises of the radio station the calendar showing the schedule of religious services during DATE , but explained that the wall had been used only for work - related announcements . She denied that she had torn up the calendar . As to the coat of arms of GPE and GPE , she stated that an invitation card with the coat of arms of PERSON had been placed in a corner of the coat of arms of GPE , but that the latter had not been covered . Lastly , she denied that she had banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka . She argued that all those matters had been taken out of context , that her career as a journalist had been thwarted and that she had been concerned about her professional future .", "CARDINAL . O.H. confirmed that he had participated in the preparation of the letter and stated that he had found out about the information contained therein from employees of the radio station who had asked him for help . There had been no intention to publish the letter . For that reason , it had been sent to the authorities personally . He did not know how the letter had reached the media .", "CARDINAL . S.C. stated that most of the information had been brought to his attention by ORG The letter had been sent to the authorities personally . Their intention had not been to publish the letter in the media . That was why they had indicated in the letter that it concerned allegations and not established facts . Their aim had been to draw the attention of the authorities to errors of GPE , who had been a serious candidate for the post of director of the BD radio .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE , ORG Instance dismissed PERSON \u2019s action and ordered her to publish the judgment at her expense and to reimburse the trial costs of the applicants . It found that the applicants could not be held responsible because there had been no evidence that they had published the letter in the media . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is clear that the GPE letter was addressed personally ( upu\u0107eno na ruke ) to the Governor , to the President of the ORG and to the Supervisor for GPE ... and it was not sent to the media ... The court established that the aim of the letter was to bring the attention of the authorities to ( these ) issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information , and not to publish unverified information .", "Having examined the articles published in the media , the court concludes that none of them was published by [ the applicants ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On appeal by GPE , ORG quashed that judgment on CARDINAL DATE and decided to hold a new hearing .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG PERSON reiterated that the CARDINAL statements specified above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had contained untrue and defamatory allegations whose aim had been to portray her as a nationalist and accordingly disqualify her for the post for which she had applied . Not only had she not been appointed to the post , but the letter had had other long - term negative consequences for her .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued that they had lacked capacity to be sued because they had not sent the letter to the media and , accordingly , had not expressed or disseminated in public any defamatory statements in respect of the appellant . The letter had been sent to the authorities . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed that argument and stated that", "\u201c ... a person \u2019s reputation can be damaged if someone expresses or disseminates to other people untrue facts or allegations about the past , knowledge , skills or anything else ( and he or she knew or ought to have known that those facts or allegations were untrue ) . For these reasons , the court dismisses the respondents\u2019 arguments that one can be held responsible for defamation only if there was a public announcement or dissemination or publication of ( such ) statements in the media . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants further argued that PERSON had been a public servant and that by having taken part in the competition for the position of radio director she had become a public figure . Relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court held as follows :", "\u201c ... even if the aggrieved party is a public servant or a candidate for a post in a public body and he or she is generally perceived as having an important influence on public issues of political interest ... ( a defendant ) is to be held liable for defamation if he knew that a statement was false or negligently disregarded its inaccuracy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Referring to the first part of the letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG did not go beyond noting that it contained value judgments for which no responsibility could be attributed to the applicants LAW . It further quoted the CARDINAL statements contained in the letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and held that these \u201c concerned statements of fact which the defendants were required to prove . \u201d In this connection it re - examined GPE , GPE and the witnesses who had already given oral evidence before the first - instance court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that GPE and GPE , both employees of the ORG public radio , had visited CARDINAL of the applicants in order to discuss PERSON \u2019s behaviour in the workplace . On that occasion R.S. had told PERSON that during DATE PERSON had detached from the wall in the radio \u2019s premises the calendar showing the schedule of religious services . The court noted that the wall had been used for work - related announcements . It also indicated that , at the relevant time , another text , which had not been work - related , had been posted on the wall . PERSON ( sound manager in the radio ) had told PERSON that on CARDINAL occasion GPE had asked him to explain why sevdalinka had been broadcasted during the time reserved in the programme for another type of music . He confirmed that she had removed the Ramadan religious calendar from the wall .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting held shortly afterwards , PERSON shared the information received from GPE and GPE with the other respondents . On that occasion one of the respondents had referred to a newspaper article and the alleged statement of GPE regarding NORP and the destruction of FAC . An allegation had been also made that PERSON had covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of PERSON . GPE had confirmed having heard people speaking about that in the city .", "CARDINAL . After analysing the statements of the witnesses and the respondents , the court found that the facts reported in the letter regarding the calendar of religious services during DATE and the broadcasting of sevdalinka were untrue , since \u201c the letter obviously did not contain what ( GPE and GPE ) had said about the appellant and her behaviour regarding the religious calendar and the broadcasting of sevdalinka \u201d . Noting that the allegation that PERSON was the author of the statement published in the newspaper was untrue , the court stated :", "\u201c ... on the basis of GPE \u2019s statement [ the court establishes ] that at the meeting that preceded the preparation of the letter a distinguished member of a [ respondent ] had informed those attending the meeting that the appellant had given a statement to the newspaper , whose contents were identical to the contents of the letter . On subsequent verification [ GPE ] established that such a text had been published , but that the appellant had not been the author ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further stated that :", "\u201c The respondents also did not prove the truthfulness of the allegation that in her office the appellant had covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of PERSON . On the basis of evidence given by the witnesses examined at the trial ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) , [ the court ] established that the appellant had put an invitation card , which bore the coat of arms of PERSON , in the corner of the coat of arms of GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the court stated :", "\u201c By the letter sent to ORG , the President of ORG and the Governor of the BD , the respondents damaged the plaintiff \u2019s reputation and honour in the place in which she lives and works . They did so by expressing and disseminating to the above persons facts about the appellant \u2019s behaviour , actions and statements which they knew or ought to have known were false ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the applicants to inform ORG , the President of ORG and ORG within DATE that they retracted the letter , failing which they would have to pay jointly the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages to GPE They were further ordered to give the judgment to the BD radio and television and to CARDINAL newspapers for publication at the ORG own expense . As regards the calculation of the amount of non - pecuniary damages , the court stated :", "\u201c When assessing the amount of damages , namely , just satisfaction to be awarded to the appellant , [ the court ] took into consideration that the impugned facts had been mentioned in the article published in the media ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a request with ORG for enforcement of the above judgment . On DATE ORG issued a writ of execution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants paid the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL ( inclusive of interest and enforcement costs ) in enforcement of the judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG closed the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to ORG seeking protection of their rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression had been \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d and concluded that there had been no violation of Article II/CARDINAL.h ) of the LAW of GPE or LAW . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . At the outset ORG notes that the appellants did not deny that their liability for defamation was based on LAW DATE and that , therefore , the interference with the right [ to freedom of expression ] protected by LAW was prescribed by law ...", "CARDINAL . The impugned judgment was delivered in civil defamation proceedings initiated by the respondent against the appellants ... accordingly , the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the \u201c reputation or rights of others \u201d .", "CARDINAL . What remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of was \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 ...", "CARDINAL . With regard to the existence of a \u2018 pressing social ORG , ORG observes that the impugned ( court ) decisions concern the letter which the appellants sent to the authorities of the ORG and the ORG casting the plaintiff ( GPE ) in a negative light . ORG considered it to be defamation because ( the case ) concerned statements whose veracity could be verified ... ORG notes that ORG qualified the impugned statements in the letter as statements of fact and not as value judgments . ORG also considers that they are to be regarded statements of fact which should be proved . The appellants failed to do so , as they did not make reasonable efforts to verify the truthfulness of [ those ] statements of fact before [ reporting ] , but merely made [ those statements ] .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considers that ORG established without doubt that the impugned factual statements about PERSON were false and that the appellants were liable for defamation . From the submissions of the CARDINAL witnesses , from whom the appellants received the information presented in the letter ( concerning the part of the letter in which it was stated that PERSON \u2018 made a point of removing from the wall ( and tore to pieces ) the calendar with the schedule of religious services during DATE and as the editor of the entertainment programme banned the broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value\u2019 ) , ORG established that there was an evident inconsistency between what had been said to the appellants and what they had reported in the letter . Furthermore , the statement in the impugned letter that PERSON had given an interview concerning the destruction of mosques was refuted by another witness , who submitted that subsequent verification had revealed that PERSON had not been the author of the said interview . Finally , the appellants failed to prove the veracity of the allegations that PERSON had covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of ORG . In view of the above , in the present case the public interest that permits reporting on alleged irregularities in the conduct of public officials can not be based on manifestly untrue factual allegations which impugn their reputation [ and ] which can not be regarded as criticism that they ought to tolerate in view of their function . Accordingly , the court considers that ORG correctly concluded that there was \u2018 a pressing social ORG in the present case [ for the interference with the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression ] .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG notes that ORG awarded non - pecuniary damages to GPE because her reputation was affected by the untrue statements made in the impugned letter ... ORG has already stated in its previous case - law that a person \u2019s reputation forms part of his or her personal identity and psychological integrity ...", "...", "CARDINAL . The appellants ... failed to verify the impugned statements beforehand as was their duty . ORG established that the appellants had damaged PERSON \u2019s reputation by making untrue allegations which caused her mental distress ... When deciding on the claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage and its amount , ORG took into account the purpose of those damages and the rule that it should not favour aspirations that were incompatible with its nature and social purpose .", "CARDINAL . [ T]he ORG considers that the measure imposed on the appellants in the present case was proportionate to the aim pursued ... The court further considers that ORG did not go beyond its discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage ... [ T]he ORG finds that the reasons ORG gave were \u2018 ORG and \u2018 LOC within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , ORG considers that the interference with the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was \u2018 necessary in a democratic FAC and that , therefore , there has been no violation of Article II/CARDINAL.h ) of LAW or LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court \u2019s decision was served on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . According to TIME of a meeting of ORG radio station dated DATE , there were CARDINAL candidates for the post of the radio \u2019s director , CARDINAL of whom was ORG decided to extend the mandate of the acting director of the radio given that \u201c due to political pressure and repeated voting \u201d no decision could be made in respect of either of the candidates ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
