{"ITEMID": "001-5067", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "FONTANESI v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is a practising lawyer by profession and presents his own case to the ORG .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "", "In DATE criminal proceedings were instituted before ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) against the applicant under LAW ( Finanzstrafgesetz ) . He was suspected of having evaded taxes exceeding MONEY ( ORG ) DATE .", "On DATE , upon a warrant issued by ORG , a search of the applicant \u2019s law office was carried out , at which CARDINAL representatives of the Bar ( Rechtsanwaltskammer ) were present .", "In DATE ORG ( PERSON ) was informed about the criminal proceedings pending against the applicant .", "On DATE ORG ( NORP ) of ORG appointed an Investigating Commissioner ( PERSON ) , to whom the applicant submitted observations on DATE .", "On DATE ORG requested the applicant to file observations as regards a possible interlocutory measure ( einstweilige ORG ) against him .", "On DATE ORG imposed an interlocutory measure under section CARDINAL subparagraph CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW DATE ( ORG ) upon the applicant , withdrawing his right to represent people before ORG , its subordinate courts , the corresponding prosecution authorities , and ORG . ORG held that there was cause to fear that the observance of the applicant \u2019s professional duties would not be sufficiently safeguarded if the applicant represented his clients before a court or authority where criminal proceedings were pending against him . In addition , such representation would prejudice the reputation of the profession . It stated that the measure would be in force at the most until the termination of the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant . Further , he was informed that the measure had immediate effect .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( PERSON Berufungs- und ORG ) . Alleging that the contested decision was unlawful , unconstitutional and in breach of ORG , he particularly complained that the imposition of the interlocutory measure was not justified since it had not been taken immediately , but DATE after the introduction of criminal proceedings against him . In this respect , he pointed out that CARDINAL ORG representatives had been present during the search of his law office on DATE , and that ORG should , therefore , have been aware of the charges against him . The applicant further claimed that ORG had failed to indicate that he had , during DATE , actually prejudiced his clients or the reputation of the profession .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that ORG had apparently failed to inform the Bar about the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant . The latter had only learned about these proceedings in DATE . ORG found that the requirements laid down in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE for imposing an interlocutory measure were met : Criminal proceedings concerning charges of tax evasion of more than ORG CARDINAL were pending against the applicant and , in view of the serious nature of these accusations and the ensuing disciplinary offence , the measure was necessary in order to protect the interests of potential litigants and the reputation of the profession . It was quite obvious that the applicant could not , in full independence , discharge his professional duties before ORG , which was conducting preliminary investigations against him , or its subordinate courts , the respective prosecution authorities , or ORG for GPE which was carrying out the underlying tax assessment proceedings . Moreover , it was harmful to the reputation of the profession if a lawyer appeared before the same court once as an accused and then as counsel .", "Further , as regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that the interlocutory measure had been taken belatedly , ORG observed that section CARDINAL of LAW DATE did not specify any time - limits . ORG could , therefore , impose such measures as long as the criminal proceedings were pending and the above conditions were satisfied . The applicant had failed to show any new circumstances indicating that a considerable prejudice was no longer to be feared . It was irrelevant whether any clients or the profession had actually suffered any prejudice , since the imposition of the interlocutory measure only required that there was reason to fear that such prejudice would occur if the applicant continued to act before the respective courts or authorities .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) . He claimed , in particular , that the disciplinary authorities had failed properly to investigate the facts as regards the institution of criminal proceedings against him . He submitted that the Bar had , at the latest on DATE , become aware that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him . The interlocutory measure , since it had only been imposed in DATE , was therefore arbitrary and infringed the principle of non - discrimination ( Gleichheitsgrundsatz ) , as well as LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It confirmed the finding of ORG that section CARDINAL of LAW DATE allowed ORG to take interlocutory measures as long as criminal proceedings were pending . To ensure the principle of non - discrimination , ORG was not free to decide , without giving objective reasons , whether or not and when it imposed an interlocutory measure . However , the applicant had failed to substantiate that ORG had acted arbitrarily in the present case . The sole fact that a measure could have been taken earlier did not render the decision arbitrary . Further , the applicant had failed to show that the proceedings , as such , had lasted unreasonably long .", "On DATE ORG of the Vienna Bar decided to open disciplinary proceedings against the applicant on the ground that there were reasons to suspect him of having evaded income tax DATE , in an amount to be specified in the further proceedings .", "On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) at FAC , referring to a report of ORG , found that the amount of taxes allegedly evaded by the applicant was below ORG CARDINAL . Therefore , the prosecution of the tax offences did not fall within the competence of the courts .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant and informed the Bar accordingly .", "On DATE the Bar lifted the interim measure of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the conditions for upholding it were no longer met , given that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINAL of the Disciplinary Act DATE ( Disziplinarstatut DATE ) deals with interlocutory measures .", "", "Paragraph CARDINAL provides that ORG may impose an interlocutory measure on a lawyer , inter alia , if criminal proceedings are pending against him and if the measure , having regard to the nature and severity of the disciplinary offence at issue , is necessary on the ground that there are reasons to fear considerable prejudice either to the interests of potential litigants or to the reputation of the profession .", "Paragraph CARDINAL enumerates the interlocutory measures . In the case of a practising lawyer , they include the withdrawal of the right to represent people before specified courts or administrative authorities , or before courts and administrative authorities in general ( subparagraph CARDINAL ( b ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
