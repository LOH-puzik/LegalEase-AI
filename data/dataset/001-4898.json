GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is a NORP national and resident in Triel - sur - Seine . He is a technician by profession . In the proceedings before the ORG , he is represented by Me N. Creuzillet , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant married a NORP national in GPE , and CARDINAL children were born in wedlock in DATE and DATE .", "Apparently in DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife separated from the applicant and returned to GPE with the CARDINAL children . She instituted divorce proceedings with ORG ( ORG ) . Moreover , divorce proceedings were instituted with the GPE tribunal de grande instance . In DATE the Memmingen ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claim under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( PERSON \u00fcber die zivilrechtlichen GPE internationaler GPE ) that the children be returned to GPE . Upon appeals lodged by the competent ORG and the applicant \u2019s wife , his claims was dismissed by ORG ( Zivilsenate ) of ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) in DATE . In DATE the Memmingen ORG granted the applicant \u2019s wife custody of the children pending the spouses\u2019 separation . However , in DATE ORG decided that the children should live at the applicant \u2019s place of residence . In DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance granted the applicant custody of the children .", "In DATE the applicant applied with ORG for a right of access ( ORG ) to his children in DATE and during DATE , as well as a regular access during DATE periods , which he intended to spend with them in GPE . He also requested information about his children . He further applied for an interim injunction .", "In these court proceedings , both spouses were represented by counsel .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction . The defendant had accepted his right to information .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for access . The court observed that the applicant wished to spend holidays with his children in GPE , while the defendant , suggesting supervised visits , objected to uncontrolled access . The court considered that , despite his assurances , there was a real risk that the applicant would not return the children at the end of the holidays and thereby create a danger for their well - being . In this respect , the court had regard to the course of the spouses\u2019 separation and divorce proceedings . Having regard to an expert opinion prepared in the context of the custody proceedings , it noted that the children had a very good relationship with their mother and that they were fully integrated at their place of residence . Moreover , given the legal situation in GPE , the applicant \u2019s assurances that he would return the children at the end of the holidays were not sufficient . In this respect , the court noted that he was not prepared to accept that the children were living with the defendant and that she had custody .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court , referring to section DATE of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) , confirmed that granting the applicant a right of access including the right to take the children to GPE was - for the time being - contrary to the children \u2019s well - being . The court noted that the applicant had expressly stated that he did not apply for access to his children in GPE ; and that this matter was not , therefore , at issue in the proceedings .", "", "Under section DATE of LAW , the parent not holding custody is entitled to have access to the child . This right of access may be suspended if such a measure is necessary in the best interest of the child .", "In this respect , ORG noted that the children , when questioned by a single judge in DATE , had indicated that they were only prepared to visit the applicant in GPE if accompanied by their mother . They feared to loose the security of their mother \u2019s presence . According to a psychological expert opinion of DATE , separating the children from their mother entailed a risk for their well - being .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( ORG ) . ORG considered that the constitutional complaint raised no issue of fundamental importance . In particular , the impugned court decisions did not disclose any discrimination against the applicant , but was reasoned by the risk that the applicant might separate the children from their mother . Moreover , the applicant had not been generally refused a right of access , but only in the concrete circumstances and having regard to the children \u2019s well - being . The possibility to visit the children in GPE was not excluded . The decision was served upon the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the GPE tribunal de grande instance , in a default judgment , had granted divorce . It had further decided that both parents had joint custody of the children and that the children should live with their mother . As regards access , it decided that , in case of disagreement between the parents , the applicant had a right of access to the children during all short school holidays and CARDINAL of the summer holidays ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
