He maintained that he was unable to give the special advocate any meaningful instructions of any kind .", "CARDINAL . PERSON handed down his judgment on DATE . This consisted of an open judgment and a closed judgment . PERSON found that the material disclosed to the applicant did not show reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had been or was involved in terrorism - related activity ; it was clear , however , that the material which had been disclosed to the court and to the special advocates showed more than reasonable grounds for that suspicion . He nonetheless found that the control order had to be quashed because , taken cumulatively , the restrictions in it amounted to a deprivation of liberty and thus violated LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Judgment in all the cases was given on DATE ( Secretary of ORG for ORG v. E and another [ DATE ] ORG DATE ) . The majority of ORG ( Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON and ORG ) held that , considered cumulatively , the restrictions amounted to a deprivation of liberty and had to be quashed , although Lord PERSON specified that a control order which confined the individual to his home for TIME or less , regardless of the severity of the other restrictions , would not amount to a deprivation of liberty . Lords PERSON and ORG dissented . A majority of their ORG , PERSON and PERSON ) therefore held that a control order which confined a person to a residence for TIME per day or less , even when coupled with other restrictions , did not amount to a deprivation of liberty under LAW . Their Lordships were unanimous in their view that the criminal limb of Article CARDINAL did not apply to control order proceedings , since the proceedings involved an assertion that a person was suspected of criminal activity , not that he was guilty of it . A majority ( Lords Bingham , PERSON and ORG , and ORG ) nonetheless held that , under the civil limb of DATE , if it were necessary to disclose material to a controlled person in order to afford them a fair hearing , then either disclosure had to be made or the material could not be relied upon . They further held that the use and contribution of the special advocates in the applicant \u2019s case could have been sufficient to afford him a fair hearing notwithstanding that none of the allegations and evidence relied upon against him was disclosed to him . In light of their conclusions , ORG reversed PERSON decision to quash control order ORG . Beyond their general observations on LAW , their Lordships made no specific finding as to whether LAW CARDINAL had been breached in the applicant \u2019s particular case and instead remitted this issue back to ORG for its consideration .", "CARDINAL .

He further found that that conclusion would apply to the pending proceedings concerning ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG appealed against those findings to ORG , which , on DATE and by a majority of CARDINAL to one , allowed the appeal . The majority found that there was no absolute rule that Article CARDINAL required the gist or essence of the allegations and evidence to be disclosed to the person subjected to a control order ( ORG and others v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . The applicant and CARDINAL other controlled persons whose cases had been heard by ORG were given leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE he was informed that , on DATE , the President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated had decided that , since the case would be remitted to the lower courts for further consideration , it was appropriate to adjourn the ORG \u2019s own consideration of the application .", "CARDINAL .
