He was represented before the ORG by Mr A. S. Angelides , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Physical Education Teachers\u2019 Appointment List is used to fill vacancies for physical education teachers in the NORP public education system . The procedure for inclusion on the list is defined by section CARDINALB of ORG \u201c the PERSON of DATE \u201d ) and is as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The list is published every DATE . Those wishing to be included on the list must submit applications by DATE of DATE . ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) then examines the applications and ranks the candidates on the list .", "CARDINAL . A candidate \u2019s position on the list is determined with reference to various criteria . For first - time candidates , their position is determined first , by DATE they obtained their degree and then by other criteria which are set out in section CARDINALB(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON such as their class of degree , whether they undertook military service , whether they have obtained any additional post - graduate qualifications and so on . For candidates who were already included on the list in DATE , their position on the new list is determined first , by DATE they were first included on the list and , thereafter , by the other criteria set out in section CARDINALB(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a holder of a degree in Physical Education . He finished his studies in DATE , having previously deferred those studies in order to complete DATE months\u2019 compulsory military service . DATE , he applied for inclusion on the list . His request was accepted by ORG and he was included in the list for DATE . While it appears he did not apply for inclusion on the list DATE thereafter , in DATE he applied for inclusion in the DATE list .", "CARDINAL . The ORG published its DATE list on DATE . The applicant was placed CARDINALth . He then filed a recourse before a single judge of ORG ( revisional jurisdiction ) seeking the annulment of the ORG \u2019s decision to place him CARDINALth . He submitted that section CARDINALB of the PERSON of DATE was unconstitutional . According to the applicant , by determining ranking on the list by reference to DATE an applicant first applied to be on the list , section CARDINALB created indirect discrimination against male candidates . This was because , unlike their female counterparts , male candidates had to complete DATE months\u2019 military service prior to applying for registration . The effect of this was to provide a DATE head start in the rankings to women .", "CARDINAL . ORG at first instance upheld the applicant \u2019s recourse and annulled the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The Government , on behalf of ORG , appealed to ORG ( revisional appeal jurisdiction ) inter alia on the grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the recourse . This was because , in the ORG \u2019s submission , the applicant had failed to prove that he was challenging an executory administrative act since he had failed to establish an appropriate comparison between his position and the position of other candidates on the list . Thus , according to the ORG , the judgment of ORG at first instance was based on entirely hypothetical facts . The Government submitted that this was an issue which went to the core of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that the matter raised by the Government on appeal had not been raised in the first instance proceedings . In any case the applicant submitted that the ORG \u2019s submissions were groundless and should be rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s appeal . The court found that the applicant \u2019s challenge to the ORG \u2019s decision to rank him ORG on the list was not a valid recourse against an executory administrative act . This was because , by its nature , the ORG \u2019s ranking decision was an act of comparison between candidates : it did not merely affect the position of CARDINAL person on the list . The court could not annul the applicant \u2019s position on the list without automatically affecting the position of other candidates . In his recourse the applicant should have set out the reasons why he considered the ORG \u2019s decision was wrong and should have done so by a direct comparison with those candidates to whom the better rankings had been given . This would have given the other candidates an opportunity to set out their arguments or objections before the court and be heard , as required by the rules of natural justice . The fault in question went to the core of the recourse and could not be remedied .", "CARDINAL . For this reason , ORG did not examine the applicant \u2019s complaints that the PERSON was unconstitutional and discriminatory ; a decision on the admissibility of the recourse preceded such substantive issues .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW prohibits discrimination providing that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . All persons are equal before the law , the administration and justice , and are entitled to equal protection thereof and treatment thereby .", "CARDINAL . Every person shall enjoy all the rights and liberties provided for in this LAW without any direct or indirect discrimination against any person on the ground of his community , race , religion , language , sex , political or other convictions , national or social descent , birth , colour , wealth , social class , or on any ground whatsoever , unless there is express provision to the contrary in LAW .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW states that ORG has exclusive jurisdiction to :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL) ... decide on a recourse filed against a decision ... of an authority ... exercising executive or administrative functions when such a decision is contrary to the constitution or the law or is made in excess or abuse of the powers vested in such body , authority or person .", "( CARDINAL ) Such a recourse may be made by a person whose existing legitimate interest ... is adversely and directly affected by such decision , act or omission .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the above PERSON ( \u201c the DATE Law \u201d ) where relevant provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Men and women enjoy equal treatment , prohibiting any discrimination on the ground of gender \u2013", "( a ) In access to employment or to a job opening , permanent or temporary ... ;", "( b ) in the definition and implementation of the terms and conditions of employment , including the qualifications and other terms and conditions and placement criteria ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to case law of ORG , only \u201c executory administrative acts \u201d can be the subject of a recourse to ORG under Article CARDINAL of the LAW v. PERSON and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) . An executory administrative act is one which , inter alia , grant rights to individuals and creates obligations for the administration ( see PERSON v. the Republic [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ; and PERSON and others v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Issues as to the admissibility of a recourse to ORG may be considered by the court of its own motion even if these are not raised by the parties ( see GPE [ CARDINAL ] CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It is well - established that , where there is a dispute between various candidates on a list or where , for example , there is a selection process amongst a number of candidates for a particular post , a candidate wishing to challenge the validity of the administrative body \u2019s preference for CARDINAL candidate over another , ought not merely to challenge his position on the list or his non - selection , as the case may be , but instead should challenge the position of other people by indicating which candidates in his opinion lacked in qualifications or were unjustifiably favoured in comparison to him . All the other candidates whose positions are affected should be given the opportunity as interested parties to set out their case and objections before the court . Since the administrative authority \u2019s decision affects a number of candidates , it means that the entirety of the decision should be challenged as that is what constitutes the executory administrative act . The part of the decision affecting solely the applicant can not be considered an autonomous executory act , as that is CARDINAL link in the entire chain of considerations which the administrative body makes in order to form the final decision ( see , among other authorities , ORG v. PERSON and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ; PERSON v. ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , unreported ; PERSON and PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ; PERSON v.
