He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , of FAC .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( GPE ) issued an international warrant for the arrest of the applicant , who was suspected of having murdered his girlfriend on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested at ORG ( GPE ) and taken into custody pending extradition proceedings .", "On DATE GPE authorities filed an extradition request with ORG .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ruled in favour of extraditing the applicant provided that GPE authorities gave the NORP government an assurance that they would neither seek nor apply the death penalty . It referred expressly to the terms of a written declaration made by the GPE District Attorney on DATE , which stated :", "\u201c ... under GPE law ... , I have the exclusive right to determine whether criminal charges will be filed against any particular defendant , and ... what the charges will be . ...", "...", "In the case of PERSON , I have been advised by my deputies and agree that no \u2018 special circumstance\u2019 is applicable ... This affidavit may be deemed a commitment by my office to not seek the death penalty against PERSON . \u201d", "ORG pointed out that , while the application of the death penalty to a person whose extradition had been granted by the NORP government would be contrary to NORP public policy under LAW of DATE abolishing the death penalty and LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW , the same was not true of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . The court also found that the question whether a limitation period applied to the crime ( crime ) committed did not arise because , even in GPE , the DATE period had only just begun .", "Lastly , it found that , although the applicant had claimed to be a NORP national at the hearing , it could not be seriously disputed that he had NORP nationality only and so it declined to seek a preliminary ruling on that issue .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against ORG decision . It held that the ruling in favour of extradition , together with its proviso , was in accordance with domestic law . It declined , however , to rule on the grounds of appeal relating to nationality and the death - row phenomenon , taking the view that they amounted to criticisms of some of the reasons given in ORG judgment and were therefore inadmissible .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a declaration of nationality .", "On DATE , at the NORP government \u2019s request , further guarantees were provided by the GPE District Attorney , who stated that :", "( a ) as District Attorney , she was authorised by law to bind the State of GPE by her decisions and so the undertaking she had given was binding both on her successors and on GPE ;", "( b ) her declaration amounted to a commitment and an assurance by ORG that the death penalty would not be sought or applied against PERSON at any stage in the prosecution or the criminal proceedings instituted against him ;", "( c ) NORP under LAW of LAW a death sentence for murder could be passed only if CARDINAL of CARDINAL special circumstances listed in the section applied ;", "( d ) the laws of ORG made it legally impossible for the death penalty to be imposed unless a special circumstance was charged by the prosecuting authorities and upheld by the trial court ;", "( e ) the District Attorney alone was entitled to charge a special circumstance ; no special circumstance would be charged in this case and therefore no court would be able to impose the death penalty on PERSON ;", "( f ) even if the understanding of the facts in the case were to change in the future , her decision not to seek the death penalty was irrevocable . Even where a special circumstance existed , LOC had a legal right not to charge it and she would not do so in this case even if a special circumstance became apparent at a later stage ; it was consequently impossible for the death penalty to be imposed .", "That declaration was made \u201c under penalty of perjury \u201d .", "On DATE the GPE embassy in GPE forwarded to the NORP government assurances made by the federal government .", "On DATE the NORP Prime Minister issued an extradition order ; the applicant appealed to the PERSON d\u2019Etat .", "On DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat held as follows :", "\u201c The death penalty was abolished in GPE by the PERSON of DATE . Under LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG , which was incorporated into the domestic legal order following its ratification ... , \u2018 The death penalty shall be abolished . No one shall be condemned to such penalty or GPE . Applying the death penalty to a person whose extradition has been granted by the NORP government would contravene NORP public policy . Consequently , if any of the crimes for which extradition is sought from the NORP authorities is punishable by death under the law of the requesting ORG , extradition in respect of that crime may legally be granted only on condition that the requesting ORG gives sufficient assurances that the death penalty will not be imposed or will not be executed . On the other hand , extradition of a person liable to serve a life sentence without any possibility of early release is not contrary to NORP public policy or LAW .", "The government of the United States\u2019 request for the extradition of PERSON is based on an act of murder . Under the criminal - law provisions that apply in GPE , which is the ORG whose courts have jurisdiction in the case , an accused found guilty of murder is liable to the death penalty .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ruled in favour of Mr ORG \u2019s extradition provided that the relevant GPE authorities gave assurances to the NORP government that , even if the death penalty was imposed , it would not be sought or applied .", "Under the impugned order of DATE , the NORP government acceded to the NORP authorities\u2019 request for the applicant \u2019s extradition provided that the death penalty was not sought , imposed or executed . In a diplomatic note of CARDINAL DATE , the GPE embassy made known to the NORP government the GPE government \u2019s assurance that , if Mr ORG \u2019s extradition was granted , the death penalty would not be imposed or carried out . GPE authorities also conveyed to the NORP authorities the undertaking made on behalf of ORG by the District Attorney of GPE \u2013 where PERSON ORG would stand trial DATE that the relevant prosecuting authority would not apply for the death penalty to be imposed on the applicant , even if new facts were uncovered that could amount to special circumstances . In an affidavit the GPE District Attorney gave a formal assurance that the death penalty could not be imposed unless a special circumstance was charged by the prosecuting authorities . Under these circumstances , the applicant is not justified in maintaining that the impugned order is not attended by adequate safeguards and that his extradition would contravene NORP public policy .", "Contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegations , the United States\u2019 legal system respects ORG fundamental rights and freedoms as required by the general principles of extradition law . The impugned order is therefore not in breach of LAW .", "PERSON maintained that he was a NORP national but provided no evidence to support that assertion . In the absence of any serious dispute on this subject , there is no reason to seek a preliminary ruling from the court competent to determine nationality issues .", "It follows that PERSON is not justified in seeking to have the impugned order quashed ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
