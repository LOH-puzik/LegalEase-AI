The first applicant is married to the second applicant and the third applicant to the fourth applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant suffers from fallopian - tube - related infertility ( eileiterbedingter PERSON ) . She produces ova , but , due to her blocked fallopian tubes , these can not pass to the uterus , so natural fertilisation is impossible . The second applicant , her husband , is infertile .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant suffers from agonadism ( PERSON ) , which means that she does not produce ova at all . Thus , she is completely infertile but has a fully developed uterus . The fourth applicant , her husband , in contrast to the second applicant , can produce sperm fit for procreation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and third applicants lodged an application ( PERSON ) with ORG ) for a review of the constitutionality of sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW ( DATE see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued before ORG that they were directly affected by the above provisions . The first applicant submitted that she could not conceive a child by natural means ; thus , the only way open to her and her husband would be in vitro fertilisation using sperm from a donor . That medical technique was , however , ruled out by sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW . The third applicant submitted that she was infertile . As she suffered from agonadism , she did not produce ova at all . Thus , the only way open to her of conceiving a child was to resort to a medical technique of artificial procreation referred to as heterologous embryo transfer , which would entail implanting into her uterus an embryo conceived with ova from a donor and sperm from the fourth applicant . However , that method was not allowed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The first and third applicants argued before ORG that the impossibility of using the above - mentioned medical techniques for medically assisted conception amounted to a breach of their rights under LAW . They also relied on LAW , which guarantees equal treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a public hearing in which the first applicant , assisted by counsel , participated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on the first and third applicants\u2019 request . It found that their request was partly admissible in so far as the wording concerned their specific case . In this respect , it found that the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW , which prohibited the use of certain procreation techniques , was directly applicable to the applicants\u2019 case without it being necessary for a decision by a court or administrative authority to be taken .", "CARDINAL . As regards the merits of their complaints , ORG considered that LAW was applicable in the applicants\u2019 case . Although no case - law of ORG existed on the matter , it was evident , in ORG view , that the decision of spouses or a cohabiting couple to conceive a child and make use of medically assisted procreation techniques to that end fell within the sphere of protection under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The impugned provisions of LAW interfered with the exercise of this freedom in so far as they limited the scope of permitted medical techniques of artificial procreation . As for the justification for such an interference , ORG observed that the legislature , when enacting LAW , had tried to find a solution by balancing the conflicting interests of human dignity , the right to procreation and the well - being of children . Thus , it had enacted as leading features of the legislation that , in principle , only homologous methods \u2013 such as using ova and sperm from the spouses or from the cohabiting couple itself \u2013 and methods which did not involve a particularly sophisticated technique and were not too far removed from natural means of conception would be allowed . The aim of the legislature was to avoid the forming of unusual family relationships , such as a child having more than one biological mother ( a genetic mother and CARDINAL carrying the child ) , and to avoid the risk of the exploitation of women .", "CARDINAL . The use of in vitro fertilisation as opposed to natural procreation raised serious issues as to the well - being of children thus conceived , their health and their rights , and also touched upon the ethical and moral values of society and entailed the risk of commercialisation and selective reproduction ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , applying the principle of proportionality under LAW , such concerns could not lead to a total ban on all possible medically assisted procreation techniques , as the extent to which public interests were concerned depended essentially on whether a homologous technique ( having recourse to the gametes of the couple ) or heterologous technique ( having recourse to gametes external to the couple ) was used .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the legislature had not overstepped the margin of appreciation afforded to member GPE when it established the permissibility of homologous methods as a rule and insemination using donor sperm as an exception . The choices the legislature had made reflected the then current state of medical science and the consensus in society . It did not mean , however , that these criteria were not subject to developments which the legislature would have to take into account in the future .", "CARDINAL . The legislature had also not neglected the interests of men and women who had to avail themselves of artificial procreation techniques . Besides strictly homologous techniques it had accepted insemination using donor sperm . Such a technique had been known and used for a long time and would not bring about unusual family relationships . Further , the use of these techniques was not restricted to married couples but also included cohabiting couples . However , the interests of the individuals concerned had to give way to the above - mentioned public interest when a child could not be conceived by having recourse to homologous techniques .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that for the legislature to prohibit heterologous techniques , while accepting as lawful only homologous techniques , was not in breach of the constitutional principle of equality which prohibits discrimination . The difference in treatment between the CARDINAL techniques was justified because , as pointed out above , the same objections could not be raised against the homologous method as against the heterologous one . As a consequence , the legislature was not bound to apply strictly identical regulations to both . Also , the fact that insemination in vivo with donor sperm was allowed while ovum donation was not , did not amount to discrimination since sperm donation was not considered to give rise to a risk of creating unusual family relationships which might adversely affect the well - being of a future child .", "CARDINAL . Since the impugned provisions of LAW were in line with LAW and the principle of equality under LAW , there had also been no breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the first and third applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz , ORG no . DATE ) regulates the use of medical techniques for inducing conception of a child by means other than copulation ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . These methods comprise : ( i ) introduction of sperm into the reproductive organs of a woman ; ( ii ) unification of ovum and sperm outside the body of a woman ; ( iii ) introduction of viable cells into the uterus or fallopian tube of a woman ; and ( iv ) introduction of ovum cells or ovum cells with sperm into the uterus or fallopian tube of a woman ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Medically assisted procreation is allowed only within a marriage or a relationship similar to marriage , and may only be carried out if every other possible and reasonable treatment aimed at inducing pregnancy through intercourse has failed or has no reasonable chance of success ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , only ova and sperm from spouses or from persons living in a relationship similar to marriage ( GPE ) may be used for the purpose of medically assisted procreation . In exceptional circumstances , namely if the spouse or male partner is infertile , sperm from a third person may be used for artificial insemination when introducing sperm into the reproductive organs of a woman ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . This is called in vivo fertilisation . In all other circumstances , and in particular for the purpose of in vitro fertilisation , the use of donor sperm is prohibited .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ova or viable cells may only be used for the woman from whom they originate . Thus , ovum donation is always prohibited .", "CARDINAL . The further provisions of LAW stipulate , inter alia , that medically assisted procreation may only be carried out by specialised physicians and in specially equipped hospitals or surgeries ( section CARDINAL ) and with the express and written consent of the spouses or cohabiting persons ( section CARDINAL) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE LAW was supplemented by LAW establishing a fund for financing in vitro fertilisation treatment ( GPE , FAC ein Fonds zur Finanzierung der In - vitro - Fertilisation eingerichtet wird \u2013 ORG , Part I , no . CARDINAL ) in order to subsidise in vitro fertilisation treatment allowed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The issue of maternity and paternity is regulated in LAW Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) . Under Article PERSON , introduced at the same time as the entry into force of LAW , the mother of a child is the woman who has given birth to that child . As regards paternity , Article CARDINAL provides that the father of a child is the male person who has had sexual intercourse with the mother within a certain period of time ( DATE ) before the birth . If the mother has undergone medically assisted procreation treatment using sperm from a donor , the father is the person who has given his consent to that treatment , that is , the spouse or male partner . A sperm donor can in no circumstances be recognised as the father of the child .", "CARDINAL . The following overview of the law and practice concerning artificial procreation in LOC is based essentially on the following documents : \u201c Medically Assisted Procreation and ORG on the Situation in GPE \u201d ( ORG , DATE ) ; the replies by the member ORG to ORG on ORG on access to medically assisted procreation ( ORG ) and on right to know about their origin for children born after GPE \u201d ( ORG , DATE ) ; and a survey carried out in DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . From this material it would appear that in vitro fertilisation treatment was ( as at DATE ) regulated by primary or secondary legislation in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE such treatment was governed by clinical practice , professional guidelines , royal or administrative decree or general constitutional principles .", "CARDINAL . ORG study sets out , in particular , the position of domestic law as regards CARDINAL different artificial procreation techniques : artificial insemination within a couple , in vitro fertilisation within a couple , artificial insemination by a sperm donor , ovum donation , ovum and sperm donation , embryo donation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( an in vitro fertilisation procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an ovum ) .", "CARDINAL . It seems that among the countries which have regulated the issue of artificial procreation , sperm donation is currently prohibited in GPE , GPE and GPE . All CARDINAL countries do not permit heterologous assisted fertilisation . Countries allowing sperm donation do not generally distinguish in their regulations between the use of sperm for artificial insemination and for in vitro fertilisation . As regards ovum donation , this is prohibited in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , in addition to the CARDINAL countries mentioned above .", "CARDINAL . It further appears that in a number of countries , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , where the matter was not regulated ( as at DATE ) , the donation of both sperm and ova is used in practice .", "CARDINAL . A comparison between ORG study of DATE and the survey conducted by ORG in DATE shows that in the field of medically assisted procreation legal provisions are developing quickly . In GPE , GPE and GPE , sperm and ovum donation , which was previously prohibited , is now allowed since the entry into force of new legal provisions in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . In GPE , sperm donation for in vitro fertilisation has been allowed since DATE , but not ovum donation . Since DATE , medically assisted procreation is also regulated by law in GPE allowing sperm and ovum donation .", "CARDINAL . Principle CARDINAL of the principles adopted in DATE by ORG in ORG ( ORG ) , the expert body within ORG which preceded the present ORG , states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In principle , in vitro fertilisation shall be effected using gametes of the members of the couple . The same rule shall apply to any other procedure that involves ova or in vitro or embryos in vitro . However , in exceptional cases defined by the member GPE , the use of gametes of donors may be permitted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG does not deal with the question of donation of gametes , but forbids the use of medically assisted reproduction techniques to choose the sex of a child . Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c The use of techniques of medically assisted procreation shall not be allowed for the purpose of choosing a future child \u2019s sex , except where serious hereditary sex - related disease is to be avoided . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
