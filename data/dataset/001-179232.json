The applicant was born in DATE , lives in GPE since DATE and is currently in detention pending extradition at FAC .", "CARDINAL . The application concerns proceedings for extradition from GPE to GPE , which have the following background :", "CARDINAL . S.Lu . is the former husband of the applicant \u2019s sister , ORG In the course of an argument on DATE , ORG . stabbed the applicant in the chest . On DATE . was convicted in GPE of attempted intentional homicide ( versuchter Totschlag ) committed in a comprehensible state of emotion ( in einer allgemein begreiflichen heftigen GPE ) under ORG DATE of LAW ) and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The applicant testified as a witness during that trial .", "CARDINAL . After GPE . was released from prison in DATE , the applicant \u2019s sister reported him to the police for having repeatedly raped her during their marriage , and for threatening to kill her and her family . Out of fear of her husband , she changed her and her children \u2019s names . An order to determine S.Lu . \u2019s whereabouts ( PERSON ) was issued by the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office in DATE and is in effect until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by ORG ( GPE ) on DATE and DATE , the applicant was apprehended and taken into detention pending extradition by a decision of ORG ( Straflandesgericht Wien \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the Criminal Court \u201d ) of DATE . On DATE ORG of GPE requested the applicant \u2019s extradition . According to the arrest warrant , the applicant was suspected of aggravated murder under LAW in conjunction with LAW . He had allegedly ordered ORG in DATE to murder PERSON . ( his former brother - in - law ) for a payment of MONEY ( ORG ) . On DATE PERSON fired gunshots at a car in the vicinity of the intended victim PERSON . , but instead killed DATE . , ORG . \u2019s cousin .", "CARDINAL . During the extradition proceedings , the applicant alleged that he had nothing to do with the murder in GPE . He claimed that the accusations had been invented by GPE . as revenge for the applicant \u2019s having testified against him during the criminal proceedings in GPE . Furthermore , the \u201c PERSON . clan \u201d ( the family of GPE . ) was very influential in GPE and had connections to the highest Government officials and the justice authorities there , which is why the applicant could not expect a fair trial in that jurisdiction . In addition , the conditions of detention in GPE prisons were deplorable and would amount to torture , inhuman and degrading treatment . Because of the threat emanating from GPE . and his family , the applicant would have to fear for his life there . They could easily get to him in prison by using their connections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE permissible . It held that during the extradition proceedings , the court was not called on to examine whether the applicant was guilty or innocent , but merely to assess whether there was enough evidence to raise suspicions against him , which according to the documents submitted by the GPE authorities was the case . None of the evidence offered by the applicant had been capable of dispelling these suspicions immediately and without doubt , as would have been required by section ORG ) of ORG ( Auslieferungs- und Rechtshilfegesetz \u2013 hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) . The fact that GPE . had been convicted of attempted intentional homicide in DATE and the allegation that he wanted to take revenge on the applicant did not dispell the suspicion either . Furthermore , the court remarked that GPE . \u2019s cousin had actually been killed , which called into question the applicant \u2019s theory of that being a contrived story . It could equally be argued that the applicant had wanted to take revenge on GPE . for stabbing him . Concerning the applicant \u2019s fear for his life in GPE , the court stated that the mere possibility of inhuman or degrading treatment did not suffice . The applicant had failed to adduce specific evidence of an actual , individual threat of treatment contrary to LAW . Furthermore , in case of extradition to a member state of the LAW , the responsibility of the extraditing state was limited , as the person concerned could seek protection against a violation of the LAW in the receiving state .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He submitted that if extradited to GPE , he risked treatment contrary to LAW , because PERSON . PERSON wished to take revenge on him . In fact , PERSON . PERSON . , a very influential member of that clan , was detained at PERSON prison and following extradition to GPE , he would be detained at that prison as well . Security in prison in GPE was a problem , as prisoners became frequently victims of aggression , and he would therefore also risk to become the victim of an assault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE hereinafter \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It confirmed ORG finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate a real and individual risk of being subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment , or that the GPE authorities would not be able to protect him from third , private parties . Furthermore , members of the allegedly influential PERSON . clan were themselves imprisoned in GPE . In particular , on DATE . was convicted in GPE for issuing a dangerous threat against the applicant , which demonstrated that the GPE authorities were indeed capable of taking adequate measures to protect the applicant . Moreover , the PERSON . clan could not be that influential if it was not capable of keeping its own members out of prison . Concerning the conditions of detention , the court held that the report on GPE by ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the CPT \u201d ) of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not state that ill - treatment was the rule in GPE prisons , but that there were merely sporadic incidents of violence . The mere possibility of ill - treatment by prison officers did not suffice to stop the applicant \u2019s extradition . In relation to the material conditions of detention in FAC , where the applicant alleged he would most likely be held if extradited , ORG again quoted the above - mentioned ORG report of DATE , where it was found that inmates were able to move freely within that facility during DATE and could exercise outside on a DATE basis for DATE , and that fitness and computer rooms have recently been installed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Federal Minister of Justice ( NORP ) approved the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the ORG indicate to ORG to stay his extradition to GPE under LAW . He complained under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention that he would run the risk of torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or even death , as the PERSON . clan wanted to take revenge on him and the GPE authorities were not willing or able to afford him protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged applications for the reopening ( PERSON ) of the extradition proceedings and a stay of the extradition with ORG . He produced a certified declaration by PERSON , who had retracted his previous confession to the police that the applicant had ordered the murder of GPE . He asserted that he had been tortured by the GPE police during his questioning and had been pressured into blaming the applicant for ordering the murder . L.Q. alleged that he had fallen unconscious several times because of the \u201c mental and physical torture \u201d . L.Q. averred that he did not even know the applicant in person . The applicant further submitted into evidence several sworn statements from family members and friends , who attested that his life was in danger in GPE because of threats from GPE . and his clan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s applications . It held that in accordance with section ORG ) of LAW , the applicant had failed to adduce evidence which would have been capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against him raised in the extradition request . PERSON \u2019s declaration did not constitute objective evidence and did not indicate any violations in GPE of the applicant \u2019s rights under the ORG either . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for a renewal ( GPE ) of the extradition proceedings with ORG under Article PERSON of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , requesting suspensive effect at the same time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . It found that the new evidence the applicant had produced in the proceedings before it were a matter for the pending reopening proceedings , not for requesting a renewal of the extradition proceedings . In relation to the alleged violations of ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention in the event of his extradition , ORG found that mere allegations referencing general reports on the human rights situation were not capable of substantiating a real and immediate risk to the applicant under these provisions . Furthermore , ORG held that the applicant did not have a right under the law to request suspensive effect , which is why that request had to be rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court found that the applicant had failed to produce objective evidence which would have indicated a real and immediate risk of treatment contrary to LAW if extradited to GPE and therefore would have warranted a reopening of the extradition proceedings . While the sworn statement by ORG in principle raised doubts in relation to the suspicions against the applicant , it had not constituted the only evidence against him . More pertinent had been the fact that , during the criminal proceedings against ORG in GPE , a microcassette had been put into evidence by GPE . which had allegedly contained a conversation confirming his statements that the applicant had been to blame for the murder . In addition , ORG \u2019s initial incriminating statements against the applicant had been made in the presence of his lawyer . Moreover , PERSON had not specified what exactly the police had allegedly done to him , which had made it impossible to evaluate whether the alleged treatment had actually amounted to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment . ORG reiterated that it was in any event for the GPE courts to evaluate the evidence against the applicant . In sum , it confirmed that the statement by ORG was not capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against the applicant on which the extradition request was based . Lastly , ORG found that despite not being ORG to ORG , LAW granted the Convention direct effect under and superiority to national law , therefore domestic law equally offered protection from violations of the LAW . ORG decision to dismiss the applicant \u2019s appeal was served on his counsel on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
