DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a private limited company , which is domiciled in ORG , GPE . It is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant company is a television producer . In DATE its documentary unit called \u201c FakCARDINALeren \u201d decided to produce a programme investigating paedophilia in GPE which was to be broadcast on national television . In this connection the journalists employed by the applicant company unsuccessfully sought permission from an association named \u201c The Paedophile Association \u201d to attend its meetings or conduct interviews with its members .", "The said association was formed \u201c to work toward the development of paedophiles\u2019 sense of responsibility towards children \u201d and it holds regular meetings , but they are generally closed to the public and the media . Its members include convicted sexual offenders . The association was not illegal under NORP law , a fact which had been the subject of public debate .", "Wishing to probe into the Paedophile Association \u2019s activities , a journalist , ORG , using the pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d , went undercover , posing as a member . In the course of his DATE long membership \u201c PERSON \u201d participated in quasi - public meetings , was invited to so - called \u201c private meetings \u201d and was befriended by CARDINAL other members \u201c Mogens \u201d and \u201c Per \u201d . These CARDINAL made many incriminating statements regarding the realities of paedophilia in both GPE and GPE , including advice on how to induce a child to chat over the internet , comments about how difficult it was to procure sexual acts from children in GPE , and how easy on the other hand it was to procure children in LOC and GPE . \u201c Mogens \u201d recommended to \u201c PERSON \u201d a specific hotel , run by a NORP paedophile in GPE , at which \u201c Mogens \u201d had had sex with NORP boys in the past . ORG visited the hotel in GPE and interviewed an NORP boy about his knowledge of \u201c Mogens \u201d . Also , in front of the hotel , a young NORP boy was offering sexual services . ORG made numerous notes and camera recordings , most of them hidden .", "Before the programme was to be broadcast on DATE , ORG and its members who had been recorded by the hidden camera were contacted by the applicant company and given assurance that they would remain anonymous , when the documentary was shown . Thus , false names would be used and the ORG faces and voices would be blurred .", "The association unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent the broadcast of the programme .", "DATE after the broadcast of the programme , on DATE , the person named \u201c Mogens \u201d was arrested and charged with sexual offences under sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) taken together with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . ORG ( K\u00f8benhavns Politi ) had taken an interest in him before the broadcast of the programme and could therefore identify him . Their request that he be detained on remand was refused by ORG , which found no specific reason to believe that \u201c Mogens \u201d would impede the investigation , notably because the information leading to the charges against him on the whole appeared from the programme . Thus , \u201c Mogens \u201d was released on DATE . During their further investigation , which also included the person in the programme named \u201c Per \u201d , ORG requested that the un - shown portions of the recordings made by ORG be disclosed . ORG , and the editor and head of the applicant company \u2019s documentary unit , refused the request following which the public prosecution requested a court order compelling the applicant company to hand over the un - shown footage to the police .", "By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) refused to grant the requested court order having regard to the need of the media to be able to protect their sources . Also , it found that the raw material had little or no evidential value , as it essentially covered the same matter as the broadcast footage . Moreover , it referred to section CARDINAL of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) and LAW .", "On appeal , the decision was upheld on DATE by ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) .", "Having been granted leave to appeal , the public prosecution brought the case before ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , which on DATE found against the applicant company , so that the latter was compelled to hand over limited specified unedited footage and notes which related solely to \u201c Mogens \u201d and his activities in GPE and GPE , including the recordings made outside the NORP hotel of the NORP boy . However , the recordings and notes were exempted from the order whenever the handover would entail a risk of revealing the identity of any of CARDINAL named persons , namely \u201c the victim [ not the NORP boy ] , the police officer and the hotel manager \u2019s mother \u201d . The remainder of the unedited footage was to remain protected . In its decision ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c ORG agrees that presumably the non - edited recordings and the notes made by the journalist JB may assist the investigation and production of evidence in the case against \u201c Mogens \u201d and that therefore they may serve as evidence within the meaning of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG .", "It is undisputed that in connection with the recording , CARDINAL of the participants - the victim , the police officer and the hotel manager \u2019s mother - were promised that they could participate without the possibility of being identified , thus their identities are protected by the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness , pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection ORG ) first sentence , of ORG .", "The charge against \u201c Mogens \u201d concerns a criminal offence which is punishable with CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment or more . The charge includes several instances of sexual relations other than intercourse , over a long time , with boys younger than DATE , and ORG finds that the case concerns a criminal act , which is of a serious nature . However , having regard to the information about the content of the material which is related to the CARDINAL participants mentioned [ the victim , the police officer and the hotel manager \u2019s mother ] compared with the investigation possibilities otherwise available , it can not be presumed that the material is of vital importance for resolving the case . In these circumstances , ORG agrees that the conditions stated in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG are not fulfilled for issuing an order [ to compel the applicant company to disclose or hand over the material which is related to those CARDINAL participants ] contrary to the right of exemption from the duty to give evidence .", "The recordings of the members of ORG during its meetings and of \u201c Mogens \u201d and \u201c Per \u201d were done with a hidden camera . Hence a promise of anonymity could only be given after the recordings . The media \u2019s extensive privilege of protecting their sources by virtue of section CARDINAL of ORG has been introduced in consideration of the sources\u2019 and the participants\u2019 opportunity to exercise the freedom of speech , since the promise of anonymity may be a vital premise for supplying a journalist with information . Thus , the main purpose of the rules concerning the right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness is to protect persons who , relying on a promise of anonymity , agree to participate in a programme . Even though , in compliance with the rules on press ethics and the use of a hidden camera , [ the applicant company ] has subsequently given the participants a promise and has kept this promise in the programme , section CARDINAL , subsection ORG ) , of ORG can not , according to its wording and purpose , extend to a right of exemption from the duty to testify as a witness as regards the recordings in question . Nor can section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "The programme contains recordings made outside an NORP hotel of a boy with whom \u201c ORG \u201d allegedly had had [ sexual ] relations . The boy \u2019s name does not appear and reasonable precautions have been taken to cover his identity , but this is not sufficient to establish a right of exemption from the duty to give evidence according to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG .", "A court order pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG may not be issued if it is disproportionate to the importance of the case and the disadvantage which such a ruling might entail ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG ) . In this balancing exercise , regard must be had to the nature of the offence , the value which the items may have for the investigation of the case , and considerations for the media \u2019s working conditions as regards LAW . In these circumstances , ORG finds that a court order should be limited to those recordings in which \u201c Mogens \u201d or the NORP boy participates , and ORG \u2019s notes which relate thereto .", "... [ ORG ] orders that [ the applicant company ] hand over those parts of the non - edited tapes with recording for the programme \u201c Danish Paedophiles \u201d in which \u201c Mogens \u201d or the NORP boy participates . Also , [ the applicant company ] must hand over notes made by the journalist JB in connection with the said recordings . However , the recordings and notes may be exempted from the handover order whenever that would entail a risk of revealing the identity of the victim , the police officer or the hotel manager \u2019s mother . \u201d", "On DATE ORG decided to discontinue its investigation against \u201c Mogens \u201d and drop the charges against him .", "The provisions of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "CARDINAL .
