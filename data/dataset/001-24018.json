SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered GPE on DATE . He applied for a permanent residence permit , based on his marriage to a NORP national , on DATE .", "In support of his application the applicant stated , inter alia , that he had met his wife in DATE , at which time he had been living with his family in GPE , GPE and working as a machine operator at a pharmaceutical factory . After a period of time he had moved in with her and the couple had subsequently married at ORG in GPE on DATE . His family had accepted the relationship and permission to marry had been sought from his uncle , who was living in GPE and who had become the head of the family after the death , in DATE , of the applicant \u2019s father . His grandfather had been a \u201c tribal chief \u201d . His father had been educated and the family had been living in town . His mother was residing in GPE and he had CARDINAL brothers and sisters , CARDINAL of whom were living in GPE .", "Interviewed together with the applicant , his wife stated , inter alia , that she had been working as a teacher in GPE since DATE and that before she met the applicant she had been acquainted with his sisters and the family . The applicant \u2019s father had apparently been a highly respected man and she had noticed that people recognised the family when their name was mentioned . All the applicant \u2019s siblings had received an education , all but CARDINAL of them probably as teachers . The family also had a family business that dealt in gems . In DATE the applicant had left his job at the pharmaceutical factory as it caused him to experience allergic reactions . He had thereafter not had any other employment but had assisted his mother who was building a house .", "On DATE the applicant was given a temporary residence permit in GPE which was subsequently extended until DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s wife gave birth to the couple \u2019s first child .", "In DATE the couple left for GPE , where they remained until DATE . While the applicant \u2019s wife returned to GPE in DATE , the applicant re - entered GPE on DATE . On DATE the couple \u2019s second child was born . The applicant was granted a permanent residence permit in GPE on DATE .", "As a result of tests performed in connection with her pregnancy , the applicant \u2019s wife in DATE learned that she was infected with the HIV virus . A test was subsequently performed also on the applicant which showed that he too carried the infection . The applicant was in this context , and subsequently on repeated occasions , informed of his obligations as a carrier of an infectious disease to refrain from conduct that could cause any further spreading of the disease . According to the evidence subsequently given by the applicant \u2019s ( then former ) wife at his trial , both she and the applicant were very well aware of the precautions they were obliged to observe , both with respect to each other and with respect to other persons who did not carry the infection .", "In DATE the applicant and his wife separated and the applicant moved out of the family home in the province of GPE and settled in GPE . The couple was divorced in DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE found the applicant guilty of making unlawful threats and of carrying knives in a public place . He was given a conditional sentence and ordered to pay a fine . No appeal was made against the judgment .", "In DATE reports were made to the unit for prevention of infectious diseases at the GPE hospital in GPE that the applicant was engaging in sexual contacts without disclosing to his partners that he was HIV positive . As a result , he was in DATE subjected to compulsory isolation pursuant to LAW , DATE ) . Following police investigation he was subsequently charged with having had unprotected sexual intercourse with CARDINAL different women without disclosing to them that he carried the HIV virus , thereby transmitting the infection to CARDINAL of them .", "During the preliminary investigation , the applicant provided further information on his family background and the circumstances surrounding his life in GPE . He stated , inter alia , that he grew up with his mother and stepfather in his home village . He first went to a primary school close to the village and later attended a catholic high school in GPE . He had CARDINAL full brothers and sisters and CARDINAL siblings on his father \u2019s side .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL counts of aggravated assault and CARDINAL count of attempted aggravated assault and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Upon the applicant \u2019s and the prosecutor \u2019s appeal , ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) , on DATE , upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence . Whilst not finding any evidence to show that the applicant had deliberately sought to transmit the virus to the victims , the court observed that he on repeated occasions had been informed of the special risk of transmitting the disease during unprotected sexual intercourse and that he accordingly had been well aware of that risk . Yet , the material before the court showed that he had not informed any of the CARDINAL victims of his condition . With respect to CARDINAL of the victims the unprotected sexual contacts had occurred on repeated occasions and in the remaining case on a single occasion when the victim was asleep and despite the fact that she at all previous times had insisted that the applicant should use a condom throughout the intercourse . Considering that the applicant had acted with exceptional ruthlessness and indifference towards his victims , the court concluded that that he would not have refrained from having sexual intercourse with them even if he had known that the disease would be transmitted . The applicant had accordingly shown the requisite mens rea under the applicable principles of NORP criminal law to be held criminally liable for having committed the crimes with intent .", "ORG further ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion from GPE . Having found that the crimes for which he had been convicted justified a DATE prison sentence , the court had regard to the inconvenience caused by his expulsion and consequently fixed the sentence at DATE imprisonment . In regard to the expulsion , the court made , inter alia , the following observations . The applicant \u2019s only connection to GPE was the fact that his former wife and their CARDINAL children were residing in the country . He had no other link to the country ; he had not learned the NORP language or established himself on the NORP labour market and did not appear to have undergone any continuous prescribed treatment for his HIV infection in GPE . In regard to the applicant \u2019s contacts with his children , evidence given by his former wife revealed that he had been seeing them CARDINAL times per year and that he had otherwise only had contact with them by telephone . The former wife had maintained , particularly out of concern for the children , certain contacts with the applicant \u2019s relatives in GPE . There were thus contacts by letter and telephone between the children and the relatives . The court further found that the applicant had not been continuously residing in GPE for such a period of time that exceptional reasons were required for his expulsion . However , even if he were to be considered as having resided in GPE for such a continuous period , the court considered that , in view of the very serious nature of the offences and the applicant \u2019s unsettled conditions in the country , there were sufficiently strong reasons to expel him from GPE with a lifelong ban on his return . In this context , the court noted that the children \u2019s established contact with relatives in GPE would probably mean that the expulsion would not cause the contact between the applicant and his children to be severed . The court also stated that there was probably a significant risk that the applicant would relapse into the same type of criminal behaviour and that this factor strongly militated in favour of expulsion .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) . He submitted a statement of DATE by Mr PERSON , a psychologist at ORG ( Barn- och ungdomspsykiatriska mottagningen ) in GPE , according to which the applicant \u2019s former wife and their CARDINAL children had visited the clinic on QUANTITY occasions during DATE . Mr PERSON stated that the children had a strong emotional relationship to their father and that their need of continuous contact with him could not realistically be maintained should he be expelled to GPE .", "By a decision of DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG judgment .", "During the applicant \u2019s time in prison , CARDINAL petitions have been made to the Government for a revocation of the expulsion order . They were rejected by decisions of DATE , DATE , DATE ( CARDINAL petitions ) and DATE respectively .", "In support of his requests for a revocation , the applicant submitted several statements . In a medical certificate of DATE , PERSON , chief physician at the HIV unit at ORG hospital and the physician responsible for the applicant \u2019s treatment during DATE , stated that the applicant had undergone anti - retroviral treatment , albeit irregularly , DATE and DATE , and had thereafter not been under treatment until DATE when DATE viral levels in his blood being very high and his immune system being severely weakened and \u201c at the level where AIDS complications usually appear \u201d \u2013 he had resumed his medication . The resumed treatment had been successful to the point where the HIV levels in the applicant \u2019s blood were no longer detectable . According to PERSON , his chances of receiving life - sustaining HIV treatment in GPE were very slim . Moreover , experience showed that the interruption of treatment of a patient like the applicant would lead to a relatively rapid deterioration of the immune system leading to the development of AIDS within DATE and death within DATE . In a further certificate of DATE PERSON reiterated his previous statements and added that the applicant \u2019s understanding and acceptance of his disease had improved and that the risk of his relapsing into his previous behaviour had to be considered as extremely small .", "In a statement , dated DATE , PERSON , a counsellor ( kurator ) at the HIV ward at the same hospital , stated that she had met the applicant regularly since DATE , during which time he had shown an increased understanding of his illness , his previous actions and his prevailing situation . PERSON concluded that there was no great risk that the applicant would relapse into his previous hazardous behaviour , as the root causes of that behaviour \u2013 fear that his illness would become known to other people , depression and alcohol abuse \u2013 had been removed .", "In submissions of CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON , ombudsman at ORG for HIV - positive People ( Riksf\u00f6rbundet f\u00f6r hivpositiva ; RFHP ) , stated that the applicant had expressed anxieties about his impending expulsion , partly because of the lack of adequate treatment in GPE and partly because of the risk of his contact with his children being severed . The applicant had also mentioned that CARDINAL of his brothers had recently died from AIDS and that a sister was seriously ill due to an HIV infection .", "In a report of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Kriminalv\u00e5rden ) stated that , after initially having been in a bad state , both mentally and physically , at the prison where he was serving his sentence , the applicant \u2019s situation had improved considerably . He was open and understanding about his illness and received continuous medical treatment . He also received regular visits once a month from his children , accompanied by his former wife , a contact which was very important both to him and the children .", "In submissions of CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , a friend of the applicant \u2019s former wife , her psychiatric counsellor and her brother attested to the close relationship between the applicant and his children and the fact that they had met regularly at the prison .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s former wife described her and the children \u2019s relationship to the applicant . She explained that since it had been easier for her to integrate on the labour market , the applicant had stayed at home with the children . Even after the separation and the applicant \u2019s move to GPE , they had remained in close contact , seeing each other as often as their financial situation permitted . They had ensured that the children spoke NORP ; the older child spoke NORP with the applicant whereas the younger child preferred NORP . During the applicant \u2019s serving of his sentence , they had visited him as often as possible , altogether on CARDINAL occasions . She further claimed that she could not afford regular visits to the applicant if he were to be expelled to GPE .", "In his latest application for a revocation of the expulsion order , submitted to the Government during DATE , the applicant maintained that , as from DATE , he had a new relationship with a NORP woman and that there was no risk that he upon release would relapse into the same type of criminal behaviour . The new relationship had apparently been established in DATE through the exchange of letters . The couple met for the first time in the prison in DATE and the woman had subsequently visited the applicant DATE . She had a metabolic disturbance and was consequently considerably overweight .", "On DATE , following the ORG \u2019s indication , under LAW , that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to expel the applicant to GPE until further notice , the Minister of Justice decided to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order . The Minister further decided that the applicant upon his release from prison on the following day was to be taken into custody pursuant to chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) on the ground that there was reason to believe that he would abscond .", "On DATE the applicant was released on probation . He remains in detention .", "In a report to the Government of DATE ORG in GPE , after consulting with medical doctors with experience of HIV / AIDS treatment at the NORP clinic in GPE , the head of ORG in GPE and CARDINAL of the latter \u2019s colleagues from other parts of the country , provided the following information . Both HIV treatment , in the form of anti - retroviral therapy , and medical care for persons suffering from an HIV infection or developed AIDS were available in GPE for those who could afford it . Anti - retroviral therapy and medical attention could be obtained in GPE and probably also in GPE in the north of the country . The physicians with whom the ORG had been in contact could not with certainty say that anti - retroviral therapy could be obtained in other parts of the country . So - called \u201c LOC \u201d , a test to establish the number of certain white blood cells , was available at CARDINAL hospitals in GPE and in all probability also at a medical centre in GPE in the north . Various types of antibiotics were available throughout GPE , also the most modern types suitable for persons suffering from allergy to penicillin . The cost of anti - retroviral therapy lay CARDINAL NORP shillings per month , to be compared with the minimum wage of a ORG employee which was MONEY ( MONEY approximately corresponded to QUANTITY ) . The cost of antibiotics and the treatment of different types of opportunistic diseases varied and was difficult to estimate but lay above MONEY per month . The cost of \u201c CDCARDINAL-count \u201d in GPE was MONEY .", "Pursuant to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) , a crime may , apart from ordinary sanctions , result in special consequences defined by law . Expulsion on account of a criminal offence constitutes such a special consequence .", "Provisions on expulsion on this ground are laid down in LAW . According to chapter DATE , section QUANTITY , an alien may not be expelled from GPE on account of having committed a criminal offence unless certain conditions are satisfied . Firstly , he must be convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment . Secondly , he may only be expelled if he is in fact sentenced to a more severe punishment than a fine and if ( CARDINAL ) it may be assumed , on account of the nature of the crime and other circumstances , that he will continue his criminal activities in GPE or ( CARDINAL ) the offence , in view of the damage , danger or violation involved for private or public interests , is so serious that he ought not to be allowed to remain in the country .", "Furthermore , under chapter CARDINAL , section QUANTITY , when considering whether or not an alien should be expelled , the court shall take into account his links to NORP society . As regards aliens who are considered to be refugees , special rules apply . Moreover , the court must have regard to the general provisions on impediments to the enforcement of an expulsion decision . Thus , pursuant to chapter CARDINAL , LAW , there is an absolute impediment to expelling an alien to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Further , a risk of persecution generally constitutes an impediment to enforcing an expulsion decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
