THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are mother and daughter . They are GPE nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively , and live in PERSON , the GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON A.M.W. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant cohabited with her partner , Mr GPE , from DATE until the latter \u2019s death in DATE . They were not married . On DATE a daughter , Jolien \u2013 the second applicant DATE was born to the couple . Mr GPE legally recognised his daughter and , following a decision by ORG ( kantonrechter ) of CARDINAL DATE , both parents were invested with parental authority over ORG .", "On DATE , following the death of Mr Schuring , the first applicant requested a survivor \u2019s benefit on behalf of ORG from ORG ( ORG ) pursuant to ORG and LAW ( Algemene Weduwen- en Wezenwet ; \u201c AWW \u201d ) . In her request she acknowledged that under the provisions of the AWW she herself was not entitled to a widow \u2019s pension as she had not been married to Mr Schuring . However , as her daughter had been financially dependent on her father , she laid claim , on behalf of her daughter , to benefits to the amount of PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage . In the subsequent proceedings she argued that since a widow without children was entitled to a partial widow \u2019s pension amounting to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage and a widow with a child under the age of CARDINAL received a full widow \u2019s pension amounting to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage , a child born of married parents was in effect awarded a survivor \u2019s benefit amounting to PERCENT of the statutory minimum wage in the form of an extra allowance on top of his / her surviving parent \u2019s benefit . Not awarding this component of the widow \u2019s pension to ORG because her parents had not been married \u2013 a circumstance over which ORG had had no control \u2013 amounted to unjustified discrimination on the grounds of birth .", "To substantiate her argument that the difference between a full and a partial widow \u2019s pension had always been intended to benefit the child who had lost CARDINAL of his / her parents , the first applicant referred to the drafting history of LAW ( PERSON ) which replaced the AWW on DATE . She also pointed to ORG no . CARDINAL ( ORG , DATE ) and no . CARDINAL ( the Invalidity , Old - Age and Survivors\u2019 Benefits Convention , DATE ) which oblige member states to provide cash benefits to the dependent children of a breadwinner . According to the first applicant , the GPE legislator had complied with this obligation by awarding higher benefits to widows with minor children . However , by requiring that the surviving parent be married to the deceased , a dependent child born out of wedlock was excluded .", "The first applicant \u2019s request was rejected by ORG on DATE . It held that as the first applicant had not been married to PERSON Schuring , she was not eligible for either a partial or a full widow \u2019s pension . Moreover , although the AWW did provide for benefits for orphans , ORG could not be awarded such benefits as she was not an orphan , one of her parents still being alive .", "The first applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) was rejected by ORG on DATE . Her appeal ( beroep ) to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE was rejected on DATE . Finally , ORG ( ORG ) rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal ( hoger beroep ) on DATE .", "ORG found that no unjustified discrimination had taken place . Referring to its own case - law , it reiterated that the fact that the pension for a widow with a child under DATE was higher than that for a widow without children did not entail that that difference should be considered as a cash benefit for the child who had lost CARDINAL of his / her parents . The AWW provided for benefits for CARDINAL kinds of survivors : widows and orphans . It was only in respect of a widow \u2019s pension that a difference in treatment was made , in that a marriage between the deceased and the survivor was required in order to create a right to such a pension . The first applicant had not disputed that this difference in treatment was justified . The right to orphan \u2019s benefits was not dependent on a child having been born in wedlock but only on a child being the offspring of the deceased whose death caused the child to be without parents DATE which was not the case here . As a result , the survivors\u2019 benefit claimed by the first applicant could only be placed in the framework of the provisions concerning widows , and the refusal to award her either a full widow \u2019s pension or any other widow \u2019s benefit could only be seen in relation to her not having been married to the deceased . There was no other discriminatory factor which could be considered as underlying the subsidiary effect that the majority of cases where an entitlement to a full widow \u2019s pension existed concerned children born from the marriage of the deceased to the surviving widow .", "The AWW , which entered into force on DATE , insured against the risk of the death of the family breadwinner . Under the AWW scheme , all persons residing in the GPE and non - residents gainfully employed in the GPE were compulsory insured . Contributions to this scheme were paid by all persons gainfully employed in the GPE .", "Entitlement to AWW benefits was not dependent on the level of contributions paid as , contrary to a social security scheme based on employment ( werknemersverzekering ) , it was a general social security scheme ( volksverzekering ) . The level of benefits was linked to the statutory minimum wage .", "The AWW conferred entitlement to a widow \u2019s pension for the widow , who was not yet aged DATE , of an insured person provided she was caring for an unmarried child born before or on the date of the death of her spouse . A widow without children was also entitled to claim benefit , for example if she was incapacitated for work or was aged DATE or over at the time of her husband \u2019s death . \u201c Widow \u201d meant the woman to whom the insured person was married on the date of his death . Since DATE , widowers enjoyed the same entitlement to benefit after the death of their wives on the basis of case - law .", "As it was felt that a widow with children had greater financial needs than a widow without children ( see Bijlagen Handelingen Tweede Kamer \u2013 Appendices to ORG DATE , CARDINAL , DATE ) , a widow with unmarried children under DATE regardless of their number \u2013 received an amount equal to the minimum wage whereas a widow without children received PERCENT of that amount .", "Under the AWW the unmarried child , up to the age of DATE , of the deceased person was entitled to an orphan \u2019s benefit provided the child had lost both parents or if the surviving parent had been divested of parental authority .", "The AWW was repealed on DATE and replaced by LAW ( PERSON ) . The new LAW replaced the term \u2018 widow\u2019 by \u2018 surviving partner\u2019 , this being the person who was married to the deceased person or who was in a relationship of equivalent status with him or her ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
