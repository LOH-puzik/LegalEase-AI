GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , has NORP and NORP nationality . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer of the law firm ORG practising in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant is a businessman with professional activities in GPE and throughout the NORP world . Since DATE the applicant entertained professional contacts with CARDINAL businessmen from GPE , GPE , named PERSON and PERSON In DATE ORG suspected the latter of having set up an extensive fraudulent scheme . According to the allegations brought out against them , DATE S. and PERSON pretended to own industrial drilling machines , which they sold to a number of leasing companies although these drilling machines did not exist and the damage remained with the leasing companies . These incidents , which became known as the \u201c PERSON - scandal \u201d , stirred a considerable amount of media attention and are regarded as a pre - eminent example of commercial delinquency in NORP history .", "On DATE the criminal investigation judge ( Ermittlungsrichter ) at ORG ( ORG ) , in the investigation proceedings against PERSON CARDINAL alleged co - offenders , and upon ORG request , ordered the applicant \u2019s assets , amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) , to be frozen pursuant to sections ORG subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINALd , ORG subsection CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with LAW subsection CARDINAL , second sentence , subsection CARDINAL , and section CARDINALa of LAW ( attachment in rem , dinglicher Arrest , see relevant domestic law below ) . That court found that , according to the preliminary investigations , a sum of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL deriving from the fraudulent sales had been transferred to the applicant \u2019s enterprise and from there to his personal property . There was the risk that the applicant would try to transfer the assets abroad in order to prevent the execution of claims brought out later by aggrieved third parties .", "On DATE ORG , in a decision naming the applicant as a person charged with an offence ( PERSON ) , modified and extended the attachment of the applicant \u2019s assets to the amount of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Relying on statements given by PERSON and PERSON during the preliminary investigations , ORG found the suspicion to be confirmed that the applicant had knowingly received money derived from fraudulent transactions . Accordingly , there was the suspicion that the applicant had committed the offence of money - laundering . The money was subjected to the claims of aggrieved third parties according to the provisions of civil liability .", "On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) , on the applicant \u2019s complaint , upheld the attachment of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and lifted the attachment of additional DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . That court confirmed that there was strong evidence given by the statements of PERSON and PERSON that the applicant had participated in the fraudulent actions . The measure taken was proportionate , moreover , it could be expected that he would try to deprive the aggrieved leasing companies of the assets .", "On DATE ORG upheld its previous decision .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to be heard personally . According to that court , the applicant and his counsel had been well informed about all circumstances which raised suspicions against him . In her written submissions to that court , the applicant \u2019s counsel had tried to cast doubts on the credibility of the main offenders PERSON and PERSON She had laid out in detail the applicant \u2019s point of view regarding all circumstances of the cash flow and had tried to rebut the incriminating evidence . As the applicant \u2019s point of view had been clearly and unambiguously submitted in writing , the chamber saw no need to hear him orally .", "With regard to the right to a fair hearing as guaranteed by LAW , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The attachment of assets pursuant to section CARDINALd , ORG subsection CARDINAL in conjunction with sections CARDINAL f. of LAW in order to safeguard third ORG claims is ordered by court decision . According to section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL sentence CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , the order to seize property in order to safeguard the claims of aggrieved parties is issued without hearing the person charged of the offence , as a prior hearing could enable him to transfer the property and thus to thwart the aim of the safeguarding measure . This practice has been approved of by ORG .... During the ensuing complaint proceedings ... the right to a fair hearing was fully taken account of . Pursuant to section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW , the decision on the complaint is taken without an oral hearing . Accordingly , the decision is taken in written proceedings . ... It follows that the fair hearing has to be granted in written proceedings . For special reasons the court of complaint can decide to hear oral statements .", "According to the chamber , these regulations do neither in general nor in this specific case run contrary to LAW . With the aid of his counsel Dr. PERSON , the defendant has made full use of the opportunity to submit his statements , which were fully taken into account , in the written proceedings . There were no obstacles which prevented him from using this form of communication to fully and objectively depict the incidents . Neither the alleged actions to the detriment of the leasing companies nor the alleged participation of the defendant were of such a nature that a personal and oral statement given by the defendant would have been more suited to provide a correct assessment of his actions than a written statement and would thus have been preferable for the chamber . The defendant \u2019s acts of participation did not have an ambiguous content ; they did not concern exceptional or borderline circumstances which would have necessitated the defendant \u2019s personal presence and hearing in order to assess them . Contrary to the defendant \u2019s counsel \u2019s opinion , it was not only necessary to weigh the statements given by the CARDINAL main suspects PERSON and PERSON against the defendant \u2019s own statements . On the contrary , it was necessary to weigh a number of other circumstances , which , taken on their own , justified the attachment order .... Accordingly , they were no \u201c special reasons \u201d justifying to hear the defendant personally . \u201d", "On DATE ORG upheld the attachment of an amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and lifted the attachment of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . On the basis of the results of the preliminary investigations , ORG confirmed the existence of a strong suspicion that the applicant had aided the transfer and concealment of assets . It further confirmed that an oral hearing was neither legally prescribed nor necessary in order to safeguard the applicant \u2019s right to a fair hearing .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision of ORG of DATE and \u2013 indirectly DATE against section CARDINALb of the Code of Criminal Procedure for adjudication for lack of prospect of success .", "With respect to the right to a fair hearing , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair hearing includes the right to information , the right to lodge requests and to submit statements , and the right that the courts take into account the submitted statements . According to the consistent case - law of ORG , LAW does not grant the right to be heard in a specific form , in particular , in an oral hearing . Accordingly , it is up to the legislator to decide to which extent he wishes to grant the right to an oral hearing in specific proceedings .", "According to section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW the decision on the complaint is taken without an oral hearing , that is to say in written proceedings . The complaint court is not prevented from orally hearing witnesses or experts in the course of their investigations pursuant to section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL or to hear oral statements given by the parties to the proceedings . However , it has the discretion to decide whether it deems such measures necessary . There is no indication that it did not make correct use of this discretion , the more so , as the applicant has failed to establish what he would have stated differently in case of an oral hearing . \u201d", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG issued an indictment against the applicant . The criminal proceedings against the applicant have been suspended on DATE in view of the applicant \u2019s inability to plead .", "The order that the applicant \u2019s assets amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL be frozen remains in force .", "Article CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW provides that in the courts , everyone is entitled to be heard in accordance with the law ( PERSON auf rechtliches PERSON ) .", "According to section CARDINALb , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , the attachment of assets may be ordered if there are reasons for assuming that the conditions of forfeiture or for confiscation have been fulfilled . According to subsection DATE , this also applies if forfeiture may not be ordered because the assets are subject to claims brought out by the aggrieved party .", "Section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL , sentence CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides that the court shall order the forfeiture of any object which has been acquired by a perpetrator or accessory as a result of an unlawful act . According to sentence CARDINAL , this shall not apply to the extent that the assets are subject to claims brought out by the aggrieved party .", "If the forfeiture of a particular object is impossible due to the nature of what was acquired or for some other reasons , the court shall order the forfeiture of the sum of money which corresponds to the value of that which was acquired ( section CARDINALa of LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide that the concerned person is not heard prior to the issue of an order of seizure or other measure , if this would endanger the purpose of such order . According to section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL , the decision on the complaint shall be taken without an oral hearing .
