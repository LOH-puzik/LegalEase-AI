The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on the strength of a provisional arrest warrant issued by a duty magistrate in connection with a request for his extradition made by GPE . The request was relayed to GPE through ORG . The charge related to the applicant 's involvement in international drug trafficking in cannabis . The information laid before the magistrate by the Attorney General referred , inter alia , to the DATE United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , to LAW concerning designated countries and Government Notice CARDINAL published in ORG of DATE which reproduced the text of the Convention to which GPE acceded on DATE . Attached to the request was a Red Notice issued by ORG bearing the applicant 's description and fingerprints as well as a certificate issued by the Prime Minister under subsection ( CARDINAL ) of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the applicant was brought before the Magistrates ' Court acting as a court of criminal inquiry in connection with extradition proceedings . A defence counsel was appointed for him . The presiding magistrate was different from the one who issued the provisional arrest warrant . The applicant did not challenge the lawfulness of his arrest and the proceedings were adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a judicial act with ORG alleging that the provisional arrest warrant was unlawful because , inter alia , there were no bilateral extradition arrangements between GPE and GPE and ORG had not been incorporated into domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prime Minister as the minister responsible for justice matters replied to the act . The Prime Minister rejected the applicant 's claim as frivolous and vexatious . He stressed that both GPE and GPE were parties to LAW even though the Convention had not been incorporated into domestic law . On the latter point , he noted that NORP law was already sufficiently equipped and adequate to implement GPE 's obligation under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At its next sitting on DATE , the applicant 's lawyer pleaded that ORG did not have jurisdiction to hear the case for extradition , that the provisional arrest warrant was therefore unlawful and that the applicant should be released . The prosecution disputed the applicant 's reasoning . The case was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the further hearing on CARDINAL DATE the applicant again pleaded that the NORP courts lacked jurisdiction to examine the extradition request as there was no extradition treaty in force between GPE and GPE and that LAW , although signed by GPE , had not been duly ratified in accordance with NORP law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the plea of lack of jurisdiction and declared that it had jurisdiction to hear the case . ORG took into account , in particular , the applicant 's argument according to which ORG had not been ratified as required by LAW . It observed , however , that the said LAW only provided for the ratification of certain treaties , indicated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The applicant argued that LAW fell under LAW , which imposed the ratification of any treaty affecting or concerning the relationship of GPE with any multinational organisation , agency , association or similar body . ORG could not accept such an interpretation , on the ground that LAW was binding for the GPE which signed it , but not for ORG . Therefore , it could not give rise to a relationship between GPE and ORG . The Magistrates ' Court moreover observed that LAW authorised arrest with a view to extradition of any person accused of an offence in a \u201c designated foreign country \u201d . As GPE had been designated foreign country by LAW DATE , the applicant 's deprivation of liberty could not be regarded as unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that there was no right of appeal at that stage of the proceedings under NORP law and that an appeal was only possible when a person was subject to an order committing him to custody to await his removal . Furthermore , the applicant had filed his appeal out of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the extradition proceedings were still pending , the applicant filed an application with ORG in its constitutional jurisdiction . He alleged that his case gave rise to violations of LAW ) and CARDINAL of ORG . The applicant based his claim on the words \u201c lawful arrest or detention \u201d of a person in connection with extradition proceedings . His main argument was that GPE had not duly ratified any international treaty giving the ORG \u201c legal authority \u201d to arrest him with a view to his extradition to GPE . As to his plea concerning LAW , the applicant stated that there was no possibility to have the legality of the detention for extradition examined before the case was decided and an appeal lodged .", "CARDINAL . The First Hall of the Civil Court listed the case for hearing on DATE . However , the case had to be adjourned to CARDINAL DATE to enable the applicant 's lawyer to produce witness evidence .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , ORG , under whose order the applicant was kept in detention , continued to hear the case , in anticipation of obtaining the relevant evidence to support the extradition request from GPE . The court had a DATE time - limit in which to conclude the hearings and render its decision . This period could be extended by further periods of up to a maximum of DATE by the President of the Republic .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the First Hall of ORG ordered that a lawyer be appointed for the applicant . According to the applicant , under domestic law any voluntary assumption of this mandate by the lawyer who filed the application to ORG would imply that the person assuming it would be personally responsible to the Government of GPE for all costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings . The applicant had no relatives in GPE . Furthermore , the lawyer acting on his behalf could not assume the position of a \u201c party \u201d in the proceedings had he applied to act as his lawyer in addition to being his legal representative since this would have raised serious issues of professional ethics . The acceptance of a voluntary mandate would make the lawyer personally involved in the proceedings as if it were his own case .", "CARDINAL . In the event , the applicant never gave a power of attorney to a legal representative in GPE to enable his claim to be dealt with by FAC . Furthermore , the applicant was never granted permission to enter GPE and the domestic court never ordered that permission be granted .", "CARDINAL .
