{"ITEMID": "001-4971", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "FREEMAN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . He is represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer working with PERSON , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "A.", "The applicant has been involved in the manufacture and distribution of erotic films since DATE . On DATE the applicant was convicted of murdering CARDINAL of his employees and sentenced to life imprisonment .", "The applicant was released on licence on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant was convicted on charges of conspiracy to publish obscene articles , procuring women to become prostitutes , procuring acts of gross indecency between men in public and possession of cannabis . He received a prison sentence . The Secretary of ORG , on the recommendation of ORG , revoked the applicant \u2019s licence with effect from DATE .", "The applicant was released on licence on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant was bound over for DATE following an altercation with another man in a GPE bookshop .", "In DATE the applicant was charged with theft , possessing an offensive weapon , threatening behaviour and possession of cannabis . The first CARDINAL charges were dropped . On DATE the applicant was cautioned for disturbing the peace and on CARDINAL DATE it was alleged that he had been seen standing on a mound overlooking a police office in a GPE park making provocative gestures while a woman filmed the scene from behind bushes .", "The applicant absconded to the GPE before his trial on the threatening behaviour and possession charges .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s licence was again revoked . The NORP authorities subsequently refused the request of the authorities of the respondent ORG that the applicant be returned to GPE , being of the opinion that the charges he faced in the NORP courts were not sufficiently serious to justify this .", "On DATE the applicant was deported to GPE following a renewed request to the NORP authorities based on different grounds . On his arrival in GPE the applicant was informed that the charges brought against him in DATE had been dismissed .", "The revocation of the applicant \u2019s life licence was confirmed by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused to recommend that the applicant be released or moved to open conditions on the grounds , inter alia , that he had committed a particularly brutal murder and although released twice on licence he had shown a marked disregard of his licence obligations .", "The applicant sought to challenge ORG decision by way of judicial review . The legal challenge was settled before a full hearing could take place on the judicial review application and in view of ORG undertaking to reconsider the applicant \u2019s case . Following the applicant \u2019s complaint to ORG about the delay in setting down a date for reconsideration of his application for release , ORG recommended on DATE the applicant \u2019s immediate release from prison without his having to spend a period of time in open conditions . In reaching its recommendation , ORG noted , inter alia , that reports on the applicant were positive and that it trusted that the applicant would remain firm in his resolution that \u201c he can be in the film business and stay within the law ... \u201d", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he had decided to accept ORG recommendation . However , he considered that :", "\u201c [ the applicant ] should spend DATE in open conditions before ... release where any outstanding work on [ his ] offending behaviour , including [ his ] attitude to pornography and drugs , can be carried out and , in light of [ his ] previous failure to comply with the conditions of [ his ] life licence , [ his ] future trustworthiness can be tested . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s solicitors made representations to the Secretary of ORG in respect of this decision . In a letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG replied to these representations stating that :", "\u201c [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour in absconding to GPE in DATE demonstrates his untrustworthiness and raises serious concerns about the likelihood of his abiding by the conditions of his life licence and probation service in the future . This aspect , together with his attitude to drugs ( a feature of the index offence and the incident in GPE in DATE when he was charged with the possession of cannabis ) and pornography , need to be tested in the more relaxed conditions of an open prison . \u201d", "For these reasons the Secretary of ORG affirmed that he was not prepared to alter his decision not to order the applicant \u2019s release until he had satisfactorily completed a DATE stay in open conditions .", "The applicant challenged the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE by way of judicial review proceedings .", "In a judgment handed down on DATE Mr Justice PERSON quashed the impugned decisions and ordered that the applicant \u2019s case be given urgent reconsideration by the Secretary of ORG . The judge held that :", "\u201c The question remains , however , whether the reasons advanced in setting a period of DATE as CARDINAL in which the question of the applicant \u2019s \u2018 trustworthiness\u2019 could effectively be tested requires the most anxious scrutiny . The reasons are tenuous in nature and capable of producing the appearance that the applicant is to be sentenced again for his conduct in breaching the terms of his previous life sentences when he has already been punished for those breaches by the period which he has served in custody since DATE . Any such reason would have to be condemned as unfair if not irrational , as being incapable of supporting the decision . As a \u2018 reason\u2019 it may also fail , because it is quite unrealistic to suppose that the extra period of DATE could have made the difference between the applicant being considered trustworthy as opposed to his present , and supposed , state of not being \u2018 ORG . It is trite law in the field of reasons that for such to be impervious to judicial interference they must be \u2018 proper , sufficient and intelligible\u2019 . In my judgment , the reasons advanced in support of the decision to require that the applicant , which must be regarded as a further DATE , as a minimum , fail the tests of propriety ( in the sense of fairness ) and intelligibility . They also fail to satisfy the test of particularity why the decision of ORG which was reached after a prolonged and careful investigation , was not accepted . \u201d", "In correspondence following the judgment , the Secretary of ORG expressed his disagreement with the court \u2019s judgment but nevertheless put in place arrangements for the applicant to be released immediately . The applicant was released on DATE .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "CARDINAL . Life sentences", "Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . Release on licence of prisoners serving mandatory life sentences", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( reproduced in section CARDINAL of ORG ) provides that the Secretary of ORG , if recommended to do so by ORG and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice , together with the trial judge if available , release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner .", "The power to release under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act can not be exercised unless the Secretary of ORG has first referred the case to ORG for its advice ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the Secretary of ORG may give ORG directions as to the matters to be taken into account in discharging its functions .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary gave directions to ORG concerning the release of mandatory life sentence prisoners . In those directions the ORG Secretary stated that the final decision on the release of a mandatory life prisoner rests with him and that the decision may be taken on grounds that go beyond the risk posed by the prisoner .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG made a statement in ORG explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners . The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence , the Secretary of ORG :", "\u201c will consider not only , ( a ) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and , ( b ) whether it is safe to release the prisoner , but also ( c ) the public acceptability of early release . This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice . \u201d", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG issued a statement in which he made clear that in the normal course of events a period in open conditions is vital in terms of testing the prisoner \u2019s suitability for release and in preparing him for a successful return to the community . He declared that it is therefore normally the practice to require a prisoner to spend a period in open conditions before release ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
