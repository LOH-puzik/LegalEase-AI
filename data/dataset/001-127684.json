NORP The lawyers submitted a statement of appeal in which they alleged that the lack of information about the fate of the applicants\u2019 relatives had been the result of an ineffective investigation .

Furthermore , it was a publicly known fact that the DATE excavation had uncovered the remains of CARDINAL people , of whom CARDINAL individuals had been identified . Among those identified were CARDINAL persons whose relatives had been complainants in the proceedings . The granting of victim status to the complainants would have allowed the identification of the remains with the use of genetic methods .

On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the judgment of DATE in its entirety .
