On DATE , after interviewing the father and mother both individually and together , and PERSON without her parents or her maternal grandmother being present , and the maternal grandmother and the father \u2019s partner individually , and performing a psychological examination of PERSON , the court psychologists drew up the following report :", "\u2018 PERSON is a communicative child of normal intellectual development for her age and above average intelligence . She is very attached to her father and mother , and the conflict between her parents is a source of some insecurity . She would like her parents to live closer together because she finds it difficult to understand why she has to live with her grandparents and not see her father or to accept this . She has a very good relationship with her father , who is very affectionate and attentive towards his daughter . Both [ the applicant ] and his ex - wife are affectionate and flexible parents and both invest in their daughter \u2019s upbringing and emotional security . The reasons for their separation were subsequently a source of substantial conflict between them , exacerbated by PERSON \u2019s maternal grandmother , who does not accept [ the applicant \u2019s ] lifestyle and unconsciously tries to keep him away from his daughter . To sum up , both parents are capable of overseeing their daughter \u2019s satisfactory psychoaffective development , but we do not feel that it is right for her to live with her grandmother , who exacerbates the conflict between the CARDINAL parties and fuels it by trying to keep [ the applicant ] away because she does not accept his lifestyle.\u2019", "CARDINAL . On DATE told the psychologist and her father that the latter \u2019s partner had asked her , while her father was out , to go into the bathroom with him , that he had locked the door and asked her to masturbate him ( she made gestures imitative of masturbation ) and then told her that she did not need to wash her hands and that she should not say anything to her father . The psychologist stated that the manner in which the child had related that episode had made her doubt the truthfulness of the story , which might have been suggested by repeated promptings . She added that while the daughter was describing the episode , the applicant had been understanding and asked for clarification , which confirmed that the father and daughter had a good relationship .", "CARDINAL . During the interview with the psychologist on DATE the child stated that she was still living with her maternal grandmother and that from time to time she stayed with her mother where she would sleep on a sofa in the living room because there was no bedroom for her .", "CARDINAL . In a report dated DATE , drawn up following a meeting between the daughter and her father , the psychologist concluded that \u2018 although PERSON has observed during her meetings with her father that he is living with another man , her parental images have been fully assimilated and she presents no problem relating to psychosexual identity , be it her own or that of her GPE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a psychiatrist , stated , after interviewing the boyfriend of [ the applicant ] , the child \u2019s father , that in his opinion the partner was well adjusted and of satisfactory emotional and cognitive development . He found nothing abnormal about the boyfriend either as an individual or in terms of his relationship with the child \u2019s father . He considered it wholly improbable that the episode related by the child , as described in paragraph DATE , had really occurred .", "CARDINAL . The final report drawn up by the court psychologists , dated DATE , indicated that PERSON was suffering from a degree of insecurity due in part to the conflict between her mother \u2019s side of the family and her father , and that she had a defensive attitude which manifested itself in a refusal to confront potentially stressful situations . The child is aware that her family opposes her meetings with her father , their opposition being justified by the child \u2019s description of an episode which had allegedly occurred between her and her father \u2019s boyfriend , GPE , in which GPE had asked her to masturbate him . With regard to that account , it is difficult to imagine how a DATE child could relate in detail an episode which had occurred DATE . The experts conclude in their report that the fact that PERSON had described in detail the above - mentioned masturbation episode did not mean that it had actually occurred . They reiterate that the father is a very affectionate father , full of understanding and kindness towards his daughter , while also imposing on her , satisfactorily and instructively , limits which were necessary and made her feel secure .", "The experts also reiterate that the child \u2019s mother is a very affectionate mother , but rather permissive , which is not conducive to a feeling of security , although she is capable of improving . They also conclude that it is not advisable for the child to live with her grandmother because the religious fanaticism present in her environment not only condemns the father , but excludes him on grounds of the individual and emotional choices he has made . This has contributed to sowing confusion in the child \u2019s mind and exacerbating her sense of conflict and anxiety , thus compromising her healthy psychoaffective development .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the following interim decision was given with the agreement of both parents : ( I ) M. could spend every DATE from TIME with her father , ( II ) to that end , her father would fetch her from her mother \u2019s house accompanied by her paternal grandmother and/or her paternal great - grandmother .", "CARDINAL . The mother did not allow her daughter to see her father on the terms fixed by the above - mentioned decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child psychiatry department of ORG decided that PERSON should be monitored because her feelings of anxiety were such as might inhibit her psychoaffective development .", "Those facts , found at first instance , are considered to have been definitively established , without prejudice to the possibility of considering a further factor in delivering this judgment . With regard to the other appeals , since the mother has not submitted any pleadings they are considered to be inoperative under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . Apart from the fact that factual evidence has not been submitted , these aspects appear to us to be sufficient to give a ruling here as we understand that the lower court ruled on the essential issue of the case , that is to which of the CARDINAL parents custody of the child should be awarded . The shortcomings in the decision referred to by ORG , although relevant , do not warrant setting it aside .", "Let us now examine the appeal :", "Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that in cases of divorce , judicial separation of persons and possessions , declarations of nullity or annulment of marriage , child custody , maintenance and the conditions of payment are governed by agreement between the parents , that agreement being subject to confirmation by the court ; confirmation is refused if the agreement is contrary to the child \u2019s interests , including the child \u2019s interest in maintaining a very close relationship with the non - custodial parent . Paragraph CARDINAL adds that , in the absence of an agreement , the court shall decide , while protecting the child \u2019s interests , including his or her interest in maintaining a very close relationship with the non - custodial parent , it being possible to award custody of the child to CARDINAL or other parent or , if CARDINAL of the cases provided for in DATE applies , to a third party or to an educational or welfare establishment .", "The Guardianship Act also deals with this point . LAW ) of that LAW provides that any award of parental responsibility must be in the child \u2019s interests .", "A judgment of ORG of DATE , summarised in ORG ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , states : \u2018 The Convention on the Rights of the Child \u2013 Resolution of DATE of ORG of the United Nations \u2013 proclaims with rare concision that children , for the full and harmonious development of their personality , require love and understanding ; they should , as far as possible , grow up under the protection and responsibility of their parents and , in any event , in a climate of affection and psychological and material security , with young children not being separated from their mother save in exceptional cases.\u2019", "We do not have the slightest hesitation in supporting that declaration , which fully corresponds to the realities of life . Despite the importance of paternal love , a young child needs the care which only the mother \u2019s love can provide . We think that PERSON , who is now aged DATE , still needs her mother \u2019s care . See on this point the judgment of ORG of DATE , in ORG no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , in which that court held that \u2018 in the case of young children , that is until DATE , the emotional tie to the mother is an essential factor in the child \u2019s psychological and emotional development , given that the special needs of tenderness and attentive care at this age can rarely be replaced by the father \u2019s affection and interest\u2019 .", "The relationship between PERSON and her parents is a decisive factor in her emotional well - being and the development of her personality , particularly as it has been demonstrated that she is deeply attached to her parents , just as it has been shown that both of them are capable of guiding the child \u2019s psychoaffective development .", "In the official record of the decision of CARDINAL DATE awarding parental responsibility , [ the applicant ] acknowledged that the appellant was capable of looking after their daughter and suggested that custody be awarded to the mother , a statement he repeated in the present proceedings to vary that order , as recorded in the transcript of the hearing of DATE , declaring that he wished to waive his initial application for custody of the child because she was living with her mother again . PERSON \u2019s father expresses the wish that his daughter not stay with her maternal grandparents , referring to the numerous difficulties he encounters when trying to see his daughter , given the conduct of the appellant and her mother who do all they can to keep him away from his daughter because they do not accept his homosexuality .", "Section CARDINAL of the Guardianship Act provides that previous arrangements can be varied if the agreement or final decision is not complied with by both parents or if subsequent circumstances make it necessary [ to vary ] the terms . Consideration needs to be given , however , to whether there is a justified ground for varying the decision awarding custody of the child to her mother .", "On examining the content of the initial application for a variation of the order it can be seen that emphasis is placed on the fact that the child was living with her maternal grandparents who are GPE \u2019s Witnesses . The truth of the matter , however , is that [ the applicant ] has not produced any evidence to prove that this religion is harmful and has merely stressed the GPE stubborn refusal to allow the father and daughter to see each other . To the ORG \u2019s knowledge , the beliefs of ORG Witnesses do not incite to evil practices , although fanaticism does exist .", "Are there adequate reasons for withdrawing from the mother the parental responsibility which was granted her with the GPE agreement ?", "There is ample evidence in this case that the appellant habitually breaches the agreements entered into by her with regard to the father \u2019s right to contact and that she shows no respect for the courts trying the case , since on several occasions , and without any justification , she has failed to attend interviews to which she has been summoned in the proceedings . We think , however , that her conduct is due not only to [ the applicant ] \u2019s lifestyle , but also to the fact that she believed the indecent episode related by the child , implicating the father \u2019s partner .", "On this point , which is particularly important , we agree that it is not possible to accept as proven that such an episode really occurred . However , we can not rule out the possibility that it did occur . It would be going too far \u2013 since there is no conclusive evidence \u2013 to assert that the boyfriend of PERSON \u2019s father would never be capable of the slightest indecency towards PERSON Thus , although it can not be asserted that the child told the truth or that she was not manipulated , neither can it be concluded that she was telling an untruth . Since there is evidence to support both scenarios , it would be wrong to give greater credence to CARDINAL than the other .", "In the same way , the accepted principle in cases involving awards of parental responsibility is that the child \u2019s interests are paramount , completely irrespective of the \u2013 sometimes selfish \u2013 interests of the parents . In order to establish what is in the child \u2019s interests , a court must in every case take account of the dominant family , educational and social values of the society in which the child is growing up .", "As we have already stated and as established case - law authority provides , having regard to the nature of things and the realities of DATE life , and for reasons relating to human nature , custody of young children should as a general rule be awarded to the mother unless there are overriding reasons militating against this ( see ORG judgment of DATE , in ORG no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In the instant case parental responsibility was withdrawn from the mother despite the fact that it had been awarded her , we repeat , following an agreement between the parents , and without sufficient evidence being produced to cast doubt on her ability to continue exercising that authority . The question which therefore arises , and this should be stressed , is not really which of the CARDINAL parents should be awarded custody of PERSON , but rather whether there are reasons for varying what was agreed .", "Even if that were not the case , however , we think that custody of the child should be awarded to the mother .", "The fact that the child \u2019s father , who has come to terms with his homosexuality , wishes to live with another man is a reality which has to be accepted . It is well known that society is becoming more and more tolerant of such situations . However , it can not be argued that an environment of this kind is the healthiest and best suited to a child \u2019s psychological , social and mental development , especially given the dominant model in our society , as the appellant rightly points out . The child should live in a family environment , a traditional NORP family , which is certainly not the set - up her father has decided to enter into , since he is living with another man as if they were man and wife . It is not our task here to determine whether homosexuality is or is not an illness or whether it is a sexual orientation towards persons of the same sex . In both cases it is an abnormality and children should not grow up in the shadow of abnormal situations ; such are the dictates of human nature and let us remember that it is [ the applicant ] himself who acknowledged this when , in his initial application of DATE , he stated that he had definitively left the marital home to go and live with a boyfriend , a decision which is not normal according to common criteria .", "No doubt is being cast on the father \u2019s love for his daughter or on his ability to look after her during the periods for which she is entrusted to his care , for it is essential that they do see each other if the objectives set out above are to be met , that is ensuring the child \u2019s well - being and the development of her personality . PERSON needs to visit her father if her feelings of anxiety and insecurity are to be dissipated . When children are deprived of contact with their father , their present and future development and psychological equilibrium are put at risk . The mother would be wise to try to understand and accept this if she is not to cast doubt on her own ability to exercise parental responsibility .", "At present , the failure to comply with the decision confirming the contact arrangements does not amount to a sufficient reason for withdrawing from the appellant the parental responsibility awarded to her by that decision .", "Accordingly , we reverse the judgment of the lower court as regards the child \u2019s permanent residence with her father , without prejudice to the father \u2019s right to contact during the periods which will be stipulated below .", "It should be impressed upon the father that during these periods he would be ill - advised to act in any way that would make his daughter realise that her father is living with another man in conditions resembling those of man and wife .", "For all the foregoing reasons ORG reverses the impugned decision and rules that the appellant , ORG , shall continue to exercise parental responsibility for her daughter , PERSON", "The contact arrangements shall be established as follows :", "CARDINAL .

To that end the father shall fetch his daughter from school at the end of classes on the DATE and bring her back on DATE TIME before classes start .", "CARDINAL .

The right to be different should not be treated as a \u2018 right\u2019 to be ghettoised . It is not therefore a matter of belittling the fact that [ the applicant ] has come to terms with his sexuality and consequently of denying him his right to bring up his daughter , but rather , since a decision has to be given , of affirming that it can not be declared in our society and in our era that children can come to terms with their father \u2019s homosexuality without running the risk of losing their reference models . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
