[ the applicant ] argues that the operative experiment and other operational - search measures were unlawful because such measures are permissible only with the aim of suppressing , preventing and investigating criminal offences of medium severity or more serious criminal offences . I suppose that at the time when the police made the decision to carry out the operative experiment and other operational - search measures against [ the applicant ] they had information that he had committed criminal offences classified as serious or especially serious under the law ( abuse of power , bribetaking ) .", "In the court \u2019s opinion , for ordering operational - search measures it is sufficient that there be some elements of a criminal offence , rather than the entire corpus delicti , permitting [ the police ] to make a preliminary rather than definitive classification of the offence ...", "The court is not convinced by [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments that the interception of his telephone communications was unlawful because the case file does not contain a judicial decision authorising this operational - search measure . The operational - search measure against [ the applicant ] was carried out in conditions of urgency .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG provides that a judge must be informed within twentyfour TIME of the commencement of operational - search activities in conditions of urgency and that judicial authorisation must be obtained within TIME , failing which the activities must be discontinued .", "The court agrees with [ the applicant ] that the case file does not contain a judicial decision authorising operational - search measures . At the same time it notes that a judge was informed about the operational - search measures within TIME and the measures were discontinued within TIME of their commencement , as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG .
