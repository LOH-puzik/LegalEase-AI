The third applicant stated in her first interview , on DATE , that she did not know whether her father had returned that night or not .

On DATE she again alleged abuse by her father that night . As a consequence , the second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 had pushed him down the stairs and disposed of the corpse along with the car . On DATE she changed her story once more , alleging that the hitting had taken place on the staircase and that her father \u2019s corpse had been cut into pieces and fed to the dogs . Afterwards she denied having seen anything at all . Finally she withdrew all confessions .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 , ORG , stated at his first interview that the first applicant had killed ORG with a club and that he had helped her to dispose of the corpse and the car in a pond near the village of ORG . He repeated this version several times until DATE . Then he alleged that he had hit ORG with a club , carried the corpse into the cellar , cut it into pieces , boiled the head in a pot and fed the pieces to the dogs . Later on he alleged that the first and the second applicants had participated in hitting ORG On DATE he changed his confession , and alleged that he alone had hit ORG in the neck . In DATE he withdrew all confessions .", "CARDINAL . After the withdrawal of their confessions , all the applicants alleged that they had made their confessions because the police officers had put pressure on them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were in pre - trial detention throughout the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the first applicant and the second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 PERSON of manslaughter and sentenced the first applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . The second and third applicants were convicted of having aided and abetted the manslaughter by omission and were sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 and DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment respectively . ORG was convinced that ORG had returned home drunk with his car that TIME , had been killed by the first applicant and the second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 , and had then been cut into pieces and fed to the dogs . The car had been destroyed in a scrap baling press . The second and third applicants had witnessed the killing without helping ORG court \u2019s findings with regard to the events of the crime were based on the testimony of the police officers who had interviewed the applicants and the second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 during the investigations . At that time neither ORG \u2019s corpse nor the car had been found .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicants\u2019 criminal liability ORG relied in detail on CARDINAL expert reports . The first report concerned the applicants\u2019 and ORG \u2019s mental health . It asserted that the first applicant had an intelligent quotient of CARDINAL and she therefore suffered from reduced mental capacity on the threshold of severe mental retardation ( Debilit\u00e4t i m Grenzbereich zur GPE ) , the second applicant had an intelligence quotient of CARDINAL which could be classified as a learning disability ( unterdurchschnittliche ORG i m Bereich der GPE ) , and the third applicant had an intelligent quotient of CARDINAL and she therefore suffered from reduced mental capacity as well ( Debilit\u00e4t ) . The second applicant \u2019s fianc\u00e9 , ORG was found to have an intelligence quotient of CARDINAL . The second report concerned the question whether their reduced mental capacity diminished or excluded their criminal liability , which was answered in the negative .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and ORG served their sentences : the first applicant until DATE , the second applicant until DATE and the third applicant until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG \u2019s corpse was found , sitting in his car at the PERSON barrage of the FAC in GPE a.d . GPE . A commissioned expert came to the conclusion that ORG had not been killed by blunt force to his head , backbone or rib cage . The corpse , which was in rather good condition considering the fact that it had been in the water for DATE , did not show any appearance of having suffered external force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants and ORG requested the reopening of the proceedings and claimed monetary compensation for wrongful detention on remand and imprisonment after trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the request to reopen the proceedings . On the applicants\u2019 and ORG appeal against this decision , ORG granted their request to reopen the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reopened the proceedings and subsequently held several hearings . The proceedings against the third applicant were separated from those of the first and second applicants and ORG due to her physical condition ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the first applicant and ORG of manslaughter and the second applicant of having aided and abetted manslaughter by omission .", "CARDINAL . In part B of the judgment ORG assessed the first and second applicants\u2019 mental health . It relied on CARDINAL expert opinions , which confirmed those obtained in the first set of proceedings , namely that the first applicant had an intelligence quotient of CARDINAL and the second applicant of CARDINAL and both therefore suffered from reduced mental capacity .", "CARDINAL . Part E of the judgment contained the reasons for the acquittal . The court expressed its conviction that ORG had arrived home at TIME The court was unable to establish what exactly had happened afterwards , but it was certain that one , some or all of the accused had acted in a way which had finally caused ORG \u2019s death during TIME . The court was unable to establish which of the accused had participated in these actions , how ORG \u2019s death had been caused and how the corpse and the car had come to be disposed of at the barrage of the GPE . As nothing pointed to suicide or death by violence on the way home , in the acquitting court \u2019s view ORG \u2019s death must have occurred after he arrived home . The fact that ORG had returned home had been confirmed by the applicants and ORG during the first set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicants\u2019 and ORG \u2019s statements could be used as evidence as there was nothing to indicate that prohibited methods of questioning had been used . In so far as the police officers had confronted the applicants in a few cases with incorrect facts , their method of questioning had to be considered as a minor attempt to mislead which did not interfere with the applicants\u2019 right to silence . The fact that the applicants had been interrogated as witnesses at the beginning of their first interview , and not immediately as suspects , did not lead to the inadmissibility of the statements as evidence either . Furthermore , throughout the proceedings neither the applicants nor their counsel had claimed specifically that the police officers had used illegal pressure during questioning . The general allegation in this regard was unsubstantiated and nothing in the course of the proceedings indicated that the police officers had used leading questions to obtain confessions . Furthermore , the videotaped reconstruction of the crime scene , which the court had viewed , had not given any impression of psychological pressure on the applicants\u2019 free will when talking about the crime .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate sections subsequent to the acquitting part of the judgment ORG also issued the decision concerning costs and expenses and the decision concerning compensation . The decision concerning costs and expenses was titled part F and the decision concerning compensation part ORG ordered the treasury to pay the costs of the proceedings but declined to reimburse the ORG legal costs and expenses in accordance with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further dismissed the applicants\u2019 monetary compensation claims with regard to their pre - trial detention and their imprisonment in accordance with LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungsma\u00dfnahmen , see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court found that these claims were to be rejected because the applicants had caused both their detention on remand and their imprisonment by culpable negligence . It argued that the applicants had acted with culpable negligence because they incriminated themselves by making either deliberately wrong statements , or statements which could be proved neither true nor false .", "CARDINAL . As to the confessions of the first applicant , the court held that the first applicant \u2019s statement of DATE , that she had lowered ORG \u2019s corpse and the car into a pond near the village of ORG , had been untrue because both the corpse and the car had been found at a barrage of the GPE . Furthermore , in DATE the first applicant had incriminated herself during the first set of proceedings when stating that ORG had returned home on TIME of his disappearance , while in DATE she had reported him missing . Thus she herself had created a strong suspicion that she had killed ORG As a result , she had caused the indictment and the judgment by culpable negligence . Regarding the question of whether her reduced mental capacity discharged the first applicant of culpable negligence , the court observed that she had been able to follow the court proceedings and had been capable of answering questions during the police investigations in DATE after thorough reflection . Her mental capacity was not such that she could not easily foresee that her statements would lead to the strong suspicion that she had killed ORG", "CARDINAL . In so far as on DATE the second applicant had admitted to having hit ORG \u2019s skull with a hammer , ORG found that this self - incrimination had been untrue because the expert who examined ORG \u2019s corpse had come to the conclusion that ORG \u2019s skull had been intact . As a consequence , the second applicant had created a strong suspicion against herself concerning ORG \u2019s death . Furthermore , the court found that the second applicant had incriminated herself by her statements when questioned on DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , even though the court was not able to determine whether these statements had been true or false . Despite her reduced mental capacity , ORG was convinced that in DATE the second applicant had been able to foresee that her statements would create a strong suspicion against her , because most of her self - incriminating statements had been very grave , repeated and given after having consulted her counsel . In the court \u2019s view , the commissioning of an expert on grounds of her reduced mental capacity had not therefore been necessary . Lastly , nothing indicated that these statements were made in response to unlawful questioning .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the third applicant was also acquitted of having aided and abetted manslaughter by omission for the same reasons as set out in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . ORG found that she had an intelligent quotient of CARDINAL and that she therefore suffered from reduced mental capacity . As regards the reimbursement of costs and compensation , the third applicant was awarded monetary compensation solely for DATE of her detention on remand . The acquitting court found that the third applicant caused both her detention on remand and her imprisonment by culpable negligence . Her statement of DATE , that ORG had killed ORG with a hammer and that the corpse had been cut into pieces and fed to the dogs , had been untrue because the corpse had been found at the barrage . Therefore , the third applicant had also created a strong suspicion against herself concerning ORG \u2019s death . Regarding her allegation that she had been sexually abused by ORG on TIME of his disappearance , the court could not determine whether this statement was true or false . However , since she had withdrawn these statements later on this was of only minor importance , because she had equally caused her indictment and imprisonment by culpable negligence . The court found that the third applicant \u2019s reduced mental capacity did not discharge her of culpable negligence . Despite this disability she had been able to express herself clearly and had incriminated herself gravely and repeatedly while advised by counsel . Nothing indicated that she had not been able to understand the importance and meaning of her statements . Furthermore , she made her statements in the presence of her counsel .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against ORG CARDINAL decisions to refuse monetary compensation and the reimbursement of legal costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( concerning the third applicant ) and DATE ( concerning the first and the second applicants ) ORG rejected the appeals against the refusal of monetary compensation for their imprisonment . The court pointed out that , when assessing whether the criminal proceedings and the convictions had been caused by culpable negligence , the point of view at the time of the first set of proceedings was decisive . A refusal of monetary compensation under LAW was limited to cases where the person concerned had acted with gross negligence . It was therefore not sufficient to draw a suspicion on oneself . The person concerned must have substantially influenced the criminal proceedings or the conviction by his conduct .", "CARDINAL . Applying these principles to the applicants\u2019 cases , ORG fully endorsed the legal reasoning of ORG in part G of the judgment concerning compensation . The alleged use of psychological pressure during the police questionings did not change this assessment . Even if there might have been such a situation , both the constancy and severity of the self - incrimination and the fact that the applicants had been represented by counsel during their various statements had to be taken into account . Furthermore , in view of the expert opinions commissioned in DATE and during the proceedings at issue nothing indicated that the applicants\u2019 criminal liability had been diminished or excluded at the time they had made their statements . ORG noted that during the hearings before ORG the court had received advice both from a psychologist and a psychiatrist . There had been no reason on the basis of the related request to take further evidence to obtain an additional psychological expert opinion in respect of the ORG statements during the first set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the decision dated DATE concerning the denial of compensation for the first and the second applicant ORG additionally mentioned that ORG had respected the applicants\u2019 right to be presumed innocent as guaranteed by LAW . It noted that ORG had been permitted to voice a remaining suspicion against the applicants , as long as it clearly stated that any remaining suspicion did not amount to a finding of guilt . These requirements were fulfilled because ORG , in stating that it was convinced that CARDINAL or all of the accused had caused ORG \u2019s death without being able to establish which of the accused and in what way , had not commented on the applicants\u2019 guilt but on whether the evidence before it left any suspicious circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further rejected the ORG appeal against the refusal of reimbursement of legal costs and expenses , fully endorsing ORG reasoning in its decision of CARDINAL DATE while referring to part F of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant complained of a violation of her right to be heard regarding both decisions of ORG . The second applicant lodged a motion to be heard and statement of objections ( NORP ) against ORG refusal to pay monetary compensation . The third applicant lodged a motion to be heard against the refusal of monetary compensation and statements of objections against the refusal to reimburse legal costs . All requests were rejected by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against ORG decisions denying compensation and reimbursement of costs and expenses . In so far as they have submitted , the second and third applicant only lodged constitutional complaints with ORG against ORG decisions refusing the reimbursement of legal costs and expenses . All the applicants alleged that ORG decisions violated their right to be heard , their right to be presumed innocent and their right to an effective remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the second applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint concerning the refusal of reimbursement of legal costs without providing reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaints concerning both the refusal to reimburse legal costs and the refusal to pay monetary compensation , without providing reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the third applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides , inter alia , that where the indicted accused is acquitted , his necessary costs and expenses shall be borne by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The indicted accused \u2019s necessary expenses shall not be charged to the ORG if the indicted accused caused the preferring of public charges by filing criminal information in which he claimed to have committed the offence with which he was charged . The court may dispense with charging the indicted accused \u2019s necessary expenses to the ORG if", "CARDINAL . he caused the preferring of public charges by falsely incriminating himself with regard to material points or in contradiction to his later statements or by concealing material exonerating circumstances despite having made a statement in response to the accusation , or .... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for damage caused , inter alia , by wrongful prosecution , detention on remand or imprisonment is covered by LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungsma\u00dfnahmen ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of that Act , a defendant is notably entitled to compensation for damage incurred by a criminal conviction if the conviction is quashed in re - opened proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a person who has been held in detention on remand may claim compensation if he was acquitted or if the proceedings against him were otherwise discontinued .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides that compensation under that LAW is ruled out if the accused caused the prosecution deliberately or by culpable negligence ( vors\u00e4tzliche oder grob fahrl\u00e4ssige PERSON ) . The latter is established when it has to be said of an accused that he himself prompted the criminal proceedings by behaving in a way which failed to take into account the elementary fact that such behaviour would obviously lead to criminal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
