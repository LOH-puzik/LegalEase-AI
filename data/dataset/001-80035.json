In his appeal , the applicant complained , inter alia , of the trial court 's refusal to order an alternative , independent analysis of the quality of the poppy - tar . He claimed that it was not a type of opium prohibited by law , but poppy - tar that had been buried for a long time and that moisture was known to destroy its morphine content . In support of his arguments about the quality of the poppy - tar , he noted that after the Second World War its owner , PERSON father , had been unable to sell it to an authorised buyer because it was of such poor quality . As it had not been properly stored its quality had deteriorated over time . He considered that a chemical analysis was necessary to determine the quality of the poppy - tar and proposed an institution which in his opinion had the equipment necessary to make the required analysis . He also complained that the expert examination of the opium had been performed by ORG which had then brought the criminal charges against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also argued that the offence had been set up by a police agent provocateur and would never have been committed without his intervention ( he claimed that the unidentified final buyer PERSON was that agent ) .

It also noted that it was known that the older the poppy - tar , the better it was for opium use . It further stated that the expert examination by the Bureau had been carried out properly and that the lower court had relied entirely on the ORG 's report and had therefore dismissed the applicant 's request for an alternative examination by another institution .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that although the identity of the final buyer of the opium had not been established , it was irrelevant to the applicant 's conviction : he had been convicted for having the opium in his possession and offering it for sale . It did not accept the applicant 's assertion that he had decided not to proceed with the offence , finding that the lower court had correctly based its findings on the applicant 's statements in the pre - trial proceedings in which he had described the whole event and had made a confession .
