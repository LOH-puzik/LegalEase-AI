He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was the Head of ORG ( nimismies , l\u00e4nsmannen ) .", "In DATE a detainee set fire to the department \u2019s holding cell . In the subsequent investigation against the detainee in question , it turned out that the fire alarm had not gone off because it had been deliberately deactivated , presumably by CARDINAL of the police officers . While the officer appointed to investigate the suspected criminal damage by the detainee was questioning CARDINAL of his colleagues as a witness , the applicant entered the investigation room . He read the text of the unfinished report and noticed that the witness had indicated the name of a fellow officer who had , to his mind , deactivated the fire alarm . The applicant felt that such an allegation was improper and , after a discussion between the CARDINAL persons present , that part of the witness statement was removed . The report was then finalised and it was read and signed by the witness .", "On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , accusing him of abuse of public office and , in the alternative , violation of official duty . As to the latter charge , she invoked LAW , LAW , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen , as amended by Act no . DATE ) , which was the general provision sanctioning violation of official duty . She also invoked section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG ( valtion virkamieslaki , statstj\u00e4nstemannalagen ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , which stipulated that a civil servant was to perform his or her duties properly and without delay and follow supervisory orders . She further invoked section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslagen , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by Act no . CARDINAL ) , according to which a report drawn up during questioning was not to be changed after the person giving the statement had checked it and any corrections and amendments requested by him or her had been made .", "The applicant denied the charges . He contended that his actions had not been contrary to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . On the contrary , in contributing to the removal of the allegation which in his view had been defamatory , he had fulfilled his official duty as the superior officer , as defined in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG . He also regarded the effects of his conduct as insignificant . In any case , the requirement of criminal intent was not met .", "During her closing arguments before ORG , the prosecutor claimed that the applicant should , at any rate , be convicted of negligent violation of official duty under LAW , LAW , of LAW .", "On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of violation of official duty , under LAW , LAW , of LAW and LAW , and sentenced him to a fine . According to the court he had , in his office as the Head of ORG , deliberately violated his official duty based on the provisions to be followed in official functions . The court found that , due to his intervention in the questioning , a statement already included in the report had been removed . As to the applicable legislation , the court stated that the general provision , LAW , LAW , of LAW , did not as such form a legal basis for a conviction . The actual substance of the official duty was to be found in other provisions or regulations . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant \u2019s actions had not been contrary to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as claimed by the prosecution . It did find , however , that section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG provided a sufficient legal basis for the conviction , as the applicant \u2019s conduct , in the given circumstances , could not be regarded as proper .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) relying mainly on his previous arguments . During the appeal proceedings the prosecutor renewed her charge concerning negligent violation of official duty . The applicant contested that charge , arguing that he had not been able to respond to it at first instance .", "On DATE ORG , having held an oral hearing , convicted the applicant of negligent violation of official duty under LAW , LAW , of LAW and section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG . It found that the applicant had acted carelessly rather than with criminal intent . It also reduced the amount of the fine by CARDINAL . As to the legal basis of the conviction the court reasoned its judgment as follows :", "\u201c According to section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG , a civil servant shall perform his or her duties properly and without delay and follow supervisory orders . In the legal praxis [ reference to ORG precedence no . PERSON ] , it has been held that the said provision , governing the general duties of public officials , does not have an independent status irrespective of other provisions . In the judicial literature the provision has been regarded as problematic in the light of the principle of legality , which includes the requirement of precision of criminal statutes . Criminal liability presupposes a breach of a clearly defined official duty . On the other hand , it has been expressed in the judicial literature that , in practice , it is impossible to describe all official duties in detail in legal provisions and regulations . However , one must always be able to deduce the more specific aspects of an official duty from some provision or regulation or at least from the established practice . ... \u201d", "\u201c The general principles to be followed in the pre - trial investigation are prescribed in sections DATE of LAW . For instance , those factors which are to be cleared up during the investigation are defined in these provisions . Further , sections DATE of LAW contain regulations about the procedure to be followed . According to those provisions a witness to the investigation , legal counsel of the person being questioned , his or her support person , guardian , trustee or other legal representative , the prosecutor and an interpreter may be present at the questioning , along with the questioner and the person being questioned . The statement given by the [ latter ] is recorded to the extent necessary , having regard to the issue under investigation . It is for the questioner to decide what , and to what extent , will be recorded in the report . The questioner must , however , always conduct the questioning in such a manner that the statement of the person being questioned is recorded according to his or her approval . Further , section CARDINAL of LAW provides that the use of any impropriate means or practices that affect [ a person \u2019s ] freedom of decision , will , memory or judgment , in order to obtain a statement leading for a specific direction , are forbidden . After the questioning the person being questioned shall be given an opportunity to check the report drawn up by the questioner , after which he or she shall be asked whether his or her account has been noted down correctly . The principle of impartiality is to be followed , which means that in the performance of official duties all persons must be treated equally ... \u201d", "\u201c Even though the above - mentioned provisions of LAW do not directly regulate the duties of [ the applicant ] as the superior officer , the general requirement of proper discharge of duties , as defined in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG means , in this case , that the provisions and principles concerning pre - trial investigation are to be followed . In this respect , regard is to be had to [ the applicant \u2019s ] position and the nature of his duties and what that necessarily entails . ORG finds that , in the light of the above general principles and the provisions concerning pre - trial questioning , it was not the duty of [ the applicant ] as the superior officer to intervene in the questioning conducted by his subordinate officer , not even in the form of a conversation . As a result of such a conversation the subordinate officer being questioned had asked that a part of his statement , already entered in the report , be removed . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) maintaining , inter alia , that he had been convicted without a sufficient legal basis . The substance of the official duty allegedly breached did not in his view transpire from those provisions of LAW referred to by ORG . He also contended that , in the appellate proceedings , the prosecutor had only demanded that he be convicted of negligent violation of official duty after the court had inquired whether she intended to do so . At no stage did the prosecutor modify the charges accordingly or indicate the applicable provision concerning that offence . He further argued that the prosecutor had never invoked any specific provision other than section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . As to the other provisions of LAW , ORG had at no point of the proceedings brought to the applicant \u2019s attention that it considered those provisions applicable to the case and that they could be relied upon for his conviction .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "LAW , article CARDINAL , of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c If a public official , when acting in his or her office , deliberately in a manner other than provided above in this chapter violates or fails to meet his or her official duty based on the provisions or regulations to be followed in official functions , and the act , when assessed as a whole , taking into consideration its detrimental and harmful effect and the other circumstances connected with the act , is not a petty crime , he or she shall be sentenced for violation of official duty to a fine or to imprisonment for at DATE . \u201d", "LAW , LAW , of LAW ( as amended by Act no .
