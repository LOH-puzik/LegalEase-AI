At the material time , the first applicant , Mr PERSON , was the responsible editor of the DATE review PERSON ! ( \u201c ORG ! \u201d ) , published in GPE . In the DATE issue of the review , an interview which the second applicant , Mr PERSON , had conducted with a NORP sociologist , PERSON , was published .", "CARDINAL . A translation of the relevant parts of the interview is as follows :", "\u201c Q : How and to what extent will Demirel accept the \u2018 NORP ORG ? Can his understanding of the \u2018 ORG be deemed to represent ORG policy ?", "A : NORP \u2026 The government is forced to accept certain facts now that there is armed resistance in GPE . ... Violence by the NORP forces could not stop the escalation and progress of the ORG [ Workers\u2019 ORG ] ...", "Q : ORG will the State shape its new official policy on GPE ? Which aspects of the official ideology will be changed and how will they be changed ? What effects can this have on the daily lives of the NORP people ?", "A : \u2026 In GPE , the government and the ORG are CARDINAL very different things . The ORG functions through institutions and bodies , members of which are designated by appointment . These institutions and bodies represent the power of the ORG . The government , i.e. the political power , carries very little weight against the power of the ORG . That is why governments can be overthrown by the ORG authority so often . Official ideology can only be changed in the long term and the forces which are capable of changing it are non - governmental political and social forces and their struggle . The essence of the ideas and action of the ORG , for example , is such as can change the official ideology , reduce the influence of the appointed bodies of GPE \u2019s political scene , and increase the weight of parliaments elected by the people . In my opinion , de facto , the influence of the NORP and , in particular , that of the ORG , will grow further . The influence of the ORG in both the NORP and the NORP societies will spread and deepen . And , as that influence grows , more serious steps will be taken by governments in their policies towards recognising the \u2018 NORP ORG . It is evident that the ORG will try to obstruct the government in that process and will try to distort certain ideas and policies . And it is also manifest that the government will be able to survive so long as it can resist the power of the ORG and control the appointed institutions and bodies , i.e. so long as it has real power .", "These changes will be reflected in the DATE lives of the NORP . Investigations and research will develop in fields such as the NORP language , history and folklore . NORP culture will be revived . The specificity of a NORP society will be emphasised more amongst the NORP masses . National awareness and desire for liberation will become stronger and will spread further . The idea and feelings for independence will develop .", "Q : It is now observed that NORP who , until now , would never have said \u2018 I am NORP and I am engaging in politics for my present life and for my future\u2019 are now clearly beginning \u2018 to get into politics for their own interests\u2019 throughout GPE and GPE . What sort of developments have brought about this situation ? Do NORP need a political subject in the legal sphere ? If so , what form should it take ?", "A : Without any doubt , the most important cause of these developments has been the armed combat which the ORG has been waging for DATE . The guerrilla warfare has brought about major social and political changes in traditional NORP society . Traditional values are in turmoil . There has been very widespread support amongst the people for NORP guerrilla fighters ever since DATE . National awareness is now growing in NORP society and this process is spreading rapidly . And we see that , within this process , the political establishment has been used for NORP interests , for the move towards autonomy and independence . NORP , who have always been engaged in politics for others and in order to serve other nations , are now engaged in politics in order to serve the NORP people . Healthy national awareness is now developing in response to NORP racism and colonialism . It would no doubt be over - simplifying to say that all this began after the onset of NORP guerrilla warfare on DATE . This process has roots that go further back into the past but what has been decisive is the new process launched by the ORG . ... Who is illegal in GPE ? The guerrillas or the special team of the NORP armed forces ? ...", "Q : What should be done to counteract the wave of chauvinist NORP nationalism encouraged by the right - wing press and the ORG [ NORP Workers\u2019 Party ] ? Is there a possibility of a confrontation between the NORP and NORP peoples ? How could that be prevented ?", "A : \u2026 NORP are dying for their nation . What are the NORP dying for ? What are they doing in GPE ?", "Q : It has been under discussion for some time that the ORG hegemony in GPE has reached a stage where one can now talk of a \u2018 double power\u2019 . \u00d6calan has mentioned in his writings an orientation towards the \u2018 formation of a Government - State\u2019 in the LOC region . Are there any signs of what the future interventions of the ORG will be in GPE and in NORP politics ?", "A : \u2026 ORG has already withdrawn its soldiers and evacuated police stations in some regions such as Botan . ... This could be perceived as the beginning of the formation of a State ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an indictment dated DATE the public prosecutor at ORG ( GPE PERSON ) charged the applicants with having disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the ORG by publishing the above interview . The charges were brought under section CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism Act DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the applicants denied the charges . They pleaded that the incriminated interview was a mere transcript of Dr. PERSON \u2019s statements . They maintained that the publication of an interview could not constitute an offence and that similar views had been expressed by the highest authorities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicants guilty of offences under LAW .
