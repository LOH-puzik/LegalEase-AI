The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were all reservists who had been drafted by ORG in connection with ORG intervention in GPE . They remained in military service DATE , and were thus entitled to a certain per diem , as recognised in a number of decisions and orders of DATE signed by the then Chief of ORG . These decisions and orders were themselves based on the relevant bylaws adopted in accordance with the armed services legislation , specifically the Rules on Travel and Other Expenses in ORG ( PERSON o naknadi putnih i drugih tro\u0161kova u PERSON ) as amended in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , following the demobilisation the Government refused to honour their obligation to the reservists , including the applicants .", "CARDINAL . NORP The reservists subsequently organised a series of public protests , some of which ended in open confrontation with the police . Ultimately , following protracted negotiations , on DATE the Government reached an agreement with some of the reservists , in particular those residing in the municipalities of GPE , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and ORG , whereby the latter were guaranteed payment in CARDINAL DATE instalments . This payment was to be effected through their respective municipalities , aggregate sums having been specified per each municipality . The said municipalities were chosen because of their \u201c underdeveloped \u201d status , implying the reservists\u2019 indigence . For their part , the reservists in question accepted to renounce all of their outstanding claims based on their military service in DATE which were still pending before the civil courts , as well as any other claims in this connection . It was , lastly , stipulated that the criteria for the distribution of the \u201c financial aid \u201d in question shall be set out by a Commission consisting of local government representatives and the representatives of the reservists themselves .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , just like all other reservists without a registered residence in the listed municipalities , could not benefit from the agreement of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants therefore filed a civil claim against the respondent ORG , seeking payment of their per diems and alleging discrimination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in LOC ruled against the applicants . In so doing , it acknowledged the valid legal basis of their claim but noted that , as pointed out by the respondent , the applicable prescription period had been DATE as of their demobilisation , in accordance with LAW . The ORG claim had thus been filed out of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in LOC upheld this judgment on appeal , and it thereby became final . In its reasoning ORG noted that both the DATE and the DATE prescription periods provided in LAW had already elapsed before the applicants filed their civil claim ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Having been served with ORG decision , on DATE the applicants lodged a further appeal with ORG ( Ustavni sud ) . Therein they maintained , inter alia , that the impugned judgment of ORG in GPE was inconsistent with numerous judgments adopted by the other appellate courts in GPE \u2013 i.e. the district courts ( okru\u017eni sudovi ) while they existed , as well as the high courts and the appeals courts ( vi\u0161i i apelacioni sudovi ) thereafter DATE which on the same facts applied a longer , DATE , prescription period and thus ruled in favour of the plaintiffs ( see LAW at paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants also referred to the agreement concluded between the Government and some of the reservists of CARDINAL DATE , which agreement excluded all of the remaining reservists including themselves .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings before ORG are still pending .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the first instance and appellate courts across GPE ruled both in favour of the reservists in a situation such as the ORG and against them , relying on the DATE / DATE or the DATE prescription periods respectively .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE and DATE , ORG adopted CARDINAL legal opinions ( pravna shvatanja ) , both of which implied that the applicable prescription period should be DATE pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . It was also alleged by the Government that ORG had adopted a further legal opinion on the matter in DATE , to the same effect but in more specific terms , but no such opinion has ever been published in its official ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE various appellate courts substantively ruled in compliance with ORG opinions of DATE and DATE ( see , for example , the decisions of ORG in GPE , PERSON . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG in PERSON , PERSON . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , ORG of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG in GPE , PERSON . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ; as well as ORG in GPE , G\u017e . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , DATE of DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE there were also a number of decisions where the appellate courts ruled against the reservists , albeit on a different ground . Specifically , their claims , unlike the claims of the applicants in the present case , were rejected as administrative in nature , and as such outside the competence of the civil courts ( see the decision of ORG in GPE G\u017e . CARDINAL of DATE , as well as the decisions of ORG in GPE G\u017e . CARDINAL , ORG and PERSON of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in ORG adopted a default judgment in favour of a reservist ( ORG . CARDINAL ) . According to the information provided by the parties , there is no evidence that this judgment had ever become final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government endorsed the agreement of CARDINAL DATE , and decided to pay to the municipalities in question the amounts specified therein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government set up a working group tasked with addressing the requests of all other reservists , i.e. those not resident in the said CARDINAL municipalities . However , having discussed the issue with various groups of reservists , this working group ultimately concluded that their demands were not acceptable , inter alia , because : ( i ) they had not harmonised or specified their requests ; ( ii ) some of their representatives had had dubious standing to represent them ; ( iii ) there had been a lack of ORG funds which could be used for this purpose ; and ( iv ) in most cases , war per diems had already been paid to the reservists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commissioner for ORG ) , an Ombudsman - type office established on the basis of LAW ( published in OG RS no . CARDINAL ) , considered the complaints brought by an organisation representing the interests of reservists in a situation such as the applicants\u2019 . In so doing , she concluded that they had been discriminated against on the basis of their registered residence , i.e. as non - residents of the CARDINAL privileged municipalities , and recommended to the Government to take all necessary measures in order to ensure that all reservists be afforded the payments recognised by their decision of DATE . The Government was also invited to provide the Commissioner with an appropriate \u201c action plan \u201d within DATE . In its reasoning , the Commissioner \u2019s decision noted , inter alia , that the payments in question were per diems , notwithstanding that the Government had chosen to consider them as social benefits awarded to persons in need ( socijalna pomo\u0107 ) , and that this was best exemplified by the fact that the reservists in question had had to renounce their legal claims concerning the per diems as well as the fact that the individual reservists resident in the CARDINAL municipalities at issue were never under an obligation to prove their indigence ( imovinsko stanje i socijalnu ugro\u017eenost ) . This being so , there was clearly no objective and reasonable justification for the differential treatment of reservists merely on the basis of their residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ministarstvo rada i socijalne politike ) noted that the discussions should continue with the various groups of reservists and that , if possible , financial support should be offered to the most indigent among them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ekonomije i regionalnog razvoja ) sent a memorandum to ORG ( ORG pravde ) , stating , inter alia , that there were numerous employment - related civil suits , brought against current or former socially - owned companies , which could endanger the country \u2019s economic stability . It thus urged ORG to review the possibility of advising the courts to suspend certain types of these suits until DATE , as well as to desist from the enforcement of any final judgments already adopted in these proceedings . According to numerous media reports , having received it , ORG forwarded the memorandum to ORG ( PERSON ) , which then faxed it to the presidents of the appellate courts for information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the public that it had rejected the recommendation of ORG . In so doing , it noted , inter alia , that the NORP judiciary was independent of the executive as well as the legislative branches of Government .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to equal legal protection , without discrimination .", "All direct or indirect discrimination based on any grounds , particularly on the grounds of race , sex , national or social origin , birth , religion , political or other opinion , property status , culture , language , age , mental or physical disability shall be prohibited . \u201d", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to ... [ a fair hearing before a ] ... tribunal ... [ in the determination ] ... of his [ or her ] rights and obligations ... \u201d", "\u201c Equal protection of rights before the courts of law ... shall be guaranteed . \u201d", "\u201c A constitutional appeal may be lodged against individual decisions or actions of ORG bodies or organisations exercising delegated public powers which violate or deny human or minority rights and freedoms guaranteed by LAW , if other legal remedies for their protection have already been exhausted or have not been prescribed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected CARDINAL separate constitutional appeals lodged by reservists who were in a situation such as the applicants\u2019 . The said court noted , inter alia , that the civil courts\u2019 decisions rendered against them , respectively , had been \u201c based on the applicable domestic legislation \u201d . The appellants , however , never specifically complained about the inconsistency of the relevant case - law or being discriminated against ( U\u017e . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and U\u017e . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in another case such as the applicants\u2019 , ORG , inter alia , effectively ignored a complaint about the differential treatment of the CARDINAL groups of reservists stemming from the agreement of DATE . In particular , it offered no substantive assessment of the issue raised by the appellants , noting further that they had not offered adequate proof as regards the existence of inconsistent case - law on the matter ( U\u017e . GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in yet another case such as the applicants\u2019 , ORG ruled against the appellants as regards their complaint about the outcome of their case before the lower courts . There was no reference in the decision itself to the agreement of DATE and it remains unclear as to whether this issue was ever raised by the appellants ( U\u017e . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a case such as the applicants\u2019 but where the civil courts had rejected the reservists claims as being outside of their competence ratione materiae ( see , for example , paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG ruled in favour of the appellants who had alleged inconsistent case - law ( between the judgments adopted in their cases and several other judgments adopted by the courts in DATE ) and ordered that the impugned civil proceedings be re - opened . As regards the NORP discrimination complaint , ORG reasoned that the said inconsistency did not amount to discrimination since the impugned court decisions had not been rendered on the basis of the appellants\u2019 personal status ( li\u010dnog svojstva ) . There was also no reference in the court \u2019s reasoning to the agreement of DATE ( U\u017e . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In decision U\u017e . CARDINAL , adopted on DATE , and decisions U\u017e . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , all adopted on DATE , as well as in decisions U\u017e . CARDINAL , DATE , ORG , CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , rendered between DATE and DATE , ORG noted the existence of inconsistent domestic case - law in the civil context and then went on to find that this had been in breach of the principle of judicial certainty as an integral part of the appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial . The appellants\u2019 complaints to the effect that the same situation had also resulted in discrimination against them , was rejected by ORG as manifestly ill - founded , since the impugned court decisions had not been rendered on the basis of the appellants\u2019 personal status . No re - opening of the proceedings was ordered . The above - cited decisions concerned matters which were factually unrelated to the applicants\u2019 situation in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that all parties shall be entitled to the equal protection of their rights .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL sets out the circumstances in which a default judgment ( presuda zbog izostanka ) may be adopted , based on , inter alia , the respondent \u2019s failure to appear before the court despite being duly served with the summons .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that a case may be reopened if ORG has in the meantime rendered a judgment in respect of GPE concerning the same or a similar legal issue .", "CARDINAL . Article QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that a meeting of a division ( sednica odeljenja ) of ORG shall be held if there is an issue as regards the consistency of its case - law . Any opinions ( pravna shvatanja ) adopted thereupon shall be binding for the panels ( ve\u0107a ) of the division in question .", "CARDINAL . These Rules set out the relevant details concerning the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with military service .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that courts may not , in the course of proceedings before them , take into account negative prescription periods unless an objection to this effect has been made by the debtor .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL states that the general negative prescription period for civil claims shall be DATE , unless provided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that the negative prescription period for seeking civil compensation shall be DATE as of when the claimant learned of the damage in question , but that , in any event , the absolute deadline shall be DATE as of when the damage occurred .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL provide , inter alia , that the running of a negative prescription period shall be interrupted by the debtor \u2019s acceptance of the claim at issue , directly or indirectly , as well as by the claimant \u2019s lodging of a civil action in this respect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that the effect of such an interruption shall be that the applicable period shall start running anew as of the debtor \u2019s acceptance of the claim in question and the conclusion of the civil suit , respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held , inter alia , that , quite apart from the competence of the administrative authorities in respect of the reservists\u2019 claims concerning their per diems , civil courts shall have jurisdiction to rule on the merits in all related cases where they seek damages ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) based on the ORG \u2019s alleged malfeasance ( pravno shvatanje ORG odeljenja ORG utvr\u0111eno na sednici od CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG essentially reaffirmed the opinion of CARDINAL DATE , extending its application to certain other \u201c military entitlements \u201d .
