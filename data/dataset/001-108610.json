When such a sentence is imposed , it is the current practice , in the majority of cases , for the trial judge to set a minimum term of imprisonment which must be served before the prisoner is eligible for release on licence . GPE , however , \u201c a whole life order \u201d may be imposed by the trial judge instead of a minimum term . This has the effect that the prisoner can not be released other than at the discretion of the Secretary of ORG . ( The power of the Secretary of ORG to release a prisoner is provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . ) The Secretary of ORG will only exercise his discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated ( see Prison Service Order CARDINAL set out at paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the entry into force of the DATE Act , it was the practice for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the trial judge but for the Secretary of ORG , after receiving recommendations from the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice , to decide the minimum term of imprisonment which the prisoner would have to serve before he would be eligible for early release on licence . This was also referred to as the \u201c tariff \u201d part of the sentence and was taken to represent the minimum period which the prisoner was required to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence .", "It was open to the Secretary of ORG to impose a whole life tariff on a prisoner . In such a case , it was the practice of the Secretary of ORG to review a whole life tariff after DATE imprisonment to determine whether it was still justified , particularly with reference to cases where the prisoner had made exceptional progress in prison ( see PERSON at paragraph DATE below ) .", "With the entry into force of LAW ( and , in particular , section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL to the Act ) , all prisoners whose tariffs were set by the Secretary of ORG have been able to apply to ORG for review of that tariff . Upon such an application ORG may set a minimum term of imprisonment or make a whole life order .", "CARDINAL . This case concerns CARDINAL applicants who , having been convicted of murder in separate criminal proceedings in GPE and GPE , are currently serving mandatory sentences of life imprisonment . All CARDINAL applicants have been given whole life orders : in the first applicant \u2019s case this order was made by the trial judge under the current practice ; in the case of the second and third applicants , who were convicted and sentenced prior to the entry into force of the CARDINAL LAW , the orders were made by ORG . All CARDINAL applicants maintain that these whole life orders , as they apply to their cases , are incompatible inter alia with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . The facts of the applications , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a work colleague , with a minimum term of DATE . He was released on licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . He began living with a woman who was to become the victim of his second murder offence . The couple married on DATE . On DATE the first applicant was involved in a fight in a public house and charged with affray ( using or threatening unlawful violence ) . His licence was revoked and he was recalled to prison . In DATE , having pleaded guilty to the charge of affray , he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . He was released on licence again in DATE and returned to live with his wife and her CARDINAL children . The couple became estranged and the first applicant left the marital home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant followed his wife to a public house . He had been drinking and had taken cocaine . The couple argued and the wife \u2019s daughter , who was present , telephoned the police to alert them to the dispute . The first applicant ordered his wife to get into a car . When the daughter tried to get into the car to protect her mother , the first applicant forcibly removed her . He then drove off with his wife . When the police telephoned her to ascertain if she was safe , the first applicant forced his wife to tell them that she was fine . The first applicant also telephoned the police to tell them that his wife was safe and well . TIME he gave himself up to the police , telling them that he had killed her . A post - mortem examination revealed that the deceased had a broken nose , deep and extensive bruising to her neck ( which was consistent with attempted strangulation ) , and CARDINAL stab wounds to the chest . CARDINAL knives were found at the scene , one of which had a broken blade .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant pleaded guilty to murder and instructed his counsel not to make any submissions in mitigation lest it add to the grief of the victim \u2019s family . The trial judge considered that the first applicant fell into that small category of people who should be deprived permanently of their liberty . He passed the mandatory life sentence and made a whole life order .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE . It considered the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence ( as set out in schedule CARDINAL to the DATE Act : see relevant domestic law and practice below ) . It found that , given the circumstances of the offence , there was no reason whatever to depart from the normal principle enshrined in schedule QUANTITY that , where murder was committed by someone who was already a convicted murderer , a whole life order was appropriate for punishment and deterrence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant \u2019s parents , his adoptive sister and her CARDINAL young children were shot and killed . The second applicant was subsequently charged and , on DATE , convicted of the murders . The prosecution \u2019s case was that the murders were premeditated and planned and had been committed for financial gain . It was also alleged that the second applicant had arranged the crime scene so as to mislead the police by making it appear as if his adoptive sister had killed the family and then herself .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge recommended to the Secretary of ORG that the second applicant serve CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment \u201c as a minimum \u201d ( his underlining ) . On the trial judge \u2019s letter to the Secretary of ORG , the Lord Chief Justice added the comment \u201c for my part I would never release him \u201d . In DATE , the Secretary of ORG imposed a whole life tariff . The practice at the time was not to inform the prisoner of this decision . By letter dated DATE , the applicant was informed that the Secretary of ORG had concluded that the requirements of retribution and deterrence could only be satisfied by the second applicant remaining in prison for the whole of his life .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the entry into force of section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL to LAW , the second applicant applied to ORG for review of the whole life tariff . Having regard to schedule CARDINAL to the LAW , ORG concluded that , given the number of murders involved and the presence of premeditation by the second applicant , the offence plainly fell within that category of cases where the appropriate starting point was a whole life order . Having further regard to statements submitted by the GPE next - of - kin and submissions by the second applicant , including reports as to the behaviour and progress he had made in prison , ORG found that there was no reason to depart from the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the Secretary of ORG . It therefore imposed a whole life order .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed to ORG , which dismissed the appeal on DATE . The court found that , when the Secretary of ORG had set a whole life tariff in DATE , he had been provided with CARDINAL different judicial recommendations : CARDINAL from the trial judge recommending a minimum term of DATE and CARDINAL from the Lord Chief Justice recommending that the second applicant should never be released . The Secretary of ORG had been entitled to choose between those recommendations or to adopt neither of them . ORG also found that the whole life order imposed by ORG was not only correct but , for the purposes of punishment and retribution , fully justified .", "CARDINAL . Relying on its previous judgment in NORP v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it found that no issue arose under LAW as the whole life order was not an irreducible life sentence as that term had been used in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ... Finally , following its ruling in R v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) it found that the review procedure created by LAW was compatible with LAW as , properly construed , the relevant statutory provisions meant a prisoner could not be disadvantaged by the outcome of the review : the term to be served could be reduced , or maintained , but it could not be increased or extended .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant applied to ORG to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG . That application was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant was convicted after trial in FAC at GPE of CARDINAL counts of murder . The victims were homosexual men and the applicant , himself a homosexual , was alleged to have committed the murders for his own sexual gratification . Each victim was stabbed many times with a large combat knife which the third applicant had bought for that purpose . The first victim was attacked in his home on DATE . Soon after , on DATE of DATE , the third applicant met his second victim in a bar and arranged to take him home for sex ; he instead took him to a forest , stabbed him to death and left the body there . The third victim was stabbed in the caravan where he lived on DATE . Finally , shortly before DATE , the third applicant went to a beach which was well - known for homosexual trysts . He met the fourth victim on the beach and stabbed him there .", "CARDINAL . Blood from the first and third victims was found on the third applicant \u2019s jacket and on the knife . Property from DATE and fourth victims was found in his possession . He made extensive admissions about all CARDINAL murders to the police . The police had been unaware of the second victim until the third applicant mentioned him to them . The body was recovered from the forest with his assistance . At trial , the applicant \u2019s defence was that the murders had been committed by someone else , though he admitted to having been present at all the murders save for that of the second victim .", "CARDINAL . After the third applicant was convicted , the trial judge passed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment and recommended to the Secretary of ORG for ORG that , in his view , the applicant should never be released . Upon review , the Lord Chief Justice reported that he thought the minimum period before eligibility for release should be set at DATE . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG decided to set a whole life tariff .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL to LAW DATE , the third applicant applied to ORG for review of the whole life tariff set by the Secretary of ORG . In its judgment of DATE ORG rejected the third applicant \u2019s submission that it should accept the Lord Chief ORG \u2019s recommendation of a minimum term of DATE . It found that , while weight should be accorded to that recommendation , the Lord Chief Justice did not have regard to the principles set out in schedule CARDINAL as ORG was required to do . It also rejected the submission that an issue arose under LAW given that a whole life tariff had been set by the Secretary of ORG . ORG found that the procedure for applying to ORG under section CARDINAL and schedule CARDINAL of the Act provided the necessary independent review as to whether a prisoner should be released . The court also found that a whole life order would be compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . Having regard to the general principles for determining the minimum term of a mandatory life sentence ( as set out in schedule CARDINAL to the Act ) , no issue of arbitrariness arose and whether such a sentence was disproportionate depended on the facts of each case .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that , since the case involved the murder of CARDINAL or more persons , sexual or sadistic conduct and a substantial degree of premeditation , under schedule CARDINAL the starting point was a whole life order . There were no mitigating features and even the Lord Chief Justice , in recommending a minimum term of DATE , had shared the trial judge \u2019s view that it might never be safe to release the third applicant . There were no reasons , therefore , to mitigate the starting point of a whole life order . ORG added that , even if the starting point were a minimum term of DATE , the aggravating features of the murders were such as to make a whole life order appropriate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the third applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that ORG was not only entitled , but clearly right , to conclude that a whole life order was appropriate .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the third applicant , in order to allow him to appeal to ORG , then applied to ORG to certify that its judgment concerned a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG . On DATE , he was informed by ORG that , because ORG had refused his application for permission to appeal against sentence ( as opposed to granting permission to appeal against sentence and then dismissing the appeal ) , an application to certify a point of law for ORG could not be made .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE , the mandatory life sentence for murder is contained in section CARDINAL ) of ORG Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . The power of the Secretary of ORG to set tariff periods for mandatory life sentence prisoners , as contained in LAW of LAW DATE , was found by ORG to be incompatible with LAW ( PERSON ) v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . This led to the enactment of LAW DATE and schedules CARDINAL and CARDINAL to that Act .", "CARDINAL .

The punitive element was represented by the tariff term , imposed as punishment for the serious crime which the convicted murderer had committed . The preventative element was represented by the power to continue to detain the convicted murderer in prison unless and until ORG , an independent body , considered it safe to release him , and also by the power to recall to prison a convicted murderer who had been released if it was judged necessary to recall him for the protection of the public ( Lord GPE of Cornhill at paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "ORG therefore held firstly , that the appellant \u2019s complaints were not of sufficient gravity to engage LAW and secondly , that the life sentence was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to LAW .

Lord PERSON also observed : \u201c there is nothing logically inconsistent with the concept of a tariff by saying that there are cases were the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of retribution and deterrence \u201d ( p.

It also found that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence would not itself constitute a violation of LAW but rather that a potential violation would only occur once the offender had been detained beyond the period that could be justified on the ground of punishment and deterrence . The court observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While under LANGUAGE law the offence of murder attracts a mandatory life sentence , this is not normally an irreducible sentence . The judge specifies the minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the offender \u2019s release on licence can be considered . Where a whole life term is specified this is because the judge considers that the offence is so serious that , for purposes of punishment and deterrence , the offender must remain in prison for the rest of DATE . For the reasons that we have given , we do not consider that the GPE court has ruled that an irreducible life sentence , deliberately imposed by a judge in such circumstances , will result in detention that violates article CARDINAL . Nor do we consider that it will do so .", "CARDINAL . It may be that the approach of the GPE court will change . There seems to be a tide in LOC that is setting against the imposition of very lengthy terms of imprisonment that are irreducible . Thus it may become necessary to consider whether whole life terms imposed in this jurisdiction are , in fact irreducible .", "...", "Under the regime that predated LAW it was the practice of the Secretary of ORG to review the position of prisoners serving a whole life tariff after they had served DATE with a view to reducing the tariff in exceptional circumstances , such as where the prisoner had made exceptional progress whilst in custody .

If , however , the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment , we can see no reason why , having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the LAW , the Secretary of ORG should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner .", "DATE . For these reasons , applying the approach of the GPE court in PERSON v GPE DATE , we do not consider that a whole life term should be considered as a sentence that is irreducible . Any article QUANTITY challenge where a whole life term has been imposed should therefore be made , not at the time of the imposition of the sentence , but at the stage when the prisoner contends that , having regard to all the material circumstances , including the time that he has served and the progress made in prison , any further detention will constitute degrading or inhuman treatment .", "CARDINAL .

The transitional measures set out in schedule CARDINAL were found by ORG to be compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention in R v. Pitchfork [ DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL . The schedule expressly provided that the outcome of the High Court review could not be an increase in the minimum period set by the Secretary of ORG . It was not in breach of LAW to direct ORG to consider the general principles set out in schedule CARDINAL : neither those principles nor the original recommendations by the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice were to enjoy primacy over the other . Instead , ORG was conducting a fresh review , taking account of both the judicial recommendations and schedule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON CARDINAL ORG held that protection of the public was not a relevant factor in fixing the minimum term , since it was the task of ORG to ensure that the offender was not released after serving the minimum term unless this presented no danger to the public . The court also held :", "\u201c A whole life order should be imposed where the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally high that just punishment requires the offender to be kept in prison for the rest of his or her life . Often , perhaps usually , where such an order is called for the case will not be on the borderline . The facts of the case , considered as a whole , will leave the judge in no doubt that the offender must be kept in prison for the rest of his or her life . Indeed if the judge is in doubt this may well be an indication that a finite minimum term which leaves open the possibility that the offender may be released for DATE of his or her life is the appropriate disposal . To be imprisoned for a finite period of DATE or more is a very severe penalty . If the case includes CARDINAL or more of the factors set out in para.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) it is likely to be a case that calls for a whole life order , but the judge must consider all the material facts before concluding that a very lengthy finite term will not be a sufficiently severe penalty . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Upon an application to ORG , the whole life tariff was substituted by a minimum term of DATE imprisonment . That decision was reviewed by ORG , which increased the minimum term to DATE imprisonment . ORG also observed that it remained open to ORG to consider the recommendation of the trial judge and Lord Chief Justice in their contemporaneous context but , as in any case , the findings and views of the trial judge represented a critical element in any sentencing decision . The recommendations were not subsidiary to the provisions in schedule CARDINAL and paragraph CARDINAL ) of schedule CARDINAL made it clear that proper weight should be given to these recommendations in the review process .

In NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . NORP ( NORP ORG the Court of Appeal stated that schedule CARDINAL provided an even more rigorous approach to the determination of the minimum term than had applied previously and , when followed , would in some cases lead to longer minimum terms . However , in that case , which concerned a sentence passed after the commencement of the DATE Act in respect of a murder committed before its commencement , the court went on to state that the scheme was compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , given the transitional measures contained in paragraph CARDINAL of schedule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . GPE requested the extradition of GPE from GPE to stand trial in GPE on CARDINAL counts of murder in the first degree . In his appeal against extradition , Mr GPE argued that his surrender would violate LAW , on the basis that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the form of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole .", "CARDINAL . In giving judgment in ORG ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) , Lord Justice Laws found that there were \u201c powerful arguments of penal philosophy \u201d which suggested that risk of a whole - life sentence without parole intrinsically violated LAW . He observed :", "\u201c The abolition of the death penalty has been lauded , and justified , in many ways ; but it must have been founded at least on the premise that the life of every person , however depraved , has an inalienable value . The destruction of a life may be accepted in some special circumstances , such as self - defence or just war ; but retributive punishment is never enough to justify it . Yet a prisoner \u2019s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death . He can never atone for his offence . However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life , his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath . Like the death sentence the whole - life tariff is lex talionis . But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner ( the only virtue of the lex talionis ) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment , for the whole - life tariff is arbitrary : it may be measured in DATE or DATE according to how long the prisoner has to live . It is therefore liable to be disproportionate \u2013 the very vice which is condemned on LAW unless , of course , the death penalty \u2019s logic applies : the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for .

However , the values underlying section CARDINAL could form part of the balancing process engaged under section CARDINAL .

The harsher sentences the appellants might receive if convicted in GPE were among the factors militating against their surrender but they had offered no evidence or case - law to back up their assertions that the possible sentences would shock the conscience of NORP .

In PERSON , cited above , the court held that LAW also prohibited the imposition of life imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide . The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the sentence . Although a ORG was not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a non - homicide crime , it had to provide some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation . The court also held that a sentence lacking in legitimate penological justification ( such as retribution , deterrence , incapacitation and rehabilitation ) was , by its nature , disproportionate . Such purposes could justify life without parole in other contexts , but not life without parole for juvenile non - homicide offenders .", "DATE .

In PERSON v. the State of GPE [ DATE ] UKPC CARDINAL the appellant had been sentenced to death .

ORG considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE , cited above , and found that the safeguards available in GPE to prevent PERSON from being without hope of release were not available in GPE . ORG had interpreted such a sentence as condemning PERSON to penal servitude for the rest of his life and the provisions of the relevant legislation on parole and remission did not apply . This meant the sentence was manifestly disproportionate and arbitrary and so contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW ( provisions to secure protection of law , including the right to a fair trial ) . It had also been argued by the appellant that the mandatory nature of the sentence violated section QUANTITY ( the prohibition of torture , inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment ) . In light of its conclusion on section CARDINAL , the ORG considered it unnecessary to decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release under section CARDINAL ( the presidential prerogative of mercy ) . It did , however , find that the safeguards available in GPE ( in the form of the Attorney - General \u2019s powers to recommend release and the President \u2019s powers to commute sentences or decree release ) were not available in GPE . It also acknowledged the appellant \u2019s argument that , as with the mandatory sentence of death it had considered in PERSON , a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment did not allow for consideration of the facts of the case .
