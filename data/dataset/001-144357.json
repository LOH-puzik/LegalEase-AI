The applicant was born in DATE and is serving a prison sentence in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a search of the applicant \u2019s flat was carried out . He was then charged with drug trafficking . The applicant was kept in police custody until DATE , when he was released on undertakings of good behaviour and to not leave town .", "CARDINAL . NORP In separate proceedings , on DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of causing bodily harm to another person . On DATE he admitted the charge , allegedly under duress . According to the applicant , lawyer PERSON , assigned to represent him , was not present at the interview and signed the record later on . However , there was no mention of counsel \u2019s name in the list of visitors in the detention centre . On CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON , LOC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) authorised the applicant \u2019s continued detention and stated that he \u201c had indeed committed a very serious offence \u201d . The applicant was charged with causing bodily harm resulting in the victim \u2019s death . On DATE , the police took him to a hospital and required him to undergo a blood test .", "CARDINAL . The applicant confirmed his earlier confession in ORG \u2019s presence during an on - the - spot interview , which was recorded on video . On an unspecified date , the applicant terminated ORG \u2019s representation of him . A new lawyer , PERSON , was appointed for the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking . In DATE ORG issued a decision admitting the applicant \u2019s mother , PERSON , as the applicant \u2019s lay defender in the appeal proceedings concerning the drug - trafficking conviction . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered a retrial .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of causing bodily harm resulting in the victim \u2019s death . However , on DATE ORG quashed this judgment , considering that the trial court had wrongly allowed the reading out of a pre - trial witness statement , despite the defence \u2019s objection and in the absence of the applicant . Thus , the appeal court ordered a retrial and that the applicant be held in custody pending it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention , referring to the gravity of the charges against him and the risk that he would continue criminal activity , if at large .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG decided on a complaint brought by the applicant and imposed a disciplinary penalty on ORG , the applicant \u2019s former lawyer , apparently , in relation to the drug - related case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the case about drug trafficking to the prosecutor . On DATE the prosecutor joined the criminal cases against the applicant . On DATE the investigator dismissed a number of motions lodged by the defence . In particular , the investigator stated that PERSON could no longer act as the applicant \u2019s lay defender , since the decision to admit her to the proceedings issued in DATE had concerned only the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the joined cases were submitted for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Hearings were held on DATE and DATE . On the latter date Judge PERSON stripped PERSON of her lay - defender status in the criminal proceedings against her son , because she had been interviewed as a witness in the bodily harm case .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the case was assigned to a trial panel of CARDINAL judges , including Judge PERSON as the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant sought the withdrawal of Judge PERSON from the case , arguing bias on account of , inter alia , the judge \u2019s statement in the detention order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and his failure to ensure decent conditions of detention pending retrial or to issue permission for a visit from the applicant \u2019s mother . The judge refused to withdraw from the case , stating that the trial court was not competent to deal with the issue of conditions of detention and that the trial court \u2019s competence as regards visits was limited under LAW of LAW to the period following delivery of the trial judgment . While admitting that the remark in the detention order was \u201c unfortunate \u201d , the judge stated it did not contain any information to the effect that he had an \u201c interest in the outcome of the criminal case \u201d . ORG upheld the judge \u2019s refusals to withdraw .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a renewed challenge by the applicant , on DATE the matter was submitted to the remaining CARDINAL judges on the trial panel . They considered that there were no reasons for Judge PERSON to withdraw from or to be removed from the criminal case against the applicant . In particular , they stated that LAW required \u201c compelling reasons \u201d for refusing a visit by a next - of - kin to a detainee . They concluded , however , that there was no evidence that any such visit had been refused without valid reason in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the case against the applicant on charges of drug trafficking , because the prosecutor had dropped the charges .", "CARDINAL . As to the remaining charges of causing bodily harm , the trial panel noted the defence \u2019s challenge to the expert report concerning the victim \u2019s injuries and granted its request for another expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of causing bodily harm resulting in the victim \u2019s death and sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment . The court relied on several witness statements , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial confession and his on - the - spot interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction and sentence .", "CARDINAL . In or around DATE the applicant sought statutory compensation payable by the ORG to individuals who have been acquitted of criminal offences or in respect of whom the charges have been dropped . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claims in part as regards pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage . On DATE ORG ordered a retrial in respect of the pecuniary claims . The award in respect of the non - pecuniary claim became final . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s pecuniary claim in part . On DATE ORG , considering that the applicant \u2019s presence at the appeal hearing was not necessary , upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant sought supervisory review of the above judgment , challenging the factual and legal findings made by the courts and their refusal to confirm his right to compensation on account of his prosecution on drug - trafficking charges . Having heard the applicant , on CARDINAL DATE the Presidium of ORG amended the judgments of DATE and DATE recognising his right to compensation . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s remaining complaints as unfounded . He received a copy of the supervisory - review ruling on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for early release from prison . In his letter , which was sent to ORG of GPE , he asked that the necessary supporting documents be requested by the court from the prison administration . It appears that this letter reached ORG on DATE . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE , a judge of ORG informed the applicant of the refusal to examine the application . The letter read as follows :", "\u201c Hereby I return your application for early release as it requires amendment . Certain necessary documents were not enclosed with it , namely the prison \u2019s reports on your personality and disciplinary penalties , as well as certificates relating to employment , your medical and psychiatric conditions ...", "No court decision [ on your application ] may be issued in the absence of these documents . \u201d", "The applicant did not appeal , as he was not provided with a copy of any formal decision .", "CARDINAL . Instead , the applicant resubmitted his application to ORG , this time with some supporting documents . During the hearing , which took place before another ORG judge , the prison administration expressed their disagreement with his application , considering it to be premature . By a judgment of DATE that ORG judge examined the applicant \u2019s request . While acknowledging that the applicant had already served CARDINAL of the sentence , the court rejected the application , referring inter alia to the fact that the applicant had received several penalties for violations of the internal prison regulations , including CARDINAL placement in a punishment cell . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant lodged numerous complaints , initiated proceedings against lawyer PERSON and various public officials accusing them of criminal offences , contesting criminal proceedings against him or complaining about the conditions of his detention ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint , alleging that during the search of his house in DATE one of the officers had taken him into the bedroom and had pushed him against the wall . On DATE an investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings on account of the alleged ill - treatment . In DATE the matter was examined and a new refusal was issued by a deputy prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE . By a judgment of DATE , ORG confirmed this refusal to prosecute . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in Talovskiy Temporary Detention Centre ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which was attached to Talovskiy police station , on numerous occasions DATE for periods at times in excess of DATE . The applicant was also held in the ORG on several occasions DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , although he was alone in the cell , no arrangements were made for a proper bed and bedding . Neither were there any facilities for taking a bath or shower or for outdoor exercise . He was given CARDINAL meal a day . The walls were rendered with shuba , a coarse type of concrete , designed to prevent detainees from leaning on the walls . The cell windows were covered with metal shutters blocking access to fresh air and natural light .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had bronchitis and allegedly failed to receive appropriate treatment . In DATE he attempted suicide and self - harmed , being unable to stand the appalling conditions of detention and the duration of his placement in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the conditions of detention in the ORG improved DATE , when he was allowed to take a shower and DATE outdoor exercise and was provided with CARDINAL meals a day .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was also kept in FAC no . CARDINAL . According to him , at times , CARDINAL detainees were held in a cell with QUANTITY beds ; thus the cell measurements were below the required international and even national standards .", "CARDINAL . In his observations before the ORG , the applicant further argued that he had been kept in a cell measuring QUANTITY m. together with CARDINAL other detainees . On average , the cell accommodated QUANTITY or QUANTITY detainees although it only had CARDINAL bunk beds . At times , it accommodated CARDINAL detainees . The applicant enclosed diagrams of cells CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , which , according to him , measured QUANTITY m. and had CARDINAL beds each . He also provided several written statements from individuals who had been kept in the remand centre for varying periods DATE , at times in the same cell(s ) as the applicant . For instance , T. submitted that on some occasions DATE detainees had been kept in cells measuring CARDINAL sq . m. with CARDINAL beds . Another detainee stated that cell no . CARDINAL had CARDINAL beds but accommodated , sometimes , CARDINAL detainees ; they had to take turns to sleep during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Drawing on the statements from other detainees , the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued in the observations that the cells had lacked mandatory ventilation although many detainees smoked , and , at times , the temperature there went up to QUANTITY The toilet in the cells was separated in the main area by a metal bar of QUANTITY in height , which did not provide sufficient privacy . Sometimes , there was no water supply in the drainage system , so the use of the toilet had to be limited in order to reduce unpleasant smells . The cells were infested with flies , cockroaches and bugs .", "CARDINAL . In reply to the applicant \u2019s initial complaint relating to the cell sizes and insufficiency of beds , the respondent Government submitted a certificate signed on CARDINAL DATE by the acting chief officer of the remand centre . This certificate listed the cells in which the applicant had been kept for varying periods since DATE ( cells nos . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully complained to various public authorities about the conditions of his detention in the Talovskiy ORG . These complaints were forwarded to ORG for examination . By letters of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and DATE ORG rejected his complaints as unfounded . It indicated that the applicant \u2019s repeated placements in the temporary detention centre were due to logistical difficulties with transferring him between Talovskiy ORG and ORG , which were a considerable distance apart . On DATE and DATE as well as on DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s renewed complaints as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . By letters of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , the President of ORG declined jurisdiction to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaints about his repeated and prolonged detention in the Talovskiy TDC , including his complaints about the physical conditions of detention there .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , ORG informed the applicant that his earlier complaints had been examined by the district prosecutor , who had issued decisions dated DATE , DATE and DATE confirming unspecified violations in relation to the conditions of detention in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is now detained in prison no . CARDINAL , located in GPE in LOC . According to him , the living area of the prison measures QUANTITY and houses CARDINAL detainees ; the artificial lights in the dormitory are insufficient ; the food is bad .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant received visits in the remand centre from his mother , PERSON", "CARDINAL . Around DATE the applicant started to complain that he was no longer receiving visits from his mother . According to the Government , she did not come to the remand centre and did not request any visits at that time ; nor did she lodge any complaints of visits being refused .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , Judge PERSON of ORG stated that LAW did not require a court decision in response to the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning family visits . LAW did not necessitate a request for such a visit to be granted ; the decision on whether to authorise such a visit remained within the discretion of the authority dealing with the criminal case . LAW provided that visits could be authorised following delivery of the trial judgment and before its enforcement .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE the President of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed complaint . He indicated that family visits could be allowed under LAW after pronouncement of a trial judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to ORG that a police officer ( apparently , the officer in charge of ORG ) was refusing to allow visits from his mother . This complaint was forwarded to ORG for examination . In DATE the district prosecutor dismissed the complaint from the applicant , stating that while PERSON had been accepted in DATE as a lay defender in the appeal proceedings concerning the drug - trafficking case against the applicant , this case had been joined to the second case pending before ORG . The prosecutor noted that ORG had not yet issued any decision accepting PERSON as a lay defender in the joined cases .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG about the refusal to allow visits from his mother . This complaint was forwarded to ORG . By letter of DATE , the President of ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c I consider that section CARDINAL of LAW does not require the court \u201c dealing with the criminal case \u201d to grant applications for the authorisation of visits . Such visits may be authorised depending on the circumstances relating to the criminal proceedings . Following the quashing of the judgments [ in respect of the applicant ] on appeal and the decision to order a retrial , the retrial has not started yet . LAW requires the court to grant visits from next - of - kin following delivery of the trial judgment ... PERSON had been accepted as [ the applicant \u2019s ] lay defender , in addition to counsel , and was granted permission to pay visits to [ the applicant ] ... LAW does not require the court to issue any additional authorisations for visits ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to ORG in DATE . This complaint was forwarded for examination to ORG . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the district prosecutor dismissed his complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant tried to lodge an appeal before ORG in relation to the above letter of DATE . By letter of DATE , Judge PERSON refused to process the applicant \u2019s appeal against the letter . The judge indicated that a letter was not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted to the ORG a statement made by his mother . She affirmed that on several occasions during DATE she had been afforded the opportunity to talk for a short time with the applicant through a metal partition , because there was no meeting room in GPE TDC . DATE she had lodged CARDINAL requests before Judge PERSON ORG seeking authorisation for a meeting with the applicant in the ORG . In her requests , she referred to her next - of - kin status rather than her position as a lay defender in the criminal proceedings . The judge had dismissed her requests orally without issuing any formal decision which would be amenable to appeal . Her similar requests to the President of ORG were also dismissed . She had presented the decision of DATE to the chief officer of the Talovskiy police station but he had demanded a recent court order . Apparently , her ensuing complaints against the officers had not been processed by ORG . DATE and DATE no permission had been granted for her to visit as a lay defender ( which would have had the benefit of visits not being limited in frequency and duration , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG received the applicant \u2019s application form dispatched , by registered mail , on DATE from ORG no . CARDINAL ( as indicated on the envelope ) .
