THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 3;No violation of Art. 14+5;Just satisfaction not applied", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The tragic and lasting crisis in GPE lies at the root of the present case . In order to combat what the respondent Government describe as \" the longest and most violent terrorist campaign witnessed in either part of the island of GPE \" , the authorities in GPE exercised from DATE until DATE a series of extrajudicial powers of arrest , detention and internment . The proceedings in this case concern the scope and the operation in practice of those measures as well as the alleged ill - treatment of persons thereby deprived of their liberty .", "CARDINAL . Up to DATE , on the figures cited before the Commission by the respondent Government , CARDINAL people had been killed , CARDINAL injured and CARDINAL worth of property destroyed during the recent troubles in GPE . This violence found its expression in part in civil disorders , in part in terrorism , that is organised violence for political ends .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE the whole of the island of GPE formed part of GPE . In DATE , following a treaty of DATE , legislation was passed which endorsed the setting - up , with self - governing status within GPE , of ORG comprising initially all of the island \u2019s CARDINAL counties . Provision was made for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL counties of the province of GPE in the north to opt out and remain within GPE and they did this in DATE . Thereafter , ORG became responsible for the government of the remaining CARDINAL counties and , in DATE , a new LAW was introduced proclaiming the independence and sovereignty of the ORG of what is now known as GPE . After the Second World War it left the ORG and declared itself a republic .", "CARDINAL . From the DATE \u2019s onwards , GPE , that is the above - mentioned CARDINAL counties , had a separate Government and ORG of its own . In addition , the electorate of the province ( meaning in this judgment the CARDINAL counties ) returned CARDINAL members to ORG . With certain defined matters excepted , ORG were the legislative and executive authorities for the CARDINAL counties until DATE when the GPE authorities resumed \" direct rule \" of the province ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE is not a homogeneous society . It consists of CARDINAL communities divided by deep and long - standing antagonisms . CARDINAL community is variously termed NORP , ORG or ORG , the other is generally labelled as NORP , NORP or NORP . CARDINAL of the population of CARDINAL belong to the NORP community , the remaining third to the NORP community . The majority group is descended from NORP settlers who emigrated in large numbers from GPE to GPE during DATE . The now traditional antagonism between the CARDINAL groups is based both on religion and on social , economic and political differences . In particular , the NORP community has consistently opposed the idea of a united GPE independent of GPE , whereas the NORP community has traditionally supported it .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( IRA ) is a clandestine organisation with quasi - military dispositions . Formed during the troubles prior to the partition of the island and illegal in GPE as well as in GPE , the IRA neither accepts the existence of GPE as part of GPE nor recognises the democratic order of GPE . It has periodically mounted campaigns of terrorism in both parts of the island of GPE and in GPE . After DATE , the ORG was not overtly active for DATE .", "During the time covered by the complaints of the applicant Government that is from DATE to DATE virtually all those members of the IRA living and operating in GPE were recruited from among the NORP community .", "CARDINAL . Legislation designed to deal with matters affecting law and order and the security of the ORG was first enacted by ORG in DATE in the form of ORG ( GPE ) . This legislation ( hereinafter referred to as \" GPE \" ) was an enabling LAW were from time to time made and brought into operation . Thus , for instance , a LAW dating from before DATE declared illegal certain organisations , including the IRA . In DATE , following raids carried out by the IRA in GPE and GPE , Regulations were introduced granting powers of entry and search . In DATE and DATE , in order to combat an IRA campaign then being launched , further Regulations were made dealing with internment , curfew , special trial procedures , firearms and explosives control , and restriction on movement . An account of the particular Regulations at issue in the present case , namely LAW , DATE ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , appears below at DATE .", "CARDINAL . The differing aspirations of the CARDINAL communities resulted in the division between the main political parties in GPE being based primarily on their attitude to the status of the province as part of GPE rather than on political differences of the type commonly found in the rest of GPE and elsewhere . The NORP community in general voted for ORG , which wished GPE to remain within GPE , whilst the NORP community in general supported candidates favouring a united , independent GPE . Given the relative sizes of the CARDINAL communities , the inevitable result of this polarisation was that ORG , supported almost exclusively by NORP , had a permanent majority in ORG and formed the Government of the province throughout DATE leading up to direct rule in DATE . The abolition of proportional representation in DATE and the geographical arrangement of constituencies affected a great increase in the size of the Parliamentary majority . This situation understandably disenchanted the NORP community .", "CARDINAL . Thus , whilst only a small minority of the latter community has ever actively supported the ORG , a very much greater proportion had always been discontented with NORP government and the effects of its in - built majority . The NORP in the population regarded themselves as discriminated against on various counts . ORG , a body appointed by ORG in DATE to report , inter alia , on the causes of disturbances in the CARDINAL counties in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , considered justified many of the grievances then felt by the NORP , in particular those concerned with the allocation of houses , local authority appointments , limitations on local electoral franchise and deliberate manipulation of ward boundaries and electoral areas . ORG itself came to the conclusion that there certainly was an element of inherent bias in the whole political system in GPE in favour of CARDINAL community .", "From the time of partition onwards there has always been a greater or lesser degree of tension between the CARDINAL communities , although since DATE there have been no disturbances comparable in scale to those of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first moves towards a campaign for \" civil rights \" for the NORP community began to be made . The objectives of this campaign were , broadly speaking , the removal of the discrimination referred to above .", "At the same time , though , manifestations of NORP violence began to emerge . In DATE there was serious rioting in GPE following a NORP march . In DATE , several petrol bombs were thrown at NORP schools and property . In DATE , a body calling itself ORG ( ORG ) , previously unknown to the police , issued a statement declaring war on the ORG and warning of its intention to execute all IRA men . Shortly thereafter , CARDINAL NORP were murdered and CARDINAL others seriously wounded in GPE . CARDINAL NORP , members of the ORG , were subsequently charged and convicted for these attacks . The ORG , believed by the police to have consisted of CARDINAL persons , was declared illegal in DATE and seems to have remained inactive from then until DATE .", "During this period , there was no violent activity of significance by the ORG , who , after DATE , appear to have concentrated on political activity .", "CARDINAL . Throughout DATE , the movement for \" civil rights \" for the NORP community gathered momentum . The first civil rights march took place in DATE without incident , but in DATE a clash with the police and CARDINAL days\u2019 rioting ensued after a march in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG announced a reform programme to deal with the NORP grievances . Nevertheless , the civil rights movement continued its campaign and marches . The marches again led to clashes with the police and to violent confrontation with NORP counter - demonstrators , often armed with cudgels , stones and the like .", "CARDINAL . The demonstrations , disturbances and rioting continued in various places into DATE . In paragraph CARDINAL of its report , presented to ORG in DATE , ORG expressed the view that certain NORP extremist organisations \" must ... bear a heavy share of direct responsibility for [ certain of ] the disorders ... and also for inflaming passions and engineering opposition to lawful , and what would in all probability otherwise have been peaceful , demonstrations or at least have attracted only modified and easily controlled opposition \" . Police conduct in handling certain disturbances was also criticised by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , CARDINAL major explosions thought to have been caused by the ORG occurred at water and electricity installations in CARDINAL counties . Units of NORP troops were flown into the province .", "The GPE Prime Minister , whose reform policies were unpopular with many NORP , resigned at DATE . DATE , his successor declared a general amnesty for persons charged with or convicted of offences connected with the recent political protests and demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . Tension remained high ; sectarian disturbances continued periodically up to DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , a traditional NORP anniversary parade sparked off DATE of large - scale rioting , first of all in GPE and thereafter spreading to GPE and other places . After CARDINAL civilians had been killed and QUANTITY civilians and CARDINAL policemen wounded , it was found necessary to call in aid units of the NORP army .", "The riots in DATE greatly exceeded in severity any that had occurred in DATE . Casualties and damage to property were extensive . In GPE , for instance , a large number of houses and licensed LOC , mostly NORP owned or occupied , were burnt down , destroyed or damaged .", "CARDINAL . The GPE Prime Minister called a peace conference on DATE which was attended by representatives of the CARDINAL communities . On DATE , GPE and ORG issued a joint declaration re - affirming , inter alia , their commitment to reforms in the CARDINAL counties .", "In DATE , a programme of reform was announced ; it included the reorganisation of the police force and local government , measures to prohibit discrimination in public employment , and the establishment of ORG and a central housing authority .", "CARDINAL . However , the publication of a government report into the functions and organisation of the province \u2019s police force had produced a violent reaction in NORP circles . On DATE , a policeman was shot dead by a bullet fired from a crowd of NORP rioters in GPE . He became the first member of the security forces to be killed during the disorders of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The IRA carried out no major acts of violence in DATE . However , at GPE DATE they had reactivated their forces , placing all volunteers on full alert . At the same time , the IRA are thought to have gained much more support as a result of the riots and of an accompanying loss of confidence by NORP in the police .", "Towards DATE , the IRA split into CARDINAL wings . For some time there had been dissension in the movement between those who hoped to bring about a form of socialist people \u2019s republic for all GPE and those who considered that such involvement deflected the ORG from its traditional aims . The traditionalists formed themselves into the Provisional IRA whilst the followers of the new political doctrines became ORG . Both factions remained organised along military lines .", "CARDINAL . The situation worsened in DATE . The number of explosions recorded by the police jumped dramatically from a total of CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE . Some explosions were caused by ORG - CARDINAL according to statistics cited by the ORG - but there is no dispute that the majority were the work of the ORG . In total , CARDINAL civilians and QUANTITY policemen were killed during the course of DATE . None of these deaths was attributed by the police to NORP activity .", "CARDINAL . The terrorist campaign by the ORG appears to have begun in earnest in DATE and to have been CARDINAL primarily of bombing buildings and attacking the security forces . There was also undoubtedly some terrorist activity on the part of ORG , directed largely against politicians seen as hostile to Unionism and against NORP owned or occupied property , particularly licensed LOC . Responsibility for certain explosions was in fact claimed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The sharp increase in what may be termed terrorist - type activity was not accompanied by the cessation of inter - communal street disturbances which continued sporadically during DATE and accounted for the deaths of a number of people .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the violence intensified , being marked by a dramatic upsurge in terrorist activity by the IRA . Police statistics record a total of CARDINAL explosions , including CARDINAL for DATE . Shooting at the security forces\u2019 patrols built up and for the first time soldiers numbered amongst those killed . By DATE , CARDINAL soldiers , QUANTITY policemen and QUANTITY civilians had died since DATE . In addition , serious and prolonged rioting occurred in both NORP and NORP areas .", "Apart from CARDINAL explosion in which a civilian was killed , there is no evidence of any deaths or even injuries having been caused by NORP terrorists . On the applicant ORG \u2019s own approximate estimate , NORP explosions accounted for CARDINAL out of the overall total of CARDINAL . Furthermore , as in DATE , NORP terrorists used mainly pipe bombs which were not very powerful in comparison with the devices employed by the IRA .", "The ORG stated in its report that the IRA were indisputably responsible for the very great majority of the acts of violence during this period . NORP terrorist activity had declined ; there is no evidence that such NORP terrorism as did exist formed part of a highly organised campaign in the sense that IRA activity did . The ORG \u2019s conclusion was that the threat and reality of serious terrorism came almost exclusively from the IRA .", "CARDINAL . On the political front during DATE and DATE , progress was made in implementing the reforms announced in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Prime Minister of GPE , however , resigned in DATE . In DATE , his successor proposed a number of further steps designed to provide a positive role for representatives of the minority community in the actual process of government .", "CARDINAL . It was against the background outlined above that on CARDINAL DATE ORG brought into operation extrajudicial measures of detention and internment of suspected terrorists . From CARDINAL DATE until DATE , when certain of GPE were replaced , the authorities in GPE in fact exercised CARDINAL such extrajudicial powers : ( i ) arrest for interrogation purposes during TIME ( under LAW ) ; ( ii ) arrest and remand in custody ( under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) ; ( iii ) detention of an arrested person ( under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) ; and ( iv ) internment ( under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) . An account of the operation of these powers and the procedures there under is given below at CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . For some time , the possibility of internment had been extensively canvassed in the press and amongst politicians . Pressure had also been mounting within the NORP community for its introduction ; in DATE there had been demonstrations against the then Prime Minister because of his ORG \u2019s alleged failure to deal with the IRA threat .", "The decision to introduce a policy of detention and internment was taken on CARDINAL DATE by ORG , following a meeting in GPE between LOC and ORG . Prior to this , the question had been considered at the highest level in GPE and frequent consultations had taken place between the two Governments .", "In DATE , as an apparent last resort to avoid introducing internment , the security forces had intensified operations against suspected terrorists , mounting searches and detaining for questioning what were believed to be key figures in the ORG . CARDINAL persons were arrested but no significant results were yielded . Prior to DATE , the intelligence obtained by the police had failed to provide anything but a very general picture of the IRA organisation .", "CARDINAL . The campaign of violence carried out by the IRA had attained unprecedented proportions by DATE . This was clearly the dominant factor behind the decision to exercise the extrajudicial powers .", "CARDINAL principal reasons for the decision have been cited by the respondent Government . Firstly , the authorities took the view that the normal procedures of investigation and criminal prosecution had become inadequate to deal with IRA terrorists ; it was considered that the ordinary criminal courts could no longer be relied on as the sole process of law for restoring peace and order . The second reason given , which was closely related to the first , was the widespread intimidation of the population . Such intimidation often made it impossible to obtain sufficient evidence to secure a criminal conviction against a known IRA terrorist in the absence of an admissible confession or of police or army testimony . Furthermore , the conduct of police enquiries was seriously hampered by the grip the IRA had on certain so - called \" no - go \" areas , that is NORP strongholds where terrorists , unlike the police , could operate in comparative safety . Thirdly , the ease of escape across the territorial border between GPE and GPE presented difficulties of control .", "In addition to the CARDINAL \" security \" reasons , there was , in the judgment of both ORG and ORG , no hope of winning over the terrorists by political means , the reform programme initiated in DATE having failed to prevent continuing violence .", "The authorities therefore came to the conclusion that it was necessary to introduce a policy of detention and internment of persons suspected of serious terrorist activities but against whom sufficient evidence could not be laid in court . This policy was regarded as a temporary measure primarily aimed at breaking the influence of the IRA . It was intended that a respite would be provided so as to enable the political and social reforms already undertaken to achieve their full effects .", "CARDINAL . The possibility of interning ORG was discussed in the preparatory stages . The security forces were aware of some NORP terrorist activity in DATE and also of certain NORP extremists , described by those forces as \" rabble rousers \" and suspected by them of acts of violence or intimidation , if not of terrorism strictly speaking . However , the security forces did not judge at this stage that there was any serious threat coming from DATE . There was said to be no army or police intelligence then available which indicated that any organisation other than the IRA had been actively engaged in bombing and killing in DATE .", "On account of the unprecedented level it had reached , and because of its nature as a highly organised , politically motivated campaign designed to overthrow the ORG , IRA terrorism was regarded as the real menace to law and order . NORP terrorist activity , which was in the main directed against the NORP community and not the ORG or the security forces , was seen by the authorities more as sporadic and as being on a minute scale in comparison and on a much less organised basis .", "CARDINAL . In DATE preceding the introduction of internment , the police , in consultation with the army , were preparing lists of persons to be arrested . The lists included not only suspected IRA terrorists but also persons suspected of being involved or associated with the ORG or even , in a few cases , of possessing information about others so involved or associated . It was generally understood that the target of the planned exercise was the ORG .", "DATE . Starting at TIME on DATE , QUANTITY DATE , the army , with police officers occasionally acting as guides , mounted an operation to arrest the CARDINAL persons whose names appeared on the final list . In the event , CARDINAL persons were arrested in accordance with LAW . The arrested persons were taken to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL regional holding centres ( ORG in GPE , ORG in GPE and ORG in GPE ) that had been set up to receive the prisoners during TIME . All those arrested were subjected to interrogation by police officers of ORG ( ORG ) . ORG persons were released within TIME . Those who were to be detained were sent on to the prison ship \" FAC \" or to FAC , both in GPE . Prior to being lodged in detention , CARDINAL individuals were moved to CARDINAL or more unidentified centres for \" interrogation in depth \" extending over DATE .", "Operation Demetrius , as the ORG points out , was not a selective manoeuvre aimed at individuals but a \" sweeping - up \" exercise directed against the IRA organisation as a whole . It is generally accepted that because of the scale and speed of the operation , some persons were arrested or even detained on the basis of inadequate or inaccurate information .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE , the Prime Minister of GPE announced to the public the introduction of internment . He stated , inter alia :", "\" The main target of the present operation is ORG ... They are the present threat ; but we will not hesitate to take strong action against any other individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in the future . \"", "CARDINAL . Arrests continued to be made during the rest of DATE , partly of persons on the above - mentioned list and partly of persons who came under suspicion thereafter .", "The CARDINAL regional holding centres were closed down in DATE shortly after PERSON was completed , and in DATE police centres were established at FAC ( GPE , County Down ) , GPE ( GPE ) , GPE ) and PERSON ( GPE ) for the purpose of holding and interrogating persons arrested under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The introduction of internment provoked a violent reaction from the NORP community and the IRA . Serious rioting broke out in GPE and elsewhere , there was a considerable increase in shootings and bombings , and the security situation in general deteriorated rapidly . Within the minority community there occurred a further alienation from the authorities and the security forces , together with a rise in support for the IRA .", "CARDINAL . Although surprised by the extent of this reaction , both LOC and ORG continued their efforts to secure political progress . In GPE , the ORG Secretary announced in DATE his ORG \u2019s determination to ensure that the NORP population in the province should have an active , permanent and guaranteed role in the conduct of public business . In DATE , a meeting took place in GPE between the Prime Ministers of GPE , GPE and GPE . In DATE , ORG published proposals for involving the opposition in government . However , these proposals were considered unacceptable by the political representatives of the NORP community and nothing came of them .", "CARDINAL . Neither internment nor the political initiatives ended the violence . On the contrary , the numbers of deaths , explosions and shootings recorded by the police for DATE throughout DATE were higher than those recorded in any of DATE . There was a total of CARDINAL persons killed , including CARDINAL members of the security forces and CARDINAL civilians , CARDINAL explosions and CARDINAL shooting incidents .", "CARDINAL . Apart from rioting and a small - scale bombing campaign of licensed LOC , there was apparently little serious violence by NORP in DATE . CARDINAL death occurring DATE , an assassination of a NORP in DATE , was attributed by the police to NORP . On the other hand , intimidation of members of the opposite community to move from their homes seems to have become more prevalent on both sides , although the official figures indicate that NORP were principally affected .", "CARDINAL . On the NORP side , the increased violence at this time led to the formation of defence associations or vigilante groups which ultimately amalgamated in or DATE to become ORG ( ORG ) . The ORG did not appear openly on the streets until DATE . There was also seen the start of a development later to become significant , that is the holding of large , carefully prepared parades by NORP organisations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The latter and in particular the ORG were looked on by the police as primarily political organisations not engaged in violence as such .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , despite a small drop , the level of violence remained higher than at any time before CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , CARDINAL people were killed by army gunfire in the course of disorders taking place in the predominantly NORP town of GPE . This incident led to a new upsurge in support for the IRA amongst the NORP community .", "In DATE , CARDINAL people were killed , including CARDINAL members of the security forces . CARDINAL assassinations carried out in DATE , CARDINAL of a NORP and the other of a NORP , were the only deaths attributed to NORP activity . CARDINAL explosions , the vast majority attributed to the IRA , were caused during the same period .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE there had been in GPE CARDINAL bomb explosions and CARDINAL shooting incidents . CARDINAL civilians , CARDINAL soldiers and CARDINAL policemen had been killed , and CARDINAL civilians , CARDINAL soldiers and CARDINAL ORG members injured .", "Throughout DATE the numbers held under detention or internment orders proceeded to rise until a total of over CARDINAL persons , all suspected of involvement with the ORG , were held at DATE . At the same time , the ordinary processes of the criminal law continued to be used , against NORP as well as NORP , whenever there was thought to be sufficient evidence to ground a criminal conviction . Thus , between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , CARDINAL people were charged with \" terrorist - type \" offences .", "DATE . In DATE , in view of the deteriorating circumstances , the ORG in GPE decided that they should assume direct responsibility for the administration of law and order in GPE if there was to be any hope of political progress . This decision was unacceptable to the Government of the province and accordingly it was announced on DATE that direct rule from GPE not only on law and order but on all matters was to be introduced .", "Under LOC ( LAW DATE ( hereinafter referred to as LAW ) , which was passed by ORG and came into force on DATE , temporary provision was made for the exercise of the executive and legislative powers of ORG by GPE authorities . ORG was prorogued and the Queen empowered to legislate in its stead by ORG . The executive powers of ORG were transferred to the Secretary of ORG for GPE . This was a new office created for the purpose ; its holder was a member of ORG and answerable to ORG . The legislation was enacted for DATE but was subsequently extended .", "CARDINAL . On assuming direct rule , ORG stated that CARDINAL of their most important objectives was to bring internment under LAW to an end and to consider how far the powers under LAW could be dispensed with . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG for GPE announced the immediate release of CARDINAL internees and CARDINAL detainees . By DATE persons had been released . The decision to phase out internment was not dictated by any fall in the level of violence . Rather it was intended to open the way for political progress by reducing tension as the first step in the process of reconciliation .", "On the political level , GPE was seeking the establishment of an equitable form of government for GPE , acceptable to both communities .", "CARDINAL . The introduction of direct rule , together with the release of detainees , caused resentment and dismay amongst the NORP community . A DATE strike , which proved largely effective , was immediately called by the leader of CARDINAL of the extremist movements on the NORP side .", "Street demonstrations and marches called by the ORG appear to have begun shortly after DATE . The ORG was organised on pseudo - military lines , its members , estimated at CARDINAL persons , giving themselves military ranks . The ORG used its forces to erect barricades , set up road blocks and disrupt civil life generally . They paraded in large numbers through the centre of GPE and elsewhere , many of them masked and dressed in para - military uniforms and on occasions openly carrying weapons such as sticks or cudgels . Such demonstrations , however , seem rarely to have led to physical violence . Whilst it was illegal to block roads , wear uniforms or carry offensive weapons , the security forces did not attempt to arrest those taking part in ORG demonstrations since they feared that major riots would result . Neither were the extrajudicial powers of detention and internment ever used , against either NORP or NORP , to combat this kind of illegal activity .", "According to the respondent Government , consideration was given to the possibility of proscribing the ORG , but it was decided that on balance no good purpose would be served by doing so , not least because most of its members were not engaged in violence . It is generally accepted , however , that ORG membership overlapped , to some extent at least , with the smaller and more militant extremist bodies which were illegal , such as the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Other aspects of NORP activity during this stage of the crisis included the erection of barricades and the continuing intimidation of NORP , a problem that became particularly grave in DATE . There were serious disturbances in NORP areas in DATE and DATE , with NORP terrorists exchanging fire with the security forces . The rioting in DATE ceased after the ORG had ordered the confrontation with the security forces to stop .", "CARDINAL . After the introduction of direct rule , there occurred a marked upward turn in NORP terrorism , evidenced by a few bombing attacks , a large - scale build - up of arms and ammunitions , and above all sectarian assassinations .", "Sectarian assassinations , which the respondent Government term the outstanding feature of NORP violence since DATE , first reached serious proportions in DATE . Victims seem largely to have been chosen at random on no other ground than their membership of , or links with , the other community . Kidnapping and torturing sometimes accompanied this kind of indiscriminate killing . While both sides committed sectarian murders , it is generally accepted that NORP were responsible for more than NORP . The police had difficulty in detecting those responsible for sectarian assassinations . In particular , witnesses were reluctant to come forward and were subjected to intimidation . Accordingly , a confidential telephone system was installed in DATE , whereby information could be given anonymously to the security forces .", "CARDINAL . Although NORP terrorist activity had grown significantly , it nonetheless remained that the great bulk of serious violence in this period was attributed to the IRA ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The high level of IRA terrorism did not at all abate despite the phasing - out of internment . In fact , there was a steady rise in explosions , shooting incidents and casualties amongst the security forces over the period from DATE until DATE However , on CARDINAL DATE ORG , who had been responsible for a lesser amount of violence than the Provisionals , declared a truce which they have on the whole respected ever since . On DATE the Provisional IRA in their turn announced a truce , becoming effective on DATE . The Provisionals\u2019 truce was , however , called off on DATE following an incident arising out of a communal argument between the ORG and NORP about the allocation of accommodation on a GPE housing estate .", "CARDINAL . After the breakdown of the ceasefire , Provisional IRA violence was resumed at an increased level . In DATE alone , CARDINAL members of the security forces and CARDINAL civilians were killed ; in addition , there were nearly CARDINAL explosions and CARDINAL shooting incidents . These figures were the highest for DATE in the entire emergency up to DATE . Responsibility was attributed to ORG for CARDINAL deaths and CARDINAL explosions .", "CARDINAL . Faced with the mounting tide of violence , ORG decided to restore the presence of the security forces in the \" no - go \" areas . After due warning had been given to the civilian population , a large - scale manoeuvre , known as PERSON , was mounted on DATE beginning at TIME", "Even after PERSON the police were still not able to function properly in NORP areas . Access to NORP areas remained easier for the police and they were not subject there to the same risk of attack . The army operated principally , and was employed to carry out police duties , in those areas where the minority community predominated .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the level of violence , although still high , immediately fell . In DATE , DATE and DATE , there was an overall total of CARDINAL shooting incidents as opposed to CARDINAL for DATE alone . The DATE average of deaths was CARDINAL the DATE total , and the number of explosions became progressively less .", "According to the respondent Government , a development contributing to the maintenance of this gradual reduction was the institution in DATE of a revised system for the detention of terrorists .", "In DATE following the introduction of direct rule \u2013 including DATE , the worst of DATE for violence - no new internment orders were made and fresh detentions virtually ceased . From DATE , after the breakdown of the attempted ceasefire , the number of detention orders - as before , against IRA suspects only - increased , while the rate of releases fell . There was , however , no large - scale operation to re - detain and re - intern people .", "CARDINAL . The political gesture of phasing out internment had not , as hoped , elicited a positive response from the ORG ; on the contrary , violence had mounted to fresh heights . Furthermore , the authorities judged that the capability of the ordinary processes of law to counter IRA terrorism continued to be impeded by a number of circumstances such as the intimidation of potential witnesses and the difficulty of bringing to trial those responsible for directing terrorist operations .", "ORG therefore became convinced that it was necessary to find fresh means of separating known terrorists from the population at large . On DATE , the Government announced that it was to set up a Commission , subsequently appointed in DATE under the chairmanship of Lord PERSON ,", "- to consider \" what arrangements for the administration of justice in GPE could be made in order to deal more effectively with terrorist organisations by bringing to book , otherwise than by internment by the Executive , individuals involved in terrorist activities , particularly those who plan and direct , but do not necessarily take part in , terrorist acts \" ; and", "- \" to make recommendations \" .", "Without waiting for the report of ORG , the Government brought into effect on DATE ORG ( GPE ) Order DATE ( abbreviated hereafter to LAW ) , an Order made in exercise of the powers conferred by LAW ( see paragraph DATE above ) . This Order , which was of a temporary nature , revoked LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( detention ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( internment ) ; in replacement it instituted , with further procedural guarantees for the protection of the individual concerned , a new system of \" interim custody \" and \" detention \" for persons suspected of participation in terrorist activities . Regulations DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( arrest ) remained . Further details on the Order are given below at DATE .", "CARDINAL . The report of ORG was presented to ORG in DATE . This report analysed the minimum requirements of a judicial process , the effects of intimidation , possible changes in the rules of evidence and the need for detention without trial . It stated , inter alia :", "\" The fear of intimidation is widespread and well - founded . Until it can be removed and the personal safety of witnesses and their families guaranteed , the use by the Executive of some extrajudicial process for the detention of terrorists can not be dispensed with . \"", "ORG , on the basis of the evidence it had itself obtained , accepted that the findings of the PERSON report as to the level of intimidation were generally warranted .", "CARDINAL . Another contributory factor invoked by the respondent Government in connection with the fall in violence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was the intensive programme of consultations which they undertook with the political parties in GPE on the question of the future government of the province . These consultations , first commenced in DATE and DATE , continued throughout DATE and DATE . Apart from the steps taken on the security front , ORG thus maintained the new emphasis placed , since the introduction of direct rule , on attempting to find a solution to the crisis through political means ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The gradual reduction in the level of violence was maintained until DATE . The figures for deaths and explosions for DATE were , with one slight exception , lower than for DATE since the introduction of internment . Despite this general reduction , though , the development of NORP militancy and terrorist activity continued .", "From DATE until DATE , CARDINAL persons were killed , CARDINAL of these deaths being attributed to ORG . The overall total included CARDINAL members of the security forces , the vast majority of whom were considered to have been killed by the ORG , and an equal number of victims of \" factional or sectarian \" assassinations . Of these assassinations , CARDINAL were ascribed to ORG , DATE to the IRA , with no attribution being possible in the remaining CARDINAL cases .", "For their part , explosions totalled CARDINAL ; no more than a small percentage - for example , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL explosions recorded DATE and DATE - were regarded as being the work of ORG .", "The increasing NORP militancy was further evidenced by the statistics on intimidation , arms and ammunitions recovered , and charges brought for \" terrorist - type offences \" . Thus , DATE , charges of the kind just referred to were laid against CARDINAL persons , namely CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP ; within this total , CARDINAL individuals - CARDINAL NORP , including CARDINAL in DATE of DATE , and CARDINAL NORP DATE were charged with murder or attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . NORP terrorism was linked by the police with NORP extremist organisations , notably the ORG . The police considered that the ORG \u2019s membership and acts of terrorism had increased from DATE following a period of relative inactivity after its DATE bombing campaign ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It was looked on as a well - armed and organised body . In general , by about DATE the police had reasonably good intelligence as to the identity of the violent elements on the NORP side , but there were cases in DATE in which it was impossible to procure sufficient evidence to bring such persons before the ordinary criminal courts . Nevertheless , none of the extrajudicial orders made between the introduction of direct rule and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) applied to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP violence , however , remained on a far smaller scale than that of the Provisional IRA who , as the above - cited figures show , were still responsible for the great bulk of the terrorist deeds recorded .", "In the view of the respondent Government and of the ORG , NORP and IRA violence were to be distinguished in further respects in addition to volume . NORP terrorism consisted largely of intimidation and sectarian assassinations , whereas the ORG campaign also included attacks on members of the security forces and the bombing of public places . As indicated earlier ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the character , aims and background of the various organisations engaged in terrorism on the CARDINAL sides differed . The evidence suggests that the NORP terrorist groups were at the time more amorphous than the IRA . Within the security forces there was a tendency , which the ORG regarded as justified in many ways , to look on NORP terrorists as \" criminals \" or \" hooligans \" and on the IRA as the organised \" terrorist \" enemy . The prospects of obtaining sufficient admissible evidence for a criminal prosecution were , it seems , judged by the security forces as being better in relation to NORP than to IRA suspects . Given the continued inability of the police to operate normally in NORP areas and the greater extent and organisation of the ORG campaign , the ORG found such an attitude \" not surprising \" .", "Finally , the statistics referred to above at paragraph CARDINAL indicate that action , in the form of searches , recovery of arms and the bringing of criminal charges , was being taken by the authorities against both sides .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE no new internment orders were made , although it was considered necessary to make CARDINAL detention orders under LAW ( CARDINAL ) . By the latter date CARDINAL men had been released from internment and CARDINAL from detention , leaving CARDINAL still interned and CARDINAL still detained . Between the entry into force of ORG and DATE , CARDINAL interim custody orders and CARDINAL detention orders were made while CARDINAL persons were released .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the ORG noted in its report that subsequent to the introduction of direct rule the extrajudicial powers appear to have been exercised on a more selective basis and , broadly speaking , in accordance with the following criteria :", "( i ) extrajudicial orders were served only on persons suspected of involvement in serious and organised terrorism ;", "( ii ) they were used solely as a \" last resort \" , that is only in cases where sufficient evidence was not available to justify prosecution before the ordinary courts ;", "( iii ) as a general practice , they were not made against a person in respect of matters for which he had been tried and acquitted by an ordinary court , provided that it had been possible to put before the court all the relevant evidence .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , a NORP soldier was shot dead in a NORP part of GPE . Shortly afterwards , on DATE , CARDINAL interim custody orders were made in respect of ORG . These CARDINAL men were the first ORG against whom the extrajudicial powers were exercised . According to the applicant Government , the specific act of which one of these men was suspected - the bombing of a bus , responsibility for which had been claimed immediately after the event by the ORG - had caused a public outcry and had actually forced a decision to \" intern \" the first suspected NORP terrorist . The decision itself had been the subject of discussions between the Secretary of ORG for GPE , the General Officer Commanding the NORP forces in the province and high ranking civil servants . The relevant higher authorities are noted in the GPE \u2019s report as recognising that the detention of ORG would lead to repercussions in the security situation . The ORG accepts that the risk of a severe outbreak of NORP violence in response was clearly a very real one .", "Prior to DATE , it seems , no recommendations had been made to the Secretary of ORG for the detention or internment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant Government , the exercise of the extrajudicial powers against ORG brought in its wake widespread threats from the ORG . In general , however , the pattern of violence from DATE can be said to have followed the previous pattern , although at a somewhat lower level than in DATE . The bulk of the terrorist acts that is most of the bombing and shooting attacks on members of the security forces were still perpetrated by ORG , with the ORG committing the majority of the sectarian assassinations .", "From DATE until DATE , the police registered CARDINAL deaths , of which CARDINAL were considered to be the responsibility of NORP . Of the CARDINAL \" factional or sectarian \" murders recorded , CARDINAL were ascribed to ORG and DATE to the IRA and in CARDINAL cases no attribution was possible . In DATE , the number of explosions dropped to CARDINAL - CARDINAL being attributed to ORG - as compared with CARDINAL in DATE . For their part , shootings fell from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , although an increase occurred in punishment shootings such as \" executions \" and \" knee - capping \" .", "DATE . On DATE , GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE ( hereafter abbreviated to LAW ) came into force . This Act , which was based mainly on the recommendations of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , repealed the DATE LAW CARDINAL and DATE ( CARDINAL ) and the DATE Terrorists Order , while retaining in substance the procedure laid down in the latter Order . Briefly , the extrajudicial powers introduced under LAW were : ( i ) arrest and detention for TIME ; ( ii ) interim custody for DATE ; and ( iii ) detention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below for a fuller explanation ) . These emergency powers remained in force for a period of DATE unless renewed . The LAW also dealt with the trial and punishment by the ordinary courts of certain scheduled offences , for the most part offences concerned with violence . CARDINAL provision , section CARDINAL , is referred to below at paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , interim custody orders were served on CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP ; at all times many more NORP than NORP were actually held . Shortly before DATE , CARDINAL detainees , CARDINAL of whom were NORP , were released .", "CARDINAL . During the same period , CARDINAL persons were charged with \" terrorist - type offences \" , the total being made up as follows : CARDINAL NORP , CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL soldiers . These figures included CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP charged with murder . In addition , searches were being conducted and arms recovered in relation to both sides .", "CARDINAL . While the level of violence was reduced in DATE and DATE , progress on the political front was somewhat erratic . In DATE , ORG published a ORG setting out proposals for the constitutional future of the CARDINAL counties . These proposals envisaged a new regional government with participation at \" cabinet \" level by representatives of both communities . A DATE Act provided for the election of a ORG before the main constitutional legislation was enacted . Elections , based on the principle of proportional representation in order to ensure a fair representation for the NORP minority , were held on DATE . Of the CARDINAL members elected to the ORG , CARDINAL were in favour of the proposed constitutional changes , even though the extreme NORP parties had conducted a campaign of opposition .", "CARDINAL . The White Paper proposals were enacted in DATE in the form of GPE DATE . This Act empowered the ORG to legislate within certain limits and established an Executive . ORG on Human Rights was instituted to advise the Secretary of ORG . The LAW also specifically provided that legislation passed by the ORG would be void if it discriminated on the ground of religious belief or political opinion ; in addition , discrimination by public authorities on such grounds was expressly rendered unlawful .", "The provisions of the LAW relating to legislative and executive powers required the passing by ORG of a Devolution Order . The LAW was made on DATE and the devolution became effective on DATE . This devolution , which was based on the principle of \" power - sharing \" between the CARDINAL communities , marked for a certain time the end of direct rule .", "CARDINAL . The Northern Ireland Executive came into office on DATE . For the first time , a ORG contained representatives of both the majority and minority communities , but its life proved to be very brief . In DATE , NORP extremist groups combined to organise a politically motivated strike which brought about the downfall of the Executive and a return to direct rule from GPE . On DATE , Her Majesty , acting under LAW referred to in the preceding paragraph , by ORG directed that ORG should stand prorogued for DATE .", "On DATE , GPE DATE was passed by ORG in order to make temporary provision for the government of the CARDINAL counties .

In DATE , ORG appointed ORG whose terms of reference were to consider what provisions and powers , consistent to the maximum extent practicable in the circumstances with the preservation of civil liberties and human rights , were required to deal with terrorism and subversion in GPE , including provisions for the administration of justice ; to examine the working of the DATE LAW ; and to make recommendations .", "The report of ORG was presented to ORG in DATE . This report critically examined trial procedures before the ordinary courts , existing and proposed offences connected with terrorism , the powers of the security forces , prison accommodation , special category prisoners and detention . When dealing with the question of detention , ORG noted at paragraph CARDINAL :", "\" ... We have detailed evidence of CARDINAL cases of intimidation of witnesses DATE : and there must be many more . Civilian witnesses to murder and other terrorist offences are either too afraid to make any statement at all , or , having made a statement identifying the criminal , refuse in any circumstances to give evidence in court . The prevalence of murder and knee - capping make this only too easy to understand . \"", "ORG , while making certain recommendations about detention and existing detention procedures , concluded at paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL :", "\" After long and anxious consideration , we are of the opinion that detention can not remain as a long - term policy . In the short term , it may be an effective means of containing violence , but the prolonged effects of the use of detention are ultimately inimical to community life , fan a widespread sense of grievance and injustice , and obstruct those elements in GPE society which could lead to reconciliation . Detention can only be tolerated in a NORP society in the most extreme circumstances ; it must be used with the utmost restraint and retained only as long as it is strictly necessary . We would like to be able to recommend that the time has come to abolish detention ; but the present level of violence , the risks of increased violence , and the difficulty of predicting events even DATE make it impossible for us to put forward a precise recommendation on the timing .", "We think that this grave decision can only be made by the Government ... \"", "CARDINAL .

Reports alleging physical brutality and ill - treatment by the security forces were made public within DATE of Operation Demetrius ( described above at paragraph CARDINAL ) . A committee of enquiry under the chairmanship of Sir PERSON was appointed by ORG on DATE to investigate such allegations . Among the CARDINAL cases this ORG examined were CARDINAL cases of persons subjected to the CARDINAL techniques in DATE ; its findings were that interrogation in depth by means of the techniques constituted physical ill - treatment but not physical brutality as it understood that term . The ORG \u2019s report , adopted on DATE , was made public , as was a supplemental report of DATE by Sir PERSON in relation to CARDINAL further cases occurring in DATE and DATE , CARDINAL of which involved the techniques .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reports came under considerable criticism in GPE . On DATE , the NORP Home Secretary announced that a further ORG had been set up under the chairmanship of Lord PERSON of GPE to consider \" whether , and if so in what respects , the procedures currently authorised for interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment \" .", "The PERSON report , which was adopted on DATE , contained a majority and a minority opinion . The majority report concluded that the application of the techniques , subject to recommended safeguards against excessive use , need not be ruled out on moral grounds . On the other hand , the minority report by Lord PERSON disagreed that such interrogation procedures were morally justifiable , even in emergency terrorist conditions . Both the majority and the minority considered the methods to be illegal under domestic law , although the majority confined their view to LANGUAGE law and to \" some if not all the techniques \" .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON report was published on DATE . On DATE , the GPE Prime Minister stated in ORG :", "\" [ The ] Government , having reviewed the whole matter with great care and with reference to any future operations , have decided that the techniques ... will not be used in future as an aid to interrogation . \"", "He further declared :", "\" The statement that I have made covers all future circumstances .

It stated in addition that the required posture caused physical pain and exhaustion . The Commission noted that , later on during his stay at the interrogation centre , T CARDINAL was allowed to take his hood off when he was alone in the room , provided that he turned his face to the wall . It was not found possible by the Commission to establish for what periods T CARDINAL and T CARDINAL had been without sleep , or to what extent they were deprived of nourishment and whether or not they were offered food but refused to take it .", "The ORG found no physical injury to have resulted from the application of the CARDINAL techniques as such , but loss of weight by the CARDINAL case - witnesses and acute psychiatric symptoms developed by them during interrogation were recorded in the medical and other evidence . ORG , on the material before it , was unable to establish the exact degree of any psychiatric after - effects produced on T CARDINAL and T CARDINAL , but on the general level it was satisfied that some psychiatric after - effects in certain of the QUANTITY persons subjected to the techniques could not be excluded .", "CARDINAL . T CARDINAL claimed in addition to have been beaten and otherwise physically ill - treated , but the medical evidence before the Commission , as the delegates explained at the hearing before the ORG on DATE , gave reason to doubt that he had been assaulted to any severe degree , if at all . Accordingly , the Commission treated the allegations in regard to T CARDINAL as concerning the CARDINAL techniques only .", "T CARDINAL similarly alleged that he was also assaulted in various ways at , or during transport to and from , the centre . On DATE he was medically examined on leaving the centre and also on his subsequent arrival at FAC where he was then detained until DATE . The medical reports of these examinations and photographs taken on DATE revealed on T CARDINAL \u2019s body bruising and contusions that had not been present on DATE . While not accepting all T CARDINAL \u2019s allegations , the Commission was \" satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that certain of these injuries ... [ were ] the result of assaults committed on him by the security forces at the centre \" .

T CARDINAL \u2019s ill - treatment was not connected with his formal interrogation which was correctly conducted by the Special Branch .
