The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local office of ORG ( kansanel\u00e4kelaitos , folkpensionsanstalten ) granted the applicant a DATE sickness allowance on account of his incapacity for work from DATE . On DATE his allowance was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr MONEY , a psychiatrist treating the applicant , considered him incapacitated for work from DATE until DATE on account of his depression and anxiety . On the strength of that opinion the applicant requested that he be granted a DATE sickness allowance for the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The medical expert consulted by the local office of ORG , PERSON , found in his opinion of DATE that the applicant \u2019s alleged incapacity for work was principally of a subjective nature , although the criteria for serious mental distress were not met . While not considering the applicant incapable for work , PERSON recommended that an opinion be obtained from an expert in psychiatry before a new decision was reached on the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion of CARDINAL DATE PERSON , a psychiatrist , found on the basis of the information available that the applicant had been capable of working as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Neither Dr PERSON nor PERSON examined the applicant in person . Their identities and opinions were not known to the applicant until they were indicated by the Government in the course of the Convention proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( sosiaali - vakuutustoimikunta , socialf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskommissionen ) of GPE refused the applicant \u2019s request to have his allowance extended until DATE . ORG , relying on section CARDINAL of LAW ( sairasvakuutuslaki , sjukf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringslag CARDINAL ) , reasoned as follows :", "\u201c A person who is incapacitated for work shall be entitled to a DATE allowance . Incapacity for work is defined as a condition caused by an illness and during which the person is unable to perform his or her ordinary , or closely comparable , work . Your function as a tourist secretary has been regarded as your ordinary work .", "On the basis of the material adduced you can not be considered unable to perform this work or a closely comparable one .", "For this reason , you are not entitled to a DATE allowance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( sosiaalivakuutuslautakunta , socialf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsn\u00e4mnden ) for ORG , adducing a report of CARDINAL DATE in which his treating physician , PERSON , agreed with PERSON that the applicant was incapacitated for work during the period in question , on account of his depression , panic feelings and neurosis . In its opinion to the ORG dated DATE , but not forwarded to the applicant for his possible comments , ORG explained the challenged decision as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of medical certificates of the A category , [ the applicant ] was granted a DATE allowance until DATE on the basis of his incapacity for work which had commenced on DATE . Subsequently he adduced a certificate of the B category in which a psychiatrist considered him incapacitated for work until DATE on account of his depression and undefined anxiety . In the opinion of the medical expert , a psychiatrist , the insured had to be considered fit for work . A further certificate of the B category , issued by a different doctor , has been appended to the appeal . The medical expert is of the opinion that there is no reason to amend the previous decision .", "Since the appellant has not adduced any new information which was not known to the [ ORG at the time of its decision , it is proposed that the appeal be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr M.M. considered that the applicant remained incapacitated for work until DATE on account of his depression .

In its opinion to ORG dated DATE , and again not forwarded to the applicant for possible comments , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant \u2019s ] earlier request for a DATE allowance for the period DATE was refused and that decision has been appealed against as well . The insured sought to have his DATE allowance granted for a further period , relying on a certificate of the B category issued by a psychiatrist . According to the opinion of the medical expert , the insured has to be considered fit to work .", "Since nothing new has been adduced in the [ applicant \u2019s current ] appeal , it is proposed that it be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a further opinion of CARDINAL DATE Dr M.M. , without taking a position in regard to the applicant \u2019s incapacity for work , maintained his diagnosis that the applicant was suffering from undefined anxiety . Relying on this opinion and on all previous evidence , the applicant sought a DATE allowance from DATE onwards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals against ORG decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , relying on the reasons and the legal provision invoked in those decisions . According to the ORG \u2019s decision , it had taken note of ORG opinions to the effect that no new material had been adduced which would have justified a change in the challenged decisions . The ORG \u2019s decision did not mention the existence of any opinions issued by the consulting medical experts . The applicant appealed to ORG ( tarkastuslautakunta , pr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant a DATE allowance from DATE onwards , with the following reasoning :", "\u201c A person who is incapacitated for work shall be entitled to a DATE allowance .

NORP The applicant again appealed to ORG , inter alia adducing a fresh medical opinion of DATE in which PERSON , maintaining his previous diagnosis , had considered that the applicant remained incapacitated for work until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals against ORG decisions of DATE and DATE by relying on the reasons given by ORG in its decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . ORG decisions were dispatched to the applicant on DATE . No further appeal lay open .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to undergo an examination of his capacity for work by a specialist of ORG own choosing . It recalled that the applicant \u2019s capacity for work had been assessed on the basis of written documentation on CARDINAL separate occasions and each time by different persons . The decisions refusing him an extended DATE sickness allowance had been upheld by all appellate instances and concerned the DATE . The applicant \u2019s capacity for work at that point in time could no longer be assessed by a doctor who had not been treating him at the time . The applicant \u2019s capacity for work at that time had already been assessed by doctors who knew him then , and his requests for a further allowance had been decided on the basis of their opinions .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a DATE allowance shall be payable to anyone suffering a loss of income due to his or her incapacity for work . LAW defines such incapacity as a condition caused by an illness and during which the person is unable to perform his or her ordinary , or closely comparable , work .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under DATE , subsection CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , of the said LAW , ORG has a possibility to order the insured person to undergo further medical examinations and thereby request medical statements from physicians specialised in the area of medicine in question .", "CARDINAL . NORP The members of ORG are appointed by ORG ( valtioneuvosto , statsr\u00e5det ) for a maximum of DATE but with a possibility of being re - appointed ( section CARDINAL , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicant , NORP law never prevented social insurance bodies from holding oral hearings . Moreover , even after the DATE amendment the law has been interpreted very narrowly as regards the need for oral hearings . The applicant refers to ORG precedent no . CARDINAL by which a case was remitted to ORG with a view to an oral hearing being held for the purpose of taking testimony from a doctor who had provided a written summary of medical reports concerning the appellant . ORG had refused his request for an oral hearing , considering it manifestly unnecessary ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
