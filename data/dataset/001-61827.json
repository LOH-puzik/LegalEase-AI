According to copies of that ORG \u2019s minutes , the applicant was a member of a sub - committee responsible for supervising the implementation of decisions and activities arising from the ORG \u2019s programme .", "CARDINAL . At the same congress , a group of delegates expressed their disagreement with the ORG \u2019s general policy , which remained loyal to GPE and the ORG , was opposed to any democratisation of public life and sought to maintain the status quo . These delegates publicly announced their withdrawal from the ORG and established a new party , ORG \u201d , which immediately declared its support for NORP independence and for a multi - party political system . The applicant did not join the dissident delegates and remained within the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a Declaration on the Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Latvia , which declared GPE \u2019s incorporation into the GPE unlawful and void and restored legal force to the fundamental provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) of DATE .

On DATE this committee announced that ORG and the government were stripped of their respective powers and declared that it was assuming full powers . After causing the loss of several lives during armed confrontations in GPE , this attempted coup failed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested the version of events put forward by the Government . In her opinion , the NORP army \u2019s aggression against the NORP government and people was not a proven fact ; in this connection , she submitted a copy of a NORP newspaper article which claimed that it had been the NORP independence supporters themselves , rather than NORP soldiers , who fired into the crowd , with the aim of discrediting the NORP army . The applicant also claimed that , at the material time , a series of public demonstrations had been held in GPE to protest against the increase in food prices ordered by the government ; those demonstrations were thus the main reason for the events of DATE . Finally , the applicant argued that , in their respective statements of CARDINAL and DATE , the ORG of the ORG \u2019s ORG and ORG had not only called for or announced the removal of the NORP authorities , but had also stated that early elections would be held for ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a national vote was held on NORP territory . According to the Government , this was a genuine national referendum ; the applicant argues that it was a simple consultative vote .

The decision stated that , although the applicant had provided false information to ORG regarding her participation in the ORG , there was nothing to prove that she had done so with the specific objective of misleading the Commission . In that connection , ORG considered that the statement by the applicant , appended to the list of candidates for the elections of DATE , was to be read in conjunction with her explanatory letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the General Procurator \u2019s Office applied to ORG for a finding that the applicant had participated in the ORG after DATE .

Consequently , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments to the effect that she was only formally a member of the ORG and that she did not participate in the meetings of its ORG , and that accordingly she could not be held to have \u201c acted \u201d , \u201c been a militant \u201d or \u201c actively participated \u201d ( darboties ) in the party \u2019s activities .", "CARDINAL .

In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the proceedings in question were limited to a single strictly - defined objective , namely a finding as to whether or not the applicant had taken part in the ORG \u2019s activities after CARDINAL DATE . The ORG concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to analyse the legal consequences of this finding , on the ground that this was irrelevant to the finding itself .

In establishing restrictions , the candidates\u2019 honour and reputation is not challenged , in the sense of personal legal protection [ personisks tiesisks labums ] ; what is challenged is the worthiness of the persons in question to represent the people in ORG or in the relevant municipal council . These restrictions concern persons who were permanent agents of the occupying power \u2019s repressive regime , or who , after DATE , participated in the organisations mentioned in the impugned provisions and actively fought against the re - established NORP LAW and ORG ...", "The argument ... that democratic state order must be protected against individuals who are not ethically qualified to become representatives of a democratic state at political or administrative level ... is well - founded ...", "... The removal from the list of a candidate who was involved in the above - mentioned organisations is not an arbitrary administrative decision ; it is based on an individual judgment by a court . In accordance with the law , evaluation of individual responsibility comes under the jurisdiction of the courts ....", "CARDINAL . ... In order to determine whether the measure applied , namely the restrictions on passive electoral rights , is proportionate to the objectives being pursued , namely the protection , firstly , of democratic state order and , secondly , of the national security and integrity of the NORP State , it is necessary to assess the political situation in the country and other related circumstances . ORG having evaluated the historical and political circumstances of the development of democracy on several occasions ... the ORG does not consider that at this stage there would be grounds for challenging the proportionality between the measure applied and its aim .", "However , ORG , by periodically examining the political situation in the ORG and the necessity and merits of the restrictions , should decide to establish a time - limit on these restrictions ... since such limitations on passive electoral rights may exist only for a specific period . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the Constitutional Court \u2019s CARDINAL judges who examined the above - mentioned case issued a dissenting opinion in which they expressed their disagreement with the majority \u2019s conclusions . Referring , inter alia , to the judgments in GPE v. GPE of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. GPE ( ORG , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-III ) , they argued that the disputed restrictions could be more extensive with regard to civil servants than to elected representatives . According to those judges , GPE \u2019s democratic regime and institutional system had become sufficiently stable in DATE for individuals who had campaigned against the system DATE previously no longer to represent a real threat to the ORG .
