On DATE ORG upheld that judgment but reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The judgment , together with the court \u2019s reasoned opinion , was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s legal - aid lawyer informed ORG that he had not found any grounds to lodge a cassation appeal in the applicant \u2019s case .

NORP On DATE the ORG refused to lodge an extraordinary cassation appeal in the applicant \u2019s case , because he had not found any grounds to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an application to ORG for the proceedings to be reopened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed a legal - aid lawyer to represent the applicant in the proceedings for the reopening of his case . On DATE the lawyer prepared and lodged a proper application to reopen the proceedings . He argued that new facts and evidence had come to light since the applicant had been convicted , namely that CARDINAL of the witnesses for the prosecution had admitted that they had given false statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) decided to exempt the applicant from court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to reopen the proceedings on the grounds that the witnesses in question had not been convicted of perjury in connection with the main proceedings against the applicant , and that the arguments raised by the applicant \u2019s lawyer were therefore invalid .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was available under the applicable domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the Court of overcrowding and inadequate medical care and detention conditions in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in FAC on CARDINAL separate occasions : ( CARDINAL ) from DATE to DATE ; ( CARDINAL ) from CARDINAL DATE until DATE ; and ( CARDINAL ) from DATE until DATE .

He did not indicate the size of the cells in which he had been placed or the number of inmates he had had to share them with .", "CARDINAL . He did submit to the ORG , however , copies of official memoranda revealing that every three to four months or so , the governor of ORG would report to the relevant penitentiary judge along the following lines : \u201c ... owing to the overcrowding of [ the prison \u2019s ] quarters , I have been forced to place prisoners in cells with CARDINAL sq . m of living space for each person . This situation affects all cells ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The official statistics published by ORG ( NORP PERSON ) show that during the applicant \u2019s second period of detention , overcrowding ( the degree by which the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum allowed capacity of a particular detention facility , which , in turn , is calculated on the basis of the standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of cell space per prisoner provided for in NORP law ) at FAC ranged PERCENT in the relevant part of DATE , PERCENT and PERCENT in DATE , PERCENT in DATE , PERCENT and PERCENT in DATE , PERCENT and PERCENT in the relevant part of DATE , and had been PERCENT in DATE and PERCENT in DATE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that during the relevant period , namely DATE , the overall maximum capacity of FAC had been exceeded by on average PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The Government also submitted that DATE and DATE the applicant had been detained in CARDINAL cells , measuring DATE QUANTITY m. They submitted that no records existed to show how many prisoners had shared those cells with the applicant . In consequence , it could not be established whether or not the applicant \u2019s cells had been overcrowded .", "CARDINAL . As regards the final period of the applicant \u2019s detention , the ORG submitted that DATE and DATE , he had been placed in cell no . CARDINAL , which measured QUANTITY m.

Lastly , the applicant submitted that for DATE , from DATE until DATE , he had shared a cell ( no . CARDINAL , wing III ) with an inmate who suffered from schizophrenia and had a history of violence .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that during his detention in FAC the applicant had not shared his cell with any prisoner suffering from schizophrenia .

In his application to ORG DATE , the applicant also complained that he had been provided with inadequate medical care by the prison healthcare system during his detention in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant suffered from ulcers , varicose veins , atherosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) , osteoarthritis , chronic bronchitis , asthma and a spinal hernia .

The applicant asserted that he had not received adequate medical care during his imprisonment . In particular , he submitted that he had not been allowed to have specialist orthopaedic treatment and that on several occasions he had been refused painkillers .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had been provided with regular and adequate care and treatment which had complied with recommended medical practice .

DATE to DATE the applicant was detained in FAC . He was initially placed in a cell in the general wing because of building works in the hospital wing . On DATE he was transferred to the hospital wing . The medical certificates issued in the hospital revealed that throughout the whole period in question , the applicant had received hospital treatment for his spinal arthritis and hernia , as well as for chronic bronchitis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged numerous complaints with the penitentiary prison authorities concerning his allegedly inadequate medical care and other aspects of his detention but to no avail . The applicant did not lodge any complaints about overcrowding at that stage .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , an officer authorised by the Director of ORG of ORG ( ORG PERSON ) informed the applicant that a complaint he had lodged concerning his unemployment in FAC had been rejected as illfounded . It was emphasised that the applicant \u2019s job opportunities were objectively limited owing to the nature of his disability and the fact that the rate of unemployment among prisoners was very high .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letters of DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE the Directors of the FAC and ORG of ORG informed the applicant that his complaints of inadequate medical treatment in prison had been rejected as ill - founded . It was established that the applicant had received sufficient medical treatment , having been examined by specialists and prescribed medication . It was also noted that in order to provide him with better medical care , on DATE the applicant had been transferred to the hospital at FAC .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant also sought temporary leave from prison on account of his poor health ; however , on DATE the ORG refused to grant the necessary licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision . The domestic courts considered that adequate medical care and treatment could be provided to the applicant by the prison system . Reference was made to the medical certificates of DATE and DATE which stated that there was no requirement for the applicant to undergo spinal surgery . The courts concluded that the applicant \u2019s multiple and serious health conditions did not make it impossible for him to continue serving his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a civil action against ORG for compensation in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) for non - pecuniary damage , which he had allegedly suffered owing to overcrowding and inadequate conditions of detention and medical care in FAC .

The court later decided to grant the applicant a partial exemption from the fees and ordered that he pay the remaining fee of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal seeking a full exemption from the court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal because it had not been lodged in compliance with the relevant procedural requirements namely the applicant had failed to give full details of his appeal and to submit the necessary supporting documents . On DATE the same court rejected a further interlocutory appeal by the applicant because such a remedy had not been available to him under the applicable domestic law .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant sent a further request for an exemption from court fees . On DATE ORG invited him to submit a statement of his financial means in support of his request .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the full fee exemption was eventually granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG obtained a medical expert report , which concluded that the applicant \u2019s medical condition , more specifically the atherosclerosis of his legs , spinal hernia , osteoarthritis , chronic bronchitis and joint deformation , did not have any connection and did not directly result from his incarceration and the conditions of his detention in FAC . It was also considered that the cause of the applicant \u2019s multiple health disorders was unknown but they undoubtedly dated back to a time prior to his detention .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the expert made the following findings about the applicant \u2019s health and treatment in FAC : the applicant \u2019s atherosclerosis dated back to DATE or earlier ; he was a smoker and had begun treatment for chronic bronchitis in DATE ; he had developed spinal problems in DATE ; and he received medication for stomach ulcers . The report also concluded that the medical treatment during his detention could be regarded as effective as his chronic illnesses were not getting any worse .", "CARDINAL .

On an unspecified date the applicant instituted social security proceedings for an assessment of his level of disability and his pension .", "CARDINAL .

It appears that the applicant later lodged a number of interlocutory appeals , some of which were out of time .
