In a judgment of DATE it dismissed PERSON \u2019s claim . It found that the first applicant , like many other journalists , had based her article on reliable official sources . This excluded any wrongful conduct on her part . The second applicant was therefore not liable either .", "CARDINAL . N.T. appealed . ORG held a hearing on DATE . On DATE it upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found that at the time when the CARDINAL articles had been published there had not existed any statutory rules governing journalistic enquiries . Journalists , including the first applicant , had been bound to adhere to the de facto rules of the profession . The first applicant had not breached those rules in researching the CARDINAL articles . She had used many independent sources to elucidate the facts covered in both articles . She had based her allegations on information from ORG and ORG , and a statement made by a public prosecutor . Both she and the second applicant had thus fulfilled their professional duties , which excluded any negligence on their part . Strict liability in tort did not exist under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . N.T. appealed on points of law . ORG heard the appeal at a hearing held on DATE . On DATE it quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case . It found that that court , whose task had not simply been to review the firstinstance court \u2019s judgment but to decide the case de novo , had not gathered all available evidence \u2013 in particular evidence relating to the identity of the public prosecutor cited in the first article and any evidence concerning the truthfulness of the second article \u2013 and had not properly analysed it . Its findings that the allegations in the articles were true did not correspond to the material in the case . The cassation court went on to say that in order to determine whether or not the applicants were liable in tort the court of appeal should have ascertained the truth or the falsity of the assertions made in the CARDINAL articles , because the right to freedom of expression could not be used to infringe the reputation of others .", "CARDINAL . NORP On remittal , ORG held CARDINAL hearings . At the second of those , which took place on DATE , the court decided to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings against PERSON of the parties appealed against that decision . After criminal proceedings against PERSON came to an end in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court decided to resume the examination of the case , and held a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG allowed PERSON \u2019s claim . It ordered the CARDINAL applicants and ORG to pay him CARDINAL new NORP levs ( ORG ) , plus interest , in nonpecuniary damages in respect of the first article . The court also ordered the second applicant and ORG to pay PERSON CARDINAL , plus interest , in nonpecuniary damages in respect of the second article . Lastly , the court ordered the CARDINAL applicants and ORG to pay PERSON in respect of costs . It specified that they were jointly liable to pay those amounts .", "CARDINAL . The court held that in preparing the articles the first applicant had acted tortiously because she had not followed the customary rules governing journalistic enquiries . Those rules required that any information , even that coming from official sources , be checked against CARDINAL independent sources . The first applicant had not done that with regard to the information received from a public prosecutor whose identity she had been unable to establish . The resulting articles had contained defamatory and injurious statements about PERSON and his family which went beyond the information in the press release issued by the authorities : that the \u201c business of [ the applicant \u2019s wife had ] thrived and she [ had ] amassed a substantial capital \u201d , that the \u201c whole family [ had been ] implicated in the affair \u201d , and that the authorities had found \u201c a bag with secret documents relating to the business of the \u2018 GPE metallurgical plant \u201d . By writing and publishing unverified defamatory allegations about PERSON the applicants had acted in breach of the general duty under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) not to infringe the rights of others . They could have anticipated the damaging result of their actions and could have averted it by taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the statements in the articles . They had not done so , and had therefore acted negligently . The second applicant had been under a duty to do so by virtue of his position as the newspaper \u2019s editorinchief , especially with regard to an article that did not bear a byline . As for the first applicant , she had made untrue and uncorroborated injurious remarks and allegations about PERSON \u2019s personal and professional life , without taking into account the negative consequences that could flow from them . ORG was vicariously liable for the applicants\u2019 actions .", "CARDINAL . The court determined the quantum of the award in equity , as required under LAW of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It took into account ORG \u2019s circulation , the number of potential readers and the degree of moral suffering sustained by PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law , arguing , among other things , that the court of appeal \u2019s judgment was in breach of LAW . On DATE a threemember panel of ORG refused to hear their appeal . It observed that PERSON had brought CARDINAL claims of BGN CARDINAL each . Those claims had been triable at first instance not by GPE , but by GPE . By accepting to hear the case , GPE , which had the rank of a regional court , had in effect exercised its powers under LAW of LAW DATE to take up and examine at first instance a case falling within the jurisdiction of CARDINAL of the district courts in its region ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . That had in turn led to an appellate judgment by ORG . Had the procedure ran its normal course , the case would have been examined at first instance by GPE and on appeal by ORG . The case thus fell within the ambit of Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , with the result that no appeal lay against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicants , in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE a fivemember panel of ORG upheld the threemember panel \u2019s decision . It fully agreed with its reasoning and went on to say that the examination of the case at second instance by ORG due to the irregular manner in which the proceedings had unfolded in terms of which court had jurisdiction could not render a judgment concerning claims of MONEY amenable to appeal on points of law . The threshold for lodging such an appeal was primarily a function of the amount in dispute . It could not be circumvented through the application of LAW of the abovementioned LAW and the resulting examination of the case at first instance by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
