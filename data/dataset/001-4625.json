POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in LOC .", "A.", "In DATE the municipality , by way of an administrative decision , nationalised the farm belonging to the applicant \u2019s father . On an unspecified later date the applicant \u2019s father died and she obtained a judicial decision confirming that she had inherited his property .", "In DATE the Minister of Agriculture refused to allow the applicant 's motion to have this decision annulled , considering that it was in conformity with the nationalisation laws applicable at the time when the decision had been issued .", "The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE ORG set the Minister \u2019s decision aside .", "On DATE ORG declared the DATE decision null and void , finding that it was in breach of substantive law as regards the criteria for nationalisation of agricultural property .", "In DATE the farm was restored to the applicant .", "Subsequently the applicant lodged a civil action against ORG with ORG , claiming compensation for lost profits resulting from the fact that from DATE she could not use the farm and , consequently , did not realise profits therefrom .", "On DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It had regard to LAW , which provided for the liability of ORG for actual damage caused by an administrative decision annulled on the ground of unlawfulness . The court observed that under the case - law of ORG this provision constituted the exclusive legal basis of ORG liability for damages caused by an administrative decision which was annulled on CARDINAL of the grounds provided for in LAW . Thus , the provisions of LAW , which provided for full compensation for damage , including actual damage and lost profits , were not applicable to the applicant \u2019s case . Consequently , having regard to the fact that the damage claimed by the applicant was clearly covered by the notion of lost profits , the applicant \u2019s claim had to be dismissed .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision , claiming that the judgment under appeal was in breach of substantive civil law in that the court had failed to apply LAW .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court reiterated the analysis of the legal basis of ORG liability for damage caused by an administrative decision which was subsequently quashed . The court further observed that it had been the intention of the legislator to limit the scope of the liability of the ORG to actual damage and that the lower court , when dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim for lost profits , had correctly applied the relevant provisions of LAW .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment , claiming that ORG had wrongly interpreted LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation in appeal . It observed that under LAW procedure , a person who suffered damage as a result of an annulled administrative decision could claim compensation for actual damage in administrative proceedings . It was only after a final administrative decision in this respect was given that a party could lodge an action with a court . Where such an action had been lodged before the administrative decision was given , the civil court should have rejected it on those grounds . In the present case , the lower courts had accepted that the applicant pursued her compensation claim in CARDINAL separate fora , civil and administrative . It was not in dispute that the administrative proceedings were pending . As to the civil proceedings , the lower court had correctly concluded that , on account of LAW as interpreted by ORG in its resolution of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was not entitled to compensation for lost profits . Therefore , despite the fact that the courts could have rejected the applicant \u2019s action for failure to exhaust the administrative procedure provided for in this provision for pursuing her compensation claim , the judgments under examination were in compliance with the law .", "ORG finally held that the absence of an administrative decision concerning the applicant \u2019s compensation claim made it impossible for a civil court to carry out its task under LAW , i.e. to determine whether the compensation awarded to the applicant constituted a suitable redress for the damage which the nationalisation might have caused her .", "The administrative proceedings , in which the applicant claimed compensation for damage caused by the DATE nationalisation decision in that the settlement on the farm had been demolished , are pending .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW permits the amendment or annulment of any final administrative decision at any time where necessary in the general or individual interest , if this is not prohibited by specific legal provisions . In particular , pursuant to LAW , a final administrative decision is subject to annulment if it has been issued by an authority which had no jurisdiction , or if it is without a legal basis or contrary to the applicable laws .", "LAW enables persons who have sustained damage as a result of a final administrative decision which was declared null and void pursuant , inter alia , to LAW , or as a result of such decision having been annulled , to submit a compensation claim to the administrative authority which annulled this decision , and this within DATE from the date on which the decision on annulment became final . An administrative decision in respect of the compensation claim can be appealed against in a civil court .", "Under LAW , a person is liable for the normal consequences of his or her act , or failure to act , which caused damage to others . Within such limits , compensation for damage suffered comprises , if applicable laws do not provide otherwise , actual damage and lost profits ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
