On DATE he and another person , PERSON , were arrested by officers from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and customs officers on the verge of concluding a drugs deal with a couple , who managed to make their getaway .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant consistently protested his innocence , saying that he had been the victim of a put - up job by customs officers . He explained that he had agreed to act as an \u201c informer \u201d , and in that capacity had cooperated with J .- F. R. of the ORG and PERSON , a customs inspector and the person allegedly behind his arrest . As for the couple who had \u201c escaped \u201d arrest by the police , they were in fact both customs officers , known as \u201c LOC and \u201c PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of ORG upheld ORG judgment in its entirety , as regards the issues of both criminal law and customs law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant decided to appeal to ORG ; however , he later withdrew his appeal and the case was struck out of ORG list on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant completed his prison sentence . However , he remained in custody pursuant to the order requiring him to serve DATE imprisonment in default of payment of the customs fine of ORG CARDINAL . He made an urgent application to the President of the GPE tribunal de grande instance , arguing that the order for his imprisonment in default was defective , as ORG had failed to serve him with a demand for payment . The urgent - applications judge dismissed that application in an order of DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld that order for the following reasons :", "\u201c Under LAW the court may make an express order for a person who has been convicted of a [ customs ] offence or offence relating to indirect taxation to remain in custody , even if an ordinary appeal or appeal on points of law has been lodged , until he or she has paid the fiscal penalties imposed on him or her .", "The courts have consistently held that customs law is a special branch of law and an exception to the general law .", "In the present case , the express reference in LAW to LAW relates only to the length of the imprisonment in default .", "Consequently , since ORG made an express order \u2013 upheld by ORG \u2013 under LAW for enforcement of the order for imprisonment on the ground of anticipatory default , the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW giving the President of the tribunal de grande instance jurisdiction to hear urgent applications are inapplicable . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He relied in particular on the ORG 's judgment in PERSON GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B ) , in which imprisonment in default was found to constitute a \u201c penalty \u201d for the purposes of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's application on the grounds that , firstly , \u201c ORG judgments are declaratory and therefore not binding on the trial court , which is only required to apply LAW \u201d ; and , secondly , \u201c imprisonment in default possesses the legal characteristics not of a penalty , but of a means of enforcement attached to the financial penalties whose recovery they are intended to secure \u201d . ORG concluded from that that LAW , which required sentences to run concurrently , had not been infringed by the trial court and could not enable a prison sentence and term of imprisonment in default to be served concurrently .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against that judgment . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal for the following reasons :", "\u201c The appellant can not validly argue that , by sitting in private in accordance with LAW , ORG infringed LAW ...", "The requirement for a public hearing laid down by that provision applies only to proceedings for ' the determination of a criminal charge ' and can not therefore be relied on with respect to proceedings relating , as in the instance case , to an application for a ruling that sentences be served concurrently ...", "The impugned judgment and procedural documents show that the appellant , PERSON GPE , was found guilty of an offence under the drug - trafficking and customs - offences legislation and , inter alia , sentenced to DATE imprisonment and a customs fine . After being ordered to serve DATE imprisonment in default of payment , he made an application for a ruling that that term should run concurrently with the prison sentence .", "In dismissing that application , ORG found , in particular , that imprisonment in default possesses the legal characteristics not of a penalty , but of a means of enforcement attached to the financial penalties whose recovery they are intended to secure .", "In these circumstances , ORG has justified its decision and the alleged grievance is without foundation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , who has now completed all the sentences he was required to serve , was deported to GPE , where he came from , pursuant to the permanent exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . Imprisonment in default is a surviving relic of the debtors ' prison , and entails jail for the recalcitrant debtor . It is now only available as a remedy to the ORG and guarantees the recovery of money owed to the ORG , such as financial penalties or any other sums due to the ORG apart from civil reparation .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant was convicted , Article L.CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW was still in force and provided :", "As an exception to the provisions of LAW , the length of imprisonment in default shall be DATE where fines and any other pecuniary penalties imposed for any of the offences mentioned in the preceding paragraph or for the related customs offences exceed FRF CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of the Customs Code provides :", "\u201c Judgments concerning customs offences may be executed by any means provided for by law .", "Judgments by which persons are convicted of offences against customs legislation shall also be enforceable by imprisonment in default ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Customs Code provides :", "\u201c A person convicted of a customs offence or an offence relating to indirect taxation may , where the court makes an express order to that effect , be kept in detention , even if an ordinary appeal or an appeal on points of law has been lodged , until he has paid the fiscal penalties imposed on him ; save in the case of drug offences , any period of detention served on that account following conviction shall be deducted from the period of imprisonment in default ordered by the court and may not exceed the minimum period laid down in LAW for failure to comply with an order to pay a sum equal to the fiscal penalties imposed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As an exception to the general law , the customs authorities may , therefore , seek a court order under LAW for the enforcement of an order for imprisonment on the ground of anticipatory default of payment of a customs fine . In practice , this means that , instead of being released , a debtor who has completed his or her prison sentence for a criminal offence will immediately begin to serve the term of imprisonment in default .", "CARDINAL . Traditionally , the courts regarded imprisonment in default as a means of enforcement intended to compel debtors to perform the obligations imposed on them . Following the ORG 's judgment in ORG , cited above , ORG has ruled that imprisonment in default constitutes \u201c a measure of a penal nature , prescribed by law to guarantee compliance with pecuniary orders , fiscal penalties and fraudulently evaded duties , as permitted by LAW ( b ) of LAW \u201d and not \u201c a subsidiary prison sentence that may run concurrently with a custodial sentence pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the former Criminal Code \u201d ( ORG ( \u201c PERSON . crim . \u201d ) , CARDINAL DATE ) . ORG added , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that \u201c an order for imprisonment in default constitutes a penalty within the meaning of LAW and , if ordered to ensure the payment of debts due to the customs authorities , is unenforceable unless a demand for payment has been served on the debtor under LAW and DATE before enforcement commences , as , in providing a special procedure for implementing imprisonment in default , LAW did not exclude the application of ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW \u201d ( Court of Cassation , Commercial Division ( \u201c GPE . com . \u201d ) , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . This rule is laid down by LAW , which was in force when the applicant was sentenced :", "\u201c If a defendant is convicted of CARDINAL serious crime [ crimes ] or other major offence [ d\u00e9lits ] , he shall only receive the longest of the sentences . The same rule shall apply to custodial sentences imposed on a defendant convicted of CARDINAL class - five minor offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The rule that sentences shall run concurrently is now contained in Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL to CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG has consistently held that orders for imprisonment in default are not penal in nature , but constitute a means of enforcement . It has ruled in particular that \u201c although statute attaches imprisonment in default to the financial penalties it is intended to secure recovery of , it nonetheless remains a means of enforcement \u201d ( PERSON . crim . , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , owing to that interpretation of the nature of imprisonment in default , the rule that sentences must run concurrently can not apply under NORP law to a prison sentence and a term of imprisonment in default .", "CARDINAL . However , the different Divisions of ORG are divided on whether imprisonment in default constitutes a penalty or a means of execution . ORG considers that it constitutes a penalty within the meaning of LAW ( PERSON . com . , CARDINAL DATE , cited at paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
