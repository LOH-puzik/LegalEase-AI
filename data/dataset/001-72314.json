RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in the city of GPE , GPE region . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant claimed that during the World War II he had been detained in a NORP concentration camp . By LAW of DATE , former prisoners of NORP concentration camps became entitled to certain social benefits , in particular , to a supplement to their retirement pension . On DATE a special municipal commission ( \u201c the commission \u201d ) granted the applicant the pension supplement on this ground .", "On DATE the commission revoked its decision of DATE , referring to the lack of evidence that the applicant in fact had been in a concentration camp , and , thus , had indeed been entitled to the supplement .", "On DATE the commission decided to withhold PERCENT of the applicant \u2019s retirement pension to cover the sums wrongly paid to him DATE . As a result , according to the respondent Government , DATE the commission withheld from the applicant \u2019s pension MONEY to compensate for the previous erroneous payments .", "The applicant brought a civil action against the commission seeking restoration of the supplement , recovery of the sums withheld , and compensation for damage .", "On DATE ORG of GPE found in the applicant \u2019s favour , holding that the retirement pension was the applicant \u2019s \u201c possession \u201d . According to LAW , no one could be deprived of his possession otherwise than by a court decision . Therefore , the deduction of PERCENT from his pension by an administrative decision had been unlawful . The district court also noted that the commission had failed to hear the applicant and witnesses , and to obtain an expert opinion . Finally , the court found that no legal procedure existed to revoke the supplement once granted . The court quashed the decision of DATE ordering the commission to return to the applicant the money deducted from his pension and to resume paying him the supplement .", "The defendant appealed . On DATE ORG delivered a new judgment on the merits . Firstly , ORG found that the decision to revoke the supplement had been \u201c well - founded \u201d . The ORG further stated that , on the other hand , the money paid in excess could be deducted from the retirement pension only in case of an abuse by the pensioner , which was not the case . The court found that the deduction from the applicant \u2019s pension had been unlawful .", "In the operative part of the judgement ORG quashed the decision of DATE , confirming that the applicant was no longer entitled to receive the supplement . ORG also held that no deduction could be made from the applicant \u2019s pension . However , the ORG did not order , at least explicitly , the reimbursement of the sum withheld DATE .", "As follows from the Government \u2019s submissions , pursuant to the decision of DATE the money withheld was returned to the applicant . Thus , on DATE the local Commission on ORG pensions decided to return to the applicant MONEY ( protocol of the deliberations of the Commission no . CARDINAL ) . On DATE the commission decided to return to the applicant the remaining of the sum withheld , namely MONEY ( protocol of the deliberations no . CARDINAL ) . Those amounts were transferred to the applicant in DATE respectively . The applicant did not contest these facts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
