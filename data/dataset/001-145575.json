NORP Before the economic reforms that were carried out in the SFRY in DATE , its commercial banking system consisted of basic and associated banks . Basic banks had separate legal personality , but were integrated into the organisational structure of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL associated banks . As a rule , basic banks were founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit ( that is , in CARDINAL of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE DATE or ORG and GPE \u2013 of ORG ) . Socially owned companies were the flagship of the NORP model of self - management : neither private nor ORG - owned , they were a collective property controlled by their employees , based on a communist vision of industrial relations ( the phenomenon and the current status of such companies in GPE , where they continue to exist , has been described in NORP GPE and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL , DATE ) . CARDINAL or more basic banks could form an associated bank .

Similarly , GPE , at which CARDINAL of the present applicants had opened accounts , had , together with some other basic banks , formed an associated bank called LOC udru\u017eena Banka .", "CARDINAL . In the SFRY there were also CARDINAL national banks , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and a national bank in each of the six Republics and CARDINAL ORG .", "CARDINAL . Being hard - pressed for hard currency , the SFRY made it attractive for its expatriates and other citizens to deposit foreign currency with its banks . Such deposits earned high interest , the DATE rate often exceeding PERCENT , and were guaranteed by the ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON and Other Financial Institutions Act DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG guarantee was to be activated in case of a bank \u2019s bankruptcy or \u201c manifest insolvency \u201d at the request of the bank ( section CARDINAL of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Insolvency Act DATE and the relevant secondary legislation ) . None of the banks under consideration in the present case made such a request .", "CARDINAL . Savers could not request the activation of the guarantee of their own volition , but were entitled , in accordance with LAW DATE , to collect their deposits at any time , together with accrued interest . Section CARDINAL of that Act provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A contract for a monetary deposit shall be formed when the bank agrees to accept and the depositor agrees to deposit a certain sum of money in the bank .", "( CARDINAL ) Under such a contract , the bank shall have the right to use the deposited money and the obligation to return it in accordance with the terms set out in the agreement . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c If a savings account is opened , the bank or financial institution shall issue the saver with a savings book . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Act provided :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) All deposits and withdrawals shall be recorded in a savings book .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Signed and stamped entries in savings books shall constitute proof of deposits and withdrawals .", "( CARDINAL ) Any agreement to the contrary shall be null and void . \u201d", "Furthermore , section CARDINAL of the LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Interest shall be paid on savings deposits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Beginning in DATE , the banks incurred foreignexchange losses because of depreciation of the dinar exchange rate . In response , the SFRY introduced a system for \u201c redepositing \u201d foreign currency , allowing banks to transfer ORG foreign - currency deposits to the ORG , which assumed the currency risk ( section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) . Although the system was legally optional , in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign - currency accounts with foreign banks , which were necessary to make payments abroad , nor were they allowed to grant foreign - currency loans . Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the ORG according to CARDINAL of the following CARDINAL methods : either the \u201c accounting \u201d or \u201c pro forma \u201d method , or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the ORG . The accounting method was used far more often , as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the ORG without having to pay fees to foreign banks ( see NORP and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ; see also decision ORG CARDINAL of ORG DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . According to an internal report of the ORG of DATE , by DATE an equivalent of MONEY had been redeposited with the ORG , of which only around ORG CARDINAL ( that is , slightly above PERCENT ) had been physically transferred to the ORG \u2019s many foreign accounts . It would appear that the funds in the ORG \u2019s foreign accounts have recently been divided among the successor GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to GPE , where the first CARDINAL applicants held their accounts , the redepositing scheme operated as follows . Pursuant to a series of agreements ( between GPE and GPE , ORG and ORG ) , GPE was to transfer DATE to ORG , for the account of PERSON , any difference between the foreign currency deposited and the foreign currency withdrawn . Some of those funds were transferred back to GPE at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs ( during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited ) . Indeed , in the period from DATE to CARDINAL , DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL was transferred to GPE and DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( that is , PERCENT ) back to GPE . The funds which had not been transferred back to GPE were redeposited with the ORG according to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL methods described in paragraph CARDINAL above : the \u201c accounting \u201d or \u201c pro forma \u201d method ( in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left GPE ) , or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the ORG . Regardless of the redepositing method used , all those funds were recorded as a claim of GPE against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under the agreements mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , GPE was granted dinar loans ( initially interest - free ) by the ORG , via ORG , in return for the value of the redeposited foreign currency . The dinars received by ORG were used by that basic bank to offer loans , at interest rates below the rate of inflation , to companies based , as a rule , in the same territorial unit .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the redepositing system was stopped ( by an amendment to section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) . Banks were given permission to open accounts with foreign banks . GPE , like other banks , seized that opportunity and deposited around ORG CARDINAL with foreign banks in the period from DATE to DATE . There is no information in the file as to what has happened to those funds .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the reforms carried out in DATE , the SFRY abolished the system of basic and associated banks described above . This shift in the banking regulations allowed some basic banks to opt for an independent status , while other basic banks became branches ( without legal personality ) of the former associated banks to which they had formerly belonged . On DATE Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo , mentioned above , thus became a branch ( without legal personality ) of GPE ; the latter assumed the former \u2019s rights , assets and liabilities . GPE , mentioned above , became an independent bank with its seat in GPE and a number of branches in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the convertibility of the dinar was declared , which led to a massive withdrawal of foreign currency . The SFRY therefore resorted to emergency measures restricting to a large extent withdrawals of foreign - currency deposits . For example , as of DATE , when the amendment to section CARDINAL of ORG DATE came into force , savers could withdraw their savings only to pay for imported goods or services for their own or their close relatives\u2019 needs , to purchase foreign - currency bonds , to make testamentary gifts for scientific or humanitarian purposes , or to pay for life insurance with a local insurance company . In addition , section CARDINAL of the SFRY government \u2019s decision of DATE , which was in force until DATE , and section CARDINAL(c ) of the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE , which ORG declared unconstitutional in DATE , limited the amount that savers could withdraw or use for the above purposes to DEM CARDINAL per transaction , but not more than DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL per month ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The dissolution of the SFRY occurred in DATE . In the successor ORG , foreign - currency savings deposited prior to the dissolution were placed under a special regime and are commonly referred to as \u201c old \u201d or \u201c frozen \u201d foreign - currency savings . An overview of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning such savings in each of the CARDINAL successor GPE is provided below . The successor ORG , which are also the respondent parties to the present case , are presented below in alphabetical order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE GPE took over the statutory guarantee for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings from ORG ( see section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .

In DATE ORG GPE carried out an inspection of the new GPE and noted many shortcomings . First of all , the management of the new FAC had not been properly appointed and it was not clear who its shareholders were . ORG , for that reason , appointed a director of that bank . Secondly , as a domestic bank , GPE could not have assumed a foreign bank \u2019s liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings , as this would impose new financial obligations on the State of GPE ( as the ORG was the statutory guarantor for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in all domestic banks ) .

Consequently , it continued to administer \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at ORG GPE branch ; PERCENT of those savings were used in the privatisation process in the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
