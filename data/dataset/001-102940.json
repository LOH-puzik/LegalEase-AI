The applicant was born in DATE and lives in NORP ( Canton of Solothurn ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been suffering from a serious bipolar affective disorder for DATE . During this period he has twice attempted suicide and has stayed in psychiatric hospitals on several occasions . On DATE he became a member of ORG , an association which offers , among other services , assisted suicide . Taking the view that his illness , for which treatment is difficult , made it impossible for him to live with dignity , the applicant asked ORG to assist him in ending his life . He approached several psychiatrists to obtain the necessary lethal substance , namely CARDINAL grams of sodium pentobarbital , which is available only on prescription , but was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contacted various official bodies seeking permission to obtain sodium pentobarbital from a pharmacy without a prescription , through the intermediary of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it did not have jurisdiction to grant his request and rejected it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on the ground that sodium pentobarbital could only be obtained on prescription from a pharmacy . It also expressed its opinion that LAW did not impose on the States Parties a positive obligation to create the conditions for committing suicide without the risk of failure and without pain .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE also dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , finding that , in the absence of the necessary medical prescription , he could not be authorised to obtain the substance in question from a pharmacy . It too noted that such a right could not be inferred from LAW . That decision was upheld by ORG GPE of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG declared inadmissible an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of DATE , on the ground that this was not an emergency in which a substance usually subject to medical prescription could be delivered without CARDINAL . It noted that only a doctor could issue the relevant prescription .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged appeals with ORG against the decisions of ORG of the ORG and ORG of the GPE of GPE . Relying in particular on LAW , he alleged that this provision guaranteed the right to choose to die and that ORG interference with this right was acceptable only in the conditions set out in the second paragraph of LAW . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the obligation to submit a medical prescription in order to obtain the substance necessary for suicide , and the impossibility of procuring such a prescription \u2013 which , in his view , was attributable to the threat that hung over doctors of having their licence withdrawn by the authorities should they prescribe the substance in question to mentally ill persons DATE amounted to interference with his right to respect for his private life . He argued that while this interference was admittedly in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim , it was not , in his case , proportionate .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG joined the CARDINAL sets of proceedings and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeals .", "CARDINAL . It noted , firstly , that , pursuant to the applicable legal provisions , sodium pentobarbital could only be obtained on medical prescription and that the applicant had not obtained such a prescription . It further noted that this was not an exceptional case in which a medical product could be issued without a prescription .", "CARDINAL . As to the alleged violation of LAW , ORG found as follows :", "[ Translation ]", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The right to self - determination within the meaning of LAW [ of the LAW ] includes the right of an individual to decide at what point and in what manner he or she will die , at least where he or she is capable of freely reaching a decision in that respect and of acting accordingly ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The right to choose to die , which is not as such in issue here , must however be distinguished from the right to assistance with suicide from the ORG or a third party . In principle , such a right can not be inferred either from DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW [ enshrining individual freedom ] or from LAW ; an individual who wishes to die does not have a right to be assisted in committing suicide , whether by the provision of the necessary means or through active assistance where he or she is not capable of ending his or her own life ... The ORG has a fundamental obligation to protect life . Admittedly , such protection is not generally extended against the will of a person who is capable of forming his or her own views ... Nonetheless , it does not follow that the ORG has a positive obligation to ensure that a person who wishes to die has access to a dangerous substance , selected for the purpose of suicide , or to tools intended to be used for that purpose . In such circumstances , the right to life guaranteed by LAW obliges the ORG , at the very least , to put in place a procedure to ensure that a decision to commit suicide does indeed correspond to the free will of the individual in question ...", "CARDINAL . The foregoing is confirmed by the case - law of the GPE institutions : Article CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] guarantees no right to die , whether with the assistance of a third party or of the ORG ; the right to life has no corresponding negative freedom ( judgment in Pretty v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALIII ) ... Article CARDINAL does not in principle oblige the ORG to guarantee criminal impunity for assisting a person to commit suicide or to create a legal basis for another form of assistance with that act ; the ORG must not sanction actions intended to terminate life ( Pretty , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . ) . With regard to LAW , the ORG found DATE without in any way negating the principle of sanctity of life \u2013 the quality of life and , in consequence , the question of the individual \u2019s autonomy play a role under this provision ( judgment in Pretty , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The ORG stated that it \u2018 [ was not prepared ] to PERSON that the fact that the applicant was precluded from exercising her choice to avoid what she consider[ed would ] be an undignified and distressing end to her life constituted an interference with her right to respect for private life within the meaning of LAW , cited above , LAW ; see also the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE [ Attorney General ; [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL ] , and Judge PERSON \u2019s opinion as the basis of the majority \u2019s findings ) ; this had already been presaged in the DATE PERSON case , where the Commission had emphasised that the activity of a person aiding and abetting suicide did not , as such , fall within the sphere of Article CARDINAL , but that , on the contrary , the protection of the private life of the person seeking to die could be at stake ( inadmissibility decision in PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The case of Pretty ( like that of PERSON ) is not comparable to the instant case : the applicant \u2019s freedom to commit suicide , and consequently the impunity of an individual who might provide assistance to that end , providing he or she is not acting from selfish motives ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) , are not in issue here . The matter in dispute is whether , on the basis of LAW must take steps to ensure that the applicant is able to end his life without pain and without risk of failure , and that , in consequence , he is able to obtain sodium pentobarbital without a medical prescription , in derogation from the legislation . This question must be answered in the negative : admittedly , the ORG guarantees not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective ( judgment in PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ) ; it does not appear , however , DATE given that other options exist \u2013 that the freedom to commit suicide and , accordingly , the freedom to choose one \u2019s own quality of life are restricted by the mere fact that the ORG does not authorise the unconditional issue of the substance in question , but makes it dependent on the presentation of a medical prescription , issued on the basis of the \u2018 recognised rules of pharmaceutical and medical science\u2019 and knowledge of the health of the individual concerned ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL of the LPTh [ ORG ] , and section CARDINAL ) , taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL , of the Lstup [ LAW ] ) . In order to guarantee effectively the freedom to choose to end one \u2019s own life , derived from LAW , it is not necessary to authorise unrestricted availability of sodium pentobarbital , even if this substance is supposedly highly suitable for the act of committing suicide . The mere fact that solutions other than sodium pentobarbital entail higher risks of failure and greater pain is not sufficient to justify the provision , without prescription , of this substance for the purpose of suicide . Such a positive obligation can not be inferred either from LAW or from LAW ...", "...", "CARDINAL . The obligation to submit a medical prescription has a clear , accessible and foreseeable legal basis , namely , in respect of domestic law , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) [ sic ] of LAW , and , with regard to international law , LAW of the [ ORG Substances of CARDINAL DATE . Generally speaking , this obligation is intended to protect the health and safety of the population and , in the context of assisted suicide , to prevent the commission of criminal offences and combat the risks of abuse ( Pretty judgment , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and DATE ... ) . A substance ; in the patient \u2019s interests , provision of such a substance must be subject to the presentation of a medical prescription . A medical prescription presupposes a diagnosis drawn up on the basis of a doctor \u2019s professional code of ethics , a medical indication ( GPE ) and an information - seeking interview . Only a doctor can assess a patient \u2019s capacity for discernment and his or her medical records , and determine whether all treatment options have been exhausted to no avail ... The obligation to obtain a prescription for sodium pentobarbital is a guarantee that doctors will not issue this substance without all the necessary conditions being fulfilled , since otherwise they would leave themselves open to criminal , civil or disciplinary sanctions ... It protects individuals from hasty and unconsidered decisions ... and guarantees the existence of a medical justification for the action . ... A potential interference with the right to self - determination protected by LAW has only a relative bearing in view of the consequences attached to issuing sodium pentobarbital for the purpose of suicide . ... In contrast , the protection of life , the prohibition of murder and the latter \u2019s delimitation with regard to assisted suicide , which is not a priori subject to penalties , represent a significant public interest . ... While assisted suicide by medical means is authorised , a matter that , given the importance of the ethical issue at stake , must in the first instance be assessed by the legislature ( see the above - cited Pretty judgment , \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine ) , the ORG is entitled to put in place a procedure for review , thus guaranteeing that the decision of the individual concerned does indeed correspond to his or her free and considered will ... ; to that end , the obligation to obtain a medical prescription is appropriate and necessary . In so far as the applicant alleges that this argument does not take into consideration the CARDINAL cases of suicide and the CARDINAL cases of attempted suicide per year , in which the ORG allegedly fails to comply with its duty of protection , it must be emphasised that those cases do not , as the instant case does , concern the question of dispensing , without prescription , a substance for the purpose of suicide and are thus not comparable to the present situation .", "...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The regulations on assisted suicide are relatively liberal in GPE , in so far as assistance or incitement is punishable only in the event of selfish motives ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . In contrast , the legislature remains free , in weighing up the interests at stake \u2013 the right to self - determination of persons wishing to kill themselves on the one hand , and protection against impulsive suicides ( GPE ) on the other \u2013 to make the legality of assisted suicide and the provision of a dangerous product subject to compliance with professional rules and the state of medical science . LAW issued by ORG on DATE acknowledge that , in borderline cases , a doctor may be faced with an \u2018 intractable ORG ( point CARDINAL of the Guidelines ) . Clearly , assisted suicide can not be considered as part of a doctor \u2019s activities , since it is self - evident that such an action goes against the aim of medicine ; however , respect for the patient \u2019s wishes is also fundamental to the relationship between the doctor and patient , so that the doctor may be led to take a decision in all conscience , a decision that ought to be respected . If the doctor opts for assisted suicide , he is guarantor of the fact that : ( CARDINAL ) the patient \u2019s illness makes it likely that death is close ; ( CARDINAL ) other options for support have been discussed and , where appropriate , put into place ; and ( CARDINAL ) the patient is capable of discernment , his or her wish appears to be carefully considered , is not the result of external pressure and is to be regarded as final , which must be verified by an independent third party who need not necessarily be a doctor ; the final act which leads to death must always be carried out by the patient himself . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s assertions , a doctor is entitled , in the context of the recognised professional rules , to prescribe sodium pentobarbital for the purpose of suicide , provided that the conditions for doing so are fulfilled . As ORG has already observed , a change in attitude is to be perceived in modern society , in the sense that assisted suicide is increasingly considered as a voluntary medical activity which can not be imposed on any doctor , but which is not excluded by the rules of professional conduct and supervision , provided that the duty of medical care is respected in examining patients , diagnosing them and dispensing the product ( judgment CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , with references ) , and provided that doctors do not allow themselves to be guided solely by their patient \u2019s wish to die and fail to examine the reasons for such a decision in accordance with the applicable scientific criteria ...", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . NORP The question of prescribing and dispensing sodium pentobarbital is particularly problematic in cases of mental illness :", "CARDINAL . It must not be forgotten that a serious , incurable and chronic mental illness may , in the same way as a somatic illness , cause suffering such that , over time , the patient concludes that his or her life is no longer worth living . The most recent ethical , legal and medical opinions indicate that in such cases also the prescription of sodium pentobarbital is not necessarily precluded or to be excluded on the ground that it would represent a breach of the doctor \u2019s duty of care ... However , the greatest restraint must be exercised : it is necessary to distinguish between a desire to die as the expression of a psychological disorder which can and must be treated , and a wish to die that is based on the considered and sustained decision of a person capable of discernment ( \u2018 pre - suicide assessment\u2019 ) , which must be respected as applicable . Where the wish to die is based on an autonomous and all - embracing decision , it is not prohibited to prescribe sodium pentobarbital to a person suffering from a psychiatric illness and , consequently , to assist him or her in committing suicide ...", "CARDINAL . The question of whether the conditions have been met in a given case can not be examined without recourse to specialised medical DATE and particularly psychiatric \u2013 knowledge , which is difficult in practice ; a thorough psychiatric examination thus becomes necessary ... , which can only be guaranteed if the obligation to submit a prescription in order to obtain sodium pentobarbital is maintained , and if responsibility does not lie solely with private organisations for assisted suicide . The activities of such organisations have been criticised on several occasions ; a study carried out in GPE , analysing CARDINAL cases of assisted suicide by the organisation ORG DATE , rightly criticised the failure to take into account psychiatric or social factors in the decision to end one \u2019s life ... Accordingly , one can not argue that issuing sodium pentobarbital and delegating responsibility for its use to an organisation for assisted suicide is equally compatible with the purpose of the legislation as maintaining the obligation to obtain a medical prescription .", "CARDINAL . To conclude , it is appropriate to note that DATE contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegations \u2013 neither LAW ... impose an obligation on the ORG to issue , without medical prescription , sodium pentobarbital to organisations for assisted suicide or to persons who wish to end their lives . The requirement of a medical prescription for sodium pentobarbital has a legal basis , is intended to protect public safety and health and to maintain order in the public interest , and is also a proportionate and necessary measure in a NORP society . In weighing up the interests at stake , namely the protection of life DATE which requires ( as a minimum ) verification , on a case - by - case basis , of whether NORP decisions to end their lives genuinely correspond to their free and considered will where they opt for assisted suicide using a product subject to legislation on drugs or medicinal products DATE , and the individual \u2019s right to self - determination , the ORG remains free \u2013 from the standpoint of constitutional law or of the Convention \u2013 to lay down certain conditions and , in this context , to maintain , inter alia , the obligation to obtain a prescription for sodium pentobarbital . The ( summary ) medical documents submitted [ by the applicant ] alter nothing in his case ; the delivery of a substance for the purpose of assisted suicide necessitates , in his case too , a thorough and considered examination and a medical indication , and , with regard to the genuineness of his wish to die and capacity for discernment in this connection , monitoring over a certain period by a medical specialist who would subsequently be able , as appropriate , to issue a medical prescription ; in contrast , in the context of the present case [ the applicant ] can not receive such a prescription by requesting that the obligation to present a prescription be lifted ; for this reason , the explanations with regard to his capacity for discernment do not appear relevant ( Pretty judgment , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to CARDINAL psychiatrists , almost all of whom , according to the information available to the ORG , practise in the GPE region . He asked each of them whether they would agree to see him for the purpose of carrying out a psychiatric examination and with a view to issuing a prescription for sodium pentobarbital . The letter was worded as follows :", "[ Translation ]", "\u201c Dear Sir / Madam ,", "Please find attached a copy of a ORG judgment in my case . I had asked ORG to be granted direct access to sodium pentobarbital so that , with the help of GPE , I could commit assisted suicide without risk of failure and without pain . Admittedly , ORG has accepted that the right to choose the time and manner of one \u2019s death is a human right . At the same time , it has held that direct access to sodium pentobarbital is impossible , since a medical prescription is necessary in order to obtain the said product .", "Given that I suffer from mental illness , ORG also stated that a preliminary in - depth psychiatric examination was also necessary ( p. CARDINAL , paragraph ORG . ) . This should determine whether my wish to die is the expression of a psychological disorder that is open to treatment or whether it results from an autonomous , considered and sustained decision by a person who is capable of discernment ( see also p. CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . ) .", "I hereby ask whether you would be willing to accept me as a patient , for the sole purpose of conducting such an assessment .", "In addition , I draw your attention to the fact that I am unlikely to commit suicide at present ; I have not taken neuroleptics since DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
