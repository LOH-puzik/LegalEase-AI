In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the defendant replied that it had already filed its observations with ORG . On DATE ORG transferred those observations to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the applicant to specify which public body possessed the powers conferred by LAW in the area of security screening after the dissolution of the NORP and GPE on DATE . On DATE the applicant responded that the body currently responsible for security screening in GPE was ORG of GPE ( \u201c the NORP Ministry \u201d ) . It was thus understood that the action was directed against the said Ministry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG invited the applicant to submit within DATE second copies of the action and of the submissions of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG requested that ORG submit within DATE copies of all ex - StB documents concerning the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The request of CARDINAL DATE was answered on DATE by the ORG to the effect that , apart from a database in which the applicant was listed as an ex - StB agent , there were no ex - StB materials concerning him in its possession . The defendant relied on a treaty between the governments of GPE and GPE on joint usage of information and archives generated by ministries of the interior in the area of internal order and security which had been signed on DATE and promulgated in LAW under No . CARDINAL ( \u201c the treaty of DATE \u201d ) . The ORG submitted that under this treaty the relevant documents were with ORG .

As this period had already expired , there was presently no official body entrusted with these powers in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reiterated its request to ORG for copies of ex - StB documents concerning the applicant .

On CARDINAL DATE ORG informed ORG that the question of legal succession in respect of the powers under LAW was not currently addressed in the existing legislation . However , by analogy , the powers of ORG had been assumed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the NORP Ministry informed ORG that there were no documents concerning the applicant in its archives .

The applicant extended the action by directing it also against the Government of GPE , as a collective constitutional body with distinct legal personality . The hearing was adjourned in order for the applicant to resubmit the extended action in writing . He did so on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed its observations in reply to the extended action .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified later point the Vice - President of ORG exercised his power under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG of DATE and assigned the case to another ORG of that court on the ground that the original ORG had an excessive workload .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG allowed the extension of the action against ORG . On DATE it invited the applicant to disclose the address of witness M.", "CARDINAL . In a written submission of DATE ORG asserted that the Government was not the legal successor of ORG and possessed no powers under LAW . It was thus not the correct defendant to the action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG that he had no information as to the address of PERSON and requested that the court itself make an inquiry as to the address .", "CARDINAL .

Their discussions were of a general nature and included the situation at the applicant \u2019s workplace . The applicant also admitted having obtained and provided to PERSON a list of students who had been preparing for studies abroad , information he considered public in any case . He had never had the impression that he was considered a collaborator and had never been asked to keep his contacts with PERSON and PERSON secret .", "The hearing was adjourned until DATE with a view to calling the witnesses again .", "DATE . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE ORG heard PERSON and PERSON confirmed that he had been in charge of recruiting the applicant as a collaborator . However , if there had ever been any act of formal undertaking to cooperate ( viazac\u00ed akt ) on the part of the applicant , PERSON had not been present at it . He had received the impression that the applicant had not been interested in meeting him . Their conversation had concerned ordinary affairs and the applicant had not submitted any documents . The reports mentioned in the StB file had been drawn up by PERSON on the basis of his conversation with the applicant . According to PERSON , the applicant had never given any information that was capable of harming any specific person . There had been norms as to how many new agents were to be recruited . As a result , new \u201c recruitments \u201d had frequently been only formal , with the new \u201c agents \u201d conceivably having no knowledge of them .", "Witness PERSON claimed to know the applicant only by face . He did not remember having ever met him and denied having ever received any information or documents from him . The applicant \u2019s StB file was partially created by PERSON In the given period the situation in the ORG had been such that , in order to meet their statistical objectives , it was possible for officers to run a file in respect of an \u201c agent \u201d by filing information from their own sources and declaring them as having been obtained from that \u201c agent \u201d .", "The witness P. did not appear and the court observed that it had been impossible to deliver the summons to him . In response to the court \u2019s request , the parties stated that they intended to adduce no further evidence apart from hearing PERSON and examining the relevant Internal Guideline of the Federal Ministry of DATE ( \u201c the DATE guideline \u201d ) concerning secret collaboration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the summons for the forthcoming hearing be served on P. by the police . No service was however actually effected .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the ORG submitted the DATE guideline . As this document was classified , the applicant had no access to it . Apart from proposing to hear P. the parties adduced no other evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG listed a hearing for DATE and ordered that the summons be served on P. by the police . At this hearing PERSON finally appeared and gave evidence . He acknowledged that he had been the chief district police officer during the relevant period and that he remembered the applicant . However , he could not recollect clearly the details of their collaboration . PERSON pointed out that the ORG \u2019s organisation had been very strict and considered that , if something had been recorded , it must have been true . In contradiction to PERSON considered that it was not possible that the applicant had not known that he was acting for the StB as an \u201c agent \u201d .", "The applicant submitted that the majority of his foreign travel had taken place before DATE , when he was allegedly acquired as an agent . The contention that he had agreed to collaborate in return for the ORG \u2019s support in connection with travel was therefore unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following another hearing held on DATE , ORG dismissed the action .", "CARDINAL . First of all , ORG found that the Government of GPE had no standing to be sued in the proceedings and that the correct entity to defend the action was the ORG . ORG considered that the crucial criterion for establishing standing was which entity de facto possessed the ex - StB archives .", "On the basis of the StB file pertaining to the applicant , ORG established that the applicant had been listed since DATE as a \u201c candidate for secret collaboration \u201d and as an \u201c agent \u201d of the ORG since DATE . For tactical reasons it had been decided not to have the applicant sign a formal undertaking to collaborate . This was permitted under the DATE guideline . The applicant \u2019s StB file contained only an index indicating which reports and documents he had provided . There was a note that the reports and documents themselves had been officially destroyed in DATE when , according to the file , cooperation with the applicant had been terminated .", "ORG also noted that the applicant had on CARDINAL occasions travelled abroad to western LOC at the relevant time and that it was then usual for a person to be interviewed by the ORG prior to and after such travel . The applicant himself acknowledged having met the StB in connection with his travels . He also admitted having been in contact with PERSON and having unwillingly met with them . However he categorically denied ever having given them any intelligence information .", "The other witness evidence was contradictory . ORG based its finding on the testimony of P. , holding it to be credible and consistent with the case file , and did not accept the testimony of PERSON , observing that it contradicted the applicant \u2019s own submissions . In the light of all the information in its possession , including what was known of the applicant \u2019s intellectual capacity , ORG found that he must have known that he had been meeting ORG agents and that their contact had actually amounted to formal collaboration . In so far as the applicant had disputed such a conclusion and asserted that his registration in the ORG files had been unjustified , he had failed to prove his case ; in particular , he had failed to show that the registration was contrary to the applicable rules .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He challenged the credibility of witness P. , objected that he had had no access to the DATE guideline , which was a crucial piece of evidence , and argued that ORG had erred in its factual assessment of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed its observations in reply to the appeal . On DATE ORG transmitted the case file to ORG for a decision on the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "It found that ORG had adequately established the facts of the case and found no logical or other errors in ORG assessment of the evidence .", "ORG held that the fact that the applicant was registered in the StB files as a person referred to in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW did not by any means constitute evidence that he had been a conscious collaborator of the ORG", "In line with established judicial practice , ORG pointed out that the procedure concerning the issuance of a security clearance under LAW could not amount to a violation of an individual \u2019s good name and reputation . Only unjustified registration in the StB files would amount to such a violation .", "ORG considered that it was crucial for the applicant to prove that his registration had been contrary to the rules applicable at the material time and concurred with ORG conclusion that the applicant had failed to do so . No appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , as applicable at the relevant time , courts were to work together with the parties to ensure that contentious facts were established reliably and that the parties\u2019 rights were protected speedily and effectively .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , once proceedings commence , the court is to act without further procedural motions so that the matter is examined and determined as expeditiously as possible .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , a hearing is to be prepared by the President of the Chamber so that the matter can be decided , usually ( spravidla ) in a single session .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the parties to the proceedings are to adduce evidence in support of their assertions . The court may also take and examine ( vykona\u0165 ) evidence which has not been adduced [ by the parties ] . The court decides on the facts as established on the basis of the evidence taken and examined .", "CARDINAL . The mechanism of legal protection of personal integrity under LAW seq . of LAW has primarily found its practical application in defamation proceedings . Certain judicial decisions ( see the judgments of ORG file nos . CARDINALCo CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and academic views ( see PERSON , PERSON , GPE , a.s . , DATE , p. CARDINAL and J : PERSON ; PERSON pr\u00e1vo na ORG , ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) seem to suggest that , in actions of that type , the burden of proving that an interference with the plaintiff \u2019s good name and reputation was justified lies with the defendant .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to protection of their personality rights ( personal integrity ) , in particular of their life and health , civil and human dignity , privacy , name and personal characteristics .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to request that unjustified infringement of their personality rights be ended and that the consequences of such infringement be eliminated . They also have the right to appropriate just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that , in cases where the satisfaction obtained under LAW is insufficient , in particular because the injured party \u2019s dignity or social standing has been considerably diminished , the injured party is also entitled to financial compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The Act laid down supplementary requirements for the holding of certain important posts and functions in ORG organs and institutions which were filled by election , designation or appointment . The LAW prevented persons mentioned in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) under letters ( a ) through ( h ) from exercising the functions enumerated in section CARDINAL .", "DATE . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) , the functions covered by the LAW could be exercised only by persons who were not registered in the [ former ] StB files in the period between DATE and CARDINAL DATE as \u201c resident \u201d , \u201c agent \u201d , \u201c holder of a conferred flat \u201d , \u201c holder of a conspiratorial flat \u201d , \u201c informer \u201d or \u201c ideological collaborator of the StB \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) , the functions covered by the LAW could only be exercised by persons who had not been conscious collaborators of the StB in the above period . On DATE ORG of the NORP and GPE ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad \u010ceskej a PERSON ) found that this condition was in contradiction with LAW z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch pr\u00e1v a slob\u00f4d ) and with LAW . Accordingly , this condition was repealed as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The fact that a person met the requirements of section CARDINAL of the Act was to be proven by means of a security clearance issued by ORG under section CARDINAL of the LAW . Under paragraph CARDINAL of that section the security clearance was to be delivered into the hands of the person concerned alone .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , if a person does not meet the requirements of LAW , the employer is to terminate that person \u2019s employment by notice within DATE unless the employment terminates earlier by agreement or otherwise or the person concerned is transferred to another post outside the scope of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , such termination of employment can be challenged before the courts within DATE from the date on which the employment purportedly ended .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that any disclosure of the clearance or of the information contained in it is prohibited , save with the consent of the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . The temporal application of the LAW is governed by its section CARDINAL , under which the LAW ceased to have effect in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It has been established by judicial doctrine and the relevant case law that persons who consider themselves adversely affected by their registration in the former StB files can seek redress before civil courts by means of an action for protection of their personal integrity under LAW seq . of LAW .", "DATE . Since DATE the keeping of files generated by the StB in respect of its collaborators , purported or real , has been regulated by the Act on the Disclosure of Documents regarding ORG in DATE and on Founding ORG ( LAW ) ( PERSON o spr\u00edstupnen\u00ed dokumentov o \u010dinnosti bezpe\u010dnostn\u00fdch zlo\u017eiek \u0161t\u00e1tu DATE a o zalo\u017een\u00ed GPE pam\u00e4ti n\u00e1roda ) .", "CARDINAL . The Act regulates ( a ) the establishment of ORG ; ( b ) the recording , collecting , disclosing , publishing , managing and use of documents created by defined security forces in the period from DATE to DATE in respect of crimes committed against persons of NORP nationality or citizenship ; ( c ) the manner of detecting and prosecuting such crimes ; ( d ) the protection of the personal data of persecuted persons ; and ( e ) activity in the area of public education .", "CARDINAL . \u201c CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries . It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine , upon their request , the files kept on them by the former secret services .", "...", "CARDINAL . Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them , the ORG notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures , such as lustration or decommunisation laws . The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they can not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles , as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses that , in general , these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met . Firstly , guilt , being individual , rather than collective , must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual , and not collective , application of lustration laws . Secondly , the right of defence , the presumption of innocence until proven guilty , and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed . Revenge may never be a goal of such measures , nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed . The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law , and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process .
