ORG Austria ( ORG ) , a non - governmental organisation ( NGO ) who had already been counselling him since DATE of his admission to the detention centre , came to talk to him . On DATE PERSON was subject to an initial hunger - strike examination ( LOC ) . PERSON was handed an information pamphlet on hunger strikes ( in LANGUAGE ) and was also orally informed by the public medical officer of the possible consequences of a hunger strike . A medical hunger - strike protocol ( PERSON ) was filled out , in which his state of health was described as follows :", "\u201c Musculature in a good , well - trained state , pronounced muscles of the upper arm , CARDINAL - pack like someone who practices athletic sports , appears vital , overall . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE at TIME , GPE was taken to ORG ) for examination and an assessment of whether he was fit enough for further detention . Because GPE resisted the examination and kicked out at a nurse , his hands and feet had to be shackled by the police officers who had accompanied him to the hospital . According to a report drawn up by the treating doctor on DATE , it was \u201c not possible to assess the intake of liquids \u201d , \u201c communication [ was ] difficult \u201d because GPE did not speak LANGUAGE , he had \u201c dry lips \u201d and had his eyes \u201c constantly closed \u201d , but \u201c walking [ was ] possible if [ he was ] supported \u201d . The hospital further noted that if his general condition worsened , he would have to be force - fed and taken to a psychiatric ward , because he \u201c lashed out from time to time \u201d . Taking his blood for a blood test had been difficult and risky ; nevertheless , with the support of the CARDINAL police officers , who secured GPE in a chair in the examination room , the doctor nonetheless managed to take a small amount of blood . After consulting the senior doctor , the treating doctor formally confirmed GPE \u2019s fitness for detention and noted the police doctor \u2019s telephone number in order to contact him after obtaining the results of the blood test .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was subsequently taken back to the detention centre and at TIME was placed alone in a security cell ( ORG ) because of his behaviour at the hospital . His shackles were removed .

In a report of CARDINAL DATE the doctor from the hospital noted that GPE had been uncooperative during his examination . It had been virtually impossible to take a blood sample as the patient had resisted strongly . At that time nothing had indicated that GPE \u2019s physical condition could become life - threatening . In a statement given on DATE the doctor described PERSON as not having been weak at all , rather , he had been physically strong and had steadily resisted treatment with all his might ( nach ORG ) , using the whole of his body and kicking out with his legs . After examination of his tongue , pulse , respiration , heartbeat and skin , he had observed GPE \u2019s dry lips , but had seen none of the other usual signs of dehydration or other abnormalities .

The investigating judge ordered that an autopsy be conducted by a sworn and judicially certified expert ( beeideter und gerichtlich zertifizierter PERSON ) ; the autopsy was conducted on DATE . On DATE , the investigating judge , in response to a request made by the public prosecutor , delivered a decision ordering the seizure of the blood samples taken from GPE , together with the pertinent examination report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a detailed report on the circumstances of GPE \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested ORG at ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr interne ORG f\u00fcr GPE \u2013 hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) for it to carry out an investigation . The request included that interviews be conducted with : the CARDINAL police officers who had accompanied GPE to the hospital on DATE of his death ; the police doctor who had examined GPE on DATE ; the doctor at ORG who had examined GPE ; the police officers who had been checking on GPE when he was placed in the security cell ; and GPE \u2019s cellmate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor added to the case file a note regarding a telephone conversation between him and PERSON , the expert who had conducted the autopsy , regarding the preliminary findings of that autopsy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG subsequently conducted an investigation at the detention centre \u2019s medical service , procured documents from the detention centre , and produced written records of the requested interviews ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG \u2019s report was submitted to the public prosecutor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge complied with a request lodged by the public prosecutor for the inclusion in the case file of the results of the investigation up until that date , as well as for GPE \u2019s medical history to be obtained from the detention centre , and for these documents to be transmitted to the expert PERSON It was further decided that the scale used to weigh GPE at the detention centre be seized and sent for technical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted a report containing the results of the supplementary investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after being supplied with all pertinent documents by the ORG , ORG ( Menschenrechtsbeirat \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d DATE an independent monitoring body established in DATE at ORG ) issued a report on GPE \u2019s death . In that report , ORG considered several points to be problematic : that GPE , after his visit to ORG on DATE , had been further monitored only by police officers , rather than by medical professionals ; that no interpreter had been present during the said hospital visit ; that a blood sample had been taken from GPE against his will ; and that the calculation of GPE \u2019s critical weight had been questionable . The issues of GPE \u2019s possible dehydration and carrying sickle cell disease had not been addressed in the report , as it had been drawn up before the delivery of the final autopsy report by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was represented by counsel , joined the criminal proceedings as a private party .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE the investigating judge urged the expert to submit his report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the forensic expert who had conducted the autopsy , submitted his final autopsy report ( dated DATE ) , as well as his expert report on GPE \u2019s death , to ORG . He stated in the autopsy report that GPE \u2019s body had not shown signs of \u201c significantly acute malnutrition \u201d , nor had there been signs of \u201c classic dehydration \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the more detailed expert report , PERSON stated that GPE \u2019s body had not shown signs of any injuries ; therefore , death caused by the use of force could be excluded . PERSON had been slim , but had not appeared malnourished . His body had weighed QUANTITY ; his height had been QUANTITY . No typical external signs of dehydration had been visible , except for the lips appearing to be slightly dry . The results of the internal investigation had recorded a thickening of the blood , which indicated a possible alternation to the blood while GPE had still been alive caused by a lack of hydration . PERSON noted that a hunger strike alone could not lead to a thickening of the blood , as long as enough fluids were consumed . As concerns the hunger strike , PERSON stated that it was likely that GPE had not eaten solid food for DATE , but that it was unlikely that he had engaged in a long - term total hunger strike as the large intestine had still been filled with an abundance of stool along its entire length .", "CARDINAL . PERSON further stated that neither GPE \u2019s external appearance nor the medical reports produced until DATE had indicated a lifethreatening situation , although there had been a significant reduction in his weight . Rather , it was more likely that a shift in the electrolyte system had commenced over a period of several days , as indicated by the results of the blood test conducted by ORG on DATE . A post - mortem examination of GPE \u2019s blood ( conducted in the course of the autopsy ) had shown that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait ( PERSON ) . PERSON explained that sickle cell disease ( PERSON ) was an inherited red blood cell disorder ; while red blood cells ( containing normal haemoglobin ) were disc - shaped , sickle haemoglobin could form stiff rods within the cell , changing it into a sickle shape . PERSON added that the disease was rare among the white population , occurring mostly among black people . Unlike in the case of people suffering from sickle cell disease , in GPE \u2019s blood the trait had been present in the heterozygous form , which is why the disease had remained undetected during his lifetime . In cases like GPE \u2019s , symptoms of sickle cell disease only manifested themselves if there were further damaging external factors , such as dehydration or a lack of oxygen .", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded that the cause of GPE \u2019s death had been dehydration , combined with the fact that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait , which had caused a shift in the electrolyte system and had ultimately caused his heart to stop beating . Neither the authorities nor GPE himself had been aware that he had been a carrier of sickle cell trait . PERSON stated that GPE \u2019s death could only have been prevented if he had been tested earlier for sickle cell trait , or if he had been aware that he was a carrier thereof . However , the hunger - strike protocol had not indicated any necessity for a blood test in that respect . The test results from the hospital on DATE of GPE \u2019s death would have given reason for further tests . However , the results had only been produced after GPE \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor made a note in the criminal file ( PERSON ) about a conversation with PERSON The doctor had expressed the opinion that with hindsight PERSON \u2019s extraordinarily aggressive behaviour at the hospital on DATE of his death had resembled a delirious state caused by advanced dehydration and the consequent disintegration of his blood cells .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor decided to discontinue the criminal investigation into the death of GPE , as no sufficient evidence could be found to warrant criminal proceedings . The applicant was informed that he had the right to ask ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG to conduct a preliminary investigation . However , he was also informed that he would have to bear the full costs of the criminal proceedings should the Council Chamber grant his request but the proceedings did not result in a criminal conviction . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . The applicant did not request that a preliminary investigation be instituted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted the decision of CARDINAL DATE issued by ORG ( PERSON DATE hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to the public prosecutor and requested him to investigate further . On DATE the public prosecutor replied that the documents submitted had already been made available to him , but that they could not change his assessment of the procedural results obtained so far , since every aspect of the legal question to be answered had already been clarified by PERSON autopsy report and his comprehensive expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to review the lawfulness of GPE \u2019s detention ( LOC ) and at the same time lodged a complaint about the conditions of his detention ( Ma\u00dfnahmenbeschwerde ) . He submitted in particular that GPE should not have continued to be kept in detention because he had no longer been fit to be detained on account of his hunger strike . As regards the conditions of GPE \u2019s detention , he submitted that the medical treatment of GPE had not been in conformity with section CARDINAL ) of the Detention Ordinance ( Anhalteordnung \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He furthermore claimed that his brother had been placed in a security cell , without access to water , on DATE of his death , in contravention of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Detention Ordinance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent member of the ORG held a hearing during which he examined as witnesses the applicant , a cellmate of GPE , CARDINAL of the police doctors who had examined GPE during his hunger strike , and the police officers who had been in charge of examining detainees on DATE of GPE \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . GPE \u2019s former cellmate , PERSON , stated that they had gone on hunger strike together to protest the duration of their detention , and that they had not been treated correctly by the police officers ; however , he did not specify how that treatment had not been correct . He said that he did not remember the exact day on which they had begun their hunger strike , but that they had not eaten or drunk anything at all for DATE . PERSON stated that he had had the impression that GPE had been \u201c terribly weak \u201d during DATE before his death .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness statements by employees of ORG GPE who had visited GPE on several occasions , PERSON had not raised any allegations of ill - treatment during their visits . In fact , with the exception of his former cellmate , all other witnesses who had been in contact with PERSON until his death had also stated during the ORG hearing that he had not appeared to be ill or weak , but that on the contrary , even on DATE of his death he had seemed athletic and strong ; which had been corroborated by photographs taken of his dead body and its description by PERSON in the autopsy report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the police doctors , PERSON , gave evidence regarding , inter alia , the reason why the calculation of the critical weight of a detainee on hunger strike was based on his or her weight at the outset of the hunger strike , and not the weight recorded upon admission to the detention centre . He stated that detainees usually lost weight slightly during their detention , but that it was also possible for them to gain weight . He acknowledged that he had not even checked PERSON \u2019s initial weight , as the QUANTITY recorded on DATE after GPE had announced his hunger strike had in principle amounted to a normal weight , given his height . Dr PERSON furthermore stated that on DATE PERSON had walked into the examination room without support . DATE , GPE had showed signs of dehydration and had come to the examination room supported by CARDINAL police officers . PERSON stated that he had accordingly ordered him to be examined at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , the police officer who had accompanied GPE to and from the hospital on DATE of his death , stated that the reason for GPE \u2019s placement in solitary confinement had been DATE following GPE \u2019s behaviour at the hospital \u2013 he and the other officer in charge had feared that GPE might harm himself or others . PERSON confirmed that there had been no water outlet in the security cell , but that GPE could have requested a water bottle at any time by ringing a bell .", "CARDINAL . B. , the police officer who had been in charge of checking on GPE while he was being held in the security cell , stated that he had received an order to do so every TIME . During the checks , he had had to make sure that the detainee reacted when spoken to . When PERSON had checked on GPE at TIME , the latter had moved his head . At DATE at TIME , he had showed no reaction and had subsequently been pronounced dead by the emergency doctor , who had immediately been called to the scene .", "CARDINAL . During the ORG hearing on DATE the applicant presented an undated and unsigned CARDINAL - page statement by PERSON ORG , whom he had engaged himself and who was a general practitioner in PERSON with a focus on nutritional medicine . Dr PERSON , who had not examined GPE \u2019s body , had based his report on the autopsy report and expert report issued by PERSON , the report of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the report by ORG , and had come to the following opinion . On DATE , the day on which GPE had been taken into detention with a view to his expulsion , he had weighed QUANTITY . On DATE , DATE on which GPE had announced that he was on hunger strike , he had had a body weight of QUANTITY . The police doctor had made a mistake in taking the latter as the normal weight of GPE for the purposes of calculating his critical body weight . The doctor had not taken into account the fact that PERSON had already lost QUANTITY CARDINAL September CARDINAL , meaning that GPE must have already started his hunger strike before he had officially announced it . From DATE until DATE of his death on DATE , GPE had lost a further QUANTITY in body weight . However , the doctor had used GPE \u2019s weight on DATE ( namely QUANTITY ) as a starting point , and had established his critical weight as QUANTITY , which in PERSON view was incorrect . The police doctor should have based his calculations on how much PERSON had weighed when he had arrived at the detention centre . If he had , the correct critical weight would have been determined at QUANTITY , PERCENT . Instead , GPE at the time of his death had already lost PERCENT of his weight in fluids . For an adult person a loss of even PERCENT in fluids constituted a life - threatening situation . PERSON assumed that GPE had died of dehydration resulting from the erroneous calculation of his body weight . He did not deal with the question of how far the sickle cell trait present in GPE \u2019s blood had played a role in his death , nor did he provide any scientific source for his calculations . Dr PERSON \u2019s opinion was later not supported by any of the official experts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the ORG that the second police doctor in charge at the detention centre on DATE of GPE \u2019s death be questioned , and that another expert report be obtained in order to refute the expert report issued by PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The ORG refused these requests .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , at the end of the hearing of DATE , ruled that GPE \u2019s detention pending his expulsion had been unlawful and that the conditions of detention during his hunger strike had violated GPE \u2019s right under LAW to protection against ill - treatment . Concerning the cause of GPE \u2019s death , the ORG reiterated the findings of the autopsy report and the expert report attached thereto ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The ORG argued that the ORG authorities had not fulfilled their role of guarantor of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . It found that given the frequency of sickle cell disease among people from sub - Saharan Africa , the ORG was under an obligation to offer a test for sickle cell disease to all detainees from that specific geographic area , and in particular to those on hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of the ORG appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG quashed the ORG \u2019s decision . It held that the applicant had no locus standi regarding the request for a review of the lawfulness of the detention of his brother because rights under LAW were not transferable to other persons . Therefore , the ORG had not had authority to issue a decision in that respect . Concerning the complaint under LAW , it held that the mere fact that a person was detained did not place any duty on the ORG to take measures ( the need for which had not necessarily been foreseeable ) because of the genetic disposition of that person without a manifest outbreak of disease in that person . Moreover , it found that the ORG had not respected certain procedural requirements , which is why ORG referred the case back to the ORG .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG concerning the above - mentioned judgment of ORG ; it was registered as ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Thereupon , the ORG decided to suspend the fresh proceedings until such time as the ORG rendered its decision in respect of this complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declared application no . CARDINAL inadmissible , pursuant to LAW , as the proceedings were still pending before the ORG and the complaints lodged by the applicant with ORG were therefore premature .", "CARDINAL . The ORG resumed the proceedings and on DATE again issued a decision finding a violation of LAW in respect of the conditions of GPE \u2019s detention . It essentially reiterated the reasoning contained in its previous decision , explaining that the proceedings were not aimed at identifying an individual who could be held culpable for GPE \u2019s death but at identifying errors inherent in the detention system \u2013 specifically , the lack of a standardised test for sickle cell disease for certain high - risk groups and the lack of clear instructions for the staff of the detention centre concerning detainees on hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of the ORG again lodged a complaint , arguing that there had been sufficient rules and instructions in place concerning the treatment of detainees . In the present case , there had not been any indications that GPE had suffered from sickle cell disease . Not even hospitals conducted standardised tests for this blood anomaly where there was no concrete suspicion in that respect . It added that the death of GPE had nonetheless prompted ORG to issue a directive to detention centre authorities instructing them to ( i ) inform detainees who were on hunger strike and who belonged to a high - risk group of the possible consequences of sickle cell disease , and ( ii ) conduct the necessary tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again quashed the ORG \u2019s decision . It reminded the ORG that it was bound by the legal interpretation that ORG had expressed in its previous judgment concerning the obligations of the ORG under LAW towards detainees ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Moreover , it suggested that the ORG order an expert report in order to determine whether the reduced mental and physical condition of GPE should have given rise to an investigation into the possibility that he had been suffering from sickle cell disease and whether appropriate medical treatment from TIME could have prevented the death of GPE", "CARDINAL . During the course of the new round of proceedings , the ORG ordered an expert report , as suggested by ORG . In a report dated DATE , as well as during the hearing of DATE , the expert in question , PERSON , confirmed that according to his findings , GPE had been a sickle cell trait carrier . He added that this was the case in respect of PERCENT of the population of countries in sub - Saharan Africa , such as the GPE ( where GPE had been from ) , and that this trait served as a protection from GPE . The fact that a person was a carrier of sickle cell trait did not mean that he or she was ill or had a lower life expectancy . Nonetheless he or she would face a higher risk of death in the event of engaging in strenuous activities ( anstrengungsassoziierte GPE ) , and the trait could also cause rapid dehydration in the event of reduced liquid intake . PERSON explained that sickle cell disease could only be detected through an analysis of blood samples , but that the need for such an analysis had at no point been clearly indicated in GPE \u2019s case , even in the light of his reduced mental and physical condition .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted the same unsigned statement that he had already submitted during the hearing of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He did not submit any further requests . When the expert PERSON was questioned by the ORG regarding the calculation of GPE \u2019s critical weight , he stated that he was inclined to believe that GPE \u2019s weight had been correctly calculated , but that that calculation had been wrongly recorded . In his opinion , it was unlikely that GPE could have lost QUANTITY over the course of a DATE hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint about the conditions of GPE \u2019s detention , basing its decision on the finding contained in the expert report of PERSON ( see paragraph PERSON above ) that the need for an analysis of GPE \u2019s blood in respect of sickle cell trait had not been indicated . It reiterated that according to ORG legal interpretation , by which it was bound , the ORG had no duty to take measures the need for which had not been foreseeable in respect of a person because of a certain genetic disposition without a manifest outbreak of the disease in that person . Therefore , the authorities\u2019 conduct had not constituted a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , which was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
