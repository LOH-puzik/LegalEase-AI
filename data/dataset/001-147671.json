The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant was arrested and detained in investigation detention facilities in GPE and GPE in the framework of a criminal investigation against him . On DATE he was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of a number of violent offences committed DATE and DATE and sentenced him to death . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction but , following the abolition of the death penalty with effect from DATE and the concomitant introduction of the sentence of life imprisonment without commutation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , replaced his sentence with life imprisonment without commutation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from ORG to FAC , where he has been serving his sentence ever since . By order of the prison governor , he was placed alone in a constantly locked cell , as required under the legal provisions governing the regime of life prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , which became final on DATE , ORG decided that the applicant was to serve his sentence under the \u201c special regime \u201d applicable to life prisoners at that time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a special commission in charge of deciding on changes in a prisoner \u2019s regime decided to place the applicant under the \u201c enhanced regime \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the Execution of Punishments and Pre - Trial Detention Act DATE superseded LAW DATE , the applicant was placed under the \u201c severe \u201d regime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His continued to be kept isolated from the rest of the prison population , as normally required under the relevant provisions of the CARDINAL Act and the regulations for its application ( ibid . ) . The above - mentioned commission has apparently not decided to place the applicant together with the main prison population , as permitted under those provisions under certain conditions ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . In FAC , the applicant was kept in an individual cell measuring QUANTITY . The Government submitted that not later than DATE significant improvements had been made to that cell . In particular , central heating was installed and the old wooden window frames were replaced by modern ones measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY and providing enough temperature isolation and access to sunlight . According to evidence put before ORG and its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , those works were completed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At all relevant times the applicant \u2019s cell contained an in - cell toilet and a water tap .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s assertions in respect of the material conditions of his detention are voluminous and lack clarity in that grievances apparently relating to different periods of time are not clearly distinguished . The applicant alleged that during unspecified periods of his incarceration in GPE he had encountered the following problems : food had been substandard and insufficient in quantity , with some meals containing pieces of plastic , hairs and fur , and the meat meals often containing meat substitutes or no meat at all ; the plates in which the food was being served had been dirty and greasy ; tap water had been muddy ; there had been iron pieces bulging from the bed - spring which had made his bed very uncomfortable , and the bedding provided had been unclean ; the taking of a shower ( TIME ) and applicant \u2019s visits to the doctor had been counted as part of his DATE outdoor activities ; the yard in which he took his DATE outdoor exercise had not had toilet facilities , which had prevented him from relieving his needs before the end of the exercise period , and inmates had not been provided with waterproof clothing when spending time outdoors ; guard dogs had been placed QUANTITY from the window of the applicant \u2019s cell and with their constant barking at night had prevented him from sleeping ; other inmates and the applicant himself had found and killed rats in the cells ; the temperature in the applicant \u2019s cell had not risen QUANTITY in DATE and the heating coal provided in DATE had been insufficient ; there had been no heating in the bathroom and inmates had been freezing when taking showers in DATE ; the applicant \u2019s cell lacked sufficient sunlight ; for a long time the cell \u2019s floor had been left riddled with holes and not covered with linoleum ; and the cleaning products provided for the in - cell toilet had been insufficient , consisting of CARDINAL spoonfuls of chlorine a month , which had made the smell unbearable as the main part of the cell was only separated from the toilet area by a screen .", "CARDINAL . The evidence submitted by the applicant in support of those allegations consisted of his own statements , a statement written in the same handwriting as in all other letters sent by the applicant but co - signed by CARDINAL other inmates on an unspecified date , and copies of CARDINAL complaints that the applicant had sent to the prison administration and various other authorities DATE and of some of the replies received . The vast majority of those complaints concerned the food served in prison : concrete instances in which the applicant had allegedly not received a full portion , yoghurt had been missing , the food had had a bad taste or smell , or meat had not been provided or had been of low quality . Some of those complaints had been acknowledged as well - founded by the prison administration and the applicant had been assured that measures would be taken .", "CARDINAL . In some of those complaints the applicant raised concerns in relation to the poor quality of coal given to inmates before the installation of a central heating system in DATE , the fact that bed linen or clothes had not been properly washed , the choice of products available for purchase at the prison canteen , and the fact that a refrigerator in the canteen used to store personal food items had not functioned for a certain period of time .", "CARDINAL . For their part , the Government denied the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the material conditions of his detention . They said that the quality and quantity of food served to inmates had been fully adequate , and that hygienic conditions in the prison canteen , including in relation to cutlery , had been maintained in line with the applicable standards . Water in the prison had not been muddy ; it came from the same pipeline as the water supplied to the town of GPE . Inmates could also buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen . The allegation that iron pieces had protruded from the applicant \u2019s bed was not true , and his bed sheets had been changed and washed DATE . Bathing time had not been counted as part of the outdoor walk time ; unlike other inmates , who had only had TIME of DATE outdoor walk time , life prisoners had been allowed DATE . The only reasons for interrupting that walk had been rowdy conduct or bad weather ; in the latter case , more outdoor time had been made available later on . The yard designated for the DATE outdoor walk did not have a toilet for security and hygiene reasons . Such a toilet was in any event not needed because that yard was adjacent to the applicant \u2019s cell , which was equipped with a toilet . If the applicant had felt an urgent need to go to the toilet during his DATE walk , he could have always used that one , and would have never been prevented from doing so . The prison administration was not under a duty to provide inmates with waterproof clothing ; when such clothing had been provided as a matter of courtesy , the inmates had very quickly damaged it . It was not true that guard dogs had been kept near the applicant \u2019s cell ; such dogs had not been used at all in the zone at issue . Nor had there been rats inside the applicant \u2019s cell ; its door , windows and piping had been built in a way not permitting rats to come in , and the prison administration was under a duty regularly to carry out pest control . The applicant \u2019s cell had had central heating since DATE , and the temperature inside the cell and the bathroom had been around QUANTITY . The cell \u2019s window , which , like all windows in FAC , had had its old wooden frame replaced with a new PVC one , did not have any covers preventing sunlight from coming in and could be freely opened , and the cell \u2019s floor was covered with linoleum which was in a good condition . Cleaning products were distributed DATE . Cable television was available in the cell . Lastly , works were under way for enlargement of the area for outdoor walks .", "CARDINAL . Apparently in view of the fact that the applicant is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without commutation , he is always handcuffed when taken out of his cell , including inside the prison . The handcuffs are removed once the destination has been reached , if security conditions permit . In particular , the applicant is handcuffed when taken out of his cell for his DATE outdoor walk , but the handcuffs are removed during the walk .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that the applicant has ever been involved in violent incidents in prison or disciplined for violent or aggressive conduct . There is no indication that he has ever tried to abscond from prison either .", "CARDINAL . The facts summarised in this subsection were set out by the applicant in CARDINAL separate applications to this ORG lodged by him in DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In those applications he complained about various issues , such as an alleged lack of access to a court , the outcome of proceedings for damages , the impossibility to vote in the DATE presidential elections in GPE , and an alleged interference with his right to correspondence .", "CARDINAL . From the materials submitted by the applicant in those CARDINAL cases it transpires that in DATE he brought a number of claims for damages under section CARDINAL the ORG and ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) before the territorially competent ORG . Those claims concerned CARDINAL of allegations concerning various aspects of the conditions of his detention and specific incidents allegedly breaching his rights .", "CARDINAL . The claims that directly relate to the subject matter of the present case concerned , inter alia : the allegedly poor quality of tap water in FAC ; the allegedly insufficient heating ; the allegedly insufficient surface of the area for outdoor walks ; the alleged failure of the prison authorities to transfer the applicant to a collective cell with a view to enabling him to have contacts with other inmates ; the alleged failure of the prison authorities to provide any educational courses for the applicant or to enable him to take part in artistic , cultural , sport , religious or other activities ; the fact that the applicant had been routinely handcuffed when taken out of his cell ; and allegedly frequent body searches by prison guards .", "CARDINAL . Other claims concerned matters such as an alleged refusal of the prison authorities in DATE to provide the applicant with copies of receipts showing that he had paid for mail sent by him ; alleged delays and obstacles in respect of mail that the applicant had wished to send ; an alleged refusal to allow the applicant to use a combined MPCARDINAL/radio device as opposed to separate radio and MPCARDINAL devices , which were allowed ; an alleged refusal of the prison administration to wash the applicant \u2019s underwear , etc .", "CARDINAL . In relation to several claims , ORG instructed the applicant to clarify the link between the facts described in his statement of claim and the alleged damage , and to submit a declaration of means . As the applicant did not comply with those instructions , the court discontinued the proceedings in respect of some of the claims .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL cases proceeded to judgment on the merits .", "CARDINAL . In a case decided on the merits on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for damages concerning the fact that tap water in LOC had on occasions been muddy and unfit for drinking . The court noted that although there was evidence that sometimes , especially after heavy rains , the quality of that water had been bad , the laboratory analysis had confirmed that it had been safe for drinking . The prison was connected to the general water supply system and got the same water as that supplied to households nearby . The applicant \u2019s allegations , for instance that he had endured acute stomach pain and had required medical assistance , had not been made out . Moreover , the applicant had had the possibility to buy bottled mineral water from the prison canteen or , if he did not have the necessary means for that , boil tap water using a device which he confirmed that he had in his cell , or filter it . The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against that judgment was not examined by ORG as he failed to pay the requisite fee of ORG CARDINAL for the processing of the appeal ( see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044e\u043d\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . A case decided on the merits by ORG on DATE concerned a specific incident on DATE in which prison staff had entered the applicant \u2019s cell for a search accompanied by a dog trained to find narcotic drugs . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that he had endured stress because of his fear of dogs . There was no evidence that the dog , which had been kept on a leash , had been handled in an inappropriate manner . That case ended in a judgment of ORG of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ) whereby the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against ORG judgment was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Another case decided on the merits by ORG on DATE concerned CARDINAL separate allegations relating to various aspects of the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention . It appears that in his statement of claim the applicant had made confused assertions about the periods of time to which those claims related and that he eventually only claimed non - pecuniary damages in respect of a limited period of time in DATE . The court dismissed all of the applicant \u2019s claims . With regard , in particular , to the surface of the area for DATE outdoor walks , it found that it was QUANTITY . It went on to note that the bodily searches to which the applicant had been subjected had not involved any undressing or inappropriate touching of his private parts but patting , through his clothes , with a view to determining whether or not he had had on him any unauthorised items . The systematic handcuffing of the applicant was not in breach of the Execution of Punishments and PreTrial Detention Act DATE or the regulations for its application , was not inconsistent with the applicant \u2019s prison regime , could be considered necessary in view of the seriousness of the offences in relation to which he had been sentenced to life imprisonment , and had not been intended to humiliate the applicant . With regard to the claim that the applicant had not been transferred to a multi - occupancy cell despite the possibility to do so for life prisoners serving their life sentence under the \u201c severe \u201d regime , the court found that those matters fell within the discretion of the special commission for the execution of sentences ; there had therefore not been a failure on the part of the prison authorities to observe a binding legal obligation . The same went for educational courses . The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against that judgment was not examined by ORG as he failed to pay the requisite fee of MONEY ( ORG ) ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the processing of the appeal ( see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044e\u043d\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , PERSON , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claim concerning the allegedly low temperatures in his cell related to CARDINAL winters : the periods DATE and DATE , and the period DATE and DATE . The court ordered an expert report , which showed that the amount of coal provided to inmates in FAC in DATE had been adequate and that central heating had been installed in the prison in DATE . In a judgment of DATE ORG found that the prison administration had provided the applicant with enough coal to secure a temperature of QUANTITY in his cell during the first period , and that central heating had been installed before the second period . The applicant \u2019s claim was therefore dismissed . That judgment was apparently not validly appealed against .", "CARDINAL . From other materials submitted by the applicant it appears that in DATE he tried to bring a number of further claims under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in relation to various instances in which his rights had allegedly been breached by the prison authorities . None of those claims was accepted for examination by ORG as a result of apparent failures on the part of the applicant to formulate his claims properly and pay the requisite court fees . In a series of decisions given in DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decisions not to examine the claims on the merits ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
