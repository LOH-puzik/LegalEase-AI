The applicant companies are limited liability companies established under the law of the GPE . They have their registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At some stage in DATE , officials of ORG ( LOC Inlichtingen- en ORG , \u201c LOC ) instituted an investigation into activities of the applicant companies and their director , PERSON , as they suspected forgery ( valsheid in geschrifte ) and tax fraud .

The ORG \u2019s investigation was concluded on DATE . The official report of the investigation was completed on CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL witnesses were heard during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the scope for an out - of - court settlement in the cases of the applicant companies and Mr PERSON was explored . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE counsel for the applicant companies and Mr PERSON asked ORG to allow them a period of DATE in which to consider the question whether to request a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) so that witnesses could be heard by the ORG or the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) . On DATE the applicant companies and Mr PERSON requested a preliminary judicial investigation , which was then applied for on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge sent a number of official records of evidence taken from witnesses to counsel for the applicant companies and asked him for the names of any further witnesses . On DATE the investigating judge informed counsel that he had heard extensive testimony from a large number of witnesses and that in doing so he had given counsel the benefit of the doubt \u201c with regard to the question of whether hearing these witnesses was necessary to the preliminary judicial investigation \u201d .

The applicant companies and Mr PERSON submitted a request to the investigating judge on DATE to reopen the preliminary judicial investigation because they still had CARDINAL witnesses they wished to be heard . The investigating judge rejected this request in a decision of DATE on the grounds that the applicant companies and PERSON PERSON had not established that hearing the CARDINAL witnesses was in the interests of the investigation . The investigating judge also took the view that the defence would not by any reasonable standards be prejudiced if the CARDINAL witnesses were not heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the preliminary judicial investigation into the applicant companies was closed . Notice of closure was served on DATE . On DATE notification of further proceedings against the applicant companies was sent to counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE summonses were served on Mr PERSON .

Both the applicant companies and Mr PERSON lodged appeals with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE on DATE . ORG ( openbaar ministerie ) lodged a cross appeal DATE . A first hearing in all CARDINAL cases took place on DATE . Prior to the second hearing , scheduled for DATE , the Advocate General ( advocaat - generaal ) to ORG initiated negotiations with counsel for the applicant companies and Mr PERSON aimed at securing the withdrawal of the appeals . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , counsel wrote as follows to the Advocate General :", "\u201c Mr PERSON is in principle willing to accept that the judgments of ORG in the criminal proceedings against [ the applicant companies ] become final and conclusive . However , my client is only prepared to withdraw the appeals if ORG explicitly abandons the execution of those judgments and if the tax authorities also forgo the implementation of further measures of collection in respect of [ the applicant companies ] and/or Mr PERSON personally . As regards the tax proceedings which are currently still pending as well as potential future fiscal and/or civil proceedings , the tax authorities and ORG should already at the present time undertake to waive their right to invoke the formal force of law of these judgments and/or their content . ... \u201d", "In reply , ORG wrote on DATE :", "\u201c I suggested withdrawing the appeals in the cases of [ the applicant companies ] for practical reasons since you still have not provided me with any clarification of the structure of the legal entities , and in particular of the fact that there was no natural person with responsibility for them ; you promised both of these things at the hearing .", "...", "Both ORG and the tax authorities will , either together or individually , make use of the ( content of the ) judgments in the widest sense of the word where this appears useful to them . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG withdrew its appeals on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Just before the hearing of CARDINAL DATE was about to start , PERSON PERSON and the Advocate General reached an agreement under the terms of which Mr PERSON would withdraw his and the applicant ORG appeals . In a letter to Mr PERSON , also of CARDINAL DATE , counsel confirmed that agreement , stating that the appeals would be withdrawn and requests submitted for remission of the sentences ( gratie ) imposed by ORG . Remission , according to counsel in his letter , would be in the form of a reduction in the fines imposed on the applicant companies in the pending tax proceedings , while the sentence imposed on Mr PERSON would be reduced to DATE imprisonment , of which DATE would be suspended and the remainder converted into a number of TIME of community service .", "CARDINAL . According to counsel and Mr PERSON , the Advocate General had further undertaken that a positive recommendation on the requests for remission of sentence would be issued , both by the Advocate General himself and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgments of DATE , ORG noted that the appeals had been withdrawn and that no hearing of the substance of the cases had taken place .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE counsel informed a colleague \u2013 counsel for the applicant companies in the tax proceedings \u2013 of the withdrawal of the appeals in the criminal proceedings , stating that remission of sentence would be sought in respect of the judgments of ORG \u201c which had now become final and conclusive \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Requests for remission of sentence were lodged with ORG on DATE . The requests were forwarded for advice to ORG on DATE . On DATE the Advocate General at ORG The Hague informed the Ministry that he was prepared to advise on the requests .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the Minister of ORG , ORG at ORG advised on the requests for remission of sentence on DATE . Its recommendation was that the requests of both the applicant companies and Mr PERSON be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG sought information from the Advocate General pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . On DATE , referring to probation and psychiatric reports , ORG issued a favourable opinion on PERSON PERSON \u2019s request . As far as the applicant companies were concerned , however , ORG saw no grounds not to collect the fines imposed by ORG in part or in full , in addition to the outstanding tax .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG The Hague also gave a favourable opinion in respect of Mr PERSON , but an unfavourable opinion with regard to the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the requests for remission of sentence made on behalf of the applicant companies were rejected . DATE , counsel for the applicant companies and Mr PERSON wrote to ORG , informing him that he could not square those rejections with the undertakings given by ORG . In a letter of reply dated DATE , the Advocate General denied that he had given such an undertaking as regards the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON again lodged appeals with ORG against the CARDINAL judgments of ORG of DATE . DATE ORG at ORG informed Mr PERSON that he would proceed with the execution of the sentences imposed on the applicant companies by that court , in the light of the fact that the appeals against the judgments had been withdrawn in DATE and had thus become final and conclusive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG requested ORG once again to advise on Mr PERSON \u2019s request for remission of sentence in view of the favourable recommendations from ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Public Prosecution Department gave a favourable opinion on PERSON PERSON \u2019s request on DATE . ORG concurred with the recommendation of ORG and ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , at a hearing before ORG on DATE , the Advocate General recommended that the appeals be declared inadmissible since it was not possible to reinstate an appeal once it had been withdrawn . He stated that although he had suggested to Mr PERSON that he might wish to withdraw his appeal and lodge a request for remission of sentence , he had never given an undertaking that such a request would be granted , but only that he would make a recommendation to that effect . He had made such a recommendation , but no decision had as yet been taken . In any event , as PERSON PERSON had been legally represented , he could have obtained advice from his counsel on the procedure . The Advocate General further confirmed that he had also suggested that the appeals in the cases against the applicant companies be withdrawn . He had done so because there was no longer any advantage to be gained since the companies were bankrupt .", "CARDINAL . In reply , Mr PERSON argued that he had erred in his decision to withdraw the appeals and would certainly not have withdrawn them had he known that it was the Minister of ORG who had the final say on the requests for remission of sentence ; the undertaking given by the Advocate General had led him to believe that the requests would be granted . Mr PERSON further stated that the applicant companies were not bankrupt and continued to exist .", "CARDINAL . At a subsequent hearing on DATE , the Advocate General informed ORG that on DATE the request for remission of sentence in the case against Mr PERSON had been granted . Neither PERSON PERSON nor his counsel had previously been informed of that decision . Mr PERSON subsequently decided to withdraw his appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its judgments of DATE in the cases against the applicant companies , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The talks between the Advocate General on the one hand and counsel and DATE in his capacity both as the accused in the criminal proceedings against himself and as the representative in the criminal proceedings against the companies \u2013 on the other , took place at the initiative of ORG . According to ORG , his aim was to prevent the execution of the custodial sentence imposed on PERSON by the first - instance court in view of the reports concerning PERSON drawn up by a psychiatrist and the probation services . ORG had further assumed that the companies would be unable to make any redress .", "ORG considers it likely that PERSON ... was taken by surprise by this course of events and was under the impression that he would be able to rely on a favourable outcome if he withdrew the appeals .", "In the opinion of the court , it is incomprehensible that the Advocate General should have advised as he did ... Both PERSON and the companies ... had an interest in the appeals . In addition , it is difficult to see why the court , in its determination of the criminal charges against PERSON , might not have been expected to have regard to the reports concerning his mental welfare , as the Advocate General had done and in accordance with his advice .", "The solution favoured by the Advocate General on the other hand , that is to say a request for remission of sentence supported by him , was by no means certain to succeed . After all , the withdrawal of the appeal meant that it was firstly for ORG and ORG to advise on the request for remission of sentence and their advice was apparently not to grant the request . It is true that it appears from the documents in the file that ORG nevertheless attempted to find acceptance for his advice within ORG and that a decision in favour of PERSON \u2013 in the shape of community service \u2013 was eventually made , but this decision was a long time coming and was preceded by a rejection of the ORG requests for remission .", "Due to the fact that a decision on his request for remission remained outstanding and in view of the rejection of the requests of the applicant companies , ORG again lodged an appeal in all CARDINAL cases , partly also because ORG appears to be planning to proceed with the execution of the fines imposed in the criminal proceedings against the companies .", "ORG fears that this execution may affect himself and/or his spouse personally . ... In view of the above , the court is of the opinion that PERSON was persuaded to withdraw the appeal on improper grounds ( op oneigenlijke gronden ) ... by ORG , that this has prejudiced the accused \u2019s reasonable interests in this case and that , accordingly , the newly lodged appeal should be considered as a prolongation of the original appeal . \u201d", "ORG then proceeded to find that a reasonable time within the meaning of LAW had been exceeded and disallowed the prosecution of the cases against the applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General filed appeals on points of law ( beroep in cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) . On DATE ORG upheld the appeals . It ruled that , in view of the closed system of legal remedies , ORG judgments of DATE had become final and conclusive ( onherroepelijk ) since the legal remedy available against those judgments DATE an appeal on points of law \u2013 had not been exercised within the DATE period allowed by statute . Given that ORG had established in those judgments that the appeals against the decisions of ORG had been withdrawn , the accused \u2019s newly lodged appeals could not be declared admissible .", "CARDINAL . The GPE system of legal remedies against judgments in criminal proceedings is a closed one in the sense that LAW ( Wetboek van Strafvordering \u2013\u201cCCP \u201d ) lays down when a legal remedy is available and of what it consists . The general rule is that an appeal lies to ORG from final judgments given at first instance and an appeal on points of law to ORG from a final judgment given on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW ORG , appeal proceedings must be instituted within DATE of the final judgment . Appeals on points of law must also be lodged within DATE of the final judgment ( LAW of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Remission of sentence may be granted by royal decree ( PERSON ) DATE that is a decree signed by the Monarch and the Minister responsible \u2013 pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of the present case , a request for remission may be lodged in respect of a sentence imposed by a judgment that has become final and conclusive ( LAW . Before a decision is taken , the request is sent for advice to the court which imposed the sentence , as well as to ORG Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Pardons Act ) . Additional information may also be obtained ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .
