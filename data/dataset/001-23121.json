AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG and ORG Zeitungs- und ORG are the owner and publisher , respectively , of the DATE newspaper \u201c ORG \u201d with its seat in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the ORG published an article , written under the pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d , about the exhibition \u201c War of annihilation . Crimes of the Wehrmacht DATE \u201d ( \u201c GPE ) , planned to be staged in GPE and contested in NORP public opinion . The article responded to a commentary by a professor of ORG , published on DATE in the opinion column of the newspaper ORG , where the author had defended and promoted this exhibition and had criticised its opponents . The article of the ORG with the head \u201c Infected with lies ... \u201d ( \u201c GPE der GPE infiziert ... \u201d ) read as follows :", "\u201c Contemporary history is infected with lies as a whore is with syphilis . \u201d Who said that ? You probably wo n\u2019t guess : the great philosopher PERSON . How right he is ! And naturally the losers in a war are the first to suffer .", "This is evident at the so - called Wehrmacht Exhibition , in which most of the exhibits come from the NORP , in other words from the NORP regime DATE among numerous other crimes against its own people and other nations \u2013 committed the massacre at PERSON and attempted to lay the blame for it on the Wehrmacht . Well over CARDINAL NORP were shot dead because they were regarded as anti - NORP . In a show trial CARDINAL NORP soldiers were sentenced to death and immediately executed , though they were completely innocent . DATE documents exist which prove this beyond dispute .", "A GPE professor of contemporary history , PERSON \u2013 a PERSON persecutor , of course , who lives on ORG money and is highly subsidised DATE praises this exhibition and attacks anyone who expresses any reservations . And who is helping him ? ORG , which gives him a whole page .", "Is n\u2019t there a saying \u201c If you are caught lying once , you are never believed ... \u201d ? Well , anyone who has once lied so grossly , who has been guilty of such criminal falsification and who DATE to make the monstrous lie more credible \u2013 has sacrificed human lives deserves our utter contempt . What can have happened to this once so distinguished newspaper for it to side with the Katyn murderers and not believe former soldiers who experienced the suffering of war ?", "Does ORG believe that the fallen whose names appear on the war memorials of our cities , towns and villages were murderers ? What an outrageous slur , on them and on those who managed to survive the hecatomb !", "Maybe those who smear our Second World War soldiers think that those who can still defend their wartime comrades and themselves are now only few in number anyway and that their numbers are declining . But sons , daughters and grandchildren will begin to feel the pain of their NORP scars . They wo n\u2019t allow soldiers whose unavoidable destiny it was to fight a world war to be called murderers .", "The process of rehabilitation has perhaps already begun . CARDINAL symptom among many : the falling circulation of newspapers that act as accomplices of \u2018 contemporary LOC as characterised by PERSON .", "Cato \u201d", "Subsequently , the owner of ORG filed a private prosecution against Mr PERSON , the editor of the Neue Kronen Zeitung , assuming him to be the author of the article written under the pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d , on grounds of defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) and insult ( PERSON ) . At the same time the owner of ORG requested compensation under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) and that the decision be published .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) acquitted PERSON and rejected the further claims . It found that it could not be established with sufficient certainty that the impugned article was written by the accused . Referring to this acquittal , the court also rejected the compensation claim and the request for publication of the judgment . It noted that the article in the ORG was part of a political debate in the course of a journalistic controversy about the exhibition and the historical role of the Wehrmacht . Its value statements were based on true facts and did not overstep the limits of permissible criticism . This decision became final .", "Parallel to these proceedings , the owner of ORG lodged injunction proceedings under LAW ( ORG ) and under LAW ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren GPE ) against PERSON and the applicant companies before ORG ( PERSON ) , requesting that the applicant companies be prohibited from repeating the following statements :", "a ) that ORG approved the massacre at PERSON committed by the NORP in the Second World War ;", "b ) that in its reporting it called murderers those fallen in the Second World War ;", "c ) that it smeared the soldiers of the Second World War ;", "d ) that it had diminished in quality as a newspaper ;", "e ) that its circulation had fallen ; and", "f ) that ORG were accomplices of liars ( meaning that contemporary historians would falsify history ) . It also requested a revocation of these allegations and that the decision be published .", "On DATE ORG issued an injunction , by which it prohibited the applicant companies to repeat the impugned statements and ordered its publication . It noted in particular that the statements a ) , b ) and d ) constituted untrue statements of facts which fulfilled the civil offences under section CARDINAL LAW and under section CARDINAL of LAW . The statements c ) and f ) were value statements containing an unobjective and unnecessary disparagement of a competitor under LAW . Finally , the statement e ) was based on true facts , which , taken in its context , fulfilled the civil offence under LAW . The court stated that the article at issue dealt with a political and ideological matter of public interest . In this respect , the criticism lodged against ORG could be understood as criticism for having given a forum in its opinion column to an author who had disputable opinions . It had to be taken into account that commentaries in opinion columns were not necessarily in line with a newspaper \u2019s point of view . Since the ORG also criticised the general quality of ORG and its circulation , which had no relevance whatsoever for the political topic at issue , the criticism lodged in the article had to be considered as having been made by the applicant companies with a competitive intention . The same applied to disparaging and untrue statements . Furthermore , in balancing the purely political statements , which aimed at contributing to a journalistic debate , with those , which were made with a competitive aim , the latter prevailed in the court \u2019s opinion , in particular since the article ended with a disparaging statement .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , on the applicant ORG appeal , confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision in part . It rejected the claim against PERSON and ordered the applicant companies to refrain from publishing the following allegations :", "\u201c a ) that , in its reports on the Wehrmacht Exhibition , ORG would side with the PERSON murderers and thus approve the massacre of CARDINAL NORP at PERSON committed by ORG ;", "b ) that in its reports ORG would call the fallen soldiers of the Second World War \u2018 murderers\u2019 ;", "c ) that in its reports ORG would smear the soldiers of the Second World War ;", "d ) that ORG would not report in the same quality as in the past and had thus lost in quality as a newspaper , and", "e ) that ORG were accomplices of liars . \u201d", "The court found that a controversy between newspapers could contribute to form public opinion . This function would become less important if such controversy was conducted with a competitive intention and by the use of untrue and disparaging statements of facts . Since this was so in the present case , the competitor \u2019s interest in the protection of its reputation outweighed the applicant companies\u2019 right to freedom of expression . The court quashed the lower court \u2019s injunction as regards the prohibition to repeat that the circulation of ORG had fallen , finding that it constituted a true statement of fact .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant ORG extraordinary appeal on points of law as it did not raise any important issue of law and because ORG judgment was in line with ORG case - law . It noted in particular that the criteria of section CARDINAL of LAW were fulfilled when statements of facts were published , inter alia , with a competitive intention . In this respect , the competitive intention had to be assumed when disparaging allegations about a competitor were made . A given statement constituted a statement of fact if its meaning , as understood by the recipient , was based on facts which were susceptible to proof .", "Section CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code provides as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Anybody who , due to defamation , suffered real damage or loss of profit , may claim compensation .", "( CARDINAL ) The same applies if anyone is disseminating facts which jeopardise someone \u2019s reputation , gains or livelihood , the untruth of which was known or must have been known to him . In this case there is also a right to claim a revocation and the publication thereof . ( ... ) \"", "The relevant sections of LAW read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\" Any person who in the course of business commits , for the purposes of competition , acts contrary to honest practices , may be enjoined from further engaging in those acts and held liable for damages . \"", "", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Any person who , for the purposes of competition , makes or propagates declarations of fact about another person \u2019s company , about the owner or manager of a company , about the goods or services of another person , that are such as to damage the activities of the company or the credit of its owner , may be held liable for damages , if the truth of the declarations can not be proved .
