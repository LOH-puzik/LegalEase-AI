Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP citizens born in DATE and DATE respectively . In DATE , the first applicant was sentenced in GPE to life imprisonment for murder . He received a number of subsequent prison sentences in DATE and DATE for prison breaking , attempted murder of a prison officer and assault on prison staff . The second applicant is the first applicant \u2019s wife and a doctor by profession .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON was removed from ORG to a ORG in FAC . ORG had been set up on an experimental basis to treat selected long - term prisoners and prisoners with violent propensities ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG had a maximum of CARDINAL prisoners and was characterised by a more liberal regime . Mr. PERSON played a prominent role in facilitating the success of ORG . In particular , he discovered that he had special abilities in working with people and in sculpture , writing and other areas of artistic activity .", "While in ORG , Mr. PERSON was allowed , amongst other things , to write and receive uncensored mail , to have DATE access to visitors and to use a telephone . He was thereby able to meet his wife , talk to her on the telephone and correspond with her without being subject to the normal restrictions . He also had the opportunity to go out of the prison without escort .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON was advised by ORG that he was to be released on licence in DATE and that he was to be transferred to PERSON , GPE , to undergo a pre - release programme . He was informed that he would serve his time there on the same terms and conditions as other prisoners . It was considered that , although the regime there was on traditional lines , ORG would be more beneficial to Mr. PERSON during the period leading to his eventual release than other alternatives , for example PERSON Open Prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The factors governing the choice included the desirability of his occupying a single cell rather than being in a dormitory ; the availability of suitable day - time work for him and of facilities for continuing his studies and his artistic work ; and access to suitable educational and vocational opportunities for his pre - release training . Mr. PERSON himself had in fact stated in written submissions in DATE that , if he could not remain at PERSON for his pre - release programme , he would prefer training from GPE rather than PERSON .", "In DATE , he was transferred to a Training for Freedom Hostel within the prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was released on DATE .", "As from DATE until his release , he was in the lowest security category ( Category D ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants\u2019 complaints to ORG in so far as relevant to the present proceedings all related to the period DATE and DATE when Mr. PERSON was subject to the ordinary prison regime at ORG . The facts surrounding those grievances are briefly set out in the following paragraphs .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period the normal rules regarding the sending and payment of correspondence were applied to Mr. PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The postage of CARDINAL - page letter per week was paid for out of public funds . He was able to pay for other letters out of his prison earnings of \u00a3 MONEY per week but not out of his general financial resources . In a letter of DATE from his solicitors to the Secretary of ORG for GPE , a complaint was made that because he found it necessary to spend MONEY per week out of his earnings to supplement his ( mainly ) vegetarian diet by buying oatmeal cakes as the prison service provided only white bread , the number of letters he was able to send was restricted . A full vegetarian diet was available at FAC and no complaint was made by Mr. PERSON to the Governor or to the Secretary of ORG as to its adequacy .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON \u2019s incoming and outgoing mail was controlled by the prison authorities in accordance with the normal practice followed at the prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicants also asserted before the Commission that on occasions the prison censorship officer read out aloud in front of other inmates letters from Mrs. PERSON , laughing or making comments about their contents . However , Mr. PERSON did not make any complaint to ORG or the Secretary of ORG regarding the manner in which his mail was read , in particular about its being read aloud , although the fact of his mail being screened was the subject of complaint in his solicitors\u2019 letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a letter to a friend of his , Mr. PERSON , was stopped by the Prison Governor on the ground that Mr. PERSON was a \" media personality \" . Mr. PERSON petitioned the Secretary of ORG regarding this matter , but his petition was rejected on the basis that there was a general prohibition of the passing on by a prisoner of material intended for publication or for use on wireless or television ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Government have subsequently acknowledged that in fact this rule was applied in error , since , although the letter in question was addressed to a person connected with the public media , it was a personal one which Mr. PERSON should have been allowed to send .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON was entitled to receive visits in accordance with the normal rules applied in LOC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Consequently , as pointed out in his solicitors\u2019 letter of DATE , he was permitted TIME visiting time DATE under close supervision in a crowded visiting hall . He used this time to meet his wife , with the result that he was not able to see the other members of his family .", "He was able to benefit from the special escorted leave scheme and visited his home on CARDINAL occasions , albeit under the constant supervision of an officer in accordance with the scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "As from DATE , he was given a special licence to do unescorted community work outside the prison , initially for DATE and subsequently for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The solicitors for Mr. and Mrs. PERSON also raised with the Secretary of ORG a general objection that Mr. PERSON \u2019s treatment at FAC was markedly less favourable than his treatment at ORG and also in comparison with other Category D prisoners elsewhere under the penal system .", "By reply dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG rejected this and the other complaints made in the solicitors\u2019 letter of DATE .", "Mr. PERSON also complained through his Member of ORG to the Parliamentary Commissioner for ORG ( the ORG - see paragraph DATE below ) about various aspects of his treatment at FAC . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated that he could not uphold Mr. PERSON \u2019s complaints . He stated , inter alia :", "\" From the details that Mr. PERSON has given , his correspondence , special escorted leave , and visits appear to have been dealt with correctly in accordance with current rules , however dissatisfied he may be with those rules . I think it is fair to say that much of Mr. PERSON \u2019s complaint reflects his disagreement with those rules and with their application to him at this stage of his sentence . The rules are of course a matter for ORG and in the absence of evidence of maladministration I am precluded by LAW from questioning the ORG \u2019s discretion in applying them . \"", "CARDINAL .

He served his sentence in GPE and GPE Prisons until DATE . From DATE , he was detained as a Category D prisoner ( that is , the lowest security category ) at FAC . He was moved to ORG within the prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE and was released on licence on DATE . He had requested to serve the latter part of his sentence in GPE rather than , for example , in FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because he wanted , prior to his release , to have the benefit of further education courses which were not available from PERSON .", "PERSON is the first - named applicant \u2019s father and lives at GPE , QUANTITY from GPE . At the relevant time he was seriously ill - having been in bad health for some DATE - and unable to walk or travel .", "CARDINAL . During his period in LOC , PERSON enjoyed the normal entitlement to visits applicable at the prison .", "He petitioned the Secretary of ORG for GPE on CARDINAL DATE requesting a home visit to his father . The petition indicated that his father had been \" ill for a considerable period \" , but not that he was dangerously ill , which would have made him eligible for compassionate leave ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His request was therefore refused on CARDINAL DATE . The decision recommended him to make the effort to get a member of staff to take him out of prison under the special escorted leave scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It appears , however , that he experienced difficulty in finding a prison officer to accompany him on special escorted leave . Although PERSON was not able to visit his father during the relevant period , he was permitted to attend , without an escort , a college to follow an educational course DATE a week and also a centre where he was doing community work . He had previously been granted a home visit in DATE and prior to the commencement of the Training for Freedom programme he spent DATE on home leave in DATE .", "In a letter dated DATE in reply to a letter of DATE from Mr. PERSON \u2019s Member of ORG , the Under Secretary of ORG at ORG explained the reasons for the refusal of compassionate leave :", "\" ... Each application is considered on its merits and on the basis of medical and social work reports . Mr. PERSON \u2019s application for a special visit was considered in the usual way but it was decided that it did not meet the required conditions . Mr. PERSON was advised that if his father \u2019s condition deteriorated he should make a further request . It is necessary , to prevent abuse of the arrangements , to maintain a strict and entirely consistent approach to applications for compassionate visits from all prisoners and the fact that a prisoner is being released for educational or other purposes does not affect consideration of the merits of his application or remove the need for the normal criteria to be met . ... Mr. PERSON is expected to transfer to the formal Training for Freedom ( TFF ) in DATE . Prior to that he will have a DATE home leave and while on ORG he will have DATE which he may spend at home . I feel that it would be quite wrong , before that stage is reached , to make a special exception in Mr. PERSON \u2019s case and circumvent the rules in relation to either a compassionate visit or a special escorted leave . \"", "CARDINAL .
