In a judgment of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , the Bratislava I ORG considered that the action aimed at obtaining a judicial order to the defendant to issue a formal confirmation that the applicant had been dismissed in DATE for politically motivated reasons and in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . The court rejected the action as being unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife appealed to ORG and , on DATE , they supplemented the appeal ( odvolanie ) . They argued that ORG had misinterpreted the action in that it had not been aimed at obtaining a judicial order against the defendant , but at obtaining a declaratory judgment to the effect that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been based on the grounds referred to in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .

On DATE a CARDINAL - judge ORG rejected the appeal on points of law after deliberating in camera . As to the defendant \u2019s observations in reply to the appeal on points of law , ORG noted that the defendant had invited ORG to reject that appeal as unfounded since the lower courts\u2019 decisions had been correct and the appeal had produced no new relevant information .

ORG further discerned no procedural or other flaws within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure .
