He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Pie\u015bcik , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was allocated a flat in DATE in a building owned by ORG in GPE . In DATE the applicant started experiencing problems with the ventilation system . He complained to the housing cooperative about this and the presence of carbon monoxide in the flat . On DATE he sued the cooperative , inter alia , for an order that it repair the ventilation in the flat and for compensation .", "On DATE ORG ordered the housing cooperative to repair the ventilation system in the applicant \u2019s flat by DATE . It further awarded the applicant compensation . It found on the basis of expert evidence that the ventilation system was malfunctioning because of a construction defect in the building . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant . On DATE a writ of execution was issued in respect of the judgment of DATE .", "In DATE the cooperative concluded a contract with a contractor DATE concerning repairs to the ventilation duct in the applicant \u2019s building .

At the time , it found that the judgment could also be executed by the applicant in the cooperative \u2019s stead and at its expense .", "On DATE the housing cooperative informed the applicant that the repair works had been completed . However , the applicant was not satisfied with the result and requested PERSON and FAC to take appropriate measures .", "Subsequently , he requested an advance on the costs of the necessary works . However , in the subsequent proceedings , ORG decided on the basis of an expert opinion that the judgment of DATE could be executed only by the cooperative itself . According to an expert opinion , in order to repair the ventilation system in the applicant \u2019s flat it was necessary to have access to and carry out works in other flats in the building , which precluded the applicant carrying out the works himself . On DATE ORG set a new time - limit of DATE from the date on which its decision had become final for the housing cooperative to repair the ventilation system in the applicant \u2019s flat . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ventilation system in the applicant \u2019s building was checked . No technical irregularities were noted .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the housing cooperative instituted proceedings in ORG against the applicant , claiming that it had complied with the obligations imposed by the judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG imposed a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) on the president of the housing cooperative or CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default for failing to comply with the court \u2019s decision of DATE . It further ordered the cooperative to comply with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE by DATE . In the event of default , a fine of ORG CARDINAL would be imposed on the president and the deputy president of the housing cooperative . The housing cooperative appealed . It submitted that it had enforced the judgment of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal .", "On DATE ORG set a new time - limit of DATE from the date on which its decision had become final for the cooperative to comply with the judgment and stated that the president and deputy president would be liable to a fine of QUANTITY FAC in default . On DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant that the repair works specified in the judgment of DATE could only be performed by the cooperative .

It held that the judgment of DATE did not indicate the exact manner in which the ventilation system was to be repaired and that it was not possible for the system to be repaired only in the applicant \u2019s flat , as a more general solution had to be found . Works had been performed by the cooperative in DATE and DATE to restore the permeability of the ventilation system . While , according to several measurements that had been taken the level of carbon monoxide in the applicant \u2019s flat was too high , that level also depended on the proper functioning of the ventilation system and the expert opinions indicated that the applicant himself had prevented the proper functioning of the system by sealing off the access of air through the windows . ORG therefore concluded that the ventilation system in the applicant \u2019s flat had been repaired in accordance with the judgment of DATE .", "The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . It upheld the first instance judgment and referred to the expert \u2019s opinion confirming that the cooperative had complied with the judgment of DATE", "The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings , in particular the applicable provisions of LAW , are stated in the ORG \u2019s decisions in the cases of ORG v.
