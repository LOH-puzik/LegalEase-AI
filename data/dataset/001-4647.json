He maintained that he had been divested of his status of veteran on the basis of a single circumstance , namely , that he had served in the organs of the public security service , even though he had never committed any condemnable , illegal or immoral act . He stressed that he had never taken part in armed fighting with the underground resistance forces but had acquired \u201c veteran status \u201d for his fight for independence of GPE and against the NORP . Finally , the applicant contested the accuracy of the certificates issued by ORG , stating that they were inaccurate .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing in the applicant \u2019s case .

Considering that persons having served in the former organs of public security , whose task it had been , inter alia , to combat and eliminate all forms of democratic opposition , did not deserve the special privileges attached to \u201c veteran status \u201d , the legislator decided that they should be unconditionally deprived of that status .", "The \u201c Public Security Service \u201d consisted of ORG organs , comprising the political police and special armed forces .
