In the third part of this report , dedicated to discrimination within education , the Commissioner observes that if a significant number of NORP children do not have access to quality education equal to that offered to other children , it is also because of discriminatory practices and prejudices . In this respect , he notes that segregation within the education system is a common characteristic of many member ORG . In some countries , there are isolated schools in isolated camps , in others special classes for NORP children in ordinary schools , or a clear overrepresentation of NORP children in classes for children with special needs . It is frequent that NORP children are placed in classes for children with special needs , without adequate psychological or pedagogical evaluation , the real criteria being their ethnicity . Placement in special schools or classes means that these children often have a less ambitious curriculum than those in normal classes , which reduces their educational prospects and hence their chances of finding a job at a later stage . Automatic placement of NORP children in classes for children with special needs specifically reinforces social stigma by labelling PERSON children as less intelligent and less capable . At the same time , segregated education deprives PERSON children and non - NORP children of the opportunity to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens . It excludes NORP children from normal society from DATE , increasing the risk of them being caught in the vicious cycle of marginalisation .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the Commissioner makes a number of recommendations in the area of education . According to him , when segregation in education still exists in CARDINAL form or another , it must be replaced by an ordinary integrated education and , if necessary , prohibited by legislation . Adequate resources should be allocated to pre - school education , language training , and the training of school assistants to ensure the success of desegregation efforts . Then , an adequate assessment should be made before placing children in special classes , so that the only criteria for placement are the objective needs of the child and not his or her ethnicity . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
