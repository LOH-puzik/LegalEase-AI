However , this was not the immediate cause of the patient \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . NORP In our view , too long a period elapsed between the diagnosis of the perforation in the duodenal ulcer and surgery .", "CARDINAL .

As to the facts , ORG considered , inter alia , the following to be established :", "\u201c The patient \u2019s hospitalisation on DATE ... was not the result of a lack of medical supervision of his clinical condition ... since it was unconnected to the complications arising out of the meningitis . In fact , it resulted from acute anaemia caused by intestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer ; ...", "The decisions to discharge the patient on CARDINAL and DATE were appropriate , given that , in the former case , the problem of bacterial meningitis had been resolved , [ the patient ] had completed the course of antibiotics , he no longer had any symptoms or fever , had a slightly increased white - blood cell count , a falling neutrophil count and normal sedimentation rate , and was not complaining ... and , in the latter case , that is to say , the patient \u2019s hospitalisation from DATE , the patient was not complaining of abdominal pain , diarrhoea or bleeding ... with the result that it was possible to continue treating his ulcer with a dietary regime while monitoring him on an outpatient basis ...", "When the patient was admitted to ORG , laboratory tests were carried out for Clostridium difficile .

On the subject of the surgery preceding the death of the applicant \u2019s husband , ORG observed as follows :", "\u201c ... the patient was in a very serious clinical state , with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction . For that reason , he was placed on artificial ventilation and vasoactive drugs and fluids were administered ... , together with hydrocortisone to deal with possible acute adrenal insufficiency ( fal\u00eancia supra - renal aguda ) , and broad - spectrum antibiotics ;", "... in this medical context the patient \u2019s prospects of survival were very uncertain , in view of the septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction ;", "... a simple abdominal X - ray and an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound scan were therefore requested , which did not reveal a perforation of the intestine . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , it had not been demonstrated that the care provided to the applicant \u2019s husband during his stay in hospital from DATE to CARDINAL DATE had not been in accordance with good medical practice , or that he should have been kept in hospital for longer . The court therefore concluded that there was no causal link between the treatment administered by PERSON to the applicant \u2019s husband in the GPE and his death , which had been caused by a perforated viscus that was unconnected to the colonic disease treated by the accused . It held :", "\u201c ... there was no evidence to show that the treatment administered by the accused for the Clostridium difficile infection was incomplete , that the patient was discharged prematurely on DATE or , in sum , that the accused was responsible for the death of the patient on DATE . \u201d", "DATE .

The judgment concluded as follows :", "\u201c ... in view of the facts that have been established , it is not possible to determine at what point the defendants , by their actions or omissions , breached the rules of good medical practice ...", "It is considered established that [ Mr PERSON \u2019s ] death was caused by sepsis due to peritonitis resulting from the perforation of his duodenal ulcer ...", "No doubts persisted regarding the diagnosis of meningitis , the procedure adopted , the sequence of treatment and the resolution of the problem , as all the various aftereffects were duly explained .", "Hence there were no differences of opinion regarding the need to prescribe and use antibiotics in the context of [ Mr PERSON \u2019s ] meningitis and other conditions , although it was explained that colitis is a bacterial imbalance caused by antibiotics ( the very ones which have undesirable effects on intestinal flora ) .", "Nevertheless , it was not possible to determine the agent or identify the cause of the bacterium linked to the meningitis and it could therefore not be established with certainty whether the sinus surgery was the source of the problem or was simply CARDINAL factor causing the infection .

There was therefore no breach of the rules of good medical practice ( either by action or omission ) . Accordingly , one of the cumulative conditions for establishing civil liability , namely an unlawful act , is absent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG . She contested the facts deemed to be established , arguing that only by studying the circumstances before , during and after the operation would it be possible to understand what type of bacterium her husband had contracted .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims , upholding the judgment of ORG . It first of all declined to review the facts considered by the lower court to have been established , on the grounds that the hearings had not been recorded and that no new documents had been submitted which could cast doubt on the evidence forming the basis for the court \u2019s decision .
