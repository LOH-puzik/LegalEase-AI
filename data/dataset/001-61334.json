The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is PERSON , born in DATE . The second applicant is her daughter , PERSON , born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are of NORP origin . The first applicant was born in GPE into the family of a military officer of ORG ( GPE ) . At DATE she moved to GPE together with her parents . Her husband , PERSON , born in DATE , was transferred to GPE in DATE to serve as a NORP military officer . He met the first applicant in GPE and married her there in DATE . In DATE the first applicant gave birth to their daughter , the second applicant . The first applicant 's father retired from the army in DATE .", "CARDINAL . GPE regained independence from the GPE in DATE . On DATE GPE assumed jurisdiction over the former NORP armed forces , including those stationed in the territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and the first applicant 's parents were entered in the register of NORP residents ( \u201c the register \u201d ) as \u201c ex - GPE citizens \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . At that time , none of them were citizens of any particular ORG . In her request to be entered in the register , the first applicant had not indicated that her husband was a NORP military officer .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government state that , in requesting her entry in the register , the first applicant submitted false information about the occupation of PERSON , stating that he worked at a factory . The respondent Government have submitted a copy of an annex to the first applicant 's application for residence in GPE , including the statement that her husband worked at a factory .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the third party submit that the document is falsified , and that it does not exist . They also refer to the fact that , during the subsequent proceedings concerning the legality of their stay in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , the immigration authorities did not refer to any such false information , and the NORP courts did not establish that the applicants had at any point submitted the information mentioned by the respondent Government .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , who had become a NORP citizen on an unspecified date in DATE , continued his service in the NORP army until his discharge in DATE on the ground of the abolition of his post . The parties disagree as to the actual date of his discharge : the applicants state that he was discharged on DATE . They rely on the fact that an order for his discharge was signed and became effective on DATE . The NORP Government support this conclusion . The respondent Government argue that the first applicant 's husband was discharged on DATE as it was only on that date that he formally completed his leave ; his leave allowance and retirement benefits had been calculated with reference to that date .", "CARDINAL . The treaty between GPE and GPE on the withdrawal of the NORP troops ( \u201c the treaty \u201d ) was signed in GPE on DATE and became effective on that date ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the respondent Government , even before the signature and entry into force of the treaty , various NORP and NORP authorities cooperated in establishing the names of the NORP military personnel liable to be removed from GPE . In this context , on DATE , the NORP military authorities submitted to the NORP authorities a list of the NORP military officers in GPE , including the first applicant 's husband , with an accompanying request to prolong his and his family 's temporary residence in GPE . This , the respondent Government contend , made it clear that their stay in GPE was temporary , and that they would be required to leave .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants and ORG , the list of DATE did not entail any obligation on PERSON to leave GPE as it was a document solely requesting the prolongation of his temporary stay in GPE , submitted before the actual signature and entry into force of the treaty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON applied to ORG ( \u201c the CMA \u201d ) for a temporary residence permit in GPE by reason , inter alia , of his marriage to the first applicant , a permanent resident of GPE . This was refused on the ground that , as a NORP military officer , he was required to leave GPE as a result of the withdrawal of the NORP troops in accordance with the treaty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG annulled the applicants ' entry in the register on the ground of PERSON military status . The applicants state that they were not informed about the decision , and that they found out about it only in DATE , in the context of the court proceedings brought by the first applicant 's husband ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government have also produced a list dated DATE , which according to them had been submitted to the NORP authorities by the NORP armed forces . In the list PERSON was included in the category of military personnel who had retired after DATE . The applicants and the third party contest the authenticity of the list .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government have further produced a list dated DATE , which according to them had been sent to ORG by the NORP consulate in GPE . According to the respondent Government , PERSON name appeared on the list among those NORP military pensioners who had been discharged from the NORP armed forces after DATE . It was also noted in the list that on QUANTITY DATE PERSON had been given housing in the city of Kursk in GPE , and that he had left GPE on DATE . The applicants and the third party contest the authenticity of the list .", "CARDINAL . NORP In point of fact , however , the first applicant 's husband had stayed in GPE . He brought a court action against the GPE , claiming that their refusal to issue him with a temporary residence permit was void . On DATE FAC found in his favour . The ORG appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG 's appeal , finding , inter alia , that PERSON had been a NORP military officer until DATE and that the treaty of DATE required all NORP officers in service on DATE to leave GPE together with their families . ORG referred , inter alia , to the list of DATE , which confirmed that he had been provided with accommodation in Kursk , and that he had left GPE in DATE . He did not bring a cassation appeal against the appellate judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the immigration authorities issued a deportation order in respect of the applicants . The order was served on them on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On that date the local authorities decided to evict the applicants from their flat , which they rented from ORG . NORP military officers and their families as well as other residents of GPE lived in the block where the flat was located . The eviction order was not enforced .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE PERSON moved to GPE , while the applicants remained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant brought a court action in her own name and on behalf of her daughter , claiming that they were in fact permanent residents of GPE and that they could not be removed from the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC found in favour of the applicants . The court held , inter alia , that the first applicant had come to GPE as a relative of her father , not her husband . As her father had retired in DATE , he could thereafter no longer be regarded as a military officer , and his close relatives , including the applicants , could be entered in the register as permanent residents of GPE . The court quashed the deportation order in respect of the applicants and authorised their re - entry in the register .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against the judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that the first - instance court had decided the case properly . Upon a cassation appeal by the ORG , on DATE ORG quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case to the appellate court for a fresh examination . ORG referred to the fact that the applicants had been provided with a flat in Kursk , and that they were subject to the provisions of the treaty of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG 's appeal , finding that PERSON had been a serving NORP military officer until DATE . Referring to the fact that he had been given housing in Kursk in DATE following his retirement from the NORP military , the court decided that he had been required to leave GPE with his family in accordance with the treaty . The court found that the decision of the immigration authorities to annul the applicants ' entry in the register had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was informed by the immigration authorities that the deportation order of DATE had become effective upon the delivery of the appellate court 's judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on a cassation appeal by the applicants , ORG confirmed the decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG stated that PERSON had been discharged from the NORP armed forces on DATE . ORG noted that the applicants had been allocated the flat in Kursk in the context of the material assistance provided by GPE for the withdrawal of NORP troops . Relying on the fact that PERSON had been discharged from the military after DATE , ORG concluded that the applicants , as part of his family , had also been required to leave GPE in accordance with the treaty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the ORG to defer execution of the deportation order . That was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged with the immigration authorities an appeal against the deportation order , requesting a residence permit and her re - entry in the register . She stated , inter alia , that GPE was her and her daughter 's motherland as they had lived there all their lives and had no other citizenship , and that she was required to take care of her disabled parents who were permanently resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the police entered the applicants ' flat . They were arrested at TIME on the same date . On DATE , at TIME , a police officer issued an arrest warrant in respect of the applicants on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW . The warrant stated that the applicants had no valid documents justifying their stay in GPE , and that the applicants ' entry in the register of NORP residents had been annulled by ORG final judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It was also mentioned in the warrant that the applicants \u201c did not leave GPE following the judgment , and there were reasonable grounds to suspect that they were staying in GPE illegally \u201d . The warrant was signed by the applicants . On the basis of the warrant the applicants were immediately detained in a centre for illegal immigrants .", "CARDINAL . Also on CARDINAL DATE the Director of the ORG sent a letter to the immigration police , stating that the applicants ' arrest had been \u201c premature \u201d in view of the fact that the first applicant had lodged an appeal on DATE . No reference to domestic law was made in the letter . The Director of the ORG ordered the immigration police to release the applicants . They were released at an unspecified time on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants received a letter from the Director of the ORG dated DATE , informing them that they were required to leave GPE immediately . They were also informed that , if they complied voluntarily with the deportation order , they could thereafter be issued with a visa enabling them to stay in the country for DATE per annum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the flat of the first applicant 's parents was searched by the police in the presence of the second applicant . On DATE , at TIME , a police officer issued a warrant for the second applicant 's arrest on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW . The warrant stated that the second applicant had no valid document justifying her stay in GPE , and that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that she was staying in GPE illegally . The order was signed by the second applicant . She was immediately arrested and thereafter detained for TIME in a centre for illegal immigrants . She was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants moved to GPE to join PERSON . By that time the second applicant had completed her secondary education in GPE . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicants adopted NORP citizenship as former nationals of the GPE . The applicants now live in Kursk , in accommodation which was provided by the NORP defence authorities . After the applicants left GPE , their flat in GPE was taken back by the NORP authorities . Meanwhile , the first applicant 's parents continued living in GPE on the basis of their status as \u201c ex - GPE citizens \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the first applicant 's parents are seriously ill , but the applicants have not been able to go to GPE to visit them . The deportation order of CARDINAL DATE prohibited the applicants from entering GPE for DATE . That prohibition expired on DATE . Towards DATE the applicants obtained visas permitting their stay in GPE for DATE per annum .", "CARDINAL . In view of the fact that PERSON had left GPE voluntarily , the prohibition on entering GPE was not extended to him . He was allowed to visit GPE several times in the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP laws use the term \u201c citizenship \u201d ( pilson\u012bba ) to denote the nationality of a person . In the official LANGUAGE translations of the domestic statutes , the term \u201c nationality \u201d is sometimes used in brackets alongside the term \u201c citizenship \u201d . An official LANGUAGE translation of LAW ( Part I ) provides , for example , that \u201c an ' alien ' [ is ] a person having the citizenship ( nationality ) of another ORG ; [ a ] ' stateless person ' [ is ] a person having no citizenship ( nationality ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
