The applicant had alleged that this weapon had been CARDINAL of the ones that he had been accused of carrying in the first set of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant did not allege that there had been a violation of the right to a fair trial on account of the nature of his participation in the appeal hearings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the text of which was deposited at the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It held that ORG had given logical and proper reasons for its decision on all the disputed issues .", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE introduced , among the implementing provisions of LAW ( ORG ) , a new LAW bis which , in its relevant parts and after the amendments introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , is now worded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In proceedings concerning CARDINAL of the offences provided for in LAW , paragraph QUANTITY bis , and LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph ( a ) , no . CARDINAL of the Code [ that is , mainly ORG - related and other serious offences ] , a person who , in any capacity , is detained in a prison shall participate in the hearings at a distance [ a distanza ] in the following cases :", "( a ) where there are serious requirements of public safety or order ;", "( b ) where the proceedings are particularly complex and participation at a distance is deemed necessary in order to avoid delays . In considering the requirement of avoiding delays in the proceedings , regard shall also be had to the fact , where applicable , that other proceedings are pending at the same time against the same defendant before different courts .", "CARDINAL bis . Besides the cases provided for in paragraph CARDINAL , participation at a distance shall also be arranged in proceedings brought against a detainee who has been the subject of the measures provided for in section CARDINAL bis , paragraph CARDINAL , of PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision to order participation at a distance shall be taken , if necessary of their own motion , by the president of the trial court or of ORG ... during the preliminary measures stage , or by the judge ... during the proceedings . The order shall be communicated to the parties and defence counsel DATE prior to the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Where an order is made for participation at a distance , an audiovisual link shall be activated between the hearing room and the place of detention so that the persons present in both places can see each other clearly and simultaneously and hear what is being said . If the measure is ordered in respect of several defendants who are being detained , in any capacity , in different places , each [ of them ] shall , by means of the same arrangement , be able to see and hear the others .", "CARDINAL . Defence counsel or his or her replacement must always be able to be present where the accused is situated . Defence counsel , or his or her replacement present in the hearing room , and the accused shall be able to confer confidentially , by means of appropriate technical equipment .", "CARDINAL . The place from which the accused is connected by audiovisual link to the hearing room shall be regarded as an extension of the hearing room [ \u00e8 equiparato all'aula d'udienza ] .", "CARDINAL . An officer of the court qualified to assist the judge ... shall be present at the place where the accused is situated and shall certify the latter 's identity and officially note that there is no impediment to or restriction on the exercise of his or her rights and entitlements . He or she shall also certify that the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL and the second sentence of paragraph CARDINAL have been complied with , and , if the examination takes place , that the precautions have been taken to ensure the lawfulness thereof ... To that end he shall consult , if necessary , the accused and his counsel . ...", "CARDINAL . If it becomes necessary during the proceedings to arrange a confrontation between witnesses or identification of the accused or another measure requiring him to be observed in person , the judge shall , if he considers it necessary , after hearing the parties , order that the accused be present in the hearing room for the time necessary to comply with that measure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG ( order no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , participation at a distance seeks to achieve the following aims : ( a ) protect public order in the event of possible acts of intimidation by the accused against other parties in the trial ; ( b ) prevent the transfer of the accused from prison to the hearing room from becoming an opportunity to renew contact with the criminal organisations to which they belong ; and ( c ) expedite the conduct of particularly complex and long trials , which often take place in different courts . ORG has also stated that the system introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE guarantees the right of persons accused of exceptionally serious offences to participate in their trial , while weighing that right against the duty to protect the public and ensure the proper conduct of the trial ( ordinato svolgimento dei processi ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that participation at a distance was compatible with the \u201c right to a defence \u201d , as guaranteed by LAW . It stated that it could not accept the idea that only the physical presence of the accused in the hearing room would ensure the effectiveness of this right , since LAW required only the personal and conscious ( consapevole ) participation of the defendant in the proceedings . LAW implementing provisions of the ORG was not limited to indicating the technical means necessary to installing a link between the hearing room and the place of detention , but required that certain \u201c results \u201d be attained and , in particular , the \u201c effective \u201d participation of the accused in the proceedings with a view to ensuring the proper exercise of his right to a defence . There were also legislative provisions guaranteeing contact between the accused , the right of defence counsel to be present where the defendant was situated and the ability of the accused and his counsel to communicate with each other . The judge had the power and the duty to ensure that the technical means installed were appropriate to the aims sought to be achieved and could , if necessary , order the accused to be present in the hearing room . In the opinion of ORG , the fact that the new provisions departed from \u201c tradition \u201d did not upset the balance and dynamics of a trial that , on the contrary , remained substantively unchanged .", "CARDINAL . For the same reasons , ORG found that the system introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE could not be deemed to be contrary to LAW , a provision which required , among other things , compliance with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement , in particular for accused persons in detention .", "CARDINAL .
