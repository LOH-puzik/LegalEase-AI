De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 son , aged DATE and DATE at that time , underwent surgery for the removal of polyps , which was performed by PERSON in the ORG - run ORG .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON decided to perform the operation under general anaesthetic with tracheal intubation . The general anaesthesia was performed by Dr P.A , assisted by ORG , a staff nurse .", "CARDINAL . After surgery the child was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit . TIME after his transfer ORG informed PERSON that the child was cyanotic and had no pulse .", "CARDINAL . The child suffered a haemorrhage , causing blood to flood his lungs . A team of doctors tried to resuscitate him and clear his respiratory channels , but without any success . The child was declared dead TIME after the operation .", "CARDINAL . A criminal investigation into the cause of death was opened by the PERSON police on the same day .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON and PERSON were questioned and gave written statements .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy report issued by ORG ( PERSON medicin\u0103 legal\u0103 PERSON ) on DATE said that the ORG son had died of acute respiratory failure as a result of the blood that had blocked his airways and flooded his lungs . It also noted that the child had suffered from several congenital deficiencies which had probably played a role in the postoperative complications : myocardia and hepatic dystrophy , and interatrial septum aneurisms .", "CARDINAL . The report was sent for the approval of the commission for confirmation and supervision of ORG ( Comisia de avizare \u0219i control din ORG ) . On CARDINAL DATE the commission confirmed that the child \u2019s death had occurred after surgery and had been caused by the blood that had blocked his airways and lungs . It held that there had been a causal link between the post - operative treatment and the child \u2019s death . It noted the deflation of the balloon of the catheter ( balona\u015ful sondei de \u00eentuba\u0163ie ) , applied after post - operatively to prevent the ingress of blood into the lungs , as a possible cause of the presence of blood there and in his airways .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the superior commission of ORG examined all the documents and approved the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child \u2019s father lodged a disciplinary complaint against PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . The disciplinary committee of ORG opened an investigation into the patient \u2019s death , collecting documents from the patient \u2019s medical file and taking statements from PERSON and ORG , as well as from the doctors involved in the resuscitation procedure postoperation . It gave its decision on DATE by which it concluded that the child \u2019s death could be included among cases of sudden death ( with a frequency of PERCENT owing to the child \u2019s pre - existing medical conditions : myocardia and hepatic dystrophy , and inter - atrial septum aneurisms ) . Although the committee concluded that there had been no direct link between the child \u2019s death and the LOC medical conduct , it reprimanded both doctors for their failure to perform the necessary pre - surgical medical tests and to seek the applicants\u2019 informed consent before surgery .", "CARDINAL . The applicants objected to the committee \u2019s conclusions and their appeal was examined by the superior disciplinary committee of ORG .", "CARDINAL . An expert medical opinion was submitted to the committee and was used by it in reaching its final conclusions . The expert noted , among other things , that the child \u2019s preparation for surgery had not been appropriate as his examination before anaesthesia had been \u201c very superficial \u201d ; in this respect the committee noted the lack of a radioscopy of the lungs , of an ORG and an exploration of the necessary time for blood coagulation . In the expert \u2019s view , the doctors had ignored the child \u2019s severe congenital deficiencies as they had considered that surgery for the removal of polyps had been a \u201c minor intervention \u201d and therefore no special precautions had been necessary .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the superior disciplinary committee of ORG quashed the decision of DATE and fined each doctor CARDINAL NORP lei ( the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) . It found that the child \u2019s pre - surgical tests had been insufficient for avoiding post - operative complications . Therefore , it held that PERSON and Dr P.A. had infringed LAW , pursuant to which a doctor should perform diagnoses with maximum diligence in order to determine the adequate treatment and avoid predictable complications that might occur for a patient under his or her care .", "CARDINAL . The committee further stated that the presence of blood in the child \u2019s airways could not be explained on the basis of the documents and statements in the file . It noted that all the doctors and the nurses who had given evidence stated that the balloon of the intubation catheter had been leakproof ( etanche ) ; however , the fact that the cause of death had been the presence of blood in the child \u2019s lungs could only lead to the conclusion that such statements had been inaccurate .", "CARDINAL . Relying on Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Deontological Code and LAW no . CARDINAL , the committee also noted that the parents had not given their informed consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a criminal complaint alleging that the flawed surgical and post - surgical treatment received by their son had resulted in his death . They asked that those responsible be identified and held accountable for their son \u2019s death . They joined the criminal proceedings as civil parties .", "CARDINAL . Following a request of ORG , on DATE ORG stated that the medical staff members in charge of monitoring the child were Dr P.A. during the intervention and the child \u2019s transfer to the intensive care unit and ORG while in the intensive care unit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office of FAC decided to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON", "CARDINAL . P.V.I. was interviewed as a witness immediately after the child \u2019s death , during the preliminary criminal investigation . During the criminal proceedings against PERSON , in spite of the fact that she had been repeatedly summoned , the investigating authorities were not able to question her as she had not been found . She had left her job at ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecuting authorities interviewed several doctors and nurses from the hospital \u2019s medical staff who had been involved in the applicants\u2019 son \u2019s post - operative care .", "CARDINAL . Dr P.A. lodged a request with the investigating body for a new forensic medical report . He pointed out that there were major contradictions between the autopsy report and the opinion issued by the commission for confirmation and supervision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to carry out a forensic expert report that would identify the cause and circumstances of the child \u2019s death . ORG replied that a new forensic report could not be produced as the evidence examined had been sent by ORG to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr P.A. submitted an extrajudicial expert report . It stated that the cause of death had not been the presence of blood in the child \u2019s lungs owing to a lack of adequate post - operative monitoring , but the post - operative reaction of a child with pre - existing medical conditions ( cardiac congenital malformation , hepatic dystrophy , renal stasis , mesenteric adenopathy and hemorrhagic enterocolitis ) mentioned in the medical records kept by the child \u2019s paediatrician . The report noted a generalised inflammatory reaction associated with diffused haemorrhages in his digestive tract , lungs , heart and spleen .", "CARDINAL . The applicants gave evidence to the investigating authorities on DATE . They contended that they had not been properly informed about the risks of surgery and of the general anaesthetic and consequently they had not given their consent for such interventions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that a new forensic report be produced by ORG . The applicants , PERSON and the investigating authorities submitted several questions for the forensic experts . They asked , among other things , whether the pre - existent medical condition of the child had influenced his unfavourable post - surgical evolution and whether administration of a general anaesthetic had been the right option , given the age and the diagnosis of the child . The child \u2019s father also asked ORG whether the post - operative monitoring of the child had been adequate .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE ORG replied that it could not deliver such a report because under the relevant domestic legislation a new forensic expert report could not be ordered unless there were new medical and factual elements . Accordingly , ORG stated that it maintained its previous opinion .", "CARDINAL . Copies of the documents from the disciplinary file were added to the criminal file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office of ORG decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against ORG , finding , in the light of evidence gathered in the case , that there had been no element of criminal negligence in his conduct . That decision was upheld on DATE by the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . A complaint by the applicants against the ORG decisions was allowed by ORG on DATE . The ORG decisions were quashed and ORG kept the file for fresh consideration . It considered that although a new forensic report had not been produced , the decision of the superior committee of ORG provided enough information concerning the cause of death , which had been the presence of blood in the child \u2019s airways owing to the balloon of the tracheal catheter not being tight enough . It considered that it should be established whether the post - operative monitoring of the child by ORG had been appropriate and more precisely whether PERSON should have noticed the non - functioning catheter .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON and PERSON gave statements before ORG on DATE . Moreover , members of the medical staff that had attempted resuscitation gave evidence ( on DATE , DATE and DATE ) . Some of them maintained that the blood in the lungs could be explained by the resuscitation attempts and that the balloon of the catheter had been kept tight all the time after surgery .", "CARDINAL . P.V.I. did not give evidence before the court as , although summoned , she did not attend the hearings . According to several reports issued by bailiffs seeking to bring her before the court , she had left the country for GPE . Based on the material in the case file it does not appear that the court took special measures to identify her address there .", "CARDINAL . The child \u2019s father gave evidence before LOC Court on DATE . He reiterated his claims for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages . He again contended that the doctors had not informed his family about the risks of surgery and in particular of the general anaesthetic and accordingly they had not given their informed consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after several hearings , FAC acquitted PERSON and dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil claim as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . ORG took into account the extrajudicial forensic report submitted by PERSON It noted that the conclusions of the extrajudicial report were in total contradiction to the conclusions of the medical report of DATE and the conclusions of the commission for confirmation and supervision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . This judgment was upheld by a decision of ORG delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not take into account the conclusions of the extrajudicial forensic report as in its opinion it represented only extrajudicial evidence which could not set aside the conclusions of competent forensic institutes .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the death of the child had been caused by the presence of blood in his airways and lungs . However , based on the evidence in the file , it was not possible to explain when the blood had entered the child \u2019s airways because of the deflation of the catheter \u2019s balloon . Moreover , the post - operative complications occurred TIME after the child had been transferred to the intensive care unit , while under the supervision of ORG held therefore that ORG could not be held responsible for the deflation of the catheter \u2019s balloon after surgery .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision . They requested that the court extend the criminal investigation to ORG , who had had the child under her supervision in the intensive care unit .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the decisions of the lower courts . Noting that the lower courts had not examined the allegation made by the child \u2019s parents that they had not given their consent for surgery and the general anaesthesia , the appeal court sent the file back to LOC Court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted PERSON It held that no causal link existed between the death of the child and the presumed omission of the medical authorities to obtain the applicants\u2019 informed consent for the administration of a general anaesthetic .", "CARDINAL . It further held that it could not establish beyond any reasonable doubt that PERSON had been negligent in ensuring the tightness of the catheter \u2019s balloon after surgery . Consequently , the court dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil claim as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The court also dismissed the ORG request to extend the criminal investigation to ORG on the grounds that , under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , only the prosecutor could ask for the extension of the investigation to other persons while the proceedings were pending before the courts .", "CARDINAL . This judgment was upheld by a final decision delivered by ORG on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted separate civil proceedings against ORG and doctors GPE and GPE in ORG for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages they had sustained as a result of their son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , referring to LAW CCP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court stayed the civil proceedings pending a final decision in the criminal proceedings . It noted that the outcome of the civil proceedings would depend to a large extent on the verdict in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lifted the stay of the civil proceedings . However , the applicants gave up their separate civil claim on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
