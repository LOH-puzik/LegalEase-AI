{"ITEMID": "001-72080", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "ALAKOSKI v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She was initially represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , and subsequently by PERSON , both lawyers practising in Riihim\u00e4ki . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant fell down and injured her leg and ankle , sustaining CARDINAL different lasting injuries . She was granted a temporary employment - based disability pension . In DATE she lodged a further application .", "On DATE the insurance company refused her a further pension , giving the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c According to LAW ( ty\u00f6ntekij\u00e4in el\u00e4kelaki , lag om pension f\u00f6r arbetstagare ; CARDINAL ) section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) an employee is entitled to a disability pension if his or her capacity to work is reduced by CARDINAL for a minimum of DATE as a result of sickness , a defect or an injury . When assessing the decrease of working capacity , attention shall be paid to the employee \u2019s remaining capacity to pursue gainful employment through available work , which he or she can reasonably be expected to carry out . In addition , attention shall be paid to working experience , age and other comparable circumstances .", "According to the information at hand on your state of health , you underwent rectifying surgery with a view to repositioning a fracture in DATE , after which the ossification has gone well .", "We consider that your state of health does not prevent you from returning to your previous work . For these reasons , you could not be considered incapable of working after your pension ceased . That being the case , your application for a continued disability pension has been rejected . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( el\u00e4kelautakunta , pensionsn\u00e4mnden ) .", "In its observations of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the insurance company stated that it had reviewed the application and found that the applicant was entitled to a part - time employment - based disability pension from DATE , but it requested that the application for a full pension still be rejected as the applicant \u2019s work capacity had not decreased by CARDINAL . Moreover , the insurance company considered that the applicant did not need any professional rehabilitation . The observations were communicated to the applicant for comment .", "In her written submissions the applicant primarily requested that she be granted a full disability pension as her incapacity to work had been reduced by CARDINAL for DATE . Alternatively , she requested that such a pension be granted temporarily from DATE until DATE . She argued that the insurance company had assessed her capacity for work as a bank clerk , although she worked as a real estate agent , which could not be considered as sedentary work . However , the insurance company had by DATE accepted the fact that she worked as a real estate agent .", "On the strength of CARDINAL medical statements the applicant pointed out that all CARDINAL doctors examining her had considered her incapable for work as a real estate agent . The only doctor who considered her capable for work was the one who , without having ever examined the applicant in person , had reported on her case to the insurance company . If ORG in written proceedings were to consider that she was not entitled to a full disability pension , the applicant requested that ORG hear the doctors ORG and PERSON treating her and the doctor who had reported on her case to the insurance company as witnesses before ORG with a view to examining whether she was incapable to carry out her work as a real estate agent .", "On DATE ORG , without hearing any witnesses , overturned the insurance company \u2019s decision , finding that the applicant was entitled to a full disability pension in the form of a rehabilitation allowance from DATE until DATE and to a part - time disability pension from DATE . The appeal was rejected as to the other claims . ORG , referring to LAW sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL b ( CARDINAL ) , gave the following reasons for the decision :", "\u201c PERSON has been granted a rehabilitation allowance with a view to facilitating rehabilitation according to a care and rehabilitation plan . PERSON is prevented from pursuing gainful employment due to incapacity for work . PERSON \u2019s capacity for work has due to sickness decreased by CARDINAL up until DATE and thereafter by CARDINAL . When assessing the decrease of work capacity , attention has been paid to PERSON \u2019s remaining capacity for pursuing gainful employment through available work , which she can reasonably be expected to carry out . In addition , attention has been paid to [ her ] training , previous working , age and living conditions and other comparable circumstances . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) . She primarily requested a full disability pension as her incapacity to work had been reduced by CARDINAL . Alternatively , she requested such a pension temporarily from DATE until DATE .", "The applicant , adducing further written medical statements , again pointed out that the opinion of the CARDINAL doctors treating her differed from the opinion of the doctor who had reported on her case to the insurance company , a person she had not even met . Moreover , she argued that ORG gave no reasons as to why DATE was decisive in its decision , although the doctors treating her had found that she was incapable for work at least until DATE . If ORG in written proceedings were to consider that she was not entitled to a full disability pension , the applicant repeated her request concerning hearing the doctors as witnesses . At this point she also proposed doctor PERSON as a witness . The applicant considered it important that they be heard also as to whether her capacity for work should be assessed differently as to the period prior to CARDINAL DATE and as to the period thereafter .", "In its observations of CARDINAL DATE the insurance company maintained its earlier standpoint . They were communicated to the applicant for comment .", "In its decision of DATE ORG noted that the applicant had submitted CARDINAL new written medical opinions . They had all been issued after ORG decision . It refused the request to hear the doctors as witnesses before ORG as manifestly unnecessary and upheld ORG decision . Referring to LAW sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL b ( CARDINAL ) and LAW ( laki vakuutusoikeudesta , lag om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ; CARDINAL ) section CARDINAL , ORG gave the following reasons for the decision :", "\u201c The reasons are given in ORG decision . In addition , ORG notes that according to the submitted medical information the fracture on PERSON \u2019s left ankle was in DATE noted to have ossified . A faulty alignment remains and a degenerative arthritis has developed in the ankle joint . PERSON has in a majority of the medical opinions been assessed as incapable of working either as a real estate agent or doing other work which places a strain on her legs . The medical opinions differ as to the duration of the incapacity . PERSON has worked as a bank clerk with different tasks for a long period of time . Having been laid off , PERSON took a real estate agent exam , but she did not manage to work as a real estate agent before she was injured . The ORG finds that PERSON can on the basis of the submitted information be considered to be partly able to work with tasks that correspond to her education and professional skills . Her ability to work can accordingly not be considered to have been reduced after DATE in such a way , i.e. by CARDINAL fifths , as to entitle her to a full pension under LAW . \u201d", "No further appeal was possible .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the then LAW ( Suomen hallitusmuoto , ORG ; CARDINAL ) provided that a decision must be reasoned . A new similar provision can be found in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; GPE ) .", "At the relevant time chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) provided that a judgment must be reasoned , indicating the facts and the legal argumentation on which it was based and the grounds which have led the court to hold a disputed issue established or unsubstantiated .", "Section CARDINAL of the then LAW ( laki vakuutusoikeudesta , lagen om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ; CARDINAL ) provided that proceedings in ORG were written . When there were exceptional reasons , ORG could however decide to hold an oral hearing . It also provided that the provisions concerning proceedings in general courts were , mutatis mutandis , applied to those before ORG .", "According to the reservation made by GPE in accordance with LAW , as in force at the relevant time , GPE could not guarantee a right to an oral hearing in so far as NORP laws at the time of the events in issue did not provide such a right . This applied , inter alia , to proceedings which were held before ORG as the court of final instance , in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , and proceedings before ORG in accordance with chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure . GPE withdrew the reservation on DATE . The reservation was applicable to the present case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
