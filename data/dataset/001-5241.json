{"ITEMID": "001-5241", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NOR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "HUSSAIN AND C. v. NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , and the second applicant , his daughter PERSON , are respectively NORP and NORP nationals born in DATE and DATE and living in GPE , GPE , and GPE , GPE . They are represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant arrived in GPE in DATE and was granted a temporary residence permit for education purposes . In DATE he was granted a residence permit for an indefinite duration .", "According to the first applicant he had met the second applicant \u2019s mother at DATE . They had established a relationship as from DATE , had got engaged in DATE and had planned to marry in DATE , but this did not materialise as PERSON was detained on remand in DATE on suspicion of drug offences .", "On DATE the Eidsivating High Court ( lagmannsrett ) convicted the first applicant of the possession and attempted sale of QUANTITY of heroin . It deemed the heroin to have been of a particularly high degree of purity and noted that CARDINAL user had died . While the first applicant 's replies to the charges had said little more than the bare minimum , ORG did not find it established from where he had received the drugs or what role he had played in the importation and acquisition of the drugs . However , although he had submitted that he had been put under strong pressures and had reluctantly received the heroin in order to store it , ORG did not find that his role had been as modest as he had claimed . He had failed to explain why , in defiance of what he described as an order , he decided to sell a large part of the drug to CARDINAL of his co - accused and to keep another part . It was further noted that in connection with a delivery of heroin by the first applicant , CARDINAL of his co - accused in the trial had come to the agreed place with CARDINAL other co - accused as a bodyguard . In view of the particularly serious nature of the offence , ORG sentenced the first applicant to DATE imprisonment .", "On DATE ORG decided to expel the first applicant . On appeal , the latter decision was upheld by ORG ( PERSON ) on CARDINAL DATE . He subsequently requested that the expulsion order be altered , but ORG and ORG , in decisions dated respectively DATE and DATE , refused the request .", "The first applicant and his wife were married at Ullersmo prison in DATE , i.e. after the applicant 's conviction and sentence to DATE imprisonment and the decision to expel him from GPE . CARDINAL daughters were born to them , the second applicant , born in DATE , and PERSON , born in DATE .", "While serving his prison sentence the first applicant had extensive contact with his wife and the second applicant . Following his release in DATE , the first applicant lived with his family for DATE until DATE , when he was expelled from GPE to GPE . His wife and the second applicant accompanied him to GPE , but returned after DATE . The first applicant was twice granted a visa to enter GPE in order to attend the court proceedings , but was denied a visa in connection with PERSON 's birth . During DATE , his wife and CARDINAL children lived with him for DATE in GPE .", "A medical certificate of DATE issued by a paediatrician states that , since the second applicant was a baby , she had suffered from atopical eczema causing her nuisance particularly during DATE , DATE and DATE , and requiring that her entire body be treated with moistening cream DATE and with oil baths . She was allergic to milk and was taking substitute milk products . She was also allergic to eggs and pollen . She had asthma and had experienced asthma fits serious enough nearly to require hospitalisation .", "According to certain statements dated DATE and DATE by personnel in charge of the second applicant 's kindergarten , the first applicant had been present and actively took part in her care ; she had said that she missed her father and there was a clear risk that her separation from him would have negative psychological consequences for her .", "On DATE ORG ( byrett ) rejected the first applicant 's appeal against the ORG 's above - mentioned decision of CARDINAL DATE . He then appealed to ORG , which , on DATE , upheld ORG judgment . He further appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) which , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , upheld ORG conclusion on the merits but overturned the lower courts ' decisions ordering him to pay legal costs .", "In its judgment ORG considered , inter alia , whether the expulsion would be consistent with GPE 's obligations under LAW , as interpreted and applied in a number of cases by the Convention institutions , in particular whether the measure was necessary in a NORP society , which the first applicant disputed . Mr Justice PERSON stated on behalf of the majority :", "\u201c The ground for the expulsion is the very serious drug offence of which Mr PERSON has been found guilty . ...", "PERSON was convicted under LAW ) , cf . ( CARDINAL ) , of LAW for serious narcotics offences relating to a very large quantity of drugs . The maximum penalty was DATE imprisonment , while the minimum was DATE . It was thus a very serious offence of which he was found guilty and the penalty imposed was DATE imprisonment , of which DATE and DATE had been served . PERSON was found guilty of the possession and attempted sale in respect of QUANTITY of heroin of a high degree of purity . It is stated in ORG judgment that each QUANTITY of the product could be divided into CARDINAL doses ; so that the substance posed a very great danger of being commercialised . ...", "\u2026 In the present case , there is no information to the effect that PERSON has been involved in other criminal offences . This is relevant to the assessment but is overshadowed by the seriousness of the offence of which he has been found guilty .", "I now turn to the arguments submitted against expulsion .", "Even though it has been conceded that PERSON own interests would not on their own suffice to make the expulsion incompatible with the Convention , it must be relevant that he has resided in GPE from DATE and has received an education and worked here . Until his detention on remand he had lived here for DATE . It may be mentioned that it was only after he was detained that he applied for NORP citizenship and that his application was refused . He has maintained links with his family in GPE during his visits to the country in DATE and DATE . \u2026", "The circumstances , which most strongly militate against expulsion , are those related to his family life with his spouse and CARDINAL daughters . The marriage was concluded while PERSON was serving his prison sentence and after the police had ordered the expulsion . Nevertheless , there is agreement that family life was established before he was detained on remand . The couple \u2019s eldest child , [ the second applicant ] , who is now DATE , was born while her father was serving his sentence but , according to the information available , she has had contacts with him during visits and home - leave and the family lived together for DATE from the applicant \u2019s release until his expulsion was effected . As already mentioned , [ the second applicant ] has considerable health problems related to asthma and allergies . Like ORG , I find it established that the maintenance of the expulsion order would split the family since , because of [ the second applicant ] , it is not expected that the mother and the daughters will settle in GPE . The possibilities of visits will be limited - in GPE , because of [ the second applicant \u2019s ] health - and in GPE , because PERSON expulsion is made permanent . It is evident that this will constitute a considerable burden to them all , in particular to [ the mother ] who will be alone in assuming the care of the daughters , one of whom is in particular need of care .", "It has been specifically claimed that in GPE it will not be possible to bring up the daughters in accordance with the mother \u2019s NORP faith . Reference is made to LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . I will not consider those matters more closely since I take it that it is not expected that the mother and the daughters will move to GPE . ...", "The appellant party has referred , inter alia , to the report recently given by the ORG in the case of ORG v. GPE and has submitted that to a high degree it supports his views . ...", "As regards this decision , I should like to point out that second generation immigrants often raise particular issues , whereas under NORP law expulsion may not be effected with respect to persons who are born in GPE and have lived there continuously . PERSON was DATE when he came here for educational purposes and has maintained contacts with GPE .", "The way I interpret the existing case - law is that in cases of such serious narcotics offences as this , it falls within the ORG \u2019s margin of appreciation to expel foreign nationals , even though it would seriously affect the person expelled and his family . \u2026", "In the final assessment I can not see that in the case under consideration the authorities\u2019 decision to expel constitutes a disproportionate measure against the scourge of drug trafficking . This was clear in DATE when the expulsion was decided by the police and ORG . The interest in protecting family life has nevertheless been given greater weight in the subsequent refusals to alter the expulsion order , the last refusal being issued by ORG on DATE . The matter was then considered on the basis of the relevant circumstances obtaining at that time . Nevertheless , having regard to the serious drug offence in respect of which PERSON has been found guilty , I consider that the interest of protecting family life does not suggest that expulsion would be disproportionate and incompatible with the LAW , despite the considerable burden it entails . It is , however , a very difficult balancing of interest with which we are faced here . \u201d", "In his dissenting opinion , Mr Justice PERSON concluded on behalf of the minority that the expulsion order must be declared unlawful ( ugyldig ) as being disproportionate . His reasoning may be summarised as follows . Although the seriousness of the offence was a consideration that weighed heavily and the interests of PERSON could not on their own justify declaring the expulsion order unlawful , the consequences for the family ought to be decisive in this case . The situation for the first applicant 's wife and the consequences for their marriage were almost identical to those described in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) . In the present case the interests of minor children were also at stake . Because of the second applicant 's illness it was excluded that the wife would move to GPE . There were great difficulties involved in maintaining family life by means of relatively short , occasional visits by the family to GPE . While it was very likely that the spouses sooner or later would be forced to divorce , the interest of avoiding divorce weighed more heavily when , as here , they had children . Moreover , there was obviously a greater risk than normal that the contacts between the father and the children would be damaged . A child in as much need of care as the second applicant would have a particular need for maintaining close contact with both parents . The mother , who alone assumed the responsibility for the CARDINAL daughters , had a strong need for the father \u2019s help in caring for the children ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
