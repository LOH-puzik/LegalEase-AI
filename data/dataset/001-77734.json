Referring to the applicant \u2019s examination by the urology department of the ORG hospital , PERSON noted in his report that there was no pathological finding . However , the neurological examination had indicated that the applicant had felt weakness in the region of his shoulder and shoulder blade and in particular when squeezing his right hand .

On DATE this letter was received by the police officers concerned , namely GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE", "On DATE and DATE ORG took statements from GPE , GPE and PERSON , who had all been involved in the interrogation of the applicant . Referring to the medical report dated DATE , which stated that there was no pathological finding on the applicant \u2019s body , the police officers all denied that they had illtreated the applicant . They claimed that such allegations were a routine practice used by members of illegal organisations to deny the crimes which they had committed .", "According to a report dated DATE , which was drafted by the ORG Director and signed by CARDINAL prison officers , the applicant refused to leave his cell and to be brought to ORG for an ORG examination .

Referring to the applicant \u2019s testimony dated DATE before ORG in which he had claimed that he had been ill - treated before his statements had been taken , and in view of the police ORG defence submissions , the court found that the CARDINAL accused police officers had merely taken statements from the applicant . However , it was undisputed that the alleged ill - treatment inflicted on the applicant occurred prior to that stage - either during his arrest or at the time of his interrogation . The court further took into consideration the medical report dated DATE which did not indicate any signs of bodily injury . Accordingly , the court concluded that there existed no evidence to substantiate that the applicant had been ill - treated by the accused police officers and therefore acquitted them of the charges . The court \u2019s decision was not served on the applicant since he had not intervened in the criminal proceedings against the accused police officers . As there was no appeal , the decision became final on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release pending trial .", "On DATE the applicant obtained a copy of ORG decision concerning the acquittal of the police officers .", "The lawyer representing the applicant in the ORG proceedings also represented him in the proceedings before ORG .", "In the meantime , the applicant provided the ORG with a copy of a document which indicated that ORG , CARDINAL of the accused police officers who had allegedly inflicted ill - treatment on the applicant , had been convicted of inflicting ill - treatment in the past .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempting to undermine the constitutional order of the ORG and sentenced him to life imprisonment .", "On DATE the Deputy to ORG appealed to ORG and requested that the conviction be quashed on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence against the applicant and that the judgment was contradictory . The public prosecutor noted that the only evidence available was the applicant \u2019s statements to the police officers .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE . It reasoned that ORG had failed to carry out a sufficient examination of the case in that it had not inquired into the outcome of the criminal proceedings concerning the alleged ill - treatment of the applicant by the security forces and the medical report to that effect .", "\u201c CARDINAL . Whoever , being a president or member of a court or council or a public officer , tortures an accused person in order to obtain a confession , shall be punished by a prison sentence of DATE and shall be disqualified from holding public office , temporarily or for life . The offender shall be punished even if he had acted under an order or encouragement from his superior . \u201d", "\u201c Any person who is injured as a result of a criminal act may , at any phase of the investigation , intervene in the public prosecution .", "Those so intervening may also submit their personal claims for adjudication . \u201d", "The intervening party is entitled to request compensation for the prejudice arising from the offence . However , the exercise of this right is subject to procedural rules : the person who is injured as a result of a criminal act must intervene in the public prosecution and request explicitly the right to ask for compensation . The compensation request is not therefore automatic . It also has to be justified and an assessment of the amount must accompany the request .", "Section CARDINAL provides that intervention should be made by means of the submission of a petition to the relevant authority or by a declaration made to the clerk of the court . Thereupon , the intervening party enjoys the same rights as a prosecutor of personal claims ( section CARDINAL ) . Decisions rendered before the intervention remain valid and , if the public prosecutor does not appeal against the final decision within the requisite time - limit , the intervener loses the right to appeal ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , according to LAW , if the intervener or his / her representative does not attend the trial , the judgment is served on him / her . Section CARDINAL empowers the intervening party to file a separate appeal against a judgment regardless of whether the public prosecutor chooses to appeal . If the intervening party succeeds in his / her appeal , the public prosecutor is required to institute criminal proceedings afresh ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
