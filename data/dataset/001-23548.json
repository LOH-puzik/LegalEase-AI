Since the beginning of the child \u2019s presence in the centre I was telling the presumed father of the boy how important it was to settle his legal situation for the good of the child . On numerous occasions I encouraged Mr T ( ... ) C ( ... ) and his mother to take the boy as a foster family ( until the settlement of the father \u2019s legal situation ) since it would be a better environment for the boy \u2019s psychophysical development .

Initially the applicant had intended to acknowledge his paternity in a statement made before ORG ( Urz\u0105d Stanu Cywilnego ) but it had proved impossible in view of the attitude of ORG mother .

The applicant should not have been granted parental responsibility because he had applied for it only after the child had been placed with the prospective adopters . Moreover , while X was still in the orphanage the applicant had refused to take him as a foster parent either alone or together with his mother . X settled very well with ORG and ORG and considered them as his parents .
