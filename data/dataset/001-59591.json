On DATE ORG ( spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud ) dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant \u2019s father .", "In its reasoning on the merits of the case , ORG stated that the defendant office had come to the conclusion that the appellant was a person of NORP nationality within the meaning of the provision in LAW ( a ) of the decree , on the basis of a finding that this was and had been generally known . It noted that the defence of the complaint directed against this finding was restricted to the representation that this finding was not supported in the files and that , due to this shortcoming , it had not been necessary to deal with the finding in greater detail . ORG considered that this approach was mistaken as , under the relevant provision of the administrative regulations , no evidence was required for facts which were generally known and , therefore , it was not necessary for evidence to be contained in the administrative files ; however , counter - evidence against an official finding that a certain fact was generally known would have been admitted .", "ORG concluded that , as the appellant had failed to raise the objection that the issue was not a fact of general knowledge and to contend that he was in a position to bring counter - evidence , the finding of the defendant office had remained uncontested .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the municipality of GPE obtained the painting as a temporary loan from ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) granted the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction ordering the municipality of GPE to hand over the painting to a bailiff at the end of the exhibition . The painting was sequestrated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG against the municipality of GPE , requesting that the defendant consent to the delivery of the painting to him by the bailiff . He argued that , as his late father \u2019s heir , he was the owner of the painting . He submitted that the painting had not been subject to expropriation measures in the former GPE and that in any event such measures were invalid or irrelevant on account of violation of the ordre public of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG intervened in these proceedings in support of the defendant . It submitted that the applicant \u2019s father had lost his ownership of the painting as a result of the confiscation in DATE and that the lawfulness of this confiscation had been confirmed by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a hearing , declared the applicant \u2019s action inadmissible . In the court \u2019s view , LAW , LAW , of ORG ( PERSON aus ORG entstandener DATE \u201c the FAC \u201d ) of DATE between GPE , GPE and GPE , GPE and GPE excluded NORP jurisdiction over the applicant \u2019s case .", "In its reasoning , ORG noted that , under the terms of that Article \u2019s paragraph CARDINAL taken in conjunction with paragraph CARDINAL , claims or actions against persons having acquired or transferred title to property on the basis of measures carried out with regard to NORP external assets or other property , seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution , or as a result of the state of war , or on the basis of specific agreements , were not admissible . These particular provisions had been confirmed upon NORP unification .", "According to ORG , Chapter CARDINAL , LAW , of ORG applied , mutatis mutandis , to the applicant \u2019s claims against the defendant , which had obtained the painting on loan and had not acquired property , because any review of the aforementioned measures should be excluded .", "ORG found that the confiscation of the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s property under Decree no . CARDINAL on the \u201c confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of NORP and NORP persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the NORP and NORP people \u201d , issued by the President of the former GPE on DATE , constituted a measure within the meaning of LAW , LAW .", "ORG rejected , in particular , the applicant \u2019s argument that this provision did not apply as it only concerned measures carried out with regard to NORP external assets or other property and his father had never been a NORP citizen . In this respect , the court , referring to case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , stated that the view of the confiscating ORG was decisive . The aim and purpose of this provision , namely to sanction , without any further examination , confiscation measures implemented abroad could only be achieved by excluding such measures from judicial review in GPE .", "Moreover , ORG found that the confiscation measure in question pursued CARDINAL of the purposes mentioned in LAW , LAW . Having regard to NORP case - law regarding other \u201c ORG Decrees \u201d , especially Decree no . CARDINAL on the \u201c confiscation of enemy property and the national reform fund \u201d , it considered that Decree no . CARDINAL , while also pursuing economic aims , was intended to expropriate the property of NORP and NORP nationals , that is , \u201c enemy property \u201d .", "ORG further noted that the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s painting had been expropriated under Decree no . CARDINAL . The competent NORP authorities had interpreted its provisions as applying to the applicant \u2019s father , regarding him as a \u201c person of NORP nationality \u201d . The applicant \u2019s father had unsuccessfully appealed against this decision which ORG had been confirmed by ORG in DATE . The NORP courts were not in a position to review the lawfulness of the confiscation at issue .", "Finally , ORG considered that the painting at issue , as part of the inventory of the agricultural property , had been included in the confiscation measure .", "ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the proceedings in order to await the outcome of proceedings to be instituted under the NORP Equalisation of Burdens Act ( GPE ) concerning compensation for damage and losses due to , inter alia , expulsion and destruction during the Second World War and the post - war period in the then NORP - occupied zone of GPE and of GPE . ORG considered that the question underlying the litigation before it would not be clarified in such proceedings . Irrespective of the question of whether the plaintiff was of NORP origin , he had no equalisation claims under the said legislation , which only applied to persons who resided in GPE or GPE on DATE . In any event , there was no right to compensation for the loss of works of art ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG confirmed that the applicant \u2019s action was inadmissible as NORP jurisdiction in respect of his claim was excluded under LAW , LAW , in conjunction with paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "ORG considered that the notion of NORP jurisdiction included the competence , derived from ORG sovereignty and generally vested by the ORG in the courts , to administer justice . NORP jurisdiction was delimited by international agreements , customary international law and the generally recognised rules of international law . LAW , LAW , taken in conjunction with paragraph CARDINAL , of the Settlements Convention excluded NORP jurisdiction in respect of claims and actions against persons , who , as a consequence of reparation measures , had directly or indirectly acquired title to NORP property confiscated abroad .", "ORG confirmed that the provisions in question continued to be in force under LAW of DATE on ORG with respect to GPE . DATE , which provided for the termination of the operation of quadripartite rights and responsibilities with respect to GPE and GPE as a whole , was amended by LAW and DATE according to which ORG was suspended and later terminated with the exception of the provisions specified in paragraph CARDINAL of that Agreement , inter alia , LAW , LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE . That Agreement was valid under public international law and under NORP constitutional law .", "ORG further considered that LAW , LAW , of ORG applied in the applicant \u2019s case . In the court \u2019s view , this provision was the procedural consequence of the notion that the legal relations resulting from the liquidation of NORP property abroad by foreign powers for the purpose of reparation were \u201c final and unchallengeable \u201d ( PERSON ) for GPE and the private persons concerned .", "According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights , in particular his right to property , his right of access to a court and his right to a decision by the legally competent court ( gesetzlicher Richter ) , had not been infringed . Basic rights protected individuals against acts of domestic public authorities and not against the exercise of public authority by a foreign ORG abroad . The domestic legislator was therefore not prevented from limiting domestic legal protection against violations of basic rights by a foreign ORG if this was necessary to attain more important goals .", "When applying LAW , LAW , of ORG , the domestic law of the expropriating ORG concerning the concrete confiscation measure had to be taken into account , as this provision was aimed at excluding litigation in GPE regarding confiscation measures based on legislation concerning enemy property .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s objections against the lawfulness , in particular under public international law , of the confiscation and expropriation of his father \u2019s property , ORG found that by virtue of LAW , LAW of ORG , NORP courts had no jurisdiction . Likewise , this provision did not allow recourse to be had to general rules of public international law or to NORP ordre public when examining the admissibility of the action . The applicant \u2019s argument that the provisions of ORG and their application to him as a national and head of a neutral ORG violated the law of peace was accordingly rejected .", "According to ORG , the painting at issue constituted external assets within the meaning of LAW , LAW , of ORG , referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s father had indisputably never had NORP nationality . However , following the case - law of ORG , it considered that the notion of \u201c NORP external assets \u201d had to be interpreted in the light of the law of the expropriating ORG . The confiscation in dispute had been found to be in compliance with the legislation of the expropriating ORG : the competent NORP administrative authorities as well as ORG had found that Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE applied to the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s confiscated property . LAW ( a ) of this decree provided for the confiscation of agricultural properties of \u201c all persons of NORP or NORP nationality \u201d irrespective of their citizenship . The notions of \u201c NORP nationality \u201d , or of \u201c NORP origin \u201d ( \u201c deutsche GPE \u201d ) , likewise used at that time , comprised as relevant elements a person \u2019s citizenship and nationality , the latter depending on the mother tongue . At the relevant time , the NORP authorities indisputably regarded the applicant \u2019s father as of NORP origin in that broader sense .", "ORG also found that the painting at issue , as part of the confiscated agricultural property , had been subject to the expropriation measure . There were no doubts as to the effectiveness of the expropriation , as it was sufficient under the relevant case - law that such expropriations had been implemented and that the previous owners had been deprived of their factual power of disposition . Furthermore , the painting had been confiscated for the purpose of reparation within the meaning of LAW , LAW CARDINAL , of ORG . The limitation of the confiscation measures to persons belonging to enemy GPE in itself justified such a conclusion . The assets of the persons concerned were confiscated as enemy assets .", "Finally , ORG considered that both the defendant and the intervener belonged to the group of persons protected by LAW , LAW , of ORG . NORP jurisdiction was excluded whenever the plaintiff intended to challenge measures within the meaning of LAW , LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , as the case was of no fundamental importance and , in any event , had no prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Third Section of the Second Division ( CARDINAL . Kammer des zweiten GPE ) of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( ORG ) , as it offered no prospect of success .", "ORG considered in particular that , for the purposes of the civil court decisions , questions as to the existence or non - existence of certain rules of customary international law on the confiscation of neutral assets or on the determination of citizenship were irrelevant as they concerned the issue of the lawfulness of the expropriation by the former GPE . The NORP civil courts had not decided this issue and , under public international law , they had not been obliged to do so . Moreover , to the extent that the civil courts had regarded the expropriation as a measure within the meaning of LAW , LAW , of LAW , they had expressly refrained from qualifying the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s nationality . Their interpretation of the terms \u201c measures with regard to NORP external assets \u201d as comprising any measures which , in the intention of the expropriating ORG , were directed against NORP assets , could not be objected to under constitutional law . The bar on litigation did not constitute an agreement to the detriment of GPE , as only GPE and its courts were under this treaty obligation .", "ORG further recalled that the exclusion of jurisdiction did not amount to a violation of the right of property as these clauses and LAW as a whole served to settle matters dating back to a time before the entry into force of LAW ) on DATE .", "Finally , there was no indication of arbitrariness or of a violation of other constitutional rights . ORG confirmed that LAW , LAW and DATE , of ORG had not been set aside by LAW on LOC with respect to GPE : while GPE obtained full sovereignty , its obligations under treaties with the Three Powers were not affected . This had also been the legal opinion of GPE and ORG , which otherwise would not have settled the suspension and termination of parts of LAW in a separate agreement .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discharged its interim injunction of CARDINAL DATE . The bailiff thereupon handed the painting over to the GPE municipality , which had it returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Bene\u0161 Decree no . CARDINAL on the \u201c confiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of NORP and NORP persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the NORP and NORP people \u201d provided for the expropriation , with immediate effect and without compensation , of agricultural property , for the purposes of land reform . It concerned agricultural property , including , inter alia , buildings and movable goods on such property , in the ownership of all persons of NORP and NORP nationality irrespective of their citizenship status .", "According to LAW said decree , those persons were to be considered as NORP or NORP nationals who , in any census since DATE , had declared to be of NORP or NORP nationality , or who had become members of national groups , formations or political parties which had been made up of persons of NORP or NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL .
