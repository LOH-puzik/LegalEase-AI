The parties disagreed as to the extent of the disruption to traffic created by the farmers\u2019 demonstrations .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , knowing that blockages were likely to occur , the police had prepared alternative road itineraries in the vicinity of the places where the demonstrations were held , so that the roadblocks would not disrupt the flow of goods . Indeed , on DATE in question the latter had been \u201c even better than usual \u201d . This could be proven by the \u201c data from posts where the roadblocks took place \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE addressed to the applicants\u2019 lawyer , ORG indicated that several queues of lorries ( ranging from CARDINAL to QUANTITY ) had formed from CARDINAL until DATE in both directions in the proximity of the Kalvarija border crossing between GPE and GPE .

The Government first observed that the GPE - Klaip\u0117da highway was the main trunk road connecting the CARDINAL biggest cities in the country , while the PERSON - Pasvalys - GPE highway ( otherwise known as ORG ) and the FAC were transitional trunk roads used to enter and leave the country . According to the Government , all CARDINAL roads were blocked at locations next to the customs post for TIME .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged , in particular , that owing to the blocking of the Kaunas - Marijampol\u0117 - Suvalkai highway , which prevented vehicles from passing through the border control station , rows of heavy goods vehicles and cars formed in GPE and GPE at the GPE border crossing . The heavy goods vehicles were forced to drive along other routes in order to avoid traffic jams . As the functioning of the PERSON customs post was disturbed , the GPE territorial customs authority was obliged to re - allocate human resources as well as to prepare for a possible re - organisation of activities with ORG and the NORP customs . As a consequence , the GPE territorial customs authority incurred additional costs ; however , the concrete material damage had not been calculated .", "CARDINAL . According to a report of the GPE police , the road was blocked on DATE . The lorries returning to GPE from GPE were directed by the police to a car park at the GPE border crossing . At TIME the lorry drivers approached the farmers . They demanded an end to the roadblocks , with the threat of using physical force . The police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down and to wait for the results of the negotiations between the farmers and the Prime Minister . According to the Government , the farmers and the lorry drivers had a few arguments , but more serious confrontations were avoided . At TIME the farmers received a telephone call about the positive outcome of the negotiations and moved CARDINAL tractor off the road . The traffic then resumed in both directions .", "CARDINAL . The Government also noted that , owing to the blocking of the GPE - Riga highway on CARDINAL DATE from CARDINAL until TIME , heavy goods vehicles could not cross the border and rows of traffic of QUANTITY respectively appeared in both directions . Cars took diversions along a gravel road .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police issued a certificate stating that on DATE the farmers had held a demonstration in the car park at the QUANTITY of the Panev\u0117\u017eys - Pasvalys - Riga highway . On DATE at around midday the farmers had gone onto the highway and had stopped the traffic . They had only allowed through passenger vehicles and vehicles carrying dangerous substances . Vehicles that carried goods and cars were allowed to go through CARDINAL at a time on each side of the road once every hour . In order to improve the situation , the police had attempted to let the traffic bypass the blockade through neighbouring villages . However , owing to the poor condition of those neighbouring roads , not all lorries that carried goods were able to drive on them and they had to remain on the highway until the farmers had left . Some lorries became stuck in sand and special machinery was necessary to pull them out . The police indicated that the farmers had unblocked the highway at TIME on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As can be seen from the documents submitted to the ORG , in DATE and DATE CARDINAL logistics companies informed the police and PERSON , ORG , that they had sustained pecuniary damage in the sum of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) as a result of the roadblocks during the farmers\u2019 demonstrations . The companies stated that they would institute court proceedings in respect of those claims .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that notwithstanding the fact that CARDINAL claim for pecuniary damage was ultimately lodged ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , CARDINAL carrier company incurred material loss owing to the disruption of traffic . As submitted by PERSON , PERSON incurred damage amounting to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) ; PERSON incurred damage amounting to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) ; and ORG incurred damage amounting to ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .

By such actions GPE had breach paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and thus committed an administrative law violation , as provided for in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government noted that the criminal proceedings against DATE were discontinued on DATE as he had not organised or provoked a gathering to seriously breach public order ; his act ( walking in the middle of the road pushing a cart in front of him ) was not considered to fall under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The Government further noted that the criminal proceedings had been discontinued on similar grounds in respect of CARDINAL other persons . In respect of a fourth person the criminal prosecution was discontinued owing to his immunity as a Member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an indictment was laid before the courts . PERSON and PERSON were accused of incitement to rioting under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor noted that PERSON had taken part in the ORG meeting of CARDINAL DATE , at which the farmers had decided to hold demonstrations near major highways on DATE and , should the government not satisfy their requests by TIME on DATE , to blockade those highways . On DATE PERSON had told the farmers to blockade the roads on DATE As a result , at CARDINAL p.m. on that date around CARDINAL farmers had gone onto the GPE - Klaip\u0117da highway . The farmers had refused to obey police requests not to stand on the road . Consequently , traffic had been blocked until TIME on CARDINAL May. Traffic jams had occurred on neighbouring roads and road transport in the region had become impossible .", "CARDINAL . With regard to PERSON , the prosecutor claimed that he had also incited the farmers to blockade the highway . As a result , at TIME on CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL people had gone onto the PERSON - Pasvalys - GPE highway , refusing to obey police orders not to block the highway . The road had remained blocked until TIME on DATE The roads in the vicinity had become clogged . The normal functioning of the PERSON border control post had been disrupted .", "CARDINAL . V.M. , GPE and GPE were accused of a serious breach of public order during the riot , under LAW . The prosecutor maintained that on DATE , at QUANTITY , CARDINAL people had gone onto the FAC at the QUANTITY . At CARDINAL p.m. the aforementioned applicants had driven onto the highway with CARDINAL tractors and had left the tractors on the carriageway . The CARDINAL applicants had refused to follow police instructions not to breach public order and not to leave the tractors on the road . The tractors had remained on the road until TIME on CARDINAL DATE . As a result , the highway had been blocked from the eighty - fourth to the QUANTITY . Due to the resulting increase of traffic on neighbouring roads , congestion had built up and road transport in the region had come to a halt . The normal functioning of the GPE and GPE border control posts had been disrupted .", "CARDINAL . Within the criminal proceedings , a logistics company brought a civil claim against PERSON , as the person who had incited the farmers to block the PERSON - Pasvalys - GPE highway , seeking damages of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for the loss allegedly incurred by it owing to the blockading of that road .", "CARDINAL . Several hearings , during which a number of witnesses testified , took place before GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kaunas ORG found the applicants guilty of having incited riots or having participated in them , under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In convicting PERSON , ORG relied on video recordings of the events , documentary evidence and the testimony of CARDINAL witness . The court concluded that PERSON had organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order , namely by rioting . PERSON had been one of the leaders of the farmers\u2019 meeting on DATE , at which the farmers had decided to attempt to achieve their goals by organising protests next to major highways . ORG noted that the second applicant had coordinated the actions of the farmers and as a consequence , on CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL people had gone to the Vilnius - Klaip\u0117da highway and had blocked it . As a result , traffic had been blocked until DATE . The ensuing serious breach of public order had been deliberate and had to be characterised as a riot . ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s claim that he and other farmers had acted out of necessity because the roadblock had been their last opportunity to draw the government \u2019s attention to their problems . The farmers had had an alternative , namely , they could have brought complaints before the administrative courts . The farmers had themselves mentioned that alternative during the meeting of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG further noted that a person who created a dangerous situation by his or her actions could only rely on the defence of necessity when a dangerous situation arose through negligence ( LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , the actions of PERSON had been deliberate and it was therefore appropriate to find him guilty of organising the riot .", "CARDINAL . ORG found it established , mainly on the basis of video recordings and documentary evidence , that PERSON had also organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order . He had taken part in the farmers\u2019 meeting of CARDINAL DATE and had known about the decision to hold protests next to the roads . When a crowd of farmers had blocked the PERSON - Pasvalys - GPE highway on CARDINAL DATE , public order had been seriously breached . Traffic had been stopped on that part of the road , causing inconvenience to drivers and goods carriers . ORG held that \u201c during the blockade of CARDINAL and CARDINAL May , PERSON coordinated the actions of the crowd , that is to say he gave orders that some of the vehicles should be let through , incited [ the farmers ] to hold on and not to move away from the highway , was in contact with the participants in the protests in GPE municipality and GPE region , [ and ] was negotiating with the authorities by mobile phone in the name of the farmers \u201d . ORG emphasised that the farmers who had gathered ( CARDINAL people ) \u201c obeyed the actions of PERSON and followed his orders \u201d . For ORG , the actions of PERSON were to be characterised as organising a riot under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of written evidence submitted by PERSON , ORG also found that by having organised the blockade of the PERSON - Pasvalys - GPE highway , PERSON had caused pecuniary damage to CARDINAL carrier companies . As CARDINAL of the carriers had submitted a civil claim for the sum of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG DATE see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG deemed it proper to grant that claim .", "CARDINAL . In finding GPE , GPE and GPE guilty of having caused a serious breach of public order during a riot , ORG , on the basis of documentary evidence , audio - visual material and the testimony of CARDINAL witnesses , established that on CARDINAL DATE between CARDINAL a.m. and CARDINAL p.m. the CARDINAL of them had driven tractors onto the FAC at its QUANTITY . They had refused to obey lawful orders by the police not to breach public order and not to park the tractors on the road ( ant va\u017eiuojamosios kelio dalies ) and had kept the tractors there until TIME on CARDINAL DATE . As a consequence , and because CARDINAL people had gathered on the road , the traffic had been blocked between the CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the FAC , traffic jams had occurred and the normal functioning of the GPE and GPE border control offices had been disrupted .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants were each given a DATE custodial sentence ( baud\u017eiamasis are\u0161tas ) . ORG also noted that all the applicants had positive characteristics and that there were no circumstances aggravating their guilt . Accordingly , there was reason to believe that the aim of the punishment could be achieved without actually depriving them of their liberty . Consequently , ORG suspended the execution of their sentences for DATE . The applicants were ordered not to leave their places of residence for DATE without the authorities\u2019 prior agreement . This measure was to last for DATE , whilst execution of the sentence was suspended .", "CARDINAL . ORG also acquitted , for lack of evidence , CARDINAL other individuals charged with organising the riots .", "DATE . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG . They noted , inter alia , that another farmer , DATE , had been punished under administrative law for an identical violation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further argued that in ORG ( hereinafter , the \u201c GPE \u201d ) member GPE , roadblocks were accepted as a form of demonstration , and that the right to demonstrate was guaranteed by ORG CARDINAL of the Convention . They referred , inter alia , to LAW ( ORG ) CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and to a report of DATE by ORG ( ORG ( CARDINAL ) on the application of that Regulation , as well as to the judgment of ORG ( hereinafter , the \u201c ECJ \u201d ) in the case of PERSON , ORG und GPE v. GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that LOC The appellate court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order , the safety of society , human health , dignity and the inviolability of property . The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal \u2013 namely , to breach public order \u2013 and the implementation of their decision which , in the instant case , had been to organise the roadblocks . To constitute an offence , the actions also had to be committed deliberately , that is to say , the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour . In relation to PERSON and PERSON , ORG observed that during the demonstrations the CARDINAL applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads . It had been established that PERSON and PERSON had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers . Even so , they had continued to coordinate the farmers\u2019 actions and had insisted that the farmers would maintain the roadblocks . As a direct result of the actions of PERSON and PERSON , on DATE a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them , thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction , causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order .", "CARDINAL . ORG also shared ORG conclusion as to the reasonableness of convicting PERSON , PERSON and GPE It noted that by driving tractors onto the highway , thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the State border control service , and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road , the CARDINAL applicants had seriously breached public order . The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers , with the result that some of the drivers had been let through , did not diminish the danger of the offence or its unlawfulness . ORG also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative law offence such as a traffic violation . As to the ORG argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer , DATE , had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation ( see paragraph DATE above ) , ORG indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence .", "CARDINAL . Whilst noting that the applicants had the right to freedom of expression under LAW , ORG nevertheless observed that such right was not without restrictions , should the interests of public order and prevention of crime be at stake . Analogous limitations to freedom of expression were listed in LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On this issue , ORG emphasised that the behaviour of PERSON and PERSON , in guiding the actions of the other individuals involved in the protest , could not be regarded as a non - punishable expression of their opinion , because they had breached public order , thus engaging criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the criminal offence had not lost its element of public danger merely because the government had refused to raise wholesale prices or had allegedly failed to take the necessary action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of an enlarged chamber of CARDINAL judges ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , dismissed the appeal . In providing an explanation as to the substance of the offence of rioting , as established in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG referred to its classification as an offence against public order , which was the objective aspect of the crime ( nusikaltimo objektas ) . In describing the scope of the offence , the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features : the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence , damaging property or otherwise breaching public order , or the commission of those actions during a gathering . For ORG , a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order , caused public violence , or damaged property . The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent ( kalt\u0117 pasirei\u0161kia tiesiogine ty\u010dia ) . The guilty person had to ( i ) be aware that he or she was performing an action that was listed as an offence in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and ( ii ) wish to act accordingly .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , ORG found that the courts below had been correct in characterising the applicants\u2019 actions as falling under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In particular , the trial court had properly established all the prerequisites for the application of LAW , namely that there had been a crowd and that public order had been breached by blocking the highways , stopping traffic and disturbing the work of the State border control service . The applicants had been sentenced for their offences under a law which had been in force at the time when they were committed and their sentences had been imposed in accordance with the provisions of LAW . It followed that the applicants\u2019 convictions had been in accordance with the law and not in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG also stated that the applicants had not been sentenced for expressing their opinion or imparting ideas , actions which were protected by the guarantees of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention , but for actions by which they had seriously breached public order .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG shared ORG view that the applicants could not be regarded as having acted out of necessity ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The fall in milk purchase prices and other problems with subsidies for agriculture had not constituted a clear or present danger to property , because the property in question had not yet materialised . The ORG had not deprived the applicants of their property , and their dissatisfaction with the government \u2019s agricultural policy had not justified the acts for which the applicants had been convicted .", "CARDINAL .
