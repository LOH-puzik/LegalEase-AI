He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and a residence permit and , on DATE , an initial interview was held with him . The applicant claimed that he had arrived in GPE that DATE and he submitted his NORP identity card . However , he did not present a passport or any travel documents . He stated that he was an ethnic NORP and had been persecuted by the NORP . CARDINAL DATE , he had been imprisoned in his home town , PERSON , and had been tortured . On DATE of his escape from prison , he had been taken by car to GPE airport and had left the country by plane DATE , via GPE and with a second stop - over at a place unknown to him .", "In the context of a comprehensive asylum investigation , the applicant appeared before ORG on DATE in the presence of his legal counsel and stated , in particular , as follows . He came from PERSON , a town in the municipality of PERSON , in the province of GPE . In DATE , because of the civil war , he and his family had fled to GPE , where they had lived in a refugee camp and he had worked as a teacher . Upon his return to GPE , in DATE , he had received an identity card and had worked for ORG . However , he claimed that he had been insulted and then dismissed because of his NORP ethnicity . DATE he had studied computer engineering at a university in GPE , in GPE , as a ORG scholarship holder . His wife and CARDINAL daughters had remained in GPE and when one of the daughters had fallen ill , he had returned . On DATE he had arrived at the airport in GPE where he had had to fill in an \u201c entry form \u201d and then his passport had been taken away from him by a man in civilian clothes . He had been told to return to collect it when he needed it , but he believed that the passport had been taken in order to prevent him from leaving the country . DATE , when he had gone to visit his parents in PERSON , he had been arrested by a person working for ORG ( hereafter \u201c the LDF \u201d ) . He had been taken to a secret prison in the countryside where , DATE , he had been insulted and hit with sticks and he had not been given anything to eat , apart from when his relatives brought him food . However , he had never been interrogated and had managed to escape after his family had bribed a guard . He had subsequently fled to GPE , via PERSON , by hiding in a pick - up truck . Relatives in GPE had arranged for him to travel to GPE since he had not dared to stay in GPE because of the presence there of high - ranking military persons of NORP nationality .", "Moreover , the applicant stated that he had never been politically active but that the NORP authorities probably thought that a NORP coming back from GPE could be capable of influencing other NORP . He had thus been called to gacaca trials ( see below under \u201c relevant background material \u201d ) , as had many others who had been to school . His father had also , several times , been summoned to the police station to be questioned about the applicant \u2019s whereabouts and his brother - in - law had fled to GPE . His brothers and sisters had been forced to leave GPE as well .", "In a written submission to ORG , the applicant , who had been given the opportunity to comment on the investigation , made certain clarifications and additions . However , he first complained that he had spent TIME on a train to get to the meeting with ORG and for this reason he had been tired and unable to prepare himself sufficiently for the interview . He then stated that the prison to which he had been taken had in fact been a normal house , belonging to a businessman . Moreover , he had been arrested when he had got off a bus to visit his brother , who since DATE had been held in the local \u201c LOC \u201d . He had never been informed of the reason for his arrest but he had been ill - treated and threatened and had also seen other persons who had been tortured and had died from their injuries . The applicant further added that , while in GPE , he had married his wife and their first child had been born there . In DATE they , together with all other NORP in the country , had been forced by the NORP military to return to GPE . However , he claimed that they had been too afraid to settle in their home town since his family \u2019s property had been confiscated by the authorities and they had therefore settled in the county town of GPE . He had nevertheless made a claim to the mayor of the municipality of PERSON to have the family \u2019s property returned . The applicant alleged that the mayor had understood the demand to mean that he was against the regime and had issued an order for his arrest . Although the mayor had left office in DATE , the applicant had remained afraid of returning because of the arrest order . Furthermore , the fact that he was a NORP and well - educated had increased the risk of his being considered as a danger to the regime and arrested . This was particularly so because he had openly expressed his discontent with the NORP regime while he had been in GPE and he was convinced that CARDINAL other NORP students there had been informers of the regime and had reported him to ORG in GPE . The applicant further submitted that he had been in contact with CARDINAL of his brothers who had recently fled to GPE and had reported that their father had been battered and interrogated about the applicant \u2019s whereabouts by the same persons who had arrested him . Thus , if forced to return to GPE , the applicant was convinced that he would be killed , seriously ill - treated or persecuted because he was a NORP with higher education who had demanded to have his family \u2019s property returned and who had escaped from a local prison . He was afraid of being sentenced by the gacaca courts . Although their task was to consider charges against people suspected of genocide , he was certain that they also convicted innocent persons whom the Government suspected of being a threat to security or of belonging to the opposition .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the Special Representative of ORG in LOC had reported that conditions in the region had developed in a positive way . Freedom of expression and political rights were respected to a larger extent and the death squads in the eastern part of GPE were no longer considered a threat to the internal security of GPE . Moreover , because it was still commonplace for people in GPE to be accused of having taken part in the genocide , whether they actually had or not , the Government had created the gacaca courts , a community - based justice system . On the basis of this , the ORG found that the general conditions in GPE were not such as to grant a right to asylum . Turning to the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , the Board observed that he had not been politically active and therefore considered that it was unlikely that the NORP authorities would suspect him of being a security risk or of working against them . If the NORP embassy in GPE had had such suspicions , he would probably have been arrested already upon his arrival at GPE airport . In view of this , it considered that the fact that his passport had been taken from him at the airport did not raise an issue . Turning to the applicant \u2019s arrest , the ORG found that he had probably been arrested because the ORG wanted to make money , since he had neither been interrogated nor accused of any offence . It further considered that the applicant \u2019s allegations that the mayor of ORG had ordered his arrest because he had demanded to have his family \u2019s property returned , were not credible as he had added it at a late stage of the proceedings . In any event , the ORG was of the opinion that it was not probable that his arrest in DATE was connected to the mayor \u2019s arrest order in DATE . If such an order had been issued , it was remarkable that he had not been arrested DATE , since he had not been in hiding but had been working and moving freely before travelling to GPE . Moreover , as regards the applicant \u2019s fear that he would be convicted by the gacaca courts , the ORG noted that there were no reports about these courts sentencing innocent people only because the regime suspected them of being a security risk or of belonging to the opposition . However , even if there were such a risk , the ORG considered that the applicant would not face a real risk of being convicted by the gacaca courts since he was not a security risk or politically active against the regime . Lastly , having regard to the fact that he had been living in GPE DATE without having any problems and that ORG was working very hard to prevent harassment attributable to the genocide , ORG concluded that the applicant would not risk persecution upon his return to GPE . ORG thus concluded that the applicant could neither be granted asylum in GPE nor granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , maintaining his claims and adducing , inter alia , the following clarifications and additional comments . When he was arrested on DATE , the arrest had been made in his home town by a person belonging to the ORG and who knew that he was PERSON and had a higher education . Moreover , his family had bribed a prison guard ( i.e. not a member of the LDF ) to release him . It was therefore probable that the LDF were still looking for him and that they had beaten his father as revenge and also threatened his brother and sister so that they had felt forced to flee to GPE . Those CARDINAL siblings had been registered as refugees by the ORG in GPE . In this respect , the applicant also claimed that another brother of his had recently died following CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment only because of his NORP ethnicity . A document was submitted in support of the alleged death . The applicant further alleged that everyone had to carry an identity card in GPE , especially NORP , as otherwise they would be considered to belong to a rebel group or an opposition party . Furthermore , as regards his passport , he had obtained it through payment of bribes and , since he was not in the ORG \u2019s register ( the register containing the names of persons suspected of having participated in the genocide ) , his name was not on any lists at airports or embassies and he had therefore been able to travel to GPE .", "The applicant stated that torture still occurred in GPE and that , during his imprisonment , he had been tortured as had many others , some of whom had died from their injuries . He gave the names of several of these persons . He was certain that his arrest had been motivated solely by his ethnicity . Moreover , in DATE , his father had been very severely battered by the police and had had to be hospitalised . He had not been able to report what had happened since the police , the prosecutors and the members of the judiciary were all NORP . In the applicant \u2019s view , although the NORP made up PERCENT of the population , they were governing the country and seeking to \u201c tutsify \u201d it . He further questioned the sources referred to by ORG , alleging that the elections in GPE in DATE had not been fair and that the country was not at all safe for ORG . The gacaca courts did not reunify the people but only created more conflicts . He invoked various reports in support of the general , poor human rights situation in GPE . He was convinced that he would be arrested upon return to his home country and the fact that he had applied for asylum abroad increased this risk even further .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , subscribing to the reasons given by ORG . It also added , inter alia , that the applicant could not be considered to have been the victim of ORG - sanctioned persecution in GPE because of his ethnicity , noting that he had been able to live in GPE for DATE prior to his journey to GPE and that he had been able to return to his home country without being arrested . ORG further found it improbable that the NORP authorities would have a special interest in him only because he had applied for asylum in GPE . In the Board\u2019Sweden and could not be granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds . He was ordered to leave the country within DATE from the date of the decision .", "On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his deportation to GPE . He alleged that he would face a real risk of being imprisoned , tortured and possibly even killed if forced to return to his home country . Moreover , he submitted CARDINAL letters . The first one , dated DATE , was from the coordinator of ORG of LOC , GPE , and stated that the LOC was willing to offer him support to resettle in GPE , provided that his case was formally referred to them by the ORG . The second letter , dated DATE , was from the Religious of PERSON , GPE , GPE , and stated that they promised to provide the applicant with sponsorship as a priority for DATE . They had an agreement with ORG which permitted them to sign commitments under which they retained responsibility for refugees during DATE in GPE .", "On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL and to suspend the deportation until the applicant had received an answer concerning the possibilities for him to go to GPE . On DATE , ORG stayed the deportation of the applicant until further notice . ORG decision is still in force .", "On DATE the ORG adjourned the case at the request of ORG following the enactment of an interim amendment to LAW , on the basis of which the applicant \u2019s case would be reviewed .", "On DATE , after having received several submissions from the applicant , ORG decided not to grant him a residence permit in GPE on the basis of the interim amendment to LAW . ORG concluded that the applicant was not in need of protection in GPE and that there were no other grounds on which to grant him leave to remain in the country .", "By letters of DATE and DATE , the ORG requested the applicant to inform it whether he had obtained permission to go to GPE .", "In a reply which arrived to ORG on DATE , the applicant stated that he would inform the ORG about the outcome of the NORP proceedings within DATE .", "The applicant then made a new request to ORG for a residence permit in GPE or , in the alternative , a student visa for DATE . He claimed that , if he was allowed to remain DATE in GPE to study , it would heal him mentally and he could then return to live and work in LOC .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request as it considered that these were no new circumstances which could constitute an impediment to the enforcement of the deportation in accordance with LAW .", "Subsequently , the applicant submitted several \u201c testimonies \u201d and letters from named NORP in confirmation of the poor human rights situation in the country , in particular for NORP and intellectuals . CARDINAL of the persons stated that he had been asked to falsely accuse the applicant of having assaulted him and another person and alleged that the applicant had been summoned by the police on DATE . This person affirmed that he had been instructed to accuse all former teachers in GPE of having taught \u201c ethnism \u201d and \u201c divisionism \u201d . Furthermore , QUANTITY persons testified that they had spent time with the applicant in prison , that they had been battered and that many people had died from the ill - treatment . CARDINAL persons claimed that they had been asked , but had refused , to give false testimony against the applicant by stating that he had taken part in the genocide . However , they alleged that many other people had given false testimonies and that , therefore , the applicant would risk being accused and convicted by the gacaca courts . CARDINAL more person , who was a NORP asylum - seeker in GPE , stated that , in DATE , he had heard people mentioning that the applicant was on the NORP authorities\u2019 list of people who were considered politically dangerous and who should be arrested . He also confirmed that the applicant had been detained without a trial .", "The basic provisions , applied in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE were laid down in the CARDINAL LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . However , LAW was superseded on DATE by a new LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslag , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Both the DATE and DATE Acts define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , of the DATE Act provided that an alien staying in GPE for DATE should have a residence permit . Such a permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , should be allowed to settle in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . For example , serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the grant of a residence permit if it was a life - threatening illness for which no treatment could be provided in the alien \u2019s home country .", "Further , under LAW , an alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to residence in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether the persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( LAW , LAW ) . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d was meant , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "An alien who was to be refused entry , deported or expelled , in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force , could be granted a residence permit if he or she filed a new application based on circumstances which had not previously been examined , and if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , LAW , or if it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce such a decision ( LAW , Section CARDINAL b ) . Regard could also be had to serious illness under this provision . Such new applications were filed with and examined by ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a refusal of entry , deportation or expulsion , account had to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "In essence , LAW did not substantially amend the above provisions , except for the following .", "Under LAW , ORG has been replaced by ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW ) . Moreover , it is no longer possible to renew applications but , instead , ORG determines , on its own initiative , whether there is any impediment to the deportation or expulsion ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Furthermore , on DATE certain interim amendments to LAW entered into force , according to which ORG , upon application by an alien or on its own initiative , could re - determine final decisions already taken by ORG . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children . The temporary provisions remained in force until the new LAW entered into force on DATE . ORG continued , however , to examine applications which it had received before that date but had not yet determined .", "GPE is a constitutional Republic dominated by a strong presidency and with a population of CARDINAL ( PERCENT NORP , PERCENT NORP and PERCENT Twa pygmies ) . In DATE , the NORP - dominated national army and its armed youth militia ( the PERSON ) , under the direction of the NORP - dominated government , began a massacre directed primarily against the minority NORP ethnic group , but also against those from the NORP majority who opposed the killing or had been active in the pro - democracy movement . The genocide , which left CARDINAL people dead , ended in DATE when the predominantly ORG ( the RPF ) overthrew the government and took power . It formed a government of ORG that functioned until DATE when , in largely peaceful but seriously marred elections , the ORG won the majority of the seats in ORG and the ORG .", "Prior to the genocide , all NORP were required to carry identity cards that indicated ethnicity , a practice that had been instituted during the NORP colonial administration . Following the genocide , the government banned all identity card references to ethnic affiliation and called for national reconciliation . They also eliminated all references to ethnicity in written and non - written official discourse as well as ethnic quotas for education , training , or government employment . The constitution provides for the eradication of ethnic , regional , and other divisions and the promotion of national unity . While some organisations and individuals have continued to accuse the government of favouring NORP in government employment , admission to professional schooling , and other matters , the government have denied this charge and there is no evidence to suggest that the government practises ethnic favouritism .", "The law prohibits \u201c any propaganda of ethnic , regional , racial , or divisive character or based on any other form of divisionism \u201d , and public incitement to \u201c divisionism \u201d is punishable by DATE in prison , heavy fines , or both . Individuals can criticise the government publicly and privately on most topics but the law discourages citizens from expressing viewpoints unacceptable to the government on sensitive subjects , as such viewpoints sometimes result in imprisonment , harassment , or intimidation under the pretext of \u201c divisionism \u201d .", "In DATE GPE received some positive comment by a peer review team of ORG for LOC ( ORG ) but was criticized for restricting political space and not recognizing diversity .", "There were reports that security forces had committed extrajudicial killings and torture , abused suspects with impunity and arbitrarily arrested and detained persons , including street children and members of other vulnerable groups . Local officials had briefly detained some individuals who disagreed publicly with government decisions or policies . Such individuals had not usually been charged and had been released after DATE in detention . Furthermore , there were reports of secret detention centres being run by security officials where individuals were detained illegally , abused and deprived of food and water . The government and police denied this but , in DATE , the ORG opened an investigation into the matter .", "Members of local communities chose community volunteers to serve in ORG ( the ORG ) , a statutorily established law - enforcement organisation under ORG that assisted police . The national police exercised tactical control of the ORG while locally appointed officials had responsibility for the operational oversight . ORG members performed basic security guard duties throughout the country , including maintaining a presence at gacaca trials , and they were ordinarily unpaid and received less training than the national police .", "Police officers and ORG members allegedly committed several unlawful killings but the government investigated these killings and reports generally indicated that the ORG members accused of killings had been arrested and charged . In DATE there were fewer reports of police officers abusing suspects at the time of arrest , and authorities dismissed or disciplined some police officers for excessive use of force .", "The government took significant steps in DATE to address human rights deficiencies and institute reforms , such as forming a unit in ORG to investigate ORG reports of official abuse and corruption . Moreover , the judiciary has demonstrated increased independence in its growing willingness to rule against the executive branch , its release of some political prisoners , and in its use of ORG to conduct investigations into judicial corruption .", "A traditional , community - based gacaca system of tribunals was established in DATE to try people suspected of crimes during the DATE genocide , in order to resolve the enormous caseload of such crimes ( however , not the most serious , so - called \u201c category I \u201d crimes , which are still tried in the ordinary courts ) . The government \u2019s stated goal for the gacaca system was to ensure that those who had participated in the genocide were brought to trial , furthering the ends of justice , ending impunity and promoting national unity . The gacaca law provides for reduced sentences including community service , for cooperation , and credit for time served .", "After a pilot phase when CARDINAL individuals were identified for prosecution for having participated in the genocide , the gacaca courts began trials nationwide in DATE . The trials have been public but there have been concerns about their fairness , among other things because of a perceived lack of impartiality and reports that defendants have not been given the opportunity to defend themselves . In addition , some courts have spent TIME hearing each case and poorly qualified , ill - trained and corrupt gacaca judges in certain districts have fuelled widespread distrust of the gacaca system . There have been reports of local gacaca officials and citizens abusing the process to pursue personal matters and settle grudges unrelated to the genocide , including making false accusations in order to acquire land . However , in some reported cases where judges had acted inappropriately , gacaca officials intervened and held that the procedure had been illegal . Moreover , \u201c Lawyers without Borders \u201d has offered training to gacaca judges . The establishment of section - level appeal courts has lagged behind , limiting the possibility of recourse for those who feel wrongly judged .", "Many NORP have not trusted the gacaca courts and have either boycotted the sessions or have attended under duress . In DATE , when the trials began , some fled to neighbouring countries in fear of being prosecuted but most of them returned to GPE DATE .", "A variety of international NGOs and CARDINAL domestic human rights groups have been operating in the country . CARDINAL of these , ORG , employed some of its CARDINAL members to conduct field investigations into alleged abuses , published its findings and discussed them with government officials . It raised concerns about false accusations in gacaca trials .", "In DATE , CARDINAL asylum seekers returned to GPE from GPE . There were no reports that these repatriates were mistreated upon their return . Also in DATE , GPE expelled more that CARDINAL NORP . The NORP government worked with ORG and other aid organisations to assist the returnees , who were resettled , and government mediators handled land disputes resulting from the number of returnees .", "It was reported that NORP nationals had not encountered any particular problems in obtaining identity cards or passports , either to leave the country or to return following exile . Corruption was not considered a problem for obtaining passports but it was expensive , thus creating an obstacle for many .", "According to ORG on NORP asylum seekers , the mere assertion of having been deprived of property before or during exile , by itself , was not sufficient to establish a refugee claim . ORG had undertaken to ensure the resolution of such cases , and some properties which had been taken by those who returned in DATE had been restored to their rightful owners . However , persons who illegally took or seized other peoples\u2019 properties in GPE are known to have falsely accused the rightful owners of involvement in the genocide when the latter have attempted to assert their property rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
