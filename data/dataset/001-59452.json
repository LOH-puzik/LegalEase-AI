DATE and CARDINAL DATE he was arrested and detained pursuant to investigations into acts of terrorism in GPE . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL arrests resulted in detention for DATE . He was never charged with any crime .", "CARDINAL . PERSON gave several written statements to his solicitors alleging physical assaults by ORG officers while in custody , including being punched in the back , punched under the chin with a clenched fist , stabbed in the throat with extended fingers , slapped in the face , having his arms wrenched back and forth repeatedly , being forced to keep a crouched position for TIME , having his head struck against a wall , and being hit and kicked in the testicles . The applicant alleged that on several occasions ORG detectives threatened to kill her son during interrogations , for example , by telling him that \u201c NORP in GPE know you now and they 'll get you \u201d .", "CARDINAL . During his detention in GPE from DATE , it was recorded that PERSON complained to a doctor that he had been ill - treated DATE this referred to the pulling of his hair and the forcing back of his fingers . The doctor reported this to the custody sergeant , who invited PERSON to make a written statement . PERSON declined to reply . He also declined to reply when the custody sergeant asked him if he would be willing to attend a police disciplinary hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON instituted proceedings against the Chief Constable of the ORG for alleged assault , battery , trespass to the person , unlawful arrest and unlawful imprisonment in respect of his detention from CARDINAL to DATE . These were discontinued by him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed that there was an attempt on PERSON life , on CARDINAL DATE , but that he managed to escape . The ORG were called but no charges were brought against a suspect for the murder attempt . When PERSON was arrested DATE , in DATE , he publicly stated that ORG officers repeatedly mentioned this murder attempt during interrogation and CARDINAL officer claimed , \u201c We wo n't miss next time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG warned PERSON twice that he was under potential threat from loyalist paramilitary groups . On DATE , a ORG detective informed him that security force documentation containing information about him , including a photographic montage , had accidentally fallen out of the back of an army vehicle . He was advised to take measures for his personal safety as there was a risk that the material had come into the hands of loyalist paramilitaries . A letter dated DATE was sent to the ORG by PERSON solicitors who requested , as a matter of urgency in order to assess the risk to his life , information relating to the documentation , including the type of information lost , dates when the information was first recorded , the exact date and under what circumstances it went missing , copies of photographs and addresses included in the files , and information in relation to the social movement and employment of persons involved in handling the files . On DATE , CARDINAL half years later , the ORG responded to this letter by stating that the police investigation was concluded and that the document had been accidentally lost by the ORG .", "On DATE , PERSON of the ORG called at Mr LOC 's home and informed him that he had received information to suggest that he was being targeted by loyalists .", "CARDINAL . The Government gave further details about the loss of the photographs . They stated that on DATE during the journey of an army patrol vehicle from FAC to Hump Vehicle Checkpoint near GPE in GPE , the rear doors of the vehicle fell open and a helmet , armoured vest and combat suit belonging to CARDINAL of the drivers fell from the vehicle . The jacket of the combat suit contained CARDINAL terrorist recognition photographic montages comprising a total of CARDINAL photographs , including some of PERSON . Upon arrival , it was discovered that the said equipment was missing and a search carried out of the route , which resulted in the recovery of the helmet . The officer responsible for the missing equipment was cautioned and interviewed by ORG about the loss of the photographic montages . He was subsequently reported and disciplinary proceedings instituted against him . The officer attended a disciplinary interview with his Brigade Commander . No formal disciplinary sanction was recorded as imposed , although the Government stated that it was possible that he received a formal rebuke which would not have been recorded . The ORG informed PERSON promptly of the loss of the photographs . There was no evidence who , if anyone , recovered the photographs or that they played any later role in events .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was stopped and questioned by ORG and GPE officers on a DATE basis . The PERSON family home , which the applicant shared with her son , was searched CARDINAL times DATE . No illegal material was ever found . According to the applicant , sometimes the ORG would not even enter certain rooms indicating that the search was not a concerted effort to locate and seize illegal material but was carried out solely to harass the family .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON was driving his van to his job when he was shot dead by a masked gunman . TIME had been fired into the van as it passed down FAC in the direction of GPE .", "The ORG ( ORG Fighters \u2013 a loyalist organisation ) later claimed responsibility for the murder in the local press .", "CARDINAL . ORG officers arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting was reported . A scene of crimes officer attended the scene and recovered bullet casings and glass samples . The scene was photographed , including the tyre impressions . These items were analysed by a member of ORG . The applicant alleged that the behaviour of the police at the scene was not consonant with any concern for her son 's life or proper police procedures , claiming that no ambulance was called to the scene and that the police prevented a priest approaching to give the last rites . The Government stated that no ambulance was called as it was apparent that an ambulance could not have assisted PERSON . When the priest arrived , he was initially asked to go to ORG before approaching the car , to enable the officers to make the necessary arrangements for the preservation of the evidence at the scene .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , a post mortem examination disclosed that PERSON had died from a bullet wound to the chest .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police attempted to identify potential eye - witnesses by speaking to all those present at the scene , conducting house to house enquiries , setting up vehicle check points and making press appeals for witnesses to come forward . They also interviewed the police officers who had been attending a road traffic accident to which personnel had been diverted shortly before the shooting occurred . The Government stated that there had been nothing suspicious in the conduct of the police in this respect . CARDINAL cars had been tasked to attend the road traffic accident at the village of GPE , it being normal practice for CARDINAL vehicle to respond due to the risk of attacks on the security forces by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the shooting , the ORG discovered a car which they believed had been used by the people involved in the shooting . However , a forensic and fingerprint examination disclosed no evidence to connect it with any person suspected of the murder . Enquiries showed that the car had been recently bought for cash by unknown persons from a private vendor .", "CARDINAL . As later revealed in the inquest , the investigating police officer believed that he knew the identity of the persons involved in the killing but had no evidence to prove it . Several suspects had been arrested and interviewed but no evidence of admission had been obtained from them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant accepted the sum of MONEY from ORG in respect of the death of her son .", "CARDINAL . An inquest into the killing was opened on DATE , CARDINAL and a half years after the murder . The ORG file had been transmitted to the Coroner on DATE . The delay in their inquiries resulted , according to the Government , from the extent of other criminal activities requiring police attention in the FAC area at that time . The inquest was further delayed to DATE pending the completion of further inquiries required by the Coroner .", "CARDINAL . No explanation was given to the PERSON family to account for the delay . During this period , the family had not known whether any murder investigation had been conducted by the police and were not provided with any indication as to the nature of the ORG 's findings , if any , as to how the applicant 's son had died .", "CARDINAL . The inquest was heard DATE , DATE and DATE . It was presided over by the Coroner who sat with a jury and was assisted by a lawyer . The ORG were represented by counsel and a solicitor .", "CARDINAL . During the inquest , the solicitor acting for the family of PERSON sought to introduce evidence in support of allegations that the ORG had prior knowledge that he was to be murdered , that the ORG had made threats against him and that the police investigation had been inadequate . This consisted of evidence from a forensic science consultant who criticised the ORG for not taking a plaster - cast of car tyre impressions found at the scene of the crime , and the oral testimony of GPE who claimed to have been told by PERSON of threats to his life made by ORG officers and who had heard such threats made by officers when he himself was in custody . When the Coroner accepted that the evidence should be admitted , the ORG Chief Constable applied for judicial review of those decisions . On DATE , ORG quashed the ORG 's decision , holding that :", "\u201c ... it is now well - settled in the jurisprudence on this topic that a ORG 's function is not , and one may say emphatically not , to conduct a wide - ranging inquiry into the broad circumstances in which a deceased has met his death . It is now clearly established by the decisions to which I have referred that the word \u201c how \u201d should receive the connotation \u201c by what means \u201d and it seems to me ... that it can not be the case that the evidence in relation to the calibre of the police investigation - the quality of the police investigation \u2013 touches upon the means by which Mr. PERSON was killed . Rather it is directly relevant to the possible criticism of the standard of the police investigation and that ... goes well beyond the scope of the inquiry of the Coroner . By the same token I consider that the evidence ... from Mr [ GPE ] ... is not germane to the question which the Coroner and the jury must decide and that is by what means the deceased met his death . Evidence has already been given without apparent challenge that the deceased was the target of loyalist terrorists before he was murdered . That evidence has not been disputed and is no way controversial and in those circumstances it appears to me that the only issue which Mr [ D.C. ] 's evidence could shed light upon is whether these threats were uttered by police officers . That , for the reasons I have already referred to , is not a matter for the Coroner 's inquest to enquire into ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Coroner refused to admit in evidence statements made by PERSON to his solicitors . The applicant stated that her original statement was edited by the ORG to exclude references to police collusion when it appeared in a Coroner 's deposition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG 's Inquest issued the verdict that PERSON had died on CARDINAL DATE on FAC in GPE from a bullet wound to the chest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant made a complaint about the conduct of the ORG at the scene of the shooting in denying PERSON access to the body and in failing to call an ambulance . This complaint was investigated by an assistant chief constable , under the supervision of ORG ( the ORG ) , as a result of which the ORG concerned was given advice which was recorded in the Divisional Discipline Book .", "CARDINAL . A Superintendent of the Complaints and Discipline Section of the ORG made attempts to investigate the allegations made by GPE that , during an interview with police , ORG officers had made threats against PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . By letter of DATE , GPE 's solicitors replied that their client would not make a statement concerning PERSON as none had been sought at the time of the incident . Attempts were made to take statements from CARDINAL other witnesses mentioned at the inquest , CARDINAL of whom agreed . The ORG officers who had interviewed GPE on DATE and CARDINAL DATE were themselves interviewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a copy of the unofficial inquiry report was sent by the applicant 's daughter to the Secretary of ORG for GPE ( see below , concerning the unofficial inquiry ) . She complained of the failure to make a plaster cast of the tyre tracks at the scene and that Constable NORP had said that he had been sent to the scene of the shooting at TIME before it had taken place . As a result , the ORG conducted further enquiries under the supervision of the ORG and the ORG subsequently reported to ORG ( the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG wrote to the applicant 's daughter and son - in - law informing them that the ORG was satisfied by the police investigation which had taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG wrote to the applicant 's daughter to inform her that Constable NORP would be spoken to about the error which he had made as to the time at which he was detailed to the scene but that no other disciplinary proceedings would be taken in respect of the matters complained of on DATE . They stated that they were satisfied with the action taken .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , having considered the results of the ORG 's further enquiries in the light of the unofficial enquiry , the ORG decided that there should be no prosecution in relation to the shooting .", "CARDINAL . A community inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the murder was organised by family and friends after the conclusion of the inquest in the hope that the whole truth about the murder could be revealed . The inquiry , conducted by the ORG and chaired by a retired GPE Judge , PERSON , heard CARDINAL witnesses over the period from DATE . The witnesses included family , local residents and friends of the deceased . Evidence was given alleging that police officers had frequently stopped PERSON in the street and issued threats , that the police warned people to keep away from him or they would end up being shot , that police officers made comments to persons in custody before the incident that PERSON would be targeted and , after the incident , claimed that they had had him killed . CARDINAL witnesses claimed that they had seen PERSON still moving after the shooting had occurred . The Judge concluded that the applicant had been murdered by ORG and , more specifically , with the collusion of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant issued a writ against the Chief Constable of the ORG and , by amendment of DATE , against ORG also . The writ was served on DATE . In the proceedings , the applicant claimed damages for loss and damage sustained by her and the estate of her son by reason , inter alia , of negligence , breach of confidence and misfeasance in public office relating to the storing , handling and use of information .", "On DATE , the defendants gave notice of intention to defend the proceedings . No further steps have been taken .", "CARDINAL . The conduct of inquests in GPE is governed by LAW ( GPE ) DATE and ORG and Procedure ) Rules ( GPE ) DATE . These provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the Coroner , who then has the power to hold an inquest , with or without a jury , for the purpose of ascertaining , with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports , inter alia , of post mortem and forensic examinations , who the deceased was and how , when and where he died .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , every medical practitioner , registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the Coroner ( section CARDINAL ) .

The forms of verdict used in GPE accord with this recommendation , recording the name and other particulars of the deceased , a statement of the cause of death ( e.g. bullet wounds ) and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death . In GPE and GPE , the form of verdict appended to the English Coroners Rules contains a section marked \u201c conclusions of the jury / coroner as to the death \u201d in which conclusions such as \u201c lawfully killed \u201d or \u201c killed unlawfully \u201d are inserted . These findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act , but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable . The jury in GPE and GPE may also append recommendations to their verdict .", "CARDINAL . However , in GPE , the Coroner is under a duty ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Prosecution of Offences Order ( GPE ) DATE ) to furnish a written report to the ORG where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed .", "CARDINAL . Until recently , legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges . Legislation which would have provided for legal aid at the hearing of inquests ( ORG , Advice and Assistance ( Northern Ireland ) Order DATE , Schedule CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL ) has not been brought into force . However , on DATE , the Lord Chancellor announced the establishment of an Extra - Statutory Ex Gratia Scheme to make public funding available for representation for proceedings before Coroners in exceptional inquests in GPE . In DATE , he published for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether applications for representation at inquests should receive public funding .

The Coroner enjoys the power to summon witnesses who he thinks it necessary to attend the inquest ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) and he may allow any interested person to examine a witness ( Rule CARDINAL ) . In both GPE and GPE and GPE , a witness is entitled to rely on the privilege against self - incrimination .

It was a decision at which no reasonable prosecutor could have arrived . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. the ORG and Others ex parte PERSON the ORG on DATE quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the ORG \u2013 that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury DATE required further explanation .", "CARDINAL . R v. ORG ex parte PERSON and PERSON ( decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) concerned the ORG 's decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner , although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death DATE there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous . The ORG reviewing the case still concluded that the ORG would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence . The Lord Chief Justice noted :", "\u201c ORG makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review : see , for example , NORP v. Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte C [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON . But , as the decided cases also make clear , the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised . The reasons for this are clear . The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by ORG to the Director as head of an independent , professional prosecuting service , answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest , and to CARDINAL else . It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the ORG , as it was here , and not by the Director personally . In any borderline case the decision may be CARDINAL of acute difficulty , since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried , a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial . If , in a case such as the present , the Director 's provisional decision is not to prosecute , that decision will be subject to review by Senior ORG Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment . The Director and his officials ( and Senior ORG Counsel when consulted ) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match . In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant , if brought , would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before ( in a serious case such as this ) a jury . This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength , by the end of the trial , of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences . It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it . So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law , on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere . At the same time , the standard of review should not be set too high , since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied . \u201d", "As regards whether the ORG had a duty to give reasons , the Lord Chief Justice said :", "\u201c It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute . Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet PERSON conditions set out above , we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of ORG to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute . But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights . It is put at the forefront of the LAW . The power to derogate from it is very limited . The death of a person in the custody of the ORG must always arouse concern , as recognised by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) , ( CARDINAL)(b ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Coroner 's Act DATE , and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the ORG that concern must be profound . The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official , the coroner , in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry ( see ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who , although not named in the verdict , is clearly identified , who is living and whose whereabouts are known , the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow . In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons , we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case : to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given , to vindicate the Director 's decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet ORG expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given . We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of ORG whose constituents have died in such circumstances . We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves . We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision . But the number of cases which meet PERSON conditions is very small ( we were told that since DATE , including deaths in police custody , there have been CARDINAL such cases ) , and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review . In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require . \u201d", "On this basis , the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the ORG in that case were in accordance with the Code for ORG Prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute . It found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute . The decision was quashed and the ORG was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute .", "DATE . In the Matter of an Application by PERSON for ORG , ORG in GPE on DATE considered the applicant 's claim that the ORG had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police . It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the ORG under the DATE Order to give reasons and considered that not duty to give reasons could be implied . The fact that the ORG in GPE and GPE had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons , whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim 's families , was a matter for his discretion . It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the PERSON case ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) would the ORG be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice PERSON ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) were infringed . Notwithstanding the findings in the civil case , they were not persuaded that the ORG had acted in such an aberrant , inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted .", "CARDINAL .

In the report on its visit to GPE and GPE from DATE , published on DATE , ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( the ORG ) reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill - treating persons . It commented , inter alia , on the statistically few criminal prosecutions and disciplinary proceedings which were brought , and identified certain aspects of the procedures which cast doubt on their effectiveness :", "The chief officers appointed officers from the same force to conduct the investigations , save in exceptional cases where they appointed an officer from another force , and the majority of investigations were unsupervised by ORG .", "It stated at paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u201c As already indicated , the ORG itself entertains reservations about whether the ORG [ ORG ] , even equipped with the enhanced powers which have been proposed , will be capable of persuading public opinion that complaints against the police are vigorously investigated . In the view of the ORG , the creation of a fully - fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development . Such a body should certainly , like the ORG , have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers . Further , in the interests of bolstering public confidence , it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the ORG for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought .", "In any event , the ORG recommends that the role of the ' chief officer ' within the existing system be reviewed . To take the example of CARDINAL ORG officer to whom certain of the chief officer 's functions have been delegated ( the Director of the FAC [ Criminal Investigations Bureau ] ) , he is currently expected to : seek dispensations from the ORG ; appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work ; determine whether an investigating officer 's report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed ; decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer 's report , and liase with the ORG on this question ; determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges ; in civil cases , negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court . It is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way .", "CARDINAL . ... Reference should also be made to the high degree of public interest in ORG [ ORG ] decisions regarding the prosecution of police officers ( especially in cases involving allegations of serious misconduct ) . Confidence about the manner in which such decisions are reached would certainly be strengthened were the ORG to be obliged to give detailed reasons in cases where it was decided that no criminal proceedings should be brought .
