GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-2", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He used to run a car rental business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed him that it had begun criminal investigations against him and CARDINAL other persons on the suspicion of insurance fraud . They were suspected of having obtained reimbursement for non - existent car rental costs and of having requested payment for non - refundable kilometres .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following ORG arrest warrant , the applicant was arrested on the suspicion that he would attempt to hinder the investigation proceedings ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the execution of the arrest warrant on the condition that the applicant cease to have contact with his co - suspects and any of the witnesses involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his co - suspects were indicted for fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG provisionally discontinued proceedings with the applicant 's consent pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) on the condition that the applicant pay a sum of CARDINAL ORG to ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had fulfilled this condition , ORG , sitting as a chamber of CARDINAL judges , permanently discontinued proceedings against the applicant but refused to grant him compensation for the time spent in detention on remand , finding that such compensation would not be equitable ( entspricht nicht der Billigkeit ) , in particular as the applicant had waived any right to compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against this decision , arguing that he had never waived his right to compensation and that compensation would be equitable , as the criminal proceedings had caused him to lose his source of income and had prevented him from finishing his law studies .", "CARDINAL . By letter to the applicant 's counsel of CARDINAL DATE , the presiding judge of the competent chamber of ORG confirmed that if the proceedings had been pursued , ORG would have opened proceedings against the applicant with regard to parts of the indictment . The applicant would then have been convicted with predominant probability ( \u201c GPE war auch mit bei weitem \u00fcberwiegender PERSON zu rechnen \u201d ) . In CARDINAL of the cases of fraud , this predominant probability was based on the submissions of another accused and of a former suspect . In another case , a conviction for fraud was to be expected following the submission of various car rental receipts ( \u201c ... war schon i m Hinblick auf die LOC diversen FAC wegen PERSON rechnen \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It noted that granting compensation for prosecution measures lay within the discretion of the competent courts or prosecuting offices . The relevant LAW ( ORG \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungs- massnahmen , see relevant domestic law below ) was to be seen as an exception to the rule - according to this provision , compensation should be granted in special cases where the execution of provisional prosecution measures was considered to be grossly disproportionate ( \u201c grob unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4ssig \u201d ) . This did not apply to the case against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the measures of prosecution instituted against the applicant were originally based on a strong suspicion ( dringender Verdacht ) . If the proceedings had continued , ORG would have opened proceedings against the applicant regarding a certain part of the indictment . ORG found that taking into account a remaining suspicion ( \u201c verbleibender NORP \u201d ) when deciding on compensation was not in violation of the right to the presumption of innocence under LAW , as it did not involve the establishment or allocation of guilt , but only constituted an admissible and necessary evaluation of the situation . Legal consequences of a non - punitive character , such as the refusal of compensation for prosecution measures , may be linked to such a remaining suspicion . This remaining suspicion , which ORG took into account when deciding on compensation , was only relevant with regard to the question of whether to open proceedings and of whether the public interest in further prosecution could be overcome . It was not relevant with regard to the actual question of guilt or the probability of a conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant 's complaint against the court decisions and the letter of ORG , finding that the principle of the presumption of innocence did not prevent the establishment and assessment of a remaining suspicion in a decision on the discontinuance of criminal proceedings before a conviction has taken place . It thus also did not prevent courts or prosecuting offices from taking this remaining suspicion into account when deciding on compensation .", "CARDINAL . The presumption of innocence prohibits imposing sanctions with a punitive or de facto punitive effect on an accused whose guilt has not been established in the relevant criminal proceedings . However , in a decision on the discontinuance of proceedings , legal consequences of a non - punitive character may be linked to a remaining suspicion , but it must become sufficiently clear from its reasoning that this does not occur out of the intention to establish or allocate guilt , but out of the intention to describe and assess the state of suspicion ( PERSON ) . This distinction had to be sufficiently expressed in the decision 's reasons . In this respect , the context of all the given reasons had to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above principles , ORG found that the impugned decisions were compatible with LAW . It noted that ORG had refused to grant the applicant compensation under LAW on the ground that if the proceedings against the applicant had been pursued , ORG would have opened court proceedings against the applicant based on parts of the indictment . This evaluation of the remaining suspicion with regard to the question of the opening of proceedings and overcoming the public interest in pursuing prosecution measures neither contained a declaration on the probability of the applicant 's conviction , nor did it contain a criminal allocation of guilt .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , criminal proceedings involving a less serious criminal offence ( PERSON ) may be discontinued subject to certain conditions and instructions ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . If the proceedings are still in the investigation phase , ORG may , with the consent of the competent court and the accused , provisionally refrain from issuing an indictment relating to an offence and may at the same time order the accused ( CARDINAL ) to take measures providing reparation , ( CARDINAL ) to pay a sum of money to a charitable association or the ORG , ( CARDINAL ) to take other measures or ( CARDINAL ) to make maintenance payments of a particular amount , if such conditions and instructions can remove the public interest in prosecution and if this is not in conflict with the seriousness of the crime ( \u201c ... PERSON , das \u00f6ffentliche ORG an der Strafverfolgung zu beseitigen , und die Schwere der Schuld nicht entgegensteht \u201d ) ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If the accused has already been indicted , the court may , with the consent of both the public prosecutor 's office and the accused , discontinue the proceedings and impose the same conditions and instructions ( Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for various prosecution measures is covered by LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In cases where an accused is acquitted or where the proceedings against him are discontinued or where a court refuses to open the proceedings against him , he is entitled to compensation for damages suffered due to time spent in detention on remand or due to other prosecution measures ( Section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the discontinuation of the proceedings is subject to the discretion of the prosecutor '", "CARDINAL . According to the case - law of ORG , cases where the proceedings have been discontinued according to LAW also fall under the scope of the above regulations ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
