POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Egidijus K\u016bris;Iulia Motoc;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant got married in GPE to GPE , a NORP national . They continued living in GPE and their son was born there in DATE . The child obtained NORP nationality at birth . It is unknown to the ORG whether he also holds NORP nationality . The family lived in the applicant \u2019s apartment . The applicant worked full time and was the sole financial provider for the family . In DATE he took CARDINAL GPE parental leave .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the family went to GPE on holiday . They agreed to return to GPE in DATE and aeroplane tickets were purchased to this end .", "The couple split up in DATE and ORG refused to return to GPE with the child . Soon afterwards the applicant went back to GPE alone . He briefly returned to GPE in DATE when his son underwent emergency surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application to have his child returned under LAW . This application was registered with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to obtain an expert report from ORG ( Rodzinny O\u015brodek Diagnostyczno - PERSON \u201c the RODK \u201d ) . The experts were ordered to assess whether there was a grave risk that the boy \u2019s return abroad would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation . A copy of this decision has not been submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and ORG were invited to appear at an interview at the RODK which was scheduled for DATE . It appears that the domestic court \u2019s decision to order the RODK report contained an instruction that the examination should go ahead whether or not the applicant was present . The applicant did not come to the appointment at the RODK . As a result , the report was based only on the statements of the child and his mother and on CARDINAL volumes of the domestic court \u2019s case file . It was prepared by CARDINAL experts in psychology and was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their report , the RODK experts took notice of the fact that for DATE the child ( who was DATE at the time of the psychological examination ) had lived away from and almost without any contact with his father . They also observed that the child had a strong emotional bond with his mother ; he was developing well and spoke NORP ; and that ORG had ensured the child \u2019s security , well - being and development .", "CARDINAL . NORP The experts concluded that \u201c the child \u2019s separation from his mother would disturb his sense of security , belonging and stability , and [ that ] it would be adverse to his development \u2013 in particular , psychological [ development ] \u2013 [ and ] it would be against his best interests . In view of the above , moving the child to his father \u2019s care [ posed ] a grave risk to his emotional [ and ] social development , [ and ] could cause a situation [ which ] for a DATE child [ would be ] difficult to bear . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Apart from the RODK report , the domestic court obtained the following evidence : testimony from the applicant , ORG and the members of both families and medical reports .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with Judge PERSON presiding , dismissed the applicant \u2019s FAC application ( IIRNsm CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court held that the child had been wrongfully retained in GPE by his mother within the meaning of LAW . It also considered that , in line with LAW , the interim orders concerning the issues of custody over the child and his residence which had been granted by the NORP and NORP family courts ( see paragraphs DATE , DATE and DATE below ) were viewed as irrelevant to the case at hand .", "CARDINAL . NORP The district court also considered that the RODK report was thorough , clear and of a high evidentiary value . Relying on the report and the remaining evidence , the family court established that since his birth the child had been under the constant good care of his mother ( who had not worked in GPE ) . The child had a strong emotional bond with the mother , did not remember the applicant and did not perceive him as a parent . The applicant did not show any interest in the child . Since DATE , he had seen his son only once , in DATE , despite the fact that he had been in GPE for DATE . He had also stopped paying child support and had not shown any interest in him . The domestic court also made an additional observation that the applicant had sold his apartment in GPE and it was unknown if his new living conditions were adequate for his DATE child to move into .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above it was ultimately held that separating the DATE boy from the mother and returning him to his father in GPE would be traumatic and hard to bear for the child . This , in turn , would pose a threat to the child \u2019s emotional and social development and would perturb his sense of security and stability .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the first - instance court had erred in that , inter alia , it had given a broad and not restrictive interpretation of LAW ( b ) of LAW and had dismissed his application even though it had not been established that the child was at a grave risk of physical or psychological harm if returned to GPE . The applicant also challenged the RODK experts\u2019 report , arguing that it was unconvincing and inconsistent with the evidence obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( II Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) dismissed the appeal in the relevant part .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court observed that international and domestic practice required that LAW ( b ) be given a restrictive reading to the effect that , in principle , any unfavourable consequences of the child \u2019s separation stemming from the order to surrender the child by the abducting parent did not give rise to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm within the meaning of that provision . It also noted that the aim of LAW would be achieved if the abducting parent returned with the child . If no objective obstacles to the abducting parent \u2019s return were present , it could be inferred that the parent was refusing to return and was acting in his or her own interest and not the interest of the child .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court reasoned that the application of the abovementioned principles was more complex in cases concerning very young children . LAW stipulated only a maximum age requirement for children whose return could be sought under its provisions ( DATE ) . It also protected ( under LAW ) very young children from possible harmful effects of the return if it was shown that the parent seeking the return had not taken care of the child before the abduction or that the child had already adapted to the new environment . Following this approach , separating an abducted child from the parent who had a dominant role in the child \u2019s life would not fall within LAW ( b ) exceptions unless objective obstacles to the parent \u2019s return could be shown to be present . This approach however , was difficult to accept in cases concerning abductions of infants by mothers because of the special relationship between them . This was true even in the absence of any objective obstacles to the mother \u2019s own return because any separation of an infant from his or her mother would inevitably be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court held that the utmost importance had to be attached to the child \u2019s contact with his mother and his separation from her would place the boy in an intolerable situation . The domestic court relied on the following elements of the case : the applicant \u2019s son had arrived in GPE with both parents at DATE , in DATE ; since then the child had been taken care of solely by his mother ; the most important element in his life was his contact with the mother ; he did not have any memories of his life in GPE ; and the applicant had not considered the child \u2019s remaining in GPE illegal prior to DATE . The appellate court also observed that by not appearing at the RODK interview , the applicant had waived his right to demonstrate that he could establish adequate contact with his young child and that the applicant had only seen his child once since the latter \u2019s departure from GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant has visited his son once , in DATE during a DATE stay in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , he had made countless attempts to see his son . In particular , he had applied to the courts to have a meeting with his child away from ORG house on DATE and on an unspecified date in DATE . Copies of these applications have not been submitted to ORG .", "In the ORG \u2019s submission , the applicant had not enquired about or sought contact with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the competent domestic court for arrangements to be made to secure the effective exercise of his right of contact during the Hague Convention proceedings . He wished to meet with his son away from ORG house DATE before and on DATE of the court hearing . He submitted that he had not seen his child since DATE and that the child \u2019s mother and grandparents had been very hostile towards the applicant when he had tried to visit his son at home . The applicant submitted that the application had been made under LAW . A copy of this application has not been submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with ORG as the presiding judge , decided to return the application for an interim order on the right of contact as unsubstantiated . It was considered that the applicant had not demonstrated that the child \u2019s mother , apart from her allegedly hostile attitude , had obstructed his contact with the child . The domestic court relied on the applicable provisions of LAW and did not make any reference to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated without submitting a copy of the relevant document that on DATE the domestic court had decided to grant him a right to a supervised visit with his son for TIME daily in ORG house . The applicant had been in GPE at that time and thus had not exercised his right .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted that on DATE the appellate court had dismissed his request , presumably for a different schedule of his visits . A copy of this decision is not in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the NORP family court granted the applicant a right to contact with his child . The details of this decision are unknown to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision , presumably concerning the applicant \u2019s right of contact with his son ( IC CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . A copy of this decision has not been submitted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against this decision . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer completed this appeal by submitting that ORG had been hindering the father \u2019s right of contact which he had tried to enforce in line with the court \u2019s order . The outcome of these proceedings is unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON petitioned for divorce in GPE . Divorce proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave an interim order , establishing the child \u2019s residence as being with the mother . It appears that the applicant participated in the court hearing via a live video link . He refused to answer any questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE held that the child \u2019s retention in GPE was wrongful and issued an interim order granting full custody of the child to the applicant , authorising him and the law - enforcement authorities to apprehend the child and ordering ORG to surrender the child without delay . To this effect , a wanted notice for ORG was issued by ORG for the offence of kidnapping .", "ORG appeal against this ruling was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found ORG to be in contempt of court for , inter alia , failing to comply with the interim order described above . No sentence was pronounced on that occasion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the interim decision of DATE , granting a final order of the applicant \u2019s exclusive custody of the child . The NORP court also requested the assistance of the NORP courts in securing the immediate apprehension and return of the child pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL .
