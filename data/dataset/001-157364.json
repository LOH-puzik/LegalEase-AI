NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was abducted by masked persons . Under the threat of killing him and his daughter they obliged the applicant to sign a document on transfer of his share in a business company . He was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After his release the applicant contacted ORG of ORG in ORG . He was heard several times by that authority . Subsequently the case was transferred to ORG which heard the applicant again . These interviews included those on DATE and DATE . In both , the applicant submitted that , during the incident , amounts of money in various foreign currencies had been taken away from him . In addition , in the latter questioning , he submitted that , by the forced transfer of his business share , he had suffered damage worth the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) and that he wished to join the criminal proceedings as an aggrieved party under LAW . , as applicable at the relevant time \u2013 \u201c the DATE ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . The interview of DATE followed the opening by ORG of a criminal investigation DATE into the suspicion that the offences of extortion and unlawful restriction of personal liberty might have been committed by CARDINAL or more persons unknown .", "CARDINAL . DATE the police authority stayed the investigation and ORG ( \u201c the PPS \u201d ) at several levels ordered that it be resumed on several occasions . In DATE the case was transferred to ORG ( \u201c the OCOC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL persons , A. and PERSON , were charged with extortion and restricting the applicant \u2019s personal liberty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned by the investigator . He submitted that , in terms of compensation , he claimed ORG CARDINAL in respect of the business share and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of the foreign currency taken away from him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings against B. were terminated as her prosecution had become statute barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were split in CARDINAL parts . The first set of proceedings concerned PERSON , who was suspected of having ordered and organised the applicant \u2019s abduction . The second set aimed at identification of the persons who had abducted the applicant . Those proceedings were stayed on CARDINAL DATE but then resumed following an order by the PPS of DATE . They are still pending before the OCOC .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in the first set of proceedings , on DATE charges of extortion and restricting personal liberty had been brought against another individual , C.", "CARDINAL . On DATE and C. were indicted to stand trial in ORG on the charges mentioned above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings . It observed that the police and the investigative authorities had generated such delays at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings that much of the evidence had lost validity . There had been repeated unlawful and arbitrary actions by these authorities such as , for example , the discontinuation of the proceedings against B. but not against the other defendants . As a result , there was no valid evidence showing that GPE and C. had committed the offences of which they stood accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the matter to ORG for a new determination , following appeals by the applicant and the PPS .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He alleged , inter alia , that the ORG and several offices of the PPS involved in the above proceedings had breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded .", "With reference to LAW . , as amended - \u201c the DATE ORG \u201d - see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) , it held that a person who considers to have suffered damage as a result of a criminal offence may claim to be a victim of a breach of his or her right to a hearing within a reasonable time only after charges of that offence have been brought against a specific person .", "ORG therefore had the power to examine only the proceedings subsequent to the bringing of charges against GPE and NORP on DATE . As the applicant \u2019s complaint was only concerned with the pre - trial phase of the proceedings , the period under examination ended on DATE when the case was transmitted to ORG by way of the indictment . The period under consideration had therefore lasted DATE and DATE which was not excessively long . In support of this conclusion , ORG observed that except for CARDINAL fourmonth period of inactivity the investigator had been acting expeditiously .", "The decision was served on the applicant DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL provide , inter alia , that an aggrieved party in criminal proceedings may attach a third - party claim for damages to the proceedings and request that the court convicting the person charged with a criminal offence ( obvinen\u00fd ) order the latter to pay compensation for the damage caused to the aggrieved party by the offence .", "CARDINAL . According to a summary of the relevant judicial practice published in ORG and Standpoints ( ORG s\u00fadnych rozhodnut\u00ed a stanov\u00edsk ) of ORG under no . DATE , a thirdparty claim for damages is properly made if it specifies the defendant against whom it is made , the ground on which it is made , and its amount .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , the DATE ORG was entirely replaced by DATE . In so far as relevant , the DATE Code contains provisions ( LAW ) similar to those of the DATE ORG .", "CARDINAL . A third - party claim must specify the ground and scope of the claim and may only be attached to the criminal proceedings if the matter of compensation has not already been decided upon in civil or other proceedings ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , where a court convicts a person charged with an offence which has caused damage to third persons within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , as a rule it orders him or her to compensate such damage , provided that the claim has been filed correctly and in due time .", "CARDINAL . ORG held ( see for example its judgments in cases nos . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG ) that a third party who joined criminal proceedings with a claim for damages has the right to a hearing \u201c without unjustified delay \u201d ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ) as such a duly lodged claim excludes the possibility of having it decided upon in civil proceedings ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE in case no . II . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , relying on its previous decisions nos . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , III . GPE DATE , III . GPE GPE , III . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG upheld the principle that , in accordance with the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , an aggrieved party of a criminal offence , who had attached a third - party claim for damages to the criminal proceedings , was entitled to the guarantees of the civil limb of LAW . However , the aggrieved party only benefited from the right to a hearing within a reasonable time under LAW after a charge had been brought against a specific person . Despite a direct argument by the complainant to that effect , ORG gave no answer to the fact that in its judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) , the ORG had found that , as a matter for principle , civil - party claims for damages made in GPE jointly with or subsequently to the lodging of a criminal complaint enjoy the guarantees in question from the moment they were made .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the present application , ORG produced a report dated DATE concerning the applicability of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time under LAW and its constitutional equivalent to third - party claims for damages attached to criminal proceedings ( adh\u00e9zne konanie ) . The report may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . A party aggrieved by a criminal offence may attach a third - party claim for damages to the criminal proceedings concerning that offence under LAW CCP ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . above ) . Neither the statue nor the case - law of ORG make this right dependant on whether or not the defendant has been charged with the offence in question . However , it is only once a charge is brought against a specific person that a concrete legal relationship is created between the aggrieved party and the person charged and it is only then that the aggrieved party becomes entitled to assert the third - party claim against the charged person in the criminal proceedings .", "Whether or not a person has been charged with the offence concerned is not a criterion for the aggrieved party \u2019s being able to make a third - party claim in the criminal proceedings but for that party \u2019s being able to rely on the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in relation to that claim ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
