CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , together with her husband , acquired a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in GPE . After her husband \u2019s death in DATE the applicant became the sole holder of the specially protected tenancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) , which regulates the sale of publicly - owned flats previously let under specially protected tenancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to visit her daughter who lived in GPE . She intended to stay with her daughter for DATE . She locked the flat in GPE and left all the furniture and personal belongings in it . She asked a neighbour to pay the bills in her absence and to take care of the flat . However , by DATE , the armed conflict escalated in GPE , resulting in severe travel difficulties in that area , including the town of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP authorities stopped paying the applicant \u2019s pension . The payments were resumed in DATE . The applicant also lost the right to medical insurance . In these circumstances , the applicant decided to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the town of GPE was exposed to constant shelling and the supply of electricity and water was disrupted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a certain PERSON , with his wife and CARDINAL children , broke into the applicant \u2019s flat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ) brought a civil action against the applicant before ORG ( PERSON ) for termination of her specially protected tenancy on the flat in question . GPE claimed that the applicant had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions to the court , the applicant explained that she had been forced to stay with her daughter in GPE from DATE until DATE . She had not been able to return to ORG since she had no means of subsistence and no medical insurance and was in poor health . Furthermore , during her stay in GPE , she had learned from the neighbour that PERSON had broken into her flat with his family . When she had enquired about her flat and her possessions in the flat , PERSON had threatened her over the telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s specially protected tenancy . The court established that the applicant had left GPE on DATE and had not returned until DATE . It stated that in the relevant period no order had been issued to the citizens of GPE to evacuate the town owing to the escalation of the armed conflict but that it had been the personal decision of every citizen whether to leave the town or to stay . On that basis the court found that the applicant \u2019s absence was not justified by the war in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court did not accept the applicant \u2019s explanation that she had fallen ill during her stay in GPE and was not able to travel . It was established that the applicant had suffered from spinal arthrosclerosis and diffuse osteoporosis for a long time , which had not affected her ability to travel . Even though her left shoulder had been dislocated on DATE , she had been able to travel following the immobilisation of the injured joint . Furthermore , by DATE she had already been absent from the flat for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further explanation that she had stopped receiving her pension in DATE and thus had been left without any means of subsistence was not accepted by the court as a justified reason for not returning to ORG . It took the view that the applicant \u2019s daughter could have sent her money . Therefore , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s reasons for not having lived in the flat were not justified .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicant against the judgment , it was quashed by ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) on DATE . ORG found that the court of first instance had not taken into careful consideration the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , namely her age and poor health , the fact that she had lost her pension and the fact that she had lived alone in GPE without any close relatives . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s decision to prolong her stay in GPE should have been carefully assessed against the background of objective circumstances , namely that ORG had been exposed to DATE shelling and had not had a regular supply of water or electricity in the material period , and that third persons had occupied the applicant \u2019s flat . The case was remitted to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG ruled again in favour of the municipality and terminated the applicant \u2019s specially protected tenancy . It observed that she had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason and repeated in substance the findings of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the municipality \u2019s claim . It found that the escalation of war and the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , as described above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , justified her absence from the flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE filed a request for revision on points of law ( revizija ) with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request for revision and reversed ORG judgment . It found that the reasons submitted by the applicant for her absence from the flat were not justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant part of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c In the period of the aggression against GPE , living conditions were the same for all citizens of GPE and , as rightly submitted by the plaintiff , it is neither possible nor legitimate to separate the defendant \u2019s case from the context of that aggression . Holding the contrary would mean assessing her case in a manner isolated from all the circumstances which marked that time and determined the conduct of each individual .", "Contrary to the appellate court \u2019s opinion , this court , assessing in that context the defendant \u2019s decision not to return to ORG during the aggression but to stay in GPE , considers the non - use of the flat unjustified . The factual findings made in the case reveal that , in view of her health condition and the available travel connections , the defendant was able to come to GPE ; her health would not have deteriorated because of her stay in GPE ; and she could have taken care of herself . The assumption that she would have had to make a considerable mental and physical effort in order to provide for her basic living needs ( all the residents of GPE who remained in the town , from the youngest to the oldest , were exposed to the same living conditions ) does not justify her failure to return to ORG and , accordingly , does not constitute a justified reason for the non - use of the flat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) . She claimed that her rights to respect for her home and property had been violated and that she had been deprived of a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that ORG had correctly applied the relevant legal provisions to the factual background established by the lower courts when holding that the applicant \u2019s absence from the flat for DATE had been unjustified . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the DATE LAW ( Ustav PERSON , ORG nos .
