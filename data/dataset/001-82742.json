{"ITEMID": "001-82742", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF OSINSKI v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Gda\u0144sk .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery . On DATE the ORG remanded him in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery . It held that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant might abscond and attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimonies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It found that the prolongation was justified by the need to obtain and secure evidence from many sources and interrogate a number of other persons who could be charged together with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . It found that it was highly probable that he had committed the offence in question . It also relied on the need to obtain various expert reports . Lastly , it held that the severity of the anticipated penalty justified the prolongation of the applicant 's detention .", "CARDINAL . Later , several other persons were detained and charged in connection with the same investigation conducted by ORG . The applicant was charged with the commission of CARDINAL robberies and armed robberies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be kept in custody pending investigation until DATE . It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged . In that respect , it referred to evidence given by ORG , a member of the same criminal group , who acted as a witness against the other suspects . ORG further relied on the need to obtain and secure evidence , in particular from experts in ballistics , biology and fingerprints . It stressed that it was also necessary to carry out a reconstruction of the crime and to confront the suspects with each other . It also considered that the scale and nature of the offences in question justified the applicant 's continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention pending investigation DATE which had meanwhile exceeded the DATE time - limit set for detention pending the investigation under LAW until DATE . It considered that the case was \u201c particularly complex \u201d given the volume of evidence and the number of charges against the numerous suspects . It also held that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and other suspects might obstruct the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that that term should be prolonged further until DATE . It reiterated the previous grounds given for the applicant 's detention and added that the case was very complex , given that CARDINAL further suspects had in the meantime been charged and detained in the case and that several other potential suspects were still being sought .", "CARDINAL . Further prolongations of the applicant 's detention pending the investigation were ordered by ORG on DATE ( up to DATE ) and DATE ( up to CARDINAL DATE ) . In its decision of DATE , ORG reiterated the original grounds given for his detention . Taking into account the nature of the offences , ORG added that the fact that the charges against all CARDINAL suspects were closely interrelated gave substance to the risk that , once released , they might obstruct the proceedings . It also referred to the particular complexity of the case . Furthermore , it noted that the prolongation of the investigation was due to the fact that new suspects had been identified in the course of the investigation . In its decision of DATE , ORG added that the prolongation of detention was justified by the need to obtain DNA evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of armed robbery which had been committed in an organised armed criminal group . The bill of indictment specified that the applicant was subject to the rules on recidivism . It listed CARDINAL charges brought against CARDINAL defendants , who were all detained on remand . The case file comprised CARDINAL volumes . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The trial began on DATE . However , as of DATE the reading out of the bill of indictment by the prosecution had still not been concluded . Initially , the trial court held CARDINAL hearings per month .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention several times . The relevant decisions were given on DATE ( extending his detention up to DATE ) , DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( prolonging that period until DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( extending his detention until DATE ) , DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) , CARDINAL DATE ( extending that term until DATE ) , DATE ( extending that term until DATE ) , DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , DATE ( extending that period until DATE ) and DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In all those decisions ORG considered that the original grounds given for the applicant 's detention were still valid . It stressed that the applicant 's detention was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings in such a particularly complex case , given the nature of the charges , the number of defendants and the connections between them . In addition , it referred to the volume of evidence to be heard .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE prolonging the applicant 's detention , ORG considered that the trial could be terminated by DATE . In addition to the grounds previously invoked , it found that the prolongation of detention was justified under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the particular complexity of the case . It further observed that the delays in the trial were partly attributable to some of the defendants who had attempted to disrupt the proceedings and , consequently , had to be removed from the court room . It instructed the trial court to hold CARDINAL hearings per month . Furthermore , it held that no other preventive measure could secure the proper conduct of the trial . In that respect , ORG observed that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant and other defendants might interfere with the proceedings , given the nature of the charges , the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that such attempts had been made in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's and his CARDINAL co - defendants ' request for the judges and lay members of the trial court to withdraw .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE extending the applicant 's detention , ORG observed that the trial could not be terminated due to obstructiveness of the defendants who had filed numerous requests challenging the trial court . It further observed that although the applicant and other defendants were free to make use of their procedural rights , the abuse of those rights had undoubtedly led to delays in the trial . It also noted that the trial court had taken various procedural steps in order to accelerate the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision on the applicant 's detention of DATE , ORG observed that up to DATE the main reason for the delays during the trial was the obstructiveness of the defendants and the abuse of the rights of the defence . It also observed that the trial could be concluded by DATE provided that ORG endeavoured to organise the trial efficiently .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE dismissing the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE prolonging his detention , ORG held that LAW established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce him to obstruct the proceedings . It added that the risk of absconding or tampering with witnesses which existed in the present case did not have to be supported by concrete facts , but resulted from the above presumption .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG again referred to the presumption established by LAW . In its decision of DATE dismissing the applicant 's appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE prolonging his detention , ORG held that that presumption alone justified the applicant 's continued detention . It also held that keeping the applicant in custody was necessary in order to prevent him from interfering with the trial , given the reasonable risk of such interference which flowed from the fact that he had been charged with the commission of the offences in an organised criminal group .", "CARDINAL . During the trial the applicant filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed , likewise unsuccessfully , against the decisions prolonging his detention . He maintained that the length of his detention was excessive and that the charges against him lacked a sufficiently strong basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made a severance order with a view to expediting the proceedings , and thereafter CARDINAL defendants ( ORG , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , who in the meantime had been released , were to be tried separately .", "CARDINAL . After DATE no hearing was held due to the serious illness of the judge rapporteur . On DATE the President of the Criminal Section IV of the ORG assigned a new judge rapporteur . Consequently , the trial had to commence de novo .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . The applicant appealed against that decision . On DATE a different panel of ORG quashed the impugned decision and ordered the applicant 's release under police supervision . It also imposed on him a prohibition on leaving the country . ORG had regard to the fact that the trial had to commence de novo and that the applicant had already spent DATE in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court made a further severance order and split the case into CARDINAL separate cases .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the trial court had held CARDINAL hearings of the CARDINAL which had been scheduled . It heard CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the proceedings are still pending before the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed with ORG a complaint about a breach of his right to a trial within a reasonable time and asked for compensation . He relied on CARDINAL of the LAW DATE on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the charges against all the defendants had been unjustifiably joined in CARDINAL set of proceedings . He claimed that numerous hearings had been cancelled and that the process of taking evidence from witnesses had been lengthy . He also submitted that he had been detained on remand throughout the proceedings and that his applications challenging the trial court had been made in accordance with the provisions of criminal procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint as unfounded , having regard to the criteria set out in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , namely the conduct of the court and of the parties , the nature of the case , its factual and legal complexity and what was at stake in the proceedings for the complainant .", "CARDINAL . Replying to the applicant 's submissions , ORG held that the joint examination of the charges against the defendants who had collectively committed a crime was justified under the domestic law . Furthermore , it considered that it could not be said that the exceptional cancellations of some hearings pointed to inactivity on the part of the trial court , bearing in mind the number of hearings held and the fact that they had been scheduled in advance .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the applicant 's complaint relating to the allegedly lengthy process of taking evidence from witnesses was unsubstantiated . It pointed out in this respect that the trial court had disciplined the witnesses who had failed to comply with the summons . The court further held that the defendants had contributed to the length of the proceedings by multiplying their applications in respect of procedural issues that had already been determined . It found that the fact that the applicant had been remanded in custody was not a relevant consideration for the determination of his complaint concerning the allegedly excessive length of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , having regard to the nature of the case and its complexity , ORG held that delays in the proceedings could not be attributed to the trial court . On the contrary , the trial had been conducted in a diligent manner .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice regarding the imposition of detention on remand ( tymczasowe aresztowanie ) , the grounds for its prolongation , release from detention and rules governing other , so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) at the material time are stated in the ORG 's judgments in the cases of ORG v.
