On DATE the ORG first - instance court issued an order notifying the applicants of the arbitration committee 's decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against the arbitration decision with the ORG court . In their opinion the experts had underestimated the value of their farmland and omitted to place a value on a quarry located on the land .

In their opinion they were entitled to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP BRISA also challenged the arbitration value , which they considered too high .

They challenged the basis used before the ORG court to calculate the court tax ( which they claimed should have been that stipulated in LAW ) , as well as the legitimacy of being required to pay anything at all in respect of costs and expenses ( custas de parte ) to BRISA , which , as a ORG enterprise , was exempt from paying court fees .", "CARDINAL .

Concerning access to a court , it pointed out that while excessively high court fees could in some circumstances be an obstacle to access to a court , this was not the case in this instance as the applicants had been required to pay only LAW , a sum it considered reasonable . On the subject of fair compensation , ORG found that compensation for the loss suffered as a result of expropriation was quite unrelated to the matter of court fees , and that there was accordingly no reason why court fees should not exceed the sum awarded in compensation .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE court fees are likened to taxes . ORG considers that the obligation for litigants to pay court fees is the same as the obligation for taxpayers to pay taxes .

Under LAW as applicable at the material time , they included the sums the successful party had been obliged to spend in connection with the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new Court Fees Code was introduced ( Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The explanatory memorandum includes the following passage :", "\u201c According to the new scale , the court tax is not calculated simply on the basis of the value in dispute . It has been found that the sum in dispute is not a decisive factor in assessing the complexity of the proceedings or in the costs generated for the legal system . The search for a better way to calculate the court tax has led to the establishment of a mixed system based on the value in dispute up to a certain limit , with the possibility of correcting the amount where the proceedings are complex , independently of the economic value considered to be at stake . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the new system there is therefore an upper limit on the amount that can be charged in court fees . At present , for proceedings at first instance , that amount equals CARDINAL units of account for ordinary proceedings or CARDINAL units of account if the proceedings are particularly complex . The charge for appeals is CARDINAL units of account . Applications made during the proceedings continue to be taxed , of course , at a rate of CARDINAL units of account , depending on the type of application ( see tables appended to Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of that text ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG undertook a comparative law study concerning the payment of court fees in a number of member ORG .", "CARDINAL . The study revealed that , generally speaking , the court fees charged vary according to the sum claimed ( except in countries where fees charged are not based on the sum in dispute ) . The fees may represent a percentage of that sum , a lump sum , or a combination of the CARDINAL . In many GPE where the fees charged are linked to the value of the claim , there is an upper limit on how much one party can be charged , but in some GPE there is no such limit .", "CARDINAL . In general the unsuccessful party is required to pay the costs of the other party . Where a claim is allowed only in part , most of the GPE covered by the study leave it to the discretion of the courts to decide who pays what fees . In GPE special rules apply to expropriation proceedings . In CARDINAL such ORG , for example , when fees are calculated as a percentage of the compensation offered , the principle is that the expropriated owner must nevertheless be repaid in full ; in other words , all the costs effectively incurred by that party must be reimbursed , as he normally has a right to full reparation for the prejudice suffered .", "CARDINAL . In many GPE there is no guarantee that a complainant will not be charged costs and expenses in excess of the sum likely to be awarded in respect of his claim , especially when only a small part of the claim is allowed . No such risk exists in those GPE where court fees are calculated only at the end of the proceedings and based on the sum effectively awarded by the court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
