It provided that building permits for temporary constructions had a validity of DATE . LAW was repealed by LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which made the same provision for the validity of building permits in relation to temporary constructions .", "On DATE the ORG ( Policia DATE \u201c the DCP \u201d ) decided to institute administrative proceedings against the applicant for alleged breaches of the DATE Act \u2019s provisions . Consequently , on DATE the ORG found that the DATE validity period of the applicant \u2019s building permit had been considerably exceeded , in violation of LAW . It also found that it was located on a green public area in breach of LAW . Finally , the ORG ordered the demolition of the applicant \u2019s construction .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant filed a motion against the ORG \u2019s decision with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) \u2013 the highest competent administrative body .

Moreover , the applicant requested compensation for pecuniary loss in respect of the caf\u00e9 - bar \u2019s equipment , which amounted to CARDINAL NORP leks ( MONEY ) .", "On DATE ORG held that the demolition order was lawful in so far as the applicant had failed to apply to the competent authority for renewal of the building permit to erect a temporary construction .

He claimed that his premises had been erected on the strength of a temporary building permit which did not stipulate the period of validity . Consequently , he had been a bona fide owner and user of the caf\u00e9 - bar throughout this time . The applicant alleged that ORG had overstepped its powers in that they had acted in the place of ORG as regards the issuance of a demolition order for the LOC . The applicant also submitted that the lower courts had not examined whether the demolition order had been duly served on him .
