Hermeli\u0144ski , Counsel", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and her brother are co - owners of a house . The applicant lives on the first floor and her brother on the ground floor . In DATE the applicant complained to the local police that her brother had been harassing her and trying to coerce her , by disconnecting the heating system of her apartment , into agreeing to certain alterations in the house .", "On DATE the ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant \u2019s brother which had been instituted at the applicant \u2019s request . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision . Subsequently , the applicant complained to ORG , alleging that there had been serious deficiencies in the investigations .", "In DATE policemen from the local station kept coming to the applicant \u2019s apartment , often as TIME , to question her about the dispute with her brother . On DATE the applicant complained thereof to the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s brother submitted a complaint to the local police station that the applicant had cut off the electricity in his apartment . On the same date the police took steps to contact the applicant .", "On DATE she came to ORG and requested the Chief Regional Officer to explain the reasons for her being harassed by the Police .", "On DATE at TIME CARDINAL policemen and the electricians from the local electricity station , having stated that there was no electricity in the applicant \u2019s brother apartment , made an unsuccessful attempt to visit the applicant \u2019s apartment .", "In a letter of DATE the ORG informed the ORG of the results of the inquiry into the applicant \u2019s complaint about the alleged deficiencies in the criminal investigations against her brother , which had been discontinued in DATE . It was stated in this letter that , in order to establish relevant facts , the applicant herself should have been given an opportunity to give evidence in those investigations . The purpose of the investigations had erroneously been limited to establishing whether her brother had forged her signature on certain documents relating to their property , even though there had been ample evidence to support coercion charges against him , in particular as he had cut off the heating system of the applicant \u2019s apartment . ORG stressed that throughout the investigations the applicant \u2019s requests that certain evidence be taken had been disregarded without any justification . In conclusion , ORG ordered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant \u2019s brother be resumed in order to remedy these shortcomings .", "On DATE the police instituted investigations concerning the complaint submitted by the applicant \u2019s brother on DATE and relating to charges of coercion committed by cutting off the electric current in his apartment . On DATE CARDINAL policemen came to the school where the applicant worked and tried to serve on her a summons to the police station for DATE . She refused to accept it and requested that it be sent to her by post .", "On DATE a hearing in civil proceedings between the applicant and her brother was held in the ORG . At TIME , as the applicant was leaving the court building , she was arrested by CARDINAL policemen , CARDINAL in plainclothes and CARDINAL in uniform . She was subsequently asked to accompany them to the police car . The applicant refused to comply , whereupon she was warned that coercive measures would be used if she persisted in her refusal . The applicant said that she would not obey and tried to walk away . Upon her arrest she was hit several times , pushed and jostled , and pushed out of the court building . The policemen caught her by both hands and brought her to the police car , parked nearby . The applicant resisted arrest by trying to get away , kicking and crying . After she was brought to the car , she refused to get in . As she was being pushed , crying , by CARDINAL policemen into an unmarked car , the parking assistant helped them to shove her into the car .", "At the police station the applicant was informed , at an unspecified time , that she had made it impossible for her brother , who lived in the same building , to use the electric installation . Later on , approximately at TIME a policeman received a prosecutor \u2019s decision authorising a search of the applicant \u2019s apartment , limited to an inspection of the electric installation . On the way to the applicant \u2019s apartment , the policemen granted her request to fetch her father , who was present at the search . Having checked the installation , an electrician from the electricity board declared that CARDINAL fuse in the fuse - box was blown and replaced it , whereupon the installation in the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s apartment started to work normally . The applicant was not allowed to participate in the checking of the installation . The applicant was released at TIME , after which the applicant was released at TIME , she went to the emergency services , where she was given tranquillisers .", "On DATE the applicant was given sick leave of DATE .", "On DATE doctor ORG issued a medical certificate at the applicant \u2019s request , stating that she had several painful areas on her head and chest , and that she suffered from general nervous exhaustion .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG about her wrongful arrest on DATE and about the manner in which it had been effected . She submitted in particular that the detention had been unlawful as she had never received any summons before the date of her arrest , either by post or by hand . Thus the legal requirements of detention had not been complied with . She contended that the record of her arrest was inaccurate and failed to recount relevant details , such as her complaint that she had felt unwell throughout her detention . She further complained about having been pushed , jostled and intimidated by the policemen . She stated that CARDINAL of them had been particularly aggressive towards her , pushing her violently and hitting her on the head . Her brother , who had been a witness to her arrest , had told her that she would finally be \u201c dealt with \u201d . When taken to the police station , she had been refused permission to use the telephone . She had also been refused permission to use the toilet . The policemen had intimidated her , and her complaints that she felt unwell had been ignored . She had briefly been presented with a document containing charges against her , but it had been immediately taken away . She had been told that her brother had lodged a complaint against her and that she had to be questioned to investigate this complaint . She also stated that her request to be given the record of the arrest had not been complied with , at least until the time when she was lodging her complaint with ORG .", "The applicant concluded that she had been wrongfully arrested , especially given the nature of the offence concerned . She had not received any summonses by post , in particular none dated DATE .", "The following medical documents were submitted to the court as annexes to the applicant \u2019s complaint : first , the copy of an information card , issued by ORG in ORG on DATE at TIME in which a physician on duty had recommended that the applicant undergo medical treatment on an outpatient basis in the local clinic ; secondly , a copy of the applicant \u2019s DATE sick leave of CARDINAL DATE ; and a copy of a medical certificate issued by doctor S.S. on DATE .", "Further , the applicant supplied the record of her arrest on DATE .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s sick leave was prolonged for a further DATE .", "On DATE the President of the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint , finding that it had been filed with the court outside TIME time - limit .", "On DATE the ORG Police station supplemented the charges of DATE with a charge that the applicant had unlawfully resisted arrest on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with the ORG against the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL , arguing that in fact the time - limit to complain about a wrongful arrest was DATE and not TIME as held by FAC .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG about the manner in which her arrest had been effected . She submitted that the police had acted unlawfully in that her detention had been unjustified ; that she had never received any summons prior to her arrest ; that she had not committed any offence ; and that she had been refused any information as to the grounds for her arrest . She contended that she had been intimidated by the police . She submitted that the police had arrested and harassed her as a \u201c personal favour \u201d to her brother , who had many friends among the police . She submitted that her arrest and detention were in breach of ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW and constituted an abuse of power within the meaning of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s parents , in a letter to the ORG , stated that the applicant \u2019s brother had had electricity in his apartment during the material period and had never complained to them that the applicant had been causing him any difficulties in using the electric installations .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL , considering that the applicant had complied with the applicable time - limit of DATE for lodging complaints about wrongful arrest , and referred the case back to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG lodged an indictment against the applicant with the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a District Court . She was charged with coercion in that from DATE she had refused her brother access to the main electricity fuses in her apartment and that this had deprived him of electricity . She was further charged with unlawfully resisting arrest on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint about her wrongful arrest .", "The Government contend that the court considered , inter alia , the following evidence in the case - file : the applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE to ORG of the Police , CARDINAL letters by the applicant \u2019s brother dated DATE requesting the prosecutor to institute proceedings against the applicant , CARDINAL reports of the police officers concerning the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest , the decision of DATE to bring charges against the applicant , and records of testimony given by CARDINAL eye witnesses .", "The case - file further contained records of the administrative proceedings undertaken following the applicant \u2019s complaints filed with ORG . The Government contend that it was established in these proceedings that the policemen involved in the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE had acted in conformity with the law and that there had been no abuse of their powers .", "In its decision of DATE , the ORG found that the police had twice tried to visit the applicant in her apartment to inspect the electric installations , on CARDINAL and DATE , and that the applicant had refused to let them in . On DATE the applicant had received a summons for DATE by registered post and she had failed to comply with it . The applicant had also refused to receive the summons at her workplace in the presence of her superior , ORG In these circumstances the applicant \u2019s arrest had been lawful as it was only by arresting her that the policemen could , acting upon ORG orders , question her and inform her of the charges .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with the ORG . She argued that there was no trace of evidence in the case - file that the police had tried to contact her at her apartment on CARDINAL and DATE . As regards the summons for DATE , it was only at the same date that the post office had informed her that a registered letter was to be served on her , with a time - limit fixed for DATE . She further stated that she had taken this summons from the post office on that date and emphasised that there had not been any previous summonses . As to the summons which the applicant had allegedly refused to accept at her workplace in the presence of GPE , the headmaster , the applicant referred to a written statement of the latter in which she had declared that no attempt had been made to serve the summonses on the applicant at school . She further stressed that the irregularities in the issuing and service of the summonses were clearly attributable to the police . The applicant concluded that arresting in a public place a person who had not jeopardised the conduct of the investigations in any way , who had a permanent address and a permanent job , should therefore be seen as an abuse of power by the police .", "On DATE a forensic medical expert stated in a certificate issued upon the applicant \u2019s request that the injuries suffered by her as shown in the medical documents could have originated from the events of CARDINAL DATE as described by the applicant .", "On DATE the President of the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as no appeal lay against the court \u2019s decision of DATE .", "On DATE the ORG upheld the rejection of the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE , finding that the President of ORG had been right in holding that no appeal lay against a dismissal of a complaint against a decision on allegedly unlawful arrest .", "On DATE the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a District Court found that the offence of coercion with which the applicant had been charged , had ceased to constitute a criminal offence under the provisions of the new Criminal Code which had entered into force on DATE , and , accordingly , discontinued the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant relating to the charges of resisting arrest . The court found that on DATE CARDINAL policemen , ORG and GPE , came to the ORG to arrest the applicant . On CARDINAL a.m. approximately they had done so . They had given her their names , grades and ordered her to follow them to the police car . The applicant had said that she was under no obligation to obey their orders and had begun to walk away . Thereupon the policemen had caught her by arms and had led to the police car . The applicant had been crying , trying to get away and kicking . She had also refused to get into the car . Then ORG had got into the car and , holding her by her arm , pulled her inside . A parking attendant S.S. had helped him by forcing the applicant \u2019s head down . Subsequently the applicant had been taken by car to the police station .", "The court relied on evidence given by CARDINAL of the policemen , ORG , by the applicant \u2019s brother and by CARDINAL other witnesses , FAC and GPE", "The court further observed that the applicant had denied all charges . She had stated that on the material date she had been approached by CARDINAL men who assaulted her and forced her to go to the parking beside the court building . There she had been hit on the head several times and pushed into the car .", "The court had regard to the applicant \u2019s submissions , but found that they were contradicted by the submissions of other witnesses . Witness PERSON , a policeman , had submitted that he had arrested the applicant together with PERSON , having given his name and grade to the applicant , and having ordered her to follow their orders . Since she had refused to comply , they had got hold of her and had taken her to the car . She had been kicking and trying to get away . The court noted that his submissions were corroborated by the testimony of the applicant \u2019s brother who had also been present at the scene , and by those of FAC , the parking assistant , who had stated that he had helped the policemen to put the applicant into the car by pushing her head down . The latter witness had also confirmed that the applicant had been kicking and trying to get away . Also , witness ORG had confirmed that the applicant had not wanted to get into the car and kept resisting .", "The court considered as credible the testimony of all the witnesses who had given a concordant recount of the material events . The testimony of ORG had been corroborated by the evidence given by other impartial witnesses who had accidentally been present at the scene . The court further considered that the applicant \u2019s conduct amounted to an offence with which she had been charged . However , the court decided to discontinue the proceedings , finding that the seriousness of the offence was infinitesimal . In taking this decision the court took into consideration the circumstances in which the offence had been committed , and in particular the context , i.e. the fact that the applicant had been involved in a conflict with her brother , which manifested itself in numerous civil and criminal proceedings to which they were parties . The court observed that the applicant had been acting under an intense emotional stress and her motives could not be considered as contemptible .", "Acts of ill - treatment causing physical harm amount to criminal offences prosecuted under the relevant provisions of LAW on various forms of assault . In instances concerning ill - treatment amounting to moral harm , in particular an attack on the privacy or dignity of the person concerned , a victim may use CARDINAL remedies . Firstly , in cases concerning acts committed by police officers the victim can , under LAW of LAW of DATE , request the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against police officers involved in any incident which allegedly infringed his or her privacy or other personal rights , such as dignity or physical inviolability .", "Pursuant to LAW officio in any case in which suspicion arose that a criminal offence had been committed .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that the ORG shall be liable for damage caused by a ORG agent in the exercise of his or her duties .", "According to the case - law of ORG , a plaintiff seeking damages under LAW of LAW must show that the act in question is unlawful and that the ORG agent committed a fault ( ORG judgments : No . I PR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished , No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , unpublished and No . I CR CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL , unpublished ) .", "Under LAW of LAW Code of Criminal Procedure , as applicable at the relevant time , the police could arrest a person if there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that he or she had committed an offence and if there was a risk of absconding or collusion .", "LAW of DATE , provided in its LAW for compensation regarding damages arising out of obviously unjustified detention on remand and for arrest and detention TIME . ORG in whose jurisdiction the detained person had been released was competent to examine whether the conditions for awarding compensation were met . The decision of ORG could be appealed against to ORG .", "According to LAW , a request for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention on remand had to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the final decision terminating the criminal proceedings in question had become final . Therefore , in practice , a request for compensation for unjustified detention under LAW could not be lodged until the criminal proceedings against the person concerned were terminated ( see also the decision of ORG no .

PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , published in ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "LAW of LAW of DATE provides for a request for compensation for , inter alia , unjustified detention . Current Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code is the equivalent of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of DATE .", "The modalities for permissible use of direct coercive measures by the police are laid down by LAW , which provides that in situations in which a police order is not obeyed , such measures can be resorted to only insofar as they correspond to the requirements of a particular situation and insofar as they are necessary to obtain compliance with that order .", "The Ordinance of DATE on the Use of Coercive Measures by the ORG provides in its LAW that direct physical force can be used to overpower a person , to counter an attack and to ensure compliance with an order .
