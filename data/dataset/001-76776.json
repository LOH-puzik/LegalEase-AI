He was represented before the Court by PERSON ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the Act on the Restitution of and Compensation for Property Expropriated during ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) entered into force .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , nationalised flats in respect of which third persons had acquired specially protected tenancies ( stanarsko pravo ) were not to be restored to their former owners . The tenants had a right to purchase such flats from the Fund for the Restitution of and Compensation for Expropriated Property ( PERSON naknadu oduzete imovine \u2013 \u201c the Fund \u201d ) under favourable conditions set out in ORG . At the same time , the former owners or their heirs were entitled to financial compensation in respect of the flats .", "In addition , section CARDINAL of LAW provided that , in the event of subsequent \u201c disposal in rem \u201d of flats purchased by such tenants , the former owners had the right of pre - emption ( pravo prvokupa ) . In such cases , the new owner ( the former tenant ) was obliged to offer it first to the former owner for the same price as he or she had paid to the ORG . If the former owner accepted the offer and concluded a contract of sale with the new owner , he or she had to pay the ORG the difference between the sale price and the amount of financial compensation previously received .", "Pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the right of pre - emption was to be noted ( zabilje\u017eba ) in the land register on the basis of a mandatory clause to be inserted into every contract of sale concluded between a tenant and the Fund .", "CARDINAL residential buildings in the centre of GPE had been owned by the applicant 's family and were nationalised during the NORP regime .", "On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG GPE ( Grad GPE , PERSON ured za imovinskopravne poslove ) issued CARDINAL decisions finding that the applicant , as the sole heir of his late mother , ORG , was entitled to financial compensation in the amount of CARDINAL NORP kunas in respect of CARDINAL flats situated in the nationalised buildings . PERCENT of the compensation was to be paid within DATE of the decisions becoming final , while the rest was to be paid in ORG bonds in CARDINAL DATE instalments over the period DATE and DATE .", "The applicant submitted that he had renounced his pre - emption rights in respect of CARDINAL of the flats .", "In DATE members of the upper house of ORG \u2013 ORG PERSON ) DATE lodged an application with ORG challenging the constitutionality of LAW ( application for abstract constitutional review \u2013 zahtjev za ocjenu ustavnosti ) under LAW of the DATE LAW on ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) .", "In addition , in the period DATE , ORG received CARDINAL petitions lodged by various individuals requesting the institution of proceedings to review the constitutionality of LAW ( petition for abstract constitutional review \u2013 prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti ) under LAW of the DATE LAW .", "On DATE the ORG delivered a single decision on the above application and petitions . It quashed certain provisions of LAW as unconstitutional . Among other provisions , ORG quashed section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , which provided for pre - emption rights for former owners . As a result , the applicant lost his right of pre - emption .", "ORG held that the constitutionally protected right to ownership included the right to dispose of a property , which meant , inter alia , the right to sell it at a contracted ( market ) price . Since the statutory right of pre - emption restricted the right of disposal , thereby placing a limitation on the constitutional right of ownership , that limitation had to meet the aim which it sought to achieve . The aim of the right of pre - emption was to protect former owners and the legal order against any unjustifiable profit which the new owner of a flat ( the former tenant ) might make by selling it at the market price ( having previously bought it from the Fund at a significantly lower price ) . However , it was not necessary to provide for the right of pre - emption in perpetuity in order to meet that aim . Instead , the aim could have been achieved by imposing a reasonable time - limit . A perpetual right of pre - emption was not proportionate to the aim pursued , and therefore constituted an excessive restriction on the rights of current owners , hampering even socially desirable disposal of property ( aimed , for example , at meeting the housing needs of the owner 's immediate family members ) and paralysing real property transactions to a significant extent .", "In addition , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) was found to be contrary to the principle of legal certainty and thereby to the rule of law , on account of the vague and imprecise nature of the terms used . In particular , it was not clear whether the right of pre - emption in question constituted a right in rem or in personam ( and if the latter was the case , whether it existed for the lifetime of the former or the current owner ) . Moreover , ORG held that the use of the term \u201c disposal in rem \u201d ( which , apart from sale , could involve other forms of alienation and mortgaging of the property ) to describe an event triggering the former owner 's right of pre - emption , was inconsistent with the other provisions of LAW , which used the term \u201c sale \u201d to describe the same event .", "ORG deferred the effects of its decision by giving the legislature DATE to comply with the decision and enact amendments to LAW to replace the unconstitutional provisions . The quashed provisions were to lose their legal force with the entry into force of the envisaged amendments , but DATE from the date of publication of the court 's decision . The decision was published in ORG on DATE .", "Following several requests by the ORG , ORG extended this time - limit on CARDINAL occasions . The time - limit was finally set at DATE .", "On DATE ORG adopted amendments to LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) which entered into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL of the LAW repealed sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of LAW , that is , the provisions providing for pre - emption rights for former owners .", "ORG did not accept the ORG 's bill , which provided for pre - emption rights for former owners in the event of a flat 's subsequent sale , donation or exchange , for DATE . It considered that the proposed solution would result in an undesirable stalemate whereby the current owner would have no incentive to sell his or her flat , and therefore making it impossible for former owners to make use of their right of pre - emption . If adopted , the bill would impose an excessive burden on the current owners while not benefiting the former owners . Moreover , since property transactions concerning these flats would be paralysed , it would deprive the ORG of the taxation revenue from such transactions .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of the LAW ( petition for abstract constitutional review ) , arguing that they were in breach of LAW . ORG has not yet decided on the applicant 's petition .", "The relevant provisions of the DATE LAW ( Ustav PERSON , ORG nos .
