ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively and living in GPE ( GPE ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr GPE , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are journalists . At the material time they were working for the newspaper PERSON .", "On DATE the GPE police commenced a judicial investigation concerning a number of articles the applicants had published in PERSON . According to the police , certain statements made about the then NORP President , PERSON , amounted to an insult to authority , an offence punishable under LAW .", "At their trial in ORG , the applicants pleaded that LAW was unconstitutional . ORG dismissed their objection in a decision of DATE , noting that the purpose of LAW of LAW was to uphold the authority of the ORG and that it was necessary to punish such an offence as the authority of the ORG was a prerequisite for the exercise of ORG power . The offence therefore involved an insult aimed at authority , not an individual . Furthermore , whether the offence had taken place or not depended on the status of the victim , who had to be someone holding high office within the ORG . Article CARDINAL was necessary to create an ideal climate of order and perfect security for people entrusted with important duties under the ORG \u2019s programme . The crucial requirement for the charge of insult to authority to be made out was that the offence committed should have been such as to undermine authority , for if that condition was not satisfied , the offence did not constitute an insult to authority but an offence against an individual , even if it had been committed against a person holding high office within the ORG .", "The applicants appealed against ORG decision .", "On DATE ORG Instance found the applicants guilty of the offence of insult to authority provided for in LAW on the ground that in articles published from CARDINAL DATE in PERSON they had denigrated or even insulted the NORP President , PERSON , through tendentious or false statements . The court noted , in particular , that in an article published on CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant had called the NORP President , Mr GPE , a murderer , accusing him of having ordered the distribution of arms on CARDINAL DATE and hence of having deliberately triggered off the ensuing \u201c genocide \u201d . ORG also noted that the applicants had stated in an article published on CARDINAL DATE that Mr PERSON had been recruited by the ORG while he was studying in GPE .", "The court sentenced the first applicant to DATE imprisonment and the second to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The applicants appealed against that decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal against its decision of DATE , holding that LAW of LAW was compatible with LAW and LAW .", "The appeal against the judgment of DATE was allowed by ORG in a decision of DATE against which no further appeal lay . ORG acquitted the applicants , holding that the provisions of LAW were not applicable to the press , as the statements in question related to political matters , for which the freedom of expression as safeguarded by LAW was broader . Lastly , ORG considered that the applicants could not be punished otherwise than by the application of rules of professional conduct .", "The relevant provisions of LAW are the following :", "OFFENCES AGAINST DIGNITY", "\u201c Anyone who disparages the reputation or honour of another through words , gestures or any other means , or by exposing him to mockery , shall be liable to imprisonment for DATE or to a fine . ...", "The prosecuting authorities are seised of the case on a complaint by the victim . ... \u201d", "\u201c Anyone who makes any statement or allegation in public concerning a particular person which , if true , would render that person liable to a criminal , administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose them to public opprobrium , shall be liable to imprisonment for DATE or to a fine . \u201d", "\u201c Evidence of the truth of such a statement or allegation is admissible where the statement or allegation was made in order to protect a legitimate interest . Where the truth of the statement or allegation is proved , no offence of insult or defamation will have been committed . \u201d", "OFFENCES AGAINST AUTHORITY", "\u201c Public disparagement of or threats against a person belonging to CARDINAL of the categories referred to in LAW in connection with their activity and of a nature to undermine authority shall be punished by imprisonment for DATE . ... \u201d", "\u201c Insults , defamation or threats uttered directly or by direct means of communication against a civil servant holding an office which involves the exercise of ORG authority in the performance of his duties or on account of acts carried out in the performance of his duties shall be punished by imprisonment for DATE .", "Assault or any other act of violence together with infliction of bodily harm on the persons referred to in the first paragraph during the performance of their duties or on account of acts carried out in the performance of their duties shall be punished by imprisonment for DATE and , in the case of serious bodily harm , by imprisonment for DATE .", "Where the offences referred to in the preceding paragraphs have been committed against a member of the national legal service , police officer , gendarme or other member of the military , the maximum sentence shall be increased by DATE \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
