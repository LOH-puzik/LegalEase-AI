The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was nominated by the coalition of ORG and PERSON parties to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of CARDINAL DATE and applied for registration as a candidate in the singlemandate ORG No . DATE .", "CARDINAL . As LAW required that each nomination as a candidate for parliamentary elections be supported by a minimum of CARDINAL voters , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant submitted to ORG ( \u201c the ConEC \u201d ) CARDINAL signature sheets containing CARDINAL voter signatures collected in support of his candidacy .", "CARDINAL . Before the DATE \u2019s decision on the question of the applicant \u2019s registration as a candidate , the accuracy of the signature sheets and other registration documents submitted by the applicant were to be first examined by a special working group ( i\u015f\u00e7i qrupu ) established by the ConEC . Although the applicant had requested to be present during the process of the examination by the working group , this took place without him .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ConEC refused the applicant \u2019s request for registration as a candidate . The NORP found that , according to the opinion of the working group , a number of submitted supporting signatures were invalid , and that the remaining valid signatures numbered CARDINAL . In particular , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL signatures had been examined , and it was found that CARDINAL of those signatures were invalid .", "CARDINAL . The following reasons were given in the PERSON working group \u2019s examination record dated DATE : ( a ) CARDINAL signatures were \u201c repeat signatures \u201d ; ( b ) CARDINAL signatures were invalid because there were uncertified corrections of them on the signature sheets ; ( c ) CARDINAL signatures were invalid owing to incorrect personal information provided concerning those voters ; ( d ) one signature was invalid because it was on the wrong line ; ( e ) CARDINAL signatures were not authentic because they had been made repeatedly by the same individuals who had already signed the signature sheets ; and ( f ) CARDINAL signatures were invalid for \u201c other \u201d ( unspecified ) reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against the PERSON decision to refuse registration . He complained , inter alia , of the following :", "( a ) CARDINAL signatures were deemed invalid on the basis of a mere visual examination , without any additional adequate investigation ;", "( b ) the members of the ConEC working group were not real experts . The head of the working group was a school gym teacher , while CARDINAL other members were an employee of a statistics committee and an employee of the passports department of a local police office ;", "( c ) there was no explanation as to what constituted \u201c other \u201d reasons for declaring CARDINAL of the signatures invalid ;", "( d ) NORP contrary to the requirements of LAW , the applicant had not been invited to participate in the process of examination of the signature sheets by the ConEC working group , and thus had been deprived of the right to give the necessary explanations to the experts ;", "( e ) NORP contrary to the requirements of LAW , he had not been provided with a copy of the results of the examination of the signature sheets CARDINAL prior to the PERSON meeting to decide on the applicant \u2019s registration ;", "( f ) the applicant \u2019s presence at the PERSON meeting of DATE had not been ensured .", "CARDINAL . Enclosed with his complaint to the ORG , the applicant submitted written statements by CARDINAL voters whose signatures had been declared invalid , affirming the authenticity of their signatures . However , according to the applicant , those statements were not taken into consideration by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG conducted another examination of the signature sheets using members of its own working group . The applicant was not invited to participate in this process . According to the working group \u2019s findings , a total of CARDINAL signatures were considered to be invalid . It appears that CARDINAL of those were considered inauthentic because they had allegedly been made repeatedly by the same persons in the name of other persons , and CARDINAL were found to be invalid owing to the voters\u2019 incorrect personal information .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not invited to the ORG meeting dealing with his complaint against the PERSON decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint and upheld the ConEC decision of DATE .
