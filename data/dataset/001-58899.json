In DATE and at DATE the first applicant ( G.H.H. ) had been a supporter of his hometown branch of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a NORP - Leninist organisation . This local wing of the organisation was headed by his cousin . The first applicant 's involvement in the organisation 's activities brought him to the attention of the authorities and he was detained on CARDINAL occasions in DATE . Following a government crackdown on the ORG and its members , the first applicant lost contact with the organisation . As from DATE he began to engage in the production and distribution of a newsletter carrying anti - government articles as well as dissident literary contributions . The first applicant himself contributed political articles and poems to the newsletter . He maintains that DATE he was kept under close surveillance by the intelligence services , including during his period of military service .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he married the second applicant who in DATE and DATE had been an anti - government activist in ORG ( \u201c the OIPFG \u201d ) . During her student days she had received several warnings from her university about her political activities .", "CARDINAL . While at university the first applicant founded a controversial literary journal and engaged in cultural , intellectual and social activities both within and outside his university which incurred the enmity of fundamentalist groups and led to his being questioned by the university intelligence services . He claims that his academic and research work as well as his NORP sense of dress were criticised as being incompatible with the fundamentals of ORG . He claims that in DATE he was arrested and detained for DATE by the authorities for drinking alcohol and during his detention received CARDINAL lashes .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant attempted to publish his first book , a collection of poems , some of which were dedicated to persons who , like his cousin , were regarded with suspicion or hostility by the government . The poems conveyed feelings of romance , secularism and revolutionary fervour , but he composed them in a way which would not attract the application of the censorship laws . The first applicant finally secured official approval for the publication of the book on condition that he made certain amendments to its contents . With the assistance of a third party he procured by subterfuge a certificate of conditional approval to have the book printed which enabled him to have CARDINAL copies run off . Before waiting for the official approval permit for the book 's release , the first applicant distributed many copies to friends and bookshops . He has subsequently learned that the authorities refused to issue a permit . He maintains that since DATE he has submitted CARDINAL other books to ORG for printing permits but never received a reply , only the verbal disapproval of officials of the books ' contents . The first applicant claims that this effectively places a ban on his writings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant paid a visit to his home town . He was immediately detained on arrival by members of the NORP security forces and taken to an intelligence office . He was questioned , inter alia , about his political activities , his literary associates and their meeting places and about how he had obtained a provisional permit to print his book . The security forces also interrogated him about the whereabouts of his cousin . He alleges that he was severely beaten while in detention . He was released after his brother agreed to stand bail for him . Before being released the first applicant was ordered to report back to the security services . He did not comply with this order and states that his brother was subsequently harassed and is currently facing prosecution on account of his failure to respect the terms of his conditional release .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant states that on DATE the publisher of a literary magazine with which he had connections was found murdered and that around the same period several other persons in the literary milieu who were known to him were imprisoned , attacked , disappeared or died in suspicious circumstances .", "CARDINAL . According to the first applicant , these events coupled with his own arrest and torture and dissident profile made him fear for his life and compelled him to flee GPE . He also states that after fleeing GPE his wife , the second applicant , was subjected to harassment and threats from vigilante groups in connection with his disappearance . During a search of their home by the intelligence services , a number of cassettes were found containing recordings of banned songs and of meetings attended by the first applicant and several of his literary associates . The first applicant alleges that the authorities used the tapes of the meetings to identify him and the other participants , several of whom were subsequently detained and questioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant obtained a passport by bribing an official and he fled to GPE DATE . He arrived in GPE on or DATE on a tourist visa and travelled to GPE . He was informed there that he should contact the office of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) in GPE , which in turn informed him that he should register as an asylum - seeker with the GPE police . The GPE police notified him that he could not register as an asylum seeker because he had been in GPE for DATE and that the asylum regulations required that asylum - seekers register within DATE of their arrival in the country .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant decided to renew his tourist visa fearing that if he lodged an asylum request he would be deported to GPE for non - compliance with the DATE time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was interviewed by the ORG , which rejected his asylum claim on DATE . He appealed against this decision on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE the ORG rejected his appeal .", "CARDINAL . At some stage the first applicant was joined by the second and third applicants who fled GPE for their safety . The Government claim that the first applicant in fact arrived in GPE on DATE and was accompanied by the second and third applicants . In the applicants ' view the entire family had been in GPE before that date but had to go on a DATE trip to GPE to have their visas renewed . They re - entered GPE on DATE . The applicants do not dispute that they all registered as asylum - seekers with the GPE police on DATE . They were granted a residence permit on DATE and ordered to reside in the town of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the ORG to reconsider his request for asylum and he was subsequently interviewed on DATE . On DATE the ORG rejected the first applicant 's renewed request and closed his case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants received a deportation order from the NORP police . They were informed that they had QUANTITY days in which to appeal to the authorities against the implementation of the deportation order . The applicants objected and their residence permit was again extended on DATE . The applicants maintain that the decision to extend the residence permit was only taken in DATE and in response to the ORG 's requests on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE to the Government not to deport the family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reconfirmed that the applicants did not meet the criteria for the grant of refugee status . The applicants claim that they were never informed of this decision .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the ORG informed ORG that it had conducted a fresh examination of the first applicant 's request for refugee status . Following that examination , and in light of new elements submitted by the first applicant , the ORG decided to grant him refugee status . In reaching its decision the ORG had particular regard to the fact that the applicant had been actively involved in ORG and his activities had brought him into contact with other intellectuals who had been murdered in DATE , apparently on account of their work on behalf of the association . The ORG concluded that if the applicant were to be returned to GPE , there was a reasonable likelihood that he would face persecution .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on receipt of the ORG 's letter , ORG directed that the applicants be entitled to remain in GPE temporarily , for humanitarian reasons , until they were resettled in a third country . On DATE the relevant authorities were requested to extend the applicants ' temporary stay in GPE pending their resettlement .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants left GPE and were resettled in GPE in the framework of a resettlement programme ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
