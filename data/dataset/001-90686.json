The plot was used as an orchard .", "In DATE the applicants ' father joined an agricultural cooperative . He put the above plot of land at the cooperative 's disposal . The cooperative thereby obtained the right of \u201c cooperative use \u201d in respect of the land . The owners retained the ownership title in the form of nuda proprietas .", "In DATE the applicants ' father terminated his membership of the cooperative which , however , continued using the plot .
