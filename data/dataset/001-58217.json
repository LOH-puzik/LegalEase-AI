ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a senior police officer , was at the time of his arrest Deputy Director of ORG ( ORG ) for GPE , in GPE . In the same city , he had previously been Head of ORG , Head of ORG ( NORP ) and ORG Secretary to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was detained on DATE at FAC under a warrant issued DATE by the investigating judge ( Giudice per le indagini preliminari ) attached to ORG , at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office . He was accused of involvement in a mafia - type organisation ( concorso in associazione de stampo mafioso DATE contrary to ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis of LAW ) on the basis of statements of several pentiti DATE former members of the ORG who have decided to cooperate with the authorities \u2013 during questioning in the course of various investigations into ORG offences . All the pentiti had themselves been charged with or convicted of involvement in a mafia - type organisation and , in some cases , other offences , such as drug trafficking or murder .", "On DATE Mr PERSON was suspended from duty .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL statements which led to the applicant \u2019s arrest may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) PERSON asserted that PERSON , head of the ORG clan of which he had been a \u201c member \u201d since DATE , had told him in DATE that the applicant was at the service of key ORG leaders for whom he had done a number of unspecified \u201c favours \u201d . PERSON had also told him that CARDINAL ORG , a property developer with ORG connections , had provided the applicant with a flat and that in DATE the ORG had spent MONEY on a DATE present of a car for one of the applicant \u2019s mistresses .", "As the ORG had decided in DATE to eliminate the applicant and CARDINAL other high - ranking officials , and had instructed PERSON and himself to shadow the applicant , PERSON had asked PERSON why the applicant was still alive . PERSON had replied that PERSON was \u201c at the disposal \u201d ( of the ORG ) . That same pentito had previously accused the public prosecutor in charge of his case , CARDINAL of the judges who had convicted him in ORG and ORG and the former President of ORG of collusion with the ORG .", "( b ) T. Buscetta , who gave evidence in DATE , said that PERSON had advised him to return to GPE and had assured him that the police would not look for him . PERSON had subsequently informed PERSON ( a member of the ORG belonging to a different clan ) of the tenor of his conversation with PERSON . PERSON had then drawn ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that PERSON was passing information to the police and , in particular , the applicant .", "As a result of those statements , an investigation was started into PERSON PERSON \u2019s activities , but was discontinued .", "On DATE , PERSON repeated the statement he had made in DATE , but added that he did not have first - hand knowledge of the facts .", "( c ) R. Spatola accused the applicant of having helped GPE , CARDINAL of the most powerful ORG leaders , to escape during a police operation in DATE . He asserted that the applicant was a PERSON and had contacts with the ORG leaders , also PERSON . He also described how a police operation to arrest another mafioso , PERSON ORG , had been foiled by a telephone call alerting him .", "( d ) PERSON stated on DATE that in DATE , after returning from a meeting with senior ORG leaders , his uncle had instructed him to alert PERSON to the fact that he had been informed by the applicant that the police had found out where GPE lived and were preparing to search his home . GPE had as a result left that address and hidden elsewhere . During questioning on DATE , however , PERSON had said that T. Riina had left home to ensure his safety owing to clashes between rival ORG clans .", "CARDINAL . NORP In making his order of DATE the investigating judge held that the statements referred to above had to be considered reliable and to have been made voluntarily . They could therefore constitute serious evidence of guilt ( gravi indizi di colpevolezza ) , which is a prerequisite under NORP law for a suspect to be detained . The judge also considered that the statements were corroborated by objective evidence confirming their credibility .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently implicated in DATE and DATE by CARDINAL other pentiti . Their statements may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) PERSON referred to the applicant during questioning on DATE , stating that the applicant was a friend of PERSON , also had contacts with PERSON and had been given the use of a flat by ORG", "( b ) S. Cancemi said that PERSON had accelerated PERSON application for a licence to carry firearms and had also intervened to secure the return of PERSON driving licence , which had been withdrawn as a preventive measure .", "( c ) PERSON claimed to have seen the applicant in DATE in a flat in GPE in the company of a member of the ORG . He alleged that PERSON had been involved in a valuation by a NORP art expert of an amphora which PERSON had brought to the premises and had , he asserted , been intended for the deputy police commissioner . PERSON had convictions for armed robbery , drug trafficking and calumny .", "( d ) PERSON , a member of the PERSON , a NORP mafia - type organisation , said that a member of the ORG , PERSON , had told him that Mr PERSON was \u201c useful \u201d to the ORG as he provided it with information about police raids .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , on DATE NORP Spatola stated that while in a restaurant with CARDINAL other members of the ORG , the PERSON brothers , they had drawn his attention to the fact that PERSON was there with the applicant in a small room that had been reserved in the restaurant .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was questioned by the investigating judge shortly after his arrest , on DATE .", "On DATE he was questioned , at his request , by the public prosecutor and , on an unspecified date , transferred to ORG .", "Subsequently , the investigating judge committed him for trial and ordered that the trial should start on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG for release on the grounds that , firstly , the order of DATE did not state what the \u201c serious evidence of guilt \u201d against him was and , secondly , in any event , the statements of the first CARDINAL pentiti , which referred to events in the distant past most of which had been related to them by third parties , could under no circumstances constitute serious evidence of guilt . In that connection , he referred in particular to ORG case - law under which a statement implicating another person did not constitute serious evidence of guilt within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) unless it was supported by objective evidence . He said that PERSON ORG and NORP Spatola had never said what the favours he had allegedly done for the ORG leaders were and that , furthermore , it was impossible to check the truth of the information provided by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , as the persons from whom it had been obtained had all died in the meantime . He also observed that the investigation into like allegations made by PERSON in DATE had been discontinued in DATE for want of material corroborating evidence . Lastly , the applicant submitted that none of the conditions laid down in LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) could justify detention in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal on the ground that the investigating judge had given logical and sufficient reasons for his decision . The court noted that the judge had found that the pentiti statements were to be considered reliable , as they had been made by persons who had occupied senior positions within the ORG and who had in the past enabled the investigators to establish the structure of that organisation . ORG said in that regard that hearsay evidence could be admissible if it emanated from a reliable witness . The evidence had also to be considered \u201c serious \u201d , as the judge had referred to objective corroborative evidence . Emphasising that the statements in question had been made by different people and concerned different events so that their credibility was strengthened , ORG concluded that the evidence assembled by the investigating judge pointed to the likelihood that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he had been charged . Furthermore , under LAW ORG , the seriousness of those offences raised a rebuttable presumption that a risk existed that the applicant would tamper with evidence , abscond or reoffend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a further application for release from detention to the investigating judge and at the same time applied for the charges to be dropped on the grounds that the offence had not been made out . He said in particular that the investigation up to that point had already provided the investigators with substantial evidence of his innocence . He referred to the active role he had played in a number of investigations into the ORG , as a result of which he had even received death threats , and argued that he had opposed granting PERSON day - release from prison , fearing , as proved to be the case , that PERSON would take advantage of it to escape and resume his activities . He maintained that he had never met PERSON or been a PERSON .", "The applicant submitted that there was no real and current risk justifying his detention , given , in particular , that he would never be able to tamper with the evidence , since in the course of the lengthy investigation into the allegations against him all the evidence had already been obtained . Nor was there any risk of his absconding , since he had been aware of the pentiti statements before being arrested . In view of his career and the role he had played in investigating the ORG , any risk that he might continue assisting the ORG \u2019s activities should also be ruled out .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge who had ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest dismissed that application on DATE . He held that the pentiti statements , far from being refuted , had subsequently been successively confirmed by :", "( i ) further detailed statements by NORP Spatola confirming that the applicant knew PERSON ;", "( ii ) the fact that the applicant had , after a search at the home of a member of the ORG , allegedly asked another police officer to \u201c ease up \u201d ; and", "( iii ) the fact that the applicant had tipped off PERSON , who was suspected of having ORG links , that an arrest warrant had been issued against him , thereby enabling him to get away .", "The judge also considered that the pentiti \u2019s decision to cooperate with the judicial authorities could not have been motivated by a grudge against the applicant , given the genuineness of their cooperation with the authorities . Lastly , in view of the fact that the applicant occupied a senior official position , there was a real risk \u2013 assuming the charges against him were founded \u2013 of evidence being tampered with and of his absconding .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed against that order to ORG , which had appellate jurisdiction on applications for release . As regards the further statements by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in which he had said that the applicant knew PERSON well , the applicant submitted that it was DATE before the applicant \u2019s arrest that Spatola had started making allegations about him to the judicial authorities . Although NORP Spatola had been cooperating with the judicial authorities since DATE he was , apparently , unaware that the applicant had left the Anti - Mafia High Commission in DATE . No more reliable , in the applicant \u2019s submission , was LOC claim that he had seen the applicant with PERSON in a well - known GPE restaurant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) for , at the time , GPE had been the scene of a ruthless power struggle between the various ORG clans and ORG had no interest in showing himself in public . As to his instruction to a colleague to \u201c ease up \u201d , his intention had not been to protect members of the ORG , but to bring a junior police officer in line following a search in which he had ill - treated the sons and wife of a mafioso wanted by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the ground that it concerned points which had already been rejected and that new facts emerging from the investigation appeared to confirm the strength of the case against him . The court observed , inter alia , that the junior police officer had confirmed his statement regarding the pressure exerted on him by PERSON . Even if no account could be taken of the statements by PERSON in GPE , as they had been related verbally by the judges and had not been recorded in any document , all the other evidence against the applicant justified keeping him in detention pending trial . The court therefore upheld the order of DATE , while declaring that the statements concerning PERSON evidence were inadmissible . Lastly , the court stressed once again the risk of evidence being tampered with given the network of contacts on which the applicant could rely , as had been demonstrated in particular by the fact that the applicant had voluntarily reported to the public prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE , when the investigation should still have been secret . That circumstance confirmed that he had been aware , not only of the existence of an investigation against him , but also of the tenor of the accusations made by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , but his appeal was dismissed on DATE . While acknowledging that the reasoning of the courts below regarding the threat posed by the applicant had been somewhat concise , ORG considered , among other things , that it was nevertheless neither manifestly illogical nor unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , noting that checks were still being carried out at banks and requests for documents from ORG and the police authorities were still in hand , the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office applied for the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial to be continued after the expiration of the statutory limit of DATE on DATE . On DATE the applicant opposed that application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge , relying in particular on the complexity of the investigation ( involving , among other things , an outstanding request for judicial assistance , transcripts of tapped telephone conversations and an analysis of data relating to mobile telephones used by PERSON ) and the risk of the applicant tampering with evidence ( whether to hand , or to be obtained ) , absconding and committing further offences , ordered that the period of detention pending trial be extended by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He submitted , inter alia , that the investigative measures that had allegedly necessitated his continued detention could easily have been completed earlier and certainly before DATE and that any delay should be attributed solely to the judicial authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that even if the data relating to the mobile telephones could have been requested and analysed DATE it had not been requested until DATE although the applicant had been in detention since DATE \u2013 the prosecution could not be criticised in relation to the other investigative measures justifying the applicant \u2019s continued detention . They had either been put in hand very early on or had been particularly complex , and the prosecution enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in that regard . Furthermore , even if the risk of absconding could be discounted , the court considered that there was still a real risk that the applicant would reoffend or that evidence would be tampered with , given the extremely sensitive official position he had occupied . The court noted on that point that , after a DATE \u2019s wait , the prosecution had still not obtained the files on , among other things , work done by the applicant for ORG . Account also had to be taken of the fact that it would be very difficult for the applicant to extricate himself from the ORG \u2019s criminal network .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG on DATE , but his appeal was dismissed on CARDINAL DATE . ORG held , in particular , that there was a danger that the applicant might use his contacts to tamper with the evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following his committal and the start of his trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant made a further application for release . ORG dismissed his application on DATE , holding once again that , as the investigation was complex , the applicant \u2019s release might interfere with its progress . The applicant could have used his many contacts and connections \u2013 made while working at his former highly sensitive posts \u2013 to tamper with evidence or to exert pressure on witnesses . As to the risk of reoffending , the court emphasised that criminal links with the ORG were generally long - lived , particularly bearing in mind the ORG \u2019s hallmark of subjugating its members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the prosecution \u2019s application of DATE for an order pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL CCP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) extending the maximum periods of detention pending trial for the duration of the trial and deliberations at first instance , owing to the complexity of the proceedings . The court held that , given the number of hearings , witnesses\u2019 depositions and statements from the applicant , the prosecution \u2019s request appeared justified . As regards the applicant \u2019s submission that the proceedings would have been completed earlier if the hearings had been held at more frequent intervals , the court considered that it had to take into account the court \u2019s excessive workload and the fact that it had also had to deal with other cases involving accused detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON appealed against that order , submitting in particular that the provision for extension of the maximum periods of detention pending trial had been adopted in order to meet the requirements of trials of a very large number of defendants ( maxi - processi ) . In his case , however , it had not been possible to complete the trial within the maximum period permitted for detention pending trial for reasons other than the complexity of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in an order of CARDINAL DATE , ruling that all the conditions laid down in LAW CCP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were satisfied in his case : that is to say , in particular , the complexity of the proceedings ( exacerbated by the court \u2019s excessive workload ) and the continuing applicability of the conditions laid down in LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant did not appeal to ORG against that order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON made a further application to LOC for release , arguing that his detention was no longer necessary for the investigation and that his health was suffering , as attested by a psychiatrists\u2019 report .", "CARDINAL . The court granted the application ( which was , moreover , supported by the prosecution ) and the applicant \u2019s release was finally ordered on DATE . The court held in particular that :", "( i ) at that stage of the trial , as the oral hearings had been completed , all the prosecution and defence witnesses heard , the documentary evidence obtained and various confrontations necessary for the investigation held , there was no longer any risk that the evidence would be tampered with or witnesses procured to give false evidence ;", "( ii ) the risk of absconding could also be ruled out owing to the applicant \u2019s state of health \u2013 he was suffering from a sufficiently acute form of DATE , the long period he had spent in detention and the fact that it was far from certain that a final conviction , which would necessitate precautions being taken to ensure that he served his sentence , would be secured ; and", "( iii ) any risk of the applicant committing further offences could also be ruled out , owing to his state of health , the long period he had spent in detention pending trial and , lastly , the fact that since his arrest he had no longer been in his post .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE , appended to the ORG \u2019s observations , the public prosecutor attached to ORG admitted , with regard to the question of whether there had been a need to keep the applicant in detention pending trial , that there was an apparent contradiction between the decision of DATE to extend the maximum period and the fact that the conditions justifying keeping the applicant in detention under LAW ORG had ceased to exist shortly afterwards , which showed that an overall view of the trial had been lacking .", "CARDINAL . The trial progressed at an average rate of CARDINAL hearings DATE . Additionally , a report by the President of the court dated DATE shows that , after the maximum period of detention pending trial in the proceedings had been extended for the duration of the trial , the court proposed holding CARDINAL hearings a week instead of CARDINAL , but the applicant \u2019s lawyers refused . It appears from the case file that the proceedings involved CARDINAL hearings at the investigative stage and the examination of CARDINAL witnesses or persons accused of offences connected with those with which the applicant was charged . There were also CARDINAL confrontations ; moreover , CARDINAL hearings were necessary merely to examine the applicant , CARDINAL of which were held in succession DATE and DATE . CARDINAL witnesses called by the parties gave evidence at the trial . A large number of documents were lodged on the case file . The hearings between DATE and CARDINAL DATE were devoted to the hearing of witnesses . CARDINAL pentiti were , for security reasons , questioned in the GPE and GPE prisons where they were detained . The public prosecutor made his submissions over the course of CARDINAL hearings held between DATE and DATE . DATE and DATE , over CARDINAL hearings , the applicant \u2019s lawyer made his submissions for the defence .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was filed with the court registry on DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for aiding and abetting from the outside ( concorso esterno ) a mafia - type organisation ( Articles CARDINAL bis and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "In the reasons for its decision it said :", "\u201c The court considers that the complex and extensive investigation carried out at the trial , at which the parties were able to put forward their respective arguments , enables the conclusion to be reached with total certainty that the accused was completely guilty . That finding is based on the accusations , all of which are consistent , made against him by people who have cooperated with the prosecution and which the court finds to be credible taken as a whole , whether individually or jointly with other items of evidence subsequently corroborated by a very large number of statements and documents from other sources , the accusatory content of which is unequivocal and the evidential value indisputable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant has appealed . The hearing of his appeal before ORG began on DATE . At the end of a subsequent hearing on DATE the appeal was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL bis of LAW provides , inter alia :", "\u201c A person who is a member of a mafia - type organisation of CARDINAL or more persons shall be liable to imprisonment ...", "An organisation is of a mafia type if its members use the intimidatory power of the bonds of membership and the resulting vows of obedience and silence in order to commit an offence , to acquire ( directly or indirectly ) the management , or other form of control , of economic activities , licences , permits , public contracts or services or to gain unfair advantages or profits for its members or other persons , or to prevent or hinder the free exercise of the right to vote , or to secure votes for members or other persons in elections .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , LAW provides that where several persons are accomplices in the commission of an offence , they shall each be individually liable to the punishment laid down for that offence .", "The case - law has applied the concept of aiding and abetting in cases concerning criminal organisations DATE and , more particularly , a mafia - type organisation DATE and has accepted that the offence of aiding and abetting a mafia - type organisation may be committed from the outside . The latter concept applies to a person who is not a member of the organisation and has confined himself to doing CARDINAL or more acts likely to further that criminal organisation \u2019s aims and motivated by an independent intention \u2013 limited in aim , duration and effectiveness DATE to commit a crime ( see , among other authorities , ORG judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "That interpretation has , however , given rise to controversy among ORG judges themselves . Thus , in its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c As regards offences associated with belonging to a criminal organisation , and in particular a mafia - type organisation , the concept of criminal responsibility in the form of \u2018 aiding and abetting from the outside\u2019 is unacceptable ; a defendant who undertakes acts which facilitate the organisation \u2019s aims either specifically intends to contribute to the furtherance of that organisation \u2019s aims and is therefore indistinguishable from a member of the organisation , or does not have that specific intention , whereupon the conduct which facilitates the organisation \u2019s aims should be treated differently from the offence of belonging to a criminal organisation ... The impossibility of applying the concept of \u2018 aiding and abetting an organisation from the outside\u2019 is confirmed by the fact that the offence of \u2018 aiding and abetting the members of a criminal GPE already exists ( LAW ) and that several provisions ... already provide for an offence committed \u2018 in order to facilitate\u2019 the activity of ORG or similar organisations ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ORG provides :", "\u201c No one shall be detained pending trial unless there is serious evidence of his guilt . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ORG provides that a person may be detained pending trial :", "\u201c ( a ) NORP if detention is demanded by special and unavoidable requirements of the inquiry into the facts under investigation concerning a genuine and present danger for the production or authenticity of evidence and based on matters of fact which must , on pain of nullity , be expressly set out in the decision , which the judicial authority may take of its own motion ... ;", "( b ) if the accused has absconded or there is a real danger of his absconding , provided that the court considers that , if convicted , he will be liable to a prison sentence of DATE ;", "( c ) where , given the specific nature and circumstances of the offence and having regard to the character of the suspect or the accused as shown by his conduct , acts or criminal record , there is a genuine risk that he will commit a serious offence involving the use of weapons or other violent means against the person or an offence against the constitutional order or an offence relating to organised crime or a further offence of the same kind as that of which he is suspected or accused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ORG , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL ( which became Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) and Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ( which became Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) there is a rebuttable presumption that such a necessity exists with regard to certain particularly serious offences , including the CARDINAL with which the applicant was charged .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL CCP lays down the maximum permitted periods of detention pending trial depending on the stage reached in the proceedings . As the applicant was prosecuted for the offence laid down in Article CARDINAL bis of LAW , the periods applicable to him during the proceedings at first instance were as follows :", "( i ) DATE from the beginning of his detention until the order committing him for trial ;", "( ii ) DATE from the beginning of the trial until his conviction at first instance .", "Article CARDINAL ORG provides , inter alia , that if the order committing the defendant for trial has not been made or , as the case may be , the defendant has not been convicted at first instance within the relevant period , the detention pending trial shall cease to be lawful and the defendant must be released .", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG provide for exceptions to these rules .", "In particular , paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL provides that for certain offences , including the one provided for in Article CARDINAL bis of LAW , the periods laid down in LAW may be extended during the hearings , the deliberations at first instance or the appeal , if the proceedings prove to be particularly complex .
