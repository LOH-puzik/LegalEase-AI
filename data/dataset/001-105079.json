Secondly , they requested an order of mandamus directing the Minister to consider the application of the first applicant to reside in the ORG . ORG judgment later summarised the Minister \u2019s response :", "\u201c The essence of the submission made in response on behalf of the respondent was that having regard to the time limit specified in ORG respondent was not under any obligation to consider the rights of the NORP citizen child either by reason of Article CARDINAL of the LAW or article CARDINAL of the LAW . It was further submitted that the second application made by Ms. PERSON \u2019s solicitors on her behalf on DATE should properly be construed as simply a repeat of her application under the revised arrangements on ORG and should not be considered as a separate or a \u201c free - standing \u201d application for permission to remain in the ORG or residency . \u201d", "The hearing before ORG took place at the same time as the hearings in a number of other judicial review applications , all concerning the Minister \u2019s rejection of , or refusal to consider , applications by parents of NORP born children for leave to remain under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme .", "On DATE the High Court delivered its lead judgment in those cases finding that the Minister \u2019s decision to refuse the parent \u2019s application under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme was unlawful because it was taken in breach of the citizen child \u2019s rights under Article CARDINAL of the LAW and in breach of the Minister \u2019s obligations under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE .", "Although that decision meant that there was an outstanding application under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme to be considered , ORG nevertheless examined PERSON request for an order of mandamus . Following the rejection of his application under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme , PERSON had made a further application for leave to remain to the Minister which , apart from being acknowledged , had not been responded to by the time leave to apply for judicial review had been granted ( DATE ) .", "ORG found that , while there was no legislative provision enabling the parent of an NORP born child to apply for residency or leave to remain outside of a proposal to deport is made under PERSON CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , it was \u201c undisputed that [ the Minister ] as part of the executive power of the ORG has an inherent right and power to exercise a discretion to consider and determine and grant if he considers it appropriate residency to the parent of an NORP born child . ... such discretion must be exercised in accordance with the LAW which includes having regard to the ORG guarantee of the personal rights of the citizen child under LAW . \u201d Accordingly , and having regard to the guarantee of the personal rights of the NORP citizen child in Article CARDINAL ( including the right to live in GPE and the welfare rights set out in PERSON v. An ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG ) ) , it was not open to the Minister either to fail to deal in a substantive way with the application or to refuse , without considering the relevant facts and rights of the citizen child , to consider the application .", "On DATE ORG applied the principles established in the lead Bode judgment to the present applicants\u2019 request for an order of certiorari concerning the rejection of their IBCCARDINAL application . ORG found that the decision to refuse to consider the first named applicant \u2019s application under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme , without considering the constitutionally protected personal rights of the NORP citizen child under Article CARDINAL as well as that child \u2019s rights under LAW , was invalid .

This power is an aspect of the executive power to protect the integrity of the ORG . It has long been recognised that in GPE this executive power is exercised by the Minister on behalf of the ORG . This was described by PERSON in ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] I.L.R.M. CARDINAL at CARDINAL as :", "\u201c In relation to the permission to remain in the ORG , it seems to me that the ORG , through its ORG , must have very wide powers in the interest of the common good to control aliens , their entry into the ORG , their departure and their activities within the ORG", "The special role of the ORG in the control of foreign nationals was described by PERSON in ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] I.R. CARDINAL at CARDINAL .

There are fundamental rights of the ORG itself as well as fundamental rights of the individual citizen , and the protection of the former may involve restrictions in circumstances of necessity on the latter . The integrity of the ORG constituted as it is for the collective body of its citizens within the national territory must be defended and vindicated by the organs of the ORG and by the citizens so that there may be true social order within the territory and concord maintained with other nations in accordance with the objectives declared in the preamble to the ORG", "I would affirm and adopt this description . While steps taken by a ORG are often restrictive of the movement of foreign nationals , the ORG may also exercise its powers so as to take actions in a particular situation where it has been determined that the common good is served by giving benefits of residency to a category of foreign nationals \u2014 as a gift , in effect . \u201d", "As regards the request for an order of certiorari ( to quash the Minister \u2019s refusal to consider their application under the IBCCARDINAL Scheme ) , ORG summarised its conclusions as follows :", "\u201c The application [ by the PERSON family to ORG ] was misconceived . The ORG CARDINAL Scheme was a scheme established by the Minister , exercising executive power , to deal administratively with a unique group of foreign nationals in a generous manner , on general principles . The parameters of the scheme were set out clearly ... .", "At no stage was it intended that within the ambit of the scheme the Minister would consider , or did the Minister consider , LAW rights of the applicants . Thus the terms of the pleadings and of the appeal relating to LAW the applicants were misconceived and premature .

However , ORG then went on to consider the Minister \u2019s legal obligation to consider stand alone applications .", "This is not now relevant in view of my decision on the nature of the ORG CARDINAL Scheme , and the consequences , and the applicability of the s.CARDINAL procedure under LAW of DATE . However , I consider it important to state my opinion , to clarify the consequences of the decision .", "The appropriate process within which to consider LAW rights of applicants is on the process under s.CARDINAL of LAW of DATE . This is the relevant statutory scheme .", "In addition , within the statutory scheme there is provision to revoke a deportation order , see s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE ...", "Thus , a person , such as [ Mr Bode ] , could notify the Minister of any altered circumstances since the making of a deportation order , such as the birth of an NORP born child . On such notification the Minister would have a duty to consider the new information to determine whether to revoke a deportation order . As the statutory scheme makes this provision for such an application , there is no need to seek a further process for a right to apply . The integrity of the system should be maintained , as long as it protects the rights of the applicants , which it does in this case .", "Consequently , it is my view that there is no free standing right of [ Mr Bode ] to apply to the Minister . The appropriate procedure is under s.CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , as amended , with the potential right to apply under s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) in the future if the need to make such an application should arise . \u201d", "On DATE ORG applied , to the present applicants\u2019 appeal , the principles it had established in its judgment on the appeal in the lead Bode case .

The point of law so certified was as follows :", "\u201c In determining the reasonableness of an administrative decision which affects or concerns the constitutional rights or fundamental rights , is it correct to apply the standards set out in O\u2019Keeffe v. An PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL I.R. CARDINAL ? \u201d", "ORG allowed the appeal ( Chief Justice PERSON , PERSON GPE and PERSON Justice PERSON in the majority , with Mr Justice PERSON and PERSON Justice PERSON dissenting ) . As noted by the Chief Justice , the primary and contemporary reference points for the approach which the courts had to adopt when judicially reviewing such administrative decisions were the decisions of ORG in The ORG ( PERSON ) v. The Stardust Victims Compensation Tribunal ( [ DATE ] I.R. CARDINAL ) and the above - cited case of O\u2019Keeffe v. An PERSON .", "As regards the nature and standard of judicial review of administrative decisions including decisions encroaching on fundamental rights , Mr Justice PERSON opined as follows :", "\u201c The question is whether these considerations should lead to a modification of the PERSON or O\u2019Keeffe test . The Minister strongly opposes the adoption of an entirely new threshold of review , whether that of \u201c anxious scrutiny \u201d , \u201c most anxious scrutiny \u201d or otherwise , for some administrative decisions . He submits that the adoption of such a test would significantly alter the role of the ORG in judicial review and would effectively constitute the ORG as the ultimate appellate tribunal from a vast range of administrative decisions .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL level all this is no more than semantics : what is irrational or unreasonable depends on the subject - matter and the context . ... The appellant \u2019s written submissions advance the principle of proportionality , in particular the notion of least intrusive interference with constitutional rights , saying that this principle can operate within the confines of the PERSON or O\u2019Keeffe test . I do not consider it necessary to change the test . Properly understood , it is capable of according an appropriate level of protection of fundamental rights . The test as enunciated by PERSON [ in PERSON ] and as explained by PERSON in O\u2019Keeffe lays down a correct rule for the relationship between the courts and administrative bodies . Properly interpreted and applied , it is sufficiently flexible to provide an appropriate level of judicial review of all types of decision . The proposition of the [ Minister ] , is a restatement , without using the word , of the principle of proportionality . The courts have always examined decisions in context against their surrounding circumstances .", "DATE . Where decisions encroach upon fundamental rights guaranteed by the LAW , it is the duty of the decision - maker to take account of and to give due consideration to those rights . There is nothing new about this . ... Where a right is not considered at all or is misdescribed or misunderstood by the decision - maker , the decision will be vulnerable to attack on the grounds of a mistake of law or failure to respect the rules of natural justice . In such cases , it may not be necessary to establish that it is unreasonable . It may , however , affect fundamental rights to such a disproportionate degree , having regard to the public objectives it seeks to achieve , as to cross a threshold , and to be justifiably labelled as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision - maker could justifiably have made it . To use the language of LAW [ in PERSON ] , it may \u201c plainly and unambiguously fl[y ] in the face of fundamental reason and common sense . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Where unreasonableness is alleged , the applicant will ask the court to examine the decision to see whether the decision - maker has complied with the duty to take account of and to give due consideration to any relevant rights or interests . There is an infinitely broad spectrum of decisions and of contexts and an infinite gradation of rights . There are constitutional rights , statutory and other legal rights , rights guaranteed by the Convention . In the last case , it is relevant that section CARDINAL of LAW , DATE places an obligation on every organ of the ORG to perform its functions in a manner compatible with the ORG \u2019s obligations under the provisions of the Convention . In the Convention context , we must be conscious that ORG is influenced by the effectiveness of legal remedies against administrative decisions , when it considers the effectiveness of a national remedy pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . If we were to adopt the criterion of \u201c anxious scrutiny , \u201d it would follow that different standards of review would apply depending on whether the case was concerned with the protection of different types of right . That is the NORP \u201c sliding scale \u201d of review . In my view , it is neither appropriate nor necessary to have a different standard of review for cases involving an interference with fundamental , constitutional or other personal rights . ... It seems to me that the principle of proportionality , more fully developed in the judgments which have been delivered by the Chief Justice and of GPE J , can provide a sufficient and more consistent standard of review , without resort to vaguer notions of anxious scrutiny . The underlying facts and circumstances of cases can and do vary infinitely . The single standard of review laid down in PERSON and O\u2019Keeffe is sufficiently responsive to the needs of any particular case .", "CARDINAL . I prefer to explain the proposition laid down in the PERSON and O\u2019Keeffe cases , retaining the essence of the formulation of PERSON in the former case . I would say that a court may not interfere with the exercise of an administrative discretion on substantive grounds save where the court is satisfied , on the basis of evidence produced by the applicant , that the decision is unreasonable in the sense that it plainly and unambiguously flies in the face of fundamental reason and common sense . I use the word , \u201c substantive , \u201d to distinguish it from procedural grounds and not to imply that the courts have jurisdiction to trespass on the administrative preserve of the decision - maker . This test , properly applied , permits the person challenging the decision to complain of the extent to which the decision encroaches on rights or interests of those affected . In those cases , the courts will consider whether the applicant shows that the encroachment is not justified . Justification will be commensurate with the extent of the encroachment . The burden of proof remains on the applicant to satisfy the court that the decision is unreasonable in the sense of the language of PERSON J [ in PERSON ] . The applicant must discharge that burden by producing relevant and cogent evidence .", "CARDINAL . This does not involve a modification of the existing test as properly understood . Rather it is an explanation of principles that were already implicit in our law . \u201d", "PERSON GPE considered that the O\u2019Keeffe decision has been construed \u201c too narrowly \u201d and judicial review should be an effective remedy especially where , as in asylum cases , access to the courts has been curtailed by law . Where fundamental rights were factors in a review , they are relevant in analysing the reasonableness of a decision and proportionality was inherent in any analysis of reasonableness ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
