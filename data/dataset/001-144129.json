The first and the second applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events the first applicant PERSON was a professor of constitutional law at ORG in GPE . The second applicant Mr PERSON was the editor of the DATE publication ORG and the third applicant PERSON ORG was a joint - stock company and the publisher of ORG ( hereinafter : \u201c the publishing company \u201d ) . Mr PERSON , the president of the board of members of ORG ORG at the material time , applied to the ORG on behalf of the publishing company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an article entitled \u2018 GPE \u2019s ORG problem in the light of its decision to dissolve the FAC [ Virtue ] Party\u2019 written by the first applicant was published in Liberal Thinking . It read as follows :", "\u201c ORG has finally delivered its judgment on ORG at DATE , which lasted DATE , and has dissolved the party on the grounds that it had become \u2018 a hub of activity contrary to [ the ] principles of ORG . As a result , the high court has decided that ORG and PERSON , who were members of parliament at the date of the judgment , [ should be ] stripped of their parliamentary status and it has prohibited former parliamentarians PERSON , PERSON and PERSON from participating in political activities for DATE . CARDINAL members of the ORG have dissented and I am of the opinion that their names should be mentioned : PERSON , PERSON and PERSON .", "The judgment of ORG has naturally created widespread discontent throughout the country . Apart from a few fanatical individuals in the media who have character deficiencies , everyone who is sensible and whose conscience has not been paralysed has considered the judgment legally wrong and politically inappropriate . Even people whose sensitivities to democratic issues have never been that obvious have criticised LAW about this judgment . Nevertheless , it is clear that concerns about the difficulties that the judgment might cause GPE in its dealings with ORG and ORG have played a great role in the emergence of this reaction . Moreover , it is commonly believed that this judgment was not the product of the free will of ORG but that it was brought about under pressure [ from ] and at the suggestion of military circles .", "It is certain that the dissolution of ORG is closely related to the current political situation , the direction of which has been determined by the status quo powers ( \u2018 the deep ORG ) . However , it seems to me that we can not be sure whether the ORG was put under direct pressure . The first point is important to find out the nature of the present regime in GPE . From a legal point of view , however , what is more important is how ORG gave such a judgment . In other words , the people who should be criticised and who should be held responsible are the CARDINAL judges at the ORG , all of whom are \u2018 PERSON and \u2018 ORG . The real issue is to examine to what extent the professional backgrounds and intellectual capacities of these individuals are sufficient for such a job and to question whether they had the right to act in accordance with their prejudices . This can be done only through analysing the judgment from a legal point of view . As a matter of fact , the reasons for judgment have not yet been published . But there is nothing wrong in subjecting the judgment to such an analysis in its form as pronounced to the public . Besides , I do not think that the reasons for judgment when they are published in a few GPE time will invalidate our first analysis . Our observations and information regarding the previous judicial approach of the ORG demonstrate that the reasoning in the judgment will be \u2018 prearranged\u2019 . In other words , in the established practice of the ORG the thing which is termed \u2018 the reasoning\u2019 is fabricated and formulated at subsequent stages to justify the predetermined judgment [ made ] on the basis of prior opinions . Now we can submit our first legally relevant observations and evaluation of this judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG did the right thing by not dissolving ORG on the grounds that \u2018 it was a continuation of a party\u2019 . The ORG might have acted in this way for CARDINAL reasons : firstly , the ORG might have maintained the type of interpretation which it adopted in its previous judgments on the meaning of \u2018 being a continuation\u2019 of a party . This means that a distinction was made between continuation in the sociological sense and the continuation of a political tradition , and continuation in a technical legal sense among consecutive political parties . This is an extraordinarily appropriate legal understanding . If this is the case , it means that ORG considered that ORG , while continuing the political line represented by PERSON ( national order ) and ORG in the sociological and political sense , was not the continuation of ORG with another title .", "A second possibility might be the fact that ORG adopted the view which is insistently voiced by some constitutional law experts , including the author of this article . According to this view , LAW stipulates that \u2018 a party which was dissolved can not be re - established under another title\u2019 , but neither the LAW nor the Law on Political Parties require that the sanction of dissolution be applied to such a party if it has acted contrary to LAW . If this was the reason for which ORG refused ORG request to dissolve ORG on the basis of it being a continuation of ORG , this only demonstrates that the court did not , at least , violate the positive law in this respect . This in itself does not deserve praise , since acting to the contrary would have been openly unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , ORG decision to dissolve ORG on the grounds that it had become \u2018 a hub of activity contrary to the principles of ORG is clearly contrary to the law and has no factual or legal basis . This judgment is faulty on CARDINAL grounds . Firstly , the activity which is claimed to be \u2018 contrary to secularism\u2019 \u2013 in fact , it is only comprised of words [ and ] statements \u2013 does not have such characteristics . Most of them concern expressions of concern [ about ] the social consequences of the lack of freedom created by the prohibition on wearing the headscarf . In other words , these statements have the nature of being demands for freedom voiced by Members of ORG \u2013 mostly from the podium of ORG . Criticism of a prohibition , especially if it is voiced by members of parliament , can not be contrary to any democratic and constitutional regime . As long as it is voiced in a peaceful way , a demand for freedom can not be contrary to the principles of secularism and democracy , even if the right or freedom which constitutes the subject of the demand has not been recognised in positive law . Besides , wearing the headscarf is not prohibited for university students in NORP law . The prohibition on wearing the headscarf which has been implemented in GPE in DATE is not a requirement of the current legal order , but it is a result of current power relations . In other words , the existence of this prohibition is a de facto and not a de jure phenomenon .", "Secondly , even if it was against the law for university students to wear the headscarf , this would not make the party whose members are criticising the prohibition and demanding its removal contrary to secularism in a democratic system . Let us leave this fact aside and let us assume that such criticism and such a demand for freedom are contrary to secularism . Even in this case , the fact that some MPs or party members are making such criticism individually does not make the party \u201c a hub \u201d of that activity . In fact , being the \u201c hub \u201d or \u201c focus \u201d of any kind of activity for an organisation means the following : that the activity arose from the centre of that organisation , it is directed , controlled and administered by that centre ; and that the activity is performed intensively , decisively and continuously . The facts in the trial record clearly demonstrate that these criteria did not apply to the legal personality of ORG . Apart from [ the fact that it was ] far from being in a position to become the \u201c hub \u201d of the [ relevant ] activity , ORG did not become a determined follower of the issue of the headscarf ban in addition to many other issues . In fact , this party has been the most \u201c obedient \u201d party of the system for DATE and did not hold a clear and decisive view on any major issue , probably because of the fear of being dissolved .", "It seems that ORG considered PERSON election as an MP for ORG \u2013 she is still an MP \u2013 and the support given by the party to her as proof of the claim that the party had become \u201c a hub of activity contrary to the principles of secularism \u201d . In other words , according to ORG , the election of a citizen who wears a headscarf as an MP and her attempt to take the oath in ORG while wearing the headscarf are contrary to secularism . This is an unsound understanding for many reasons . First of all , if \u201c national sovereignty \u201d is CARDINAL of the true \u2013 not fake \u2013 basic principles of GPE \u2019s constitutional order , no constitutional organ , particularly ORG , whose legitimate authority stems from this principle , can impose any restrictions on the nation \u2019s right to elect its representatives . PERSON was put forward as a candidate by ORG , but she was elected by the NORP nation . If ORG had found this fact to be contrary to secularism , it would have \u201c annulled \u201d the nation . Secondly , there is no provision in the LAW stipulating that a person who wears a headscarf can not be an MP and that she can not take the oath in ORG in a headscarf . [ Nor does ] such a provision exist in ORG \u2019s standing orders . This can be understood from the fact that an initiative was recently launched in ORG to add such a prohibition to its standing orders . Besides , even if there were such a provision , this would be considered null and void because it would be contrary to the LAW . In fact , ORG does not have the right to act [ in a way ] which would bring about the abolition of the ORG rights to elect representatives and to be elected as representatives , which are CARDINAL of [ their ] basic rights . Actually , since the aim of the standing orders is to ensure the conduct of ORG \u2019s activities in an orderly way , a right can not be annulled with such a procedural action .", "CARDINAL . This judgment demonstrates that the dominant majority of ORG continues to apply its incorrect understanding of what \u201c secularism in a democratic system \u201d is . Unfortunately , ORG has interpreted secularism in many of its judgments in a totalitarian manner . According to the ORG , secularism is not a pro - freedom and pro - peace principle restricting the ORG , but is a higher principle legitimising the imposition by the ORG of a certain way of life on citizens . ORG considers secularism as the categorical refusal of the demands of religion in the social , public and political arenas . Therefore , it thinks that secularism authorises the ORG to remove manifestations of religion in society . Moreover , it exalts this principle to the level of being the most important value of the constitutional order . According to this understanding , democracy , the rule of law and human rights are all secondary values , which should [ only ] be recognised to the degree allowed by secularism .", "Here , the more interesting point is that ORG insists on continuing the doctrine of \u201c secularism as a project of social engineering \u201d , which was developed during the authoritarian ( occasionally totalitarian ) CARDINAL - party era , in the democratic - pluralist environment . It also stubbornly ignores the pro - freedom / democratic criticism of this notion . Despite the fact that even the NORP literature on the subject of \u201c secularism in a democratic system \u201d has expanded to a considerable degree in the last QUANTITY or fifteen years , our judges in ORG turn a blind eye to this literature . Furthermore , in this trial at least , our senior judges did not need to undertake additional efforts to obtain new sources and information on this issue . For example , there was detailed information in the defence brief on how secularism is understood and implemented in contemporary democracies , but it seems that the members of the ORG did not read these passages or if they did , they ignored it .", "In this connection , the CARDINAL judgments of ORG which directly concerned the issue of wearing headscarves and its judgments dissolving ORG and ORG indicate that this matter has become the key focus of secularism . The conclusion which the ORG has reached can be formulated as the following : \u201c to demand the freedom of wearing the headscarf means categorically being against secularism DATE and indirectly against the LAW . \u201d This is a totally wrong idea regardless of the perspective one has : it is anti - democratic , it is anti - freedom , it is contrary to secularism and it is pro - conflict . It is anti - democratic because it restricts in an arbitrary way the field of democratic politics and the sphere of activity of democratic political actors . It is anti - freedom because it is oppressive and imposing . It is contrary to secularism because it oppresses religious choices and creates discrimination on the grounds of religion . Finally , it is pro - conflict because it forces the ORG to quarrel with society and in this way it allows the ORG to destroy the social peace and order .", "CARDINAL . NORP The part of this judgment which ends the MP status of some politicians and prohibits them from involvement in further political activities does not contain valid grounds pertaining to the relevant individuals . Specifically , the application of the sanctions against ORG on the grounds that she \u201c was one of the people who brought about the dissolution of their party with their activity contrary to secularism \u201d bears no relation to reality and is a ridiculous assertion . The situation is really awkward . A high court imagines that it protects \u201c secularism \u201d by prohibiting a person from being involved in political activities and by ending the MP status of that individual , who meets the criteria of a \u201c contemporary way of life \u201d and \u201c contemporary personal appearances \u201d perfectly . Everybody knows that she has never been in favour of a political regime established on the basis of religion and that she has never made any effort in this direction . This is a typical example of the attitude of the ORG demonstrating the absurd results [ its ] formalist legal reasoning can produce .", "CARDINAL . All these explanations highlight that the statement of the chairman of ORG to the effect that \u201c there is nothing we can do , the laws force us to act in this way , if you do not want us to do so , change the laws \u201d , has no value from a legal point of view . It is true that the LAW and the laws in GPE are not pro - freedom ; therefore , it is , of course , necessary to improve the positive law . But the major problem in the judgment which dissolved ORG is not the unsuitable character of the current law . The problem is that ORG interprets the LAW and the laws which are in force in an authoritarian and narrow - minded way . Let us leave the necessity of ORG complying with the provisions of LAW and the GPE case - law [ to CARDINAL side ] . There are no serious grounds for dissolving ORG , even on the basis of the LAW and the Law on Political Parties . But there is no need [ to know ] the [ provisions of those ] laws to understand this fact . The notions which are needed are the notion of law , which does not see legitimacy as the same as the law [ itself ] , a considerable amount of knowledge about the technique of interpretation and legal reasoning and sensitivity to freedom and democracy . In other words , our problem is the fact that most of our constitutional law judges do not know the law , and do not have knowledge of democracy , political and constitutional theory or secularism . Nor do they intend to acquire it .", "It is assumed that the pro - freedom and pro - democracy case - law of ORG is brought about by the strict interpretation of the LAW . The real situation is different from the one which is assumed : when deciding on cases on the basis of the LAW , which does not include the concept of a \u201c political party \u201d , ORG concludes them by applying a broad interpretation to the provisions concerning freedom of association and expression in accordance with [ general ] principles and the universal understanding [ of those concepts ] . The NORP constitutional court judges , if they wished to do so and could develop the necessary intellectual skills , could ease the restrictive provisions of positive law in GPE . So long as they wanted to do so .", "Moreover , it is difficult to consider the aforementioned statement of the chairman to be sincere . If the problem is [ one of ] making changes to the LAW and the law , ORG actually enacted a statutory amendment , which defined [ what it means ] for political parties to become a \u201c hub \u201d in a highly reasonable way and which set criteria to ensure its implementation . Why did ORG annul this amendment in accordance with an authoritarian understanding ? In this case , the problem is related to the fact that our constitutional court judges have not taken on board freedoms , rather than the assertion that the current laws are unsuitable .", "CARDINAL . This latest judgment of ORG has demonstrated another thing : the professional capabilities of most of the court members are insufficient for the job . Moreover , they are not willing to compensate for this insufficiency . They are closed to knowledge , they have no passion for their jobs and they are incapable of becoming open - minded . They try to fulfil the requirements of their vital duty , finding their way out by sticking together , without feeling uneasy about it . It is because of this reason that the obstacle to freedoms in GPE is not ORG , which does not change the LAW and which does not enact the necessary laws . The real obstacle is ORG , which does not shy away from being the systematic shredder of freedoms . It is urgently necessary to deal with the issue of membership in ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears that following the publication of the article all members of ORG brought separate civil actions against PERSON , Mr PERSON and the publishing company ( hereinafter \u201c the defendants \u201d ) , seeking damages for the injury they claimed to have sustained as a result of the applicants\u2019 serious attack on their honour and integrity through the publication of the above article , which had contained , in their view , defamatory passages .", "CARDINAL . The present applications concern the damages claims brought against the applicants by PERSON , Mr Y.A. and PERSON , judges and in the case of the last claimant , the president , of ORG at the material time .", "CARDINAL . Before the domestic courts the applicants maintained that , while the expressions used in the article had been severe in terms of form and style , they had remained within the limits of the freedom of expression , as they had had a basis in fact . In this connection , the applicants , referring to the case - law of ORG , asserted that the article in question had criticised the judgment of ORG with respect to its decision to dissolve ORG , that the acceptable limits of criticism should be more extensive for judges , high level public officials and politicians than others , and that value judgments which were made on the basis of fact were in conformity with the law .", "On this latter point , the applicants , relying on the views of various academics , politicians and journalists , underlined that a segment of the public believed \u2013 rightly or wrongly DATE that the judgment of ORG had been given under the influence of the military and that there were certain parallels between the outcome of the judgment and the general political situation existing in GPE at the time . Likewise , again relying on various articles , notably certain statements made by a number of judges sitting on the bench of the higher courts , including ORG , the applicants argued that the statements regarding the lack of skill of the judges sitting at FAC were not without any factual basis .", "The applicants submitted that numerous criticisms had been voiced against the judgment of ORG by academics , journalists and politicians , and underlined that the first applicant , who was a professor of constitutional law , had consistently emphasised in his publications that the basic function of constitutional courts DATE or similar organs \u2013 in constitutional democratic systems is to serve as the guarantee of basic rights against arbitrary actions of the ORG and that high court judges DATE and indeed judges in general DATE have to avoid giving judgments corresponding to their ideological opinions and political tendencies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG of First Instance ordered the applicants to pay PERSON , jointly , MONEY ( GPE \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) in damages , plus interest at the legal statutory rate running from the date the article in question was published .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , the court referred to the following passages :", "\u201c ... it is commonly believed that this judgment is not the product of the free will of ORG but that it was brought about under pressure from and at the suggestion of military circles ... it is certain that the dissolution of ORG is closely related to the current political situation , the direction of which has been determined by the status quo powers ( \u2018 the deep ORG ) .
