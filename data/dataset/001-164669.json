His son , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and died on DATE . The present case concerns the investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a powerful explosion occurred at the facilities of PERSON , a company with headquarters in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the judicial decisions and the case file that the explosion was caused by the covert production of composite solid rocket fuel under the auspices of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The general information the ORG has been able to procure as to the production of rocket fuel and the risk of an explosion at production sites may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Composite fuel , also known as composite propellant , is a broad class of solid chemical fuels that are used as propellants in rockets . The rocket - fuel sheets resemble PVC folia but are less stable and require a specialised location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions . They are composed of fuel and oxidiser . An example of a fuel is phenol formaldehyde and of an oxidiser , ammonium perchlorate ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . ORG is a powerful oxidiser , which explains why it is used mainly in solid propellant rocket boosters , including space shuttles and military missiles .", "CARDINAL . ORG is a white , granular , crystalline solid or powder . Its explosive characteristics depend on particle size and granulometric composition . It is a class CARDINAL oxidiser ( it can cause an explosive reaction ) when particles measure over QUANTITY . It is classified as an explosive when particles measure QUANTITY . It has been apparently involved in a number of accidents . ORG is stable when properly stored , transported and handled at temperatures below QUANTITY ( oC ) . The amount put in any pile must be limited and storage sites must be designed with blast walls . The risks of explosion and fire associated with ORG arise mainly when there is a large proportion of ORG in a premix or when it is exposed to intensive heat or an organic compound . When heated to CARDINALoC , ORG degrades organic adhesive , breaking cemented joints . Complete reactions leave no residue .", "CARDINAL . At a series of meetings , an ORG executive had apparently agreed to the production of rocket fuel with a private company , ORG ( hereinafter \u201c JPL \u201d ) . The latter \u2019s experts were supposed to provide the formula and certain components , including oxidisers . Certain PERSON managers had allegedly been requested to make available a mill with CARDINAL counter - rotating rollers in its facilities for the production of polyvinyl chloride sheets , as well as other substances and its experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , most of the components were blended together in a batch mixer in another company , transported in aluminium bins to PERSON in a private car by ORG experts and stored next to the mill . When the mixture was put on the mill and extraction of the sheets of rocket fuel started , an explosion occurred in the presence of CARDINAL workers from the CARDINAL commissioned companies . As a consequence , the applicant \u2019s son and CARDINAL other people died , while QUANTITY others were seriously injured .", "CARDINAL . It appears from ORG and the expert reports that neither PERSON nor ORG was licensed and adequately equipped for the production of rocket fuel at the material time .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the investigating judge on duty , ORG , arrived at PERSON to inspect the scene of the incident . PERSON , the Deputy District Public Prosecutor Office ( hereinafter \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) , PERSON , a crime inspector , and PERSON , a crime - scene technician , were also present .", "CARDINAL . According to the investigating judge \u2019s CARDINAL - page report of his inspection of the incident scene ( zapisnik o uvi\u0111aju ) , at TIME on DATE a massive explosion occurred during the production of a new product DATE polyvinyl chloride sheets . The explosion greatly damaged the production room and killed a number of people who had been involved in the production process .", "When the investigating judge arrived at the scene , unspecified members of the factory \u2019s security staff and the GPE police prevented him and the prosecutor from entering the production room . They were requested to examine the scene two to CARDINAL steps away from the entrance door for security reasons , given that the damaged roof could have collapsed . The judge noticed that it had been a powerful explosion , and that the production room had been covered in dust and pieces of the roof , which also prevented a good overview of the room .", "As the judge could not inspect the incident scene , in order to gather evidence he talked to the director , GPE He had to wait TIME for the director to be found and to finish his telephone call with the GPE mayor , ORG The director stated that the explosion had occurred when the factory \u2019s experts with a team of additional experts ( part of the statement is illegible ) had apparently tested a new product - manufacturing process with which he was not familiar . However , he clarified that the manufacturing process required special security measures and teams , and named all of the factory \u2019s experts involved , including the applicant \u2019s son as a chief engineer . The technical director , PERSON , stated that his team of DATE employees had been testing a new product and that experts from other companies and faculties \u201c might have been involved \u201d in the manufacturing process that TIME . Presuming that CARDINAL people had died , he anticipated that the cause of the explosion may have been \u201c an unwanted , unexpected and unknown chemical reaction which had \u2018 broken out\u2019 during the process \u201d .", "The investigating judge instructed ( a ) the GPE police \u2019s expert team and the factory experts to continue looking for those involved who had died or survived ; ( b ) the crime - scene technician to collect and register all traces , objects and details which might help to elucidate the account of the events and to make an appropriate file in that respect ; ( c ) the removal of all the corpses to ORG for post - mortem examinations to determine the cause of death ; and ( d ) the transfer of all the survivors to the appropriate medical centres . All those activities and the relevant documentation were to form an integral part of the incident report .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his CARDINAL - page report on the forensic inspection of the incident scene ( izve\u0161taj o kriminalisti\u010dko - tehni\u010dkom pregledu lica mesta ) , the crime inspector , PERSON , noted that there had been traces of the destruction caused by a massive explosion which had occurred at TIME on DATE at the PERSON factory ( production room ) where bituminous materials were produced . He reported that CARDINAL corpses had been found and gave the names of several injured people who had been transported to hospital ( CARDINAL of them had died there ) as well as a short statement by CARDINAL of the workers who had been nearby . The inspector reported that the police firemen had already started extinguishing the fire , that the crime - scene technicians , GPE and ORG , had taken photographs , and that the criminal police ( PERSON slu\u017eba ( UZSK ) ) had taken on the case . The identification of the casualties and the cause of the explosion should have been determined the following day by specialised teams of criminal police . No other documents , photographs , scheme of the scene or results of any chemical or toxicological analysis , if any , have been submitted to the Court with the case file ; nor apparently were they made available to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an additional forensic report was drawn up after the fingerprinting and photographing of the bodies . The bodies were transferred for post - mortem examination , together with additional body parts which had been found in the meantime , while the clothing was sent to the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . The post - mortem examination of GPE bodies was carried out DATE by ORG in GPE . The autopsy reports stated that the GPE deaths had been violent and caused by the destruction of or damage to some vital organs and/or third and fourth - degree burns from the explosion , or complications thereafter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police ex officio set up a commission to examine the cause of the explosion . The commission was comprised of several officers from ORG ( NORP bezbednosti ORG - a ORG ) , as well as CARDINAL professors from ORG in GPE , GPE and GPE , who were also the co - owners of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Following site inspections DATE and computer simulations of the explosions , CARDINAL experts from ORG , GPE and ORG , submitted their report to the PERSON on DATE . As regards the cause and origin of the accident , the experts stated ( a ) that the explosion appeared to have been initially caused by the heat generated by the mill \u2019s rollers during the production of composite fuel ; ( b ) that static electricity could not have ignited the composite fuel , premix or fuel sheet ; ( c ) that the primary blast of the premix or the composite fuel sheet on the mill \u2019s CARDINAL counter - rotating rollers had most probably been caused by the presence of a mechanical object in the premix , which had ended up between the rollers ; and ( d ) that the initial blast had led to CARDINAL secondary explosions of the premix , which was stored in CARDINAL aluminum bins next to the mill .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG inspectorate lodged a criminal complaint against the Director of GPE , GPE , for breaching health - and - safety regulations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Previously , on DATE the ORG had informed the prosecutor that on CARDINAL and DATE they had been refused access to the factory and to documentation for inspection , and that PERSON had not informed them to that date about the fatal incident , as required by the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the prosecutor lodged a request for a formal preliminary judicial investigation against unknown persons from PERSON in respect of the explosion ( zahtev za sprovo\u0111enje pojedinih istra\u017enih radnji ) . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant sought to be granted victim status .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other GPE relatives lodged a criminal complaint against a number of senior executives of PERSON and ORG ( GPE , FAC , GPE , D.Z. , ORG . NORP , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , on the grounds that there was a reasonable suspicion that they had committed grave breaches of public safety regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , LAW in conjunction with LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The experts\u2019 report of CARDINAL DATE was served on the applicant on DATE . DATE , the applicant submitted numerous objections and posed questions . He questioned , inter alia , the expert commission \u2019s authorisation to investigate the case , the fact that it had focussed on the cause of the explosion without establishing whether the appropriate safety precautions had been taken , and the experts\u2019 conclusions , which were pure presumption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor lodged a request with ORG that the police experts be heard .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing scheduled for DATE , however , the investigating judge did not take statements from the experts . The applicant again objected to the experts\u2019 report . The investigating judge endorsed the PERSON request to be provided with all questions in writing and to be given DATE to answer . In their reply of DATE , the experts clarified that ( a ) on DATE at the scene of the incident , where they had gone ex officio , the investigating judge had instructed them orally to establish the cause of the explosion ; ( b ) they had not made any plan or programme for the expert report ; ( c ) they had not had sufficient information ( for example , on the original premix or the final product ) to examine and determine the cause of the blast , but they had found traces of ORG at the accident scene and had been provided with the formulae of the premix by ORG ; ( d ) they could not say whether the fire had started on the rollers , the fuel or the rocket - fuel sheet ; ( e ) they had not found any documentation about the planning or technology programme of the production of rocket fuel which had led to the blast ; and that ( f ) their task had been to establish the cause of , and not the responsibility for , the explosion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant amended his criminal complaint , relying on LAW in conjunction with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the prosecutor \u2019s proposal of DATE the court appointed ORG to determine and submit a report on whether the cause of the explosion had been of a technical nature or a human mistake . On DATE the Institute informed the investigating judge that it did not have the capacity to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was appointed to determine the cause of the explosion , whether it could have been avoided and the possible liability in that respect .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL unsuccessful attempts to receive additional relevant data , on CARDINAL DATE the Professor of ORG , GPE , submitted his report . He claimed that it was based on reliable data collected by ORG , given that , owing to the lapse of time , it was impossible to analyse any samples found on the site . He clarified further that he had not used most of the ORG \u2019s documentation , as it concerned computer - generated and simulated experiments of assumed events which could only indirectly hint at the possible answers . The expert stated that the collected data were incomplete and did not contain quantitative figures of the samples examined to allow any deeper analysis of the collected evidence or its compliance with the account of the events that had allegedly led to the explosion . While not excluding the possibility that the cause of the explosion might have been the CARDINAL suggested by the police experts , the expert observed that the possible exposure of ORG to humidity could have made it sensitive to an organic compound and the explosion could have been caused by a piece of paper , wood or engine oil , especially in the presence of unwanted metal or soot particles .", "CARDINAL . The expert also noted the following issues as relevant : ( a ) although explosive , carcinogenic and other dangerous substances were used during the production process , no technical - technological documentation and certificates for them had been found ; ( b ) the purity of the components , especially of ORG , was questionable ( it was described as light pink powder , whereas it was a white , crystalline substance ) ; ( c ) the samples revealed , unusually , included the presence of phosphates , which were not components of composite fuel , or equipment for the maintenance of the mill or the building itself ; ( d ) the production process and technology did not seem to have been accurately specified and followed , as certain components had been added and mixed on the mill in the course of the production process ; and ( e ) an unacceptably high number of individuals present had indicated that they did not know what had been produced and that other safety measures had probably not been taken .", "CARDINAL . Following the prosecutor \u2019s proposal of CARDINAL DATE , the investigating judge heard evidence from a number of witnesses to and surviving victims of the accident ( CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL were from GPE ) on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE . They were asked who had allowed GPE to bring the premix to PERSON , and whether they had known what it contained and what safety measures had been taken . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively the investigating judge also interviewed Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , Deputy Head and Head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge returned the case file with the collected evidence to the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge , on the prosecutor \u2019s initiative , withdrew the case file and sealed the statements of ORG executives , classifying them as ORG secret .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute , relying on secret evidence and information . He stated that a detailed analysis of the facts had been provided in an official note of DATE , which had been classified as confidential . He summarily dismissed the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint on the grounds that there were no elements of crimes prosecuted ex officio ( da se prijavljeno delo ne goni ex officio ) , invoking ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . By a letter of DATE , the applicant was informed about the prosecutor \u2019s decision and notified that he could pursue a subsidiary criminal prosecution within DATE of the date the letter had been served on him by lodging a request for an investigation ( zahtev za sprovo\u0111enje istrage ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that despite his request , he had not had access to the case file until DATE . In the meantime , he commissioned an expert report by the court \u2019s permanent specialist on explosives and blasts , ORG In her report of CARDINAL DATE , the specialist stated that most of the police experts\u2019 work had been incomplete or irrelevant , and gave the reasons for her assertions . She found that neither PERSON nor ORG had been registered and properly equipped for working with explosive materials , and that their employees had lacked the necessary skills and competences . She confirmed in principle , and further elaborated on , the findings of ORG expert and itemised the numerous failures of the CARDINAL companies to comply with the relevant provisions of ORG , Flammable Liquids and LAW concerning transporting and working with explosive materials ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted subsidiary prosecution against GPE , PERSON , GPE , PERSON and ORG by lodging a request with ORG that a criminal investigation be opened into breaches of safety regulations , referring to ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of the GPE ORG refused to open the investigation sought by the applicant ( izrazio neslaganje sa zahtevom ) , and referred the case to a CARDINAL - judge criminal panel ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG upheld the investigating judge \u2019s decision , having established that rocket fuel had been produced on the orders of the then NORP President , PERSON , and Mr PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The applicant appealed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision . On DATE it referred the case back to the GPE ORG for additional investigation , holding that the prosecuting authorities had failed to assess the evidence properly .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the prosecutor \u2019s request of DATE , the investigating judge commissioned ORG ( Vojno - tehni\u010dka akademija - Katedra za raketna goriva ) to draw up a fresh expert report in respect of the explosion . The ORG refused , claiming that it did not have the power to do so .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE and DATE the applicant filed an indictment and requested further investigative measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal chamber of ORG sent the case file back to the investigating judge , referring to ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The chamber instructed the investigating judge to open an investigation and interview the suspects . It stated that the CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG would again decide on his refusal to open an investigation once the suspects had been heard . It explained that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a subsidiary indictment without first carrying out an investigation , even with the investigating judge \u2019s permission to file a direct indictment , if the suspects had never been questioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the investigating judge opened an investigation . DATE and DATE he questioned all CARDINAL suspects and gave individual decisions on investigation in respect of each of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge again appointed ORG to draw up a report establishing in a clear and conclusive manner the cause of the explosion and which irregularities in the production process had led to the blast . In a short report drawn up in DATE , the ORG stated this time that their task was apparently to examine the cause of the explosion , not the possible failure of any of the suspects to protect those involved from the risk of explosion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge closed the investigation . The applicant was informed and instructed that he could file an indictment as a subsidiary prosecutor within DATE if he so wished .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL others filed an indictment , laying blame on CARDINAL former senior executives of PERSON and ORG , GPE , PERSON and GPE , as well as on Mr R.L. , former Deputy Head of ORG , for failing to take measures that had been required of them to prevent the lives of the applicant \u2019s son and others from being avoidably put at risk or to mitigate casualties . By DATE , ORG rejected all of the objections raised by the defence that the indictment was defective , and upheld the indictment .", "CARDINAL .

The CARDINAL scheduled hearings ( DATE , DATE and DATE ) were adjourned because of the presiding judge \u2019s other commitments and/or because CARDINAL or more of the defendants had failed to appear in court .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE , the court heard CARDINAL defendants ( GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) and adjourned to decide on further objections to the indictment . DATE and DATE , the competent courts dismissed the indictment in respect of LOC and GPE , because the applicant had failed to name them as suspects in his earlier criminal complaint for the crimes at issue ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which were , in principle , supposed to be prosecuted firstly ex officio . The hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned to allow the court to decide on ORG \u2019s objection , and the next hearing scheduled for DATE , on DATE , was cancelled as the case file had been at ORG to decide on appeals on points of law lodged by other suspects ( ORG , PERSON GPE ) against the courts\u2019 decisions on their objections .", "CARDINAL .
