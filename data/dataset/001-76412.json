The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the applicant \u2019s birth , the ORG - appointed guardian brought an action against ORG , the applicant \u2019s putative biological father , seeking a declaration of paternity and payment of a contribution towards his maintenance . PERSON admitted that he had had sexual relations with the applicant \u2019s mother but denied paternity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant \u2019s birth , his mother declared on registering the birth that the father was PERSON , with whom she had had sexual relations during the period of conception .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the action for a declaration of paternity . In the absence of an appeal , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , who had been placed with a foster family , met his mother , who informed him that his father was PERSON According to the applicant , he had regular contact with his father and received presents from him and a DATE payment of MONEY ( ( CHF ) \u2013 PERSON euros ( EUR ) ) until he reached the age of majority . PERSON and his family denied those allegations . Only PERSON \u2019s legitimate son admitted that he had received a telephone call from the applicant after PERSON \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG always refused to undergo tests to establish his paternity . In DATE , shortly after his death , a blood - type analysis carried out at the applicant \u2019s request did not rule out his being the latter \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant contacted ORG to have a private paternity test carried out , but his request was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant successfully applied to renew the lease for ORG \u2019s tomb until DATE for the sum of CHF MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for revision of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In the course of the proceedings he also requested a DNA test on the mortal remains of ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request for a DNA test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Canton of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application on the ground that it was impossible to obtain a declaration of paternity without also amending the register of births , deaths and marriages .", "CARDINAL . ORG argued that the applicant was not entitled to such an amendment of the register as a result of the DATE revision of LAW abolishing the exceptio plurium constupratorum , a defence which the putative biological father could use in a paternity suit . However , in his application to ORG the applicant had sought revision of the DATE judgment , in which the exceptio plurium had been relied on to the benefit of ORG", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that DATE ( when the revised Civil Code had come into force ) , an illegitimate child who was DATE on DATE had had the option of converting a maintenance claim into a civil action ( paternity suit ) where the exceptio plurium had been raised . However , this was no longer permitted under the revised Civil Code .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly held that , even supposing that the applicant had been awarded maintenance in DATE , he was no longer entitled to have the register of births , deaths and marriages amended , firstly because the law had changed , and secondly because he had been born DATE before the end of the transition period between the old and new laws .", "CARDINAL . His request for evidence to be taken by means of a DNA test was therefore refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment , served on DATE , in which it rejected the applicant \u2019s application on the following grounds :", "\u201c The right to know one \u2019s parentage can not be absolute in scope but must be weighed against the interests relating to protection of the personal freedom of others \u2013 in the instant case , the right of the deceased , deriving from human dignity , to protect his remains from interferences contrary to morality and custom , and the right of the close relatives to respect for the deceased and the inviolability of his corpse . ...", "The right to know one \u2019s parents is generally linked to the right to be raised by them . The applicant , who is DATE , has been able to develop his personality and pursue a large portion of his existence without suffering any medically attested damage to his physical or mental health as a result of his uncertainty as to his parentage , despite the vicissitudes of his childhood and adolescence . On the other hand , while the reasons of family devotion opposing the exhumation of the mortal remains of the late [ ORG ] are understandable , the respondents have not advanced any religious or philosophical grounds in support of their position ; in particular , they have not argued that they would have renewed the lease on their relative \u2019s tomb had the applicant not done so .", "However , in weighing up the conflicting interests , the refusal of the application for an expert examination may be upheld since , in the absence of any consequences of a civil - law nature , the applicant has not established that he has suffered sufficiently serious damage to his psychological well - being , as protected by the right to personal freedom , to justify the evidentiary measure requested . The measure appears excessive in view of the principle of proportionality , having regard to the applicant \u2019s particular circumstances , from which it can not be concluded that his personality or mental stability might be seriously threatened by the uncertainty that may still persist as regards his parentage , in spite of all the information in his possession suggesting that [ ORG ] very probably is his father . ORG was therefore entitled to restrict the applicant \u2019s personal freedom by taking into consideration that of the respondents , in view of the lack of public interest in having this parental tie established and the disproportionate nature of the steps required to establish it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG observed that there were no consequences of a civil - law nature that could justify implementing the measure sought ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
