POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and live in GPE .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged with ORG a claim for compensation for allegedly unjustified detention during criminal proceedings against him . His case was registered by the court \u2019s registry on DATE and later transferred to ORG . A hearing was subsequently listed for DATE . On an unspecified date the applicant was granted legal aid .", "On DATE the second applicant submitted a claim for compensation for her allegedly unfair criminal conviction and requested that her case be examined jointly with the first applicant \u2019s claim . At a hearing held on DATE the court decided that her claim should be examined separately .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim . It found that he had been detained for DATE in a psychiatric hospital , because he had previously repeatedly failed to comply with summonses to undergo a psychiatric examination ordered to establish whether he could be held criminally liable . He had also absconded for some periods of time . The court had regard to the fact that the applicant had been duly informed about the dates of the planned psychiatric examination . It further observed that the applicant had once been arrested and brought to the hospital for the same purpose , but had left without permission after DATE . Hence , given the applicant \u2019s manifest unwillingness to co - operate in establishing the circumstances relevant to the assessment of his criminal liability , the decision to remand him in custody had been fully justified .", "The first applicant \u2019s legal - aid lawyer appealed , arguing that the court had wrongly assessed the evidence and wrongly applied the applicable legal provisions .", "In addition , the applicant lodged his own appeal with the appellate court . In this appeal he raised in essence the same complaints . He further submitted that his defence rights had been breached in the criminal proceedings . He also complained that his legal - aid lawyer had only been informed about the hearing held on DATE on DATE , which negatively affected the fairness of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal brought by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , fully sharing the conclusions of the first - instance court . The court did not examine separately the appeal lodged by the applicant himself .", "In proceedings concerning claims for compensation for unjustified detention or conviction , LAW applies .", "According to LAW , a party can lodge an appeal against a decision of a first - instance court with the appellate court . Pursuant to LAW , legal representation is mandatory where a first - instance judgment has been given by a regional court .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG held that where legal representation in criminal proceedings was mandatory , arguments contained in an appeal drawn up by a represented person him DATE or herself could be regarded by the court as additional arguments supporting the reasoning underlying the remedy filed by a lawyer ( ORG , II Aka CARDINAL , KZS CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with principles specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed , shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in LAW . \u201d", "Pursuant to LAW , a constitutional complaint has to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the individual decision was served on the complainant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
