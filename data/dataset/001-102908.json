On DATE the prison 's governor , relying on the relevant regulations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) and having regard to a note in which the investigating authorities had described the charges against the applicant , his character , and their assessment of the risk that he could pose to prison staff , ordered that he be placed within an isolated group of prisoners subjected to stringent security measures and be deprived of the right to take part in communal activities . In a follow - up decision of CARDINAL DATE the governor ordered that the applicant be handcuffed each time he was separated from that group .

They cited a note drawn up by the prison 's governor , which said the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is even now extremely hostile towards the legal order of GPE . He does not accept his conviction and sentence , and considers the criminal proceedings against him to be unfair and biased . He shows complete disregard to others , and acts rudely and arrogantly when approached . Extremely mistrustful , suspicious and hostile towards all prison staff . His irascibility , undisguised cruelty and spitefulness , and constant nervous tension make him especially dangerous and unpredictable . His attitude towards the other inmates in his group does not differ markedly from the CARDINAL described above . He refuses to socialise with others , hates everything and everyone . He enters into sporadic contacts with the group 's hygienist when necessary . Refuses to take part in communal activities . On several occasions he was offered work , which he pointedly turned down . When taken out for visits and in the presence of larger groups of people , he often loudly makes negative remarks about the courts and the prison administration .

The ORG has visited GPE CARDINAL times . PERSON was visited in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report on the DATE visit ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) says :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL lifers at FAC at the time of the visit ; CARDINAL were being accommodated in the mainstream prison population , while the rest were held in a separate unit in the section used for disciplinary isolation ... Lifers in the separate unit were accommodated in single cells measuring QUANTITY m\u00b2 ; the cells had a small barred window , set too high in the wall to afford a view out . There was integral sanitation which reduced the limited space in the cell ; however , the cells would provide adequate sleeping accommodation for CARDINAL person provided these prisoners were offered a varied programme of out - of - cell activities during the daytime .", "However , in contrast to the situation observed in [ CARDINAL other prisons ] , life - sentenced prisoners in FAC lacked communal activities . They were locked up in their cells except for periods of outdoor exercise ( TIME like the rest of the inmates at FAC ) , which all but CARDINAL lifers took together . The lack of group activities is not justifiable in security terms , given that life - sentenced prisoners already exercise together . The delegation was told of plans to set up a group room for association and other activities for lifers , which would be opened in the near future . In - cell activities included watching TV and reading books from the library and a DATE newspaper ; further , CARDINAL lifers worked in their cells ( making gift bags ) . CARDINAL prisoner interviewed by the delegation complained that he had been refused permission to have a personal computer in his cell to do a computer literacy course .", "The CARDINAL lifers who did not join the others for communal exercise were segregated under orders reviewed DATE . Whenever they were outside the cell , they were handcuffed , including for exercise which they took alone in a secure yard . In the ORG 's opinion , there can be no justification for handcuffing a prisoner exercising alone in a secure yard , provided there is proper staff supervision . ORG recommends that the NORP authorities review their current policy as regards the handcuffing of the above - mentioned life - sentenced prisoners , in the light of these remarks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report on the DATE visit ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) says :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ A]t the time of the visit , there were CARDINAL life - sentenced prisoners at FAC . CARDINAL of [ them ] had been integrated into the mainstream prisoner population , while the remainder were being held in a separate unit ( Group CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Material conditions of detention in the lifer unit had remained basically unchanged since the DATE visit ... The installation of integral sanitation in the cells , with a shower head over the toilet and access to hot water DATE , was a positive feature ; however , as a result , prisoners had less occasions to leave their cells and interact with staff .", "Some of the lifers had their own television sets and play - stations in their cells . At the time of the DATE visit , lifers had had hot plates in their cells , to cook food , which increased their sense of independence and helped to pass the time . The hot plates had reportedly been withdrawn DATE before the visit for safety reasons , and lifers had immersion coils for heating water .", "DATE . As regards activities , CARDINAL notable change since the DATE visit was the entry into operation of a social room ( \u201c club \u201d ) in the lifer unit . This good facility was decorated in pleasant light colours and furnished with bookcases , a chess table with CARDINAL chairs , a larger table with CARDINAL chairs , a cupboard with games including a backgammon board , a television set with DVD player and a sink . Lifers were divided into CARDINAL subgroups on the basis of common interests ( playing cards , chess , discussing legal matters , etc . ) and each group was allowed to use the social room for TIME each weekday . At DATE , there were only the CARDINAL officers present , which made it difficult to organise activities .", "Lifers who were willing to work ( CARDINAL of the CARDINAL in the lifers unit ) worked in their cells on the same kinds of piece work as was observed on the DATE visit ( e.g. putting strings on boutique bags ) .", "Further , outdoor exercise for TIME per day was offered to all lifers . The delegation noted that a shelter had been provided at CARDINAL end of the exercise yard .", "Despite the above - mentioned welcome introduction of a social room , which increased the amount of time spent out of the cells and in association with other prisoners , the DATE regime in the lifer unit remained monotonous . The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities strive to enhance the programme of activities provided to life - sentenced prisoners at FAC , if necessary , by increasing staffing .", "CARDINAL . Staff on the lifer unit indicated that CARDINAL of the inmates were in DATE of a life sentence and were therefore subject to particular security restrictions . The CARDINAL lifers were escorted in handcuffs and were not allowed television . It was up to the Director to review the use of handcuffs , but there was no time limit on their use and no regular review period .", "As already stated in the report on the DATE visit , the ORG considers that there can be no justification for routinely handcuffing a prisoner within a secure environment , provided there is proper staff supervision . ORG recommends that the NORP authorities review the policy of handcuffing life - sentenced prisoners when outside their cells .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has in the past expressed its serious misgivings about the current legal provisions whereby lifers are systematically subjected to a strict and segregated regime for an initial period ordered by the sentencing court ( i.e. DATE ) . This approach runs counter to the generally accepted principle that offenders are sent to prison as a punishment , not to receive punishment .", "The ORG does not question that it may be necessary for some prisoners to be subject , for a certain period of time , to a special security regime . However , the decision whether or not to impose such a measure should lie with the prison authorities , be based on an individual risk assessment and be applied only for the shortest period of time . A special security regime should be seen as a tool of prison management , and not be made part of the catalogue of criminal sanctions to be imposed by courts .", "In many countries , lifers are not viewed as necessarily more dangerous than other prisoners ; many of them have a long - term interest in a stable and conflict free environment . Therefore , the approach to the lifer management should proceed from individual risk and needs assessment to allow decisions concerning security , including the degree of contact with others , to be made on a case - by - case basis .", "Whereas lifers should not be systematically segregated from other prisoners , special provision should be made to assist lifers and other long - term prisoners to deal with the prospect of DATE in prison . In this respect , reference should be made to Rule CARDINAL of ORG which states that \u201c particular attention shall be paid to providing appropriate sentence plans and regimes for life - sentenced prisoners \u201d , taking into consideration the principles and norms laid down in ORG on the \u201c management by prison administrations of life - sentence and other long term prisoners \u201d .", "Pursuant to NORP law , after DATE of their sentence , lifers are eligible for allocation within the mainstream prisoner population if they have behaved well and have had no disciplinary punishments . However , in practice , only a minority of lifers ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL at FAC ) had found their way into the mainstream , some after many years served in the lifer unit . The ORG invites the NORP authorities to build on the success of the \u201c experiment \u201d of integrating some life - sentenced prisoners into the mainstream prison population , which should be considered as an appropriate part of the management of this category of prisoner and reinforced by legislative measures .", "More generally , the ORG recommends that the NORP authorities review the legal provisions and practice concerning the treatment of life - sentenced prisoners , in the light of the above remarks . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
