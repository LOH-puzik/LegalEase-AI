By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG replied that while there was no evidence known to them to raise a true suspicion that PERSON had been murdered , a review of the initial police investigation would be carried out . By letter dated DATE , ORG reviewing the case stated that there was still no evidence that the death was suspicious but that as he was not satisfied that the initial investigation met the required standard he had tasked further work to be done e.g. further witness statements and consultation of a medical expert . A further letter dated DATE stated that the persons interviewed had not witnessed any violence , or heard any shouts nor had they any knowledge of alleged hangings by prison officers and that the expert evidence to date made no reference to suspicious death or foul play . By letter dated DATE , which commented on the solicitors\u2019 delay in putting forward their new medical opinion , ORG noted that this opinion added nothing new and indeed confirmed previous reports .", "By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors drew the attention of the police to the civil judgments obtained in other cases in which there was evidence of death threats and mock hangings . They therefore were calling for a public inquiry into the events at the prison and the systematic abuse of inmates and requested that the case be reviewed in light of the civil cases and the convictions of prison officers in DATE . On DATE , the ORG agreed to review the matter again . The outcome of this review is expected shortly but no further steps are anticipated as likely to result .", "On DATE , the applicants\u2019 solicitors presented a dossier to the Chief Inspector of Prisons detailing ill - treatment of CARDINAL prisoners in FAC and CARDINAL prisoner at PERSON and , inter alia , expressing their view that a statutory inquiry into the allegations be instituted . Their report led to criminal investigations and a series of inquiries .", "The applicants\u2019 solicitors came to represent CARDINAL other prisoners who made allegations of assaults by prison officers during this period . CARDINAL civil claims were later brought against ORG by inmates at FAC .", "An internal prison inquiry was launched , headed by PERSON , the head of ORG . His inquiry team consisted of QUANTITY persons , QUANTITY of whom were permanent members of ORG but independent of the operational line . None had ever served at FAC .", "On DATE , the first part of the interim report issued . It dealt with the CARDINAL prisoners named by the solicitors in their dossier , plus the first applicant who had been added later . It recommended , inter alia , that allegations by CARDINAL prisoners ( including the first and eighth applicants ) be referred to the police for investigation of serious criminal offences ; that identified staff involved in those incidents be suspended pending the outcome of those proceedings and that any other staff identified during the investigation as being involved be suspended ; that in view of the absence of any evidence that there had been internal prison investigations into specific allegations and due to the chaotic state of other investigations as well as concerns about the effectiveness of senior management supervision of the care and control unit , the Director of ORG be suspended from duty while a disciplinary investigation took place . The report also mentioned that the preliminary investigation revealed that CARDINAL other allegations had been made about ill - treatment since DATE , CARDINAL of those occurring in the segregation unit and that there could be no assurance that these had been properly followed up at the time . It recommended that confidence - building steps be taken immediately , including the installation of ORG in the segregation unit and all routes to the unit , particularly those used when prisoners were subject to the use of force ; DATE visits to the segregation unit by a governor grade ; that the unit operate on the basis of open access to other departments and ORG ; and that accurate records be kept in the segregation unit", "On DATE the second part of the interim report issued . It referred CARDINAL more allegations concerning ill - treatment in the segregation unit , and CARDINAL allegations concerning other parts of the prison , to the police for investigation ; and it recommended that the Director General review the case for suspension against CARDINAL more prison officer ; and that the prisoner grievance procedures receive an immediate and thorough overhaul . In total , CARDINAL of the original cases in the solicitors\u2019 dossier were handed over to the police for investigation and CARDINAL of the cases transmitted to the police for their information . The report finally identified in general terms other aspects relating to prison administration , management and training that could be pursued further .", "ORG investigated a number of individual claims of physical violence by prison officers against inmates . They carried out CARDINAL investigations called Mevagissey I and Mevagissey II . It appears that in DATE charges were lodged against CARDINAL prison officers in connection with CARDINAL separate complainants , which resulted in CARDINAL convictions in DATE and DATE . In another QUANTITY criminal cases , CARDINAL went to full trial and resulted in acquittals for CARDINAL officers , in CARDINAL the judge directed an acquittal of CARDINAL officers and in CARDINAL the prosecution offered no evidence , leading to the formal acquittal of CARDINAL officers .", "On DATE , the applicants\u2019 solicitors presented a further dossier to the Home Secretary , listing the allegations of ill - treatment by over CARDINAL inmates , including the applicants and PERSON , and arguing for the necessity of holding a public inquiry .", "In DATE , the Chief Inspector of Prisons issued a report , following an unannounced inspection of ORG .", "\u201c As this report shows , the failure to establish , publicly and independently , what took place at Scrubs during DATE has severely hampered attempts to change the culture and regime there , or to establish whether there were underlying systemic problems which may need addressing in this , and other , prisons . For that reason , many of those involved in Scrubs , from ORG to the ORG , have supported the call for a public inquiry . I would like to stress that this inspection , thorough though it is , is no substitute for that : it is a snapshot of the prison as we found it in DATE . This ORG does not of itself have the powers or the mandate to investigate past events ... Prisons are closed environments and it is vital that an independent and external spotlight is directed on them when something appears to have gone seriously wrong . \u201d", "The applicants\u2019 solicitor renewed their request for an inquiry by letter of DATE to ORG , pointing out that there was no risk of prejudicing the criminal investigations , which had apparently come to an end . They threatened judicial review proceedings to require him to hold a public inquiry .", "On DATE , ORG replied that ORG was still considering possible prosecutions and that it would not be right to hold an inquiry . By letter dated DATE , it was stated that the ORG Secretary would review the matter whenever the civil proceedings had finished , it appearing that there would now be no further criminal proceedings .", "Following conclusion of the civil proceedings in which all claims were settled , the solicitors wrote to ORG on DATE reiterating the need for a public inquiry .", "In proceedings in ORG on DATE , in answer to a question about Wormwood Scrubs and a possible public inquiry , ORG reply referred to the visit by ORG of Prisons in DATE in respect of which it had been found that \u201c it was a greatly improved prison , gradually implementing and consolidating fundamental changes \u201d . Most noticeable of all was the \u201c change in attitude and approach of Prison Officers \u201d .", "By letter of DATE , the ORG Secretary stated that he was not convinced that a public inquiry would be in the public interest or serve any useful purpose in improving the effective operation of ORG , taking into account the disciplinary actions taken , the criminal investigations which had led to prosecutions and convictions , the civil claims which had been settled and the wider actions taken in ORG . While the incidents had been wholly unacceptable , he concluded that those incidents and the systems which allowed them to occur had now been properly and fully investigated , lessons had been learned and effective action taken to address those failings . In respect of the death of PERSON , he noted that the case had been subject of a criminal investigation , an inquest and a further review by the LOC police . Taking into account also the lapse of time , he considered that it would not be in the public interest to hold a public inquiry into that case .", "On DATE , the ORG Solicitor provided the applicants\u2019 solicitors with a copy of the full ORG , noting that a redacted version had been available during the civil proceedings . He declined to make available any copies of other reports . The applicants state that CARDINAL other internal inquiries ( referred to as the Hind , PERSON and PERSON inquiries ) had been conducted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
