The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was CARDINAL of the parties to civil proceedings instituted against , inter alia , him ( as possessor ) , concerning the recission of a contract of perpetual emphyteusis of a hotel owing to a failure to effect the relevant payments , namely PERSON et proprio et nomine v ORG and for any interest they might have PERSON [ the applicant ] and PERSON . In these proceedings the address of the applicant ( the then defendant in the proceedings ) was correctly marked as \u201c FAC , GPE FAC , GPE \u201d , and the claimant \u2019s address correctly marked as \u201c DATE , PERSON , GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the first - instance court found against the defendants and ordered the property to be returned to the claimant . The defendants had DATE to vacate the property .", "CARDINAL . Caral Ltd , the holder of the emphyteusis and main defendant , did not appeal . In consequence , the rescission of the emphyteusis and the eviction of ORG became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . The appeal application was signed by PERSON , the Assistant Advocate for Legal Aid . On DATE , through the assistance of PERSON ( in his capacity as ORG ) , the applicant requested legal aid ( Article CARDINAL of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure \u201c COCP \u201d ) . In both the appeal application and the legal - aid request , signed by PERSON , the addresses of the applicant and the respondent were inverted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted legal aid and PERSON and PERSON were nominated as advocate and legal procurator respectively for this purpose . The applicant was informed that he should enquire at the court registry for details of those nominated . It would appear that he did not make an enquiry at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court bailiff unsuccessfully attempted to serve notification of the appeal on the respondent at \u201c FAC , FAC , GPE \u201d ( the applicant \u2019s address ) . In consequence , he marked the notification as undelivered \u201c riferta negattiva \u201d ( see Relevant domestic law ) and noted that the venue was derelict .", "CARDINAL . No further attempts at notification were made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the first appeal hearing conducted in the absence of both parties , the appeal was declared to have lapsed ( been deserted ) , on the basis that no notification of the appeal application had been made to the respondent within the peremptory DATE period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ordinary courts requesting the revocation of the decision of DATE , in that it had been issued on the basis of a lack of notification as a result of an error in the address of the respondent as submitted in the appeal application signed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the applicant \u2019s request was rejected as unjustified on the basis that it had been the applicant , through his legal representative , who had supplied the erroneous address and during the rest of DATE the applicant had not taken any steps to rectify the error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged another application with the ordinary courts , requesting the revocation of the decision of DATE . He argued , inter alia , that the error had been made by ORG and not by himself , and that he had never been given a copy of the procedural acts presented in his name , which would have enabled him to rectify the error . On DATE the applicant \u2019s case was dismissed as it was substantially the same as his previous request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) . Referring to ORG judgments LAW QUANTITY ( c ) , he complained that the decision of DATE and the decisions confirming it denied him the right to a fair trial , to legal assistance and to access to court as guaranteed by LAW . He therefore requested the court to revoke the said decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . Having considered the evidence , the court noted that the relevant addresses in the appeal folder had been incorrect and that at the time ( after the appeal application against the decision of DATE ) the applicant was not in contact with ORG but with legal counsel who had acted for him previously , and maybe PERSON , his appointed advocate for legal aid . However , neither of these advocates advised the applicant to verify the acts of the proceedings . Thus , neither the applicant nor a legal representative had ever verified whether the respondents had been successfully notified . In consequence , ORG found that the applicant was mostly responsible for causing the case to lapse , as he had failed to conduct the necessary verifications and had failed to prove that what had happened had been beyond his control . Even assuming that the initial error was imputable to somebody else it was up to the applicant to follow up his appeal proceedings . Moreover , unlike in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) the error in the present case did not make the appeal null and void , and it could have been avoided if the applicant had been careful to monitor the state of his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He argued , inter alia , that in view of an error on the part of an agent of the ORG , the application of \u201c lapsed \u201d status ( desertion ) provisions to his case had had disproportionate consequences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his claims on the merits . It reiterated that throughout DATE the applicant had done nothing to correct the underlying error or to follow up his appeal proceedings . The case was the applicant \u2019s and not the lawyer \u2019s and therefore it was the applicant \u2019s responsibility to show assiduous interest in what was going on and to follow the case scrupulously . The error in the present case was a minor one and could have been corrected . It was , therefore , irrelevant who had originally made the mistake . A simple check could have easily been made with the court \u2019s registry . However , nothing had been done , and in consequence CARDINAL attempt to notify the respondent had been made .", "CARDINAL . As to the application of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law ) of LAW ( \u201c COCP \u201d ) , ORG held that the provision used the word \u201c may \u201d and therefore the court was not obliged to make any assessment to decide whether the use of the provision would be justified . In any event , in the present case , it had appeared that notwithstanding the first failed notification ( riferta negattiva ) nothing had been done to request a second notification . It followed that the court \u2019s decision not to make use of the provision had been justified . Moreover , procedural rules safeguarded the interests of both parties and those of legal certainty .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the present case , LAW , regarding desertion of causes , read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Saving the provisions of sub - article ( CARDINAL ) and of articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the written pleadings in any cause shall be closed , in first instance , within the peremptory time of DATE , and , in second instance , within the peremptory time of DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) The time shall commence to run , in first instance , from DATE on which the sworn application is filed , and , in second instance , from the date of the application of appeal for the reversal or variation of the judgment appealed from .", "( CARDINAL ) If it is found that the written pleadings in any cause set down for hearing are not closed , the court may order such cause to be again placed with the causes the pleadings whereof are not yet closed and fix for the closing of the pleadings of that cause a peremptory time not exceeding one month .", "( CARDINAL ) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub - article ( CARDINAL ) , the pleadings shall be deemed to be closed if the party not served with the pleading necessary for the close of the record appears at the trial and does not raise the question that the pleadings are not closed and proceeds or knowingly allows others to proceed to further acts without raising such question . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , sub - article CARDINAL above was amended to read as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) If , even where the peremptory times referred to in sub - article ( CARDINAL ) shall have lapsed , it is found that the written pleadings in any cause are not closed , the court shall once only give such orders which it may deem fit so that such pleadings may be closed as soon as possible in order to avoid that such cause be deserted by reason of some failure to notify or by reason of the failure of performance of a procedure or formality .", "( CARDINALA ) The desertion of a cause shall be declared by means of a decree delivered in open court if , after the orders referred to in sub - article ( CARDINAL ) shall have been given , the written pleadings are not closed .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE amendments , LAW , regarding the signing of pleadings , read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The written pleadings and the applications whether sworn or not shall be signed by the advocate and also by the legal procurator , if any . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to NORP practice , once an advocate or legal procurator pays the dues relevant for the notification ( notifika ) of an act , the bailiff will attempt to deliver notification to the address indicated . Subsequently , the bailiff must record the outcome of his attempt in the court file . Thus , an individual can learn whether the bailiff has successfully notified the other party or otherwise by virtue of a note ( ir - riferta ) that the bailiff sticks on the back of the document in the case file , which may be consulted in the registry . In the event that notification was unsuccessful , the stamp on the back of the document will be in red ( riferta negattiva ) . If notification is successful the stamp on the back of the document will be in blue ( riferta pozittiva ) . In the case of a \u201c riferta negattiva \u201d , the bailiff normally notes down the reason why notification was unsuccessful . Further notification will require payment and the relevant instruction depending on the bailiff \u2019s written comments . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c The officer charged with the service of an act shall , on DATE when he serves or unsuccessfully seeks to serve the act , or , at the latest , on DATE , draw up a certificate stating whether the service was effected or not . In the affirmative , the certificate shall state the name and surname of the person on whom service was effected and , if the act was not served directly on the person on whom service was to be effected , the name and the surname of the person to whom the copy was delivered and the place where the act was served ; in the negative , the certificate shall state the reason why service was not effected . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the judgments of ORG v Commissioner of Police , of DATE and ORG v ORG , of CARDINAL DATE , both cases decided by ORG ( First Hall ) in its Constitutional Jurisdiction , in the same single judge formation , ORG entered into the admissibility and where necessary the merits of the applications , notwithstanding that the applications to the court had been presented by the claimant without the assistance of a lawyer . However , ORG did not deal specifically with the respondents\u2019 objection that the application was null and void , on the basis that it had not been signed by an advocate , as required by law and confirmed by the judgment in PERSON v ORG of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
