The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in PERSON and the second , third and fourth applicants live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants and the father of the third and fourth applicants instituted civil proceedings against the ORG , seeking that they be recognised as owners of CARDINAL plots of land in the coastal zone ( u zoni morskog dobra ) . They submitted , in particular , that the land at issue had been lawfully owned by their father , but that without any legal basis the ORG appeared as the registered owner thereof in ORG , and that they should be declared owners as their father \u2019s legal successors ( kao pravni sledbenici ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in PERSON ( PERSON , podru\u010dna jedinica ORG ) , acting upon the first applicant \u2019s request , issued a decision allowing the division into CARDINAL of an adjacent plot of land , a forest in the coastal zone , the registered owner of which at the time was the Municipality . The Municipality remained registered as the owner of CARDINAL part of it , whereas the other part was registered in the name of the applicants\u2019 predecessor ( the father of the first and second applicants , and the grandfather of the third and fourth applicants ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a remittal , ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE ruled against the first and second applicants and the third and fourth applicants\u2019 father . The court found that the land at issue had indeed been owned by their predecessors , notably their father , grandfather and grand - grandfather , but that they had not proved that they had inherited it when their last predecessor had died in DATE . Notably , the court considered that the land at issue was in the coastal zone and thus ORG property pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE and \u201c section CARDINAL and other sections \u201d of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , and that the claimants could not claim the right to property in respect of such land . The court made no reference to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As regards the ORG \u2019s submission that the land had been nationalised , the court noted that the contents of the decisions relied on by the ORG could not be clarified . Notably , ORG Dr\u017eavni arhiv ) informed the court , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , that the case files and decisions PERSON and PERSON , referred to by the ORG , had not been found in that institution . Finally , the court considered that ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was \u201c of no particular influence \u201d ( bez posebnog uticaja ) given that it related to a different plot of land which was not the subject of these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal the first and second applicants and the third and fourth applicants\u2019 father confirmed that the said land had not been in their predecessor \u2019s estate when he died , which was exactly the reason why they had initiated these proceedings . They also submitted that : ( a ) LAW CARDINAL of LAW had never been complied with even though it was indisputable that their predecessor had lawfully owned the land ; and ( b ) the relevant legislation did not prohibit private ownership of land in the coastal zone , and referred to section CARDINAL of LAW and LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . They reiterated that the adjacent plot of land , also a forest in the coastal zone , was privately owned , by them , and submitted the decision of ORG . They maintained that the first - instance court \u2019s reasoning that the said decision was of no influence indicated legal uncertainty , given that the same legal issue was treated differently without any explanation in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the first - instance judgment . It found that the land at issue was indisputably forest in the coastal zone , that it was ORG property pursuant to LAW and that the claimants therefore could not claim ownership . The court further held that even assuming that the claimants had had ownership of these plots of land , they had lost it \u201c in accordance with LAW and LAW . In support of this was also section CARDINAL of LAW , relied upon by the claimants , which provided that the owners of land in the coastal zone , who had obtained it in a lawful manner before that LAW entered into force and which was duly registered in ORG as private property , were entitled to compensation in case of an expropriation \u201d . ORG made no reference to the decision of DATE and the status of the adjacent plot of land , or as to whether the claimants could have inherited the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the previous judgments . The court made no explicit reference to the adjacent plot of land and the decision of DATE . It held as follows :", "\u201c As the real estate at issue is in the coastal zone regime DATE common resource ( dobro od op\u0161teg interesa ) , the lower courts correctly applied the substantive law when they ruled in the said way . Notably , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , which had been in force until LAW entered into force ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) , coast is owned by the ORG and could not be object of the private property .", "The claimants were wrong to consider that the issue was to be resolved by means of LAW . That provision regulated the rights of the owners of land in the coastal zone who had obtained the property thereof before that LAW entered into force by providing that they were entitled to compensation in case of an expropriation [ ... ] . That means that the land did not remain in the private property regime , but became ORG property by the law itself .", "Likewise , section DATE ) of LAW DATE is inapplicable to the present case as it can not be retroactively applied to relations which had arisen before it came into force . Exceptionally , the right to property over a coastal zone can be acquired only after it entered into force . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants and the third and fourth applicants\u2019 father lodged a constitutional appeal . They submitted , inter alia , that it was not true that land in the coastal zone could not be privately owned , as numerous plots of land in that zone were private property , including the plot of land adjacent to the CARDINAL at issue , which was owned by them . They invoked the right to a fair trial and the right to property , and reiterated the importance of legal certainty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the constitutional appeal . It held that the lower courts\u2019 assessment \u201c was based on a correct application of substantive law and a constitutionally acceptable interpretation thereof , in accordance with LAW . As regards LAW No . CARDINAL the court held that a claim which had been dismissed because the claimants did not meet statutory conditions was not considered a possession that could constitute property rights , and thus there could be no violation of such a right either . This decision was served on DATE at the earliest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third and fourth applicants\u2019 father died , leaving the third and fourth applicants as his heirs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a general legal opinion ( na\u010delni pravni stav ) relating to the use of land in the coastal zone . In reaching this opinion , ORG analysed the relevant domestic legislation , including the LAW , LAW DATE , LAW and LAW . It found , inter alia , that section CARDINAL ) of the Property Act provided that exceptionally coastal zone can be privately owned , while at the same time section GPE ) of the same Act provided that the coast can not be privately owned . It also found that the conditions under which the coastal zone can be privately owned are not provided for by law ( nisu zakonom odre\u0111eni ) , \u201c which leaves open numerous questions on practical implementation \u201d . The court concluded that \u201c by analysing [ the relevant legislation ] it can be concluded that acquiring private property rights in respect of the coastal zone is not possible save in exceptional cases which are not defined by legislation . It can also be concluded that the issue of lawfully acquired rights in respect of the coastal zone is not regulated in a precise and clear manner ... \u201d , but that it was a fact that there were lawfully acquired property rights over the coastal zone , as indicated by CARDINAL of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
