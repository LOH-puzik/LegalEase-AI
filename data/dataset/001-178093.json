NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his former wife , GPE , are the parents of PERSON , who was born in DATE in wedlock . From DATE the parents lived in separate households and PERSON lived together with her mother . The parents , however , continued to share custody . On DATE GPE applied for sole custody of PERSON On DATE the applicant and GPE concluded an agreement before ORG under which sole custody of PERSON was awarded to GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and GPE divorced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and GPE concluded a court settlement concerning the contact rights of the applicant in respect of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for joint custody over PERSON and requested GPE to agree to this application . However , GPE disapproved of the applicant \u2019s application for joint custody as there were ongoing disputes between the parents . The applicant , on the other hand , stated that he wished to be involved in PERSON \u2019s life and to be included in decisions concerning her education , medical issues and other matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicant , GPE and PERSON ; at the end of the hearing the applicant and GPE confirmed that they would continue to adhere to the settlement of DATE concerning the contact rights of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held a further hearing in the course of which the applicant , GPE and PERSON were examined again , dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for joint custody . It based this decision on Article CARDINALa of LAW , under which joint custody is only possible in the event of both parents consenting . The applicant requested the court to apply to ORG for review of the constitutionality of this provision , but ORG held that a court of first instance did not have the authority to lodge such an application .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that Article CARDINALa of the Civil Code was unconstitutional and in violation of his Convention rights ; he also asked ORG to request ORG for review of the constitutionality of this provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for an application to ORG for judicial review in respect of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , as ORG had no concerns regarding the constitutionality of these provisions . Referring explicitly to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG found that the present case must be distinguished from ORG . Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , which applied in the present case , parents had joint custody of their child . If after divorce CARDINAL parent were to ask for sole custody then the court , taking into account the well - being of the child , had to transfer custody to CARDINAL of the parents . By contrast , Article CARDINAL of LAW , which was at issue in ORG , provided that custody of a child born out of wedlock was from the very beginning to be granted only to the mother of that child . Given that in the event of the termination of joint custody after divorce or following an agreement between the parents , the law did not grant either of the parents a privileged position as regards the award of sole custody , there was no indication that this was discriminatory . If CARDINAL were to follow the reasoning of the applicant that it should be possible to simply request the re - establishment of joint custody at any moment following a final court decision lifting joint custody or an agreement of the parents to that effect , the binding force of decisions whereby joint custody had been lifted would be rendered meaningless , which was in contradiction to the principle of legal certainty ( Rechtskraft ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed furthermore that the first - instance court had not made any findings as to the ability of the parents to find compromise ( GPE ) indispensable for the meaningful exercise of joint custody . From the content of the case file and in particular the expert reports submitted , it could , however , be deduced that at the time of the termination of joint custody , the parents lacked this ability , and there was no indication in the file that the situation had improved in the meantime . In such a situation it was not in the interest of the well - being of a child that once joint custody had been granted , every single issue on which parents did not agree \u2013 such as which school a child should attend \u2013 had to be determined by decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an ordinary appeal ( ordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and asked ORG to apply to ORG for review of the constitutionality of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as inadmissible . The ruling was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . ORG found that if custody of a child had been granted to CARDINAL parent , either by a court decision or by agreement between the parents , then in the interest of consistency of education ( ORG ) a change of the person having custody could only be granted if there existed a risk to the well - being of the child . It was not decisive whether the circumstances of CARDINAL parent were better than those of the other . ORG noted that in his application for joint custody the applicant had not even made the argument that circumstances had changed since the decision on custody of ORG of DATE had become final , and he had not given any other reasons ( as required by LAW ) to justify a different ruling . The mere presupposition that joint custody exercised by both parents might be better for the well - being of the child was not a sufficient justification for interfering with a binding decision . Furthermore , the ability and intention of both parents to share their responsibility is an indispensable precondition for joint custody . It could be clearly seen from the case file that there was no agreement between the parents regarding the issue of joint custody and that no coordinated action when exercising joint custody could therefore be expected from them .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE amendment to LAW ( see para . CARDINAL below ) , on DATE the applicant lodged an application for joint custody of PERSON However , on DATE , he withdrew this application .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , as in force at the material time read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the marriage of the parents of a minor legitimate child is dissolved or annulled , the custodial rights of both parents remain intact . However , they may present an agreement to the court DATE even modifying an existing agreement \u2013 regarding custodial responsibility . In this connection it may be agreed that CARDINAL parent alone or both parents shall have custody . Where both parents have custodial powers , those of CARDINAL parent may be limited to specific matters .", "( CARDINAL ) Where both parents have custody , they must submit an agreement to the court regarding the parent with whom the child is to stay primarily . This parent must always be put in charge of all custodial matters .", "( CARDINAL ) The court must approve the agreement of the parents if it serves the interests of the child . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If an agreement under LAW on the main domicile of the child or on custodial powers is not reached within a reasonable period after a marriage is dissolved or annulled , or if [ such an agreement ] is incompatible with the interests of the child , the court must decide which parent shall henceforth have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If both parents have custody under LAW after their marriage has been dissolved or annulled , and if one parent applies for the withdrawal of that custody , the court must decide which parent shall have sole custody , if all attempts to reach an amicable solution fail . \u201d", "", "CARDINAL . It is noted , however , that on DATE the relevant provisions of ORG were amended significantly . The relevant sections read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the marriage or the common household of the parents is dissolved , joint custody is maintained .
