GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr S. Tsakyrakis , a lawyer practising in GPE . The Government were represented by PERSON , Senior Adviser , ORG , and PERSON , ORG , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant graduated from ORG of PERSON in DATE . ORG were , at the time , the only institutions training the future teachers of elementary schools and all graduates were eligible for appointment to the public school system . After graduation the applicant moved to GPE where he worked as a teacher of NORP language at the elementary school of GPE from DATE untill DATE .", "In DATE he returned with his wife and CARDINAL children to live permanently in GPE . On DATE he applied to ORG and Religion asking to be appointed as a teacher to a NORP public school . The appointments were made according to a seniority list comprising all persons having the necessary qualifications , mainly a degree from a ORG . The immediate result of his application should have been his registration in the list , so that he could be appointed when his turn would come .", "On DATE the Ministry rejected his application and returned his documents because the applicant was a NORP \u2019s Witness . ORG indicated that according to an opinion of ORG , it was prohibited for persons believing in religions or dogmas other than ORG to be appointed as teachers .", "DATE Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL was enacted and explicitly provided in section CARDINAL that persons believing in religions or dogmas other than ORG were eligible for appointment as teachers . Immediately after the enactment of that law the applicant resubmitted his application asking to be registered in the list of DATE . However , the Ministry registered him on the DATE list .", "By DATE all those who were on the DATE list had been appointed , but not those who were on the DATE list . By DATE the applicant realised that , with the pace the appointments were made , he would not be appointed at all . In effect , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL provided that no one over DATE could be appointed as a teacher and the applicant would become DATE in DATE .", "On DATE he applied to ORG asking to be considered as registered in the DATE list , which would have resulted in his immediate appointment .", "On DATE his application was rejected on the ground that Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL had no retroactive effect , so the applicant was not eligible for registration on the DATE list .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG asking it to quash the decision rejecting his application .", "By judgment CARDINAL of DATE ORG dismissed the application . It held that the authorities had correctly applied Law DATE which introduced an entirely new provision regarding the appointment of non - NORP teachers . Law DATE was not intended to interfere with the seniority lists of the past . Any possible violations of LAW or LAW on religious freedom occurred in DATE and should have been challenged at that time .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He maintained that PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not introduce an entirely new provision but instead tried to remedy the illegal practice of the authorities to exclude all non - NORP from employment in the public education system . If it were to be construed as not having retroactive effect , this would constitute by itself a new and direct violation of the LAW and the LAW .", "By judgment CARDINAL of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the ground that the refusal of the authorities in DATE did not constitute an executory administrative act , but it was a mere repetition of the initial refusal of DATE and the subsequent registration in the DATE list and as such could not be subjected to judicial review . In particular , ORG held that : \u201c Since the applicant challenged neither the initial refusal of his request nor his subsequent registration in the seniority list of DATE , which contained an omission to register him in the list of DATE , the final decision of the Minister of ORG ... has not an executory character and the applicant \u2019s action against it must be dismissed as inadmissible ... \u201d .", "LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Primary education and kindergarten teachers of another dogma or religion who are candidates for appointment will be appointed and placed in public primary schools with CARDINAL teaching posts ... as the case may be , provided that they meet the qualifications of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the cases of the above - mentioned paragraph , these teachers will not teach the course of religion , except to students believing in the same dogma or religion , provided that the said course is included in the curriculum .", "CARDINAL . The teachers of paragraph CARDINAL may also be appointed to primary schools and kindergartens with CARDINAL teaching post , if they are students of the same dogma or religion attending that school or kindergarten . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
