FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was employed by the city of GPE as an adviser in housekeeping , giving for instance cooking courses . Her employer made a report to the police , alleging that she had embezzled money .", "The public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for aggravated embezzlement etc . during the period DATE and DATE , amounting to ORG ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The complainant , the city of GPE , claimed damages . The applicant denied the charges as well as the other claims .", "ORG k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) heard some twenty witnesses during DATE . On DATE ORG , composed of a professional judge and CARDINAL laymen , convicted the applicant and sentenced DATE imprisonment . She was ordered to pay damages amounting to ORG plus interest and legal costs . Insofar as the sentence was concerned , the judgment was not unanimous , as it was based on the opinion of CARDINAL lay judges , whereas the professional judge in his dissenting opinion considered that DATE and DATE suspended imprisonment was a sufficient sanction .", "At this point , the public prosecutor ordered a further pre - trial investigation to be carried out as to what information the applicant 's superiors and other employees of the complainant had in DATE concerning income allegedly unaccounted for .", "Subsequently , the applicant learned that lay judge T. , who had examined the case in ORG , was an employee of the complainant in her case .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , denying the charges . She argued that lay judge ORG had been disqualified from deciding her case for the aforementioned reason . She also requested an oral hearing with a view to adducing more documentary evidence , rehearing a witness and hearing new witnesses . According to the applicant , the witness statements before ORG were not properly entered into TIME and only statements supporting ORG conclusions were included .", "On DATE ORG gave judgment , finding that lay judge T. had not been disqualified and , having listened to the audio tapes from ORG hearings and read the new pre - trial report , that the proposed new evidence would not clarify the matter further . Thus , holding an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary . ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "The applicant requested leave to appeal to ORG , still denying the charges and requesting , at any rate , that her sentence be reduced . She maintained that lay judge PERSON had been disqualified from deciding her case . She also requested an oral hearing before ORG .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal .", "ORG gave judgment on DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) . As to the alleged disqualification , ORG found that lay judge PERSON , who at the relevant time had worked as a special teacher employed by the city of GPE , had not lacked impartiality . ORG , referring to the relevant provisions in domestic law , gave the following reasoning for its decision :", "In assessing whether a judge is disqualified , attention has to be paid also to the provisions in LAW and the case - law of ORG . In light of ORG case - law , a judge must not hold a preconception or a have a prejudged view of the case in question or have a desire to favour one of the parties ' interests ( subjective impartiality ) . In addition , all legitimate doubts as to the judge 's and the tribunal 's impartiality must be eliminated ( objective impartiality ) . In assessing impartiality from the last - mentioned point of view , attention has to paid to whether the judge 's previous activities , his relations to the parties or the composition of the court from an objective point of view give a party reason to believe that impartiality is jeopardized .", "No one has indeed argued that lay judge T. would have been disqualified on subjective grounds . The question is what position should be taken on the fact that ORG was an employee of the complainant , the city of GPE . A party , such as the defendant in criminal proceedings , may understandably be worried , if the composition of ORG includes a layman employed by the opposing party . Some weight may be given to the party 's opinion of partiality based on employment , but what is decisive is whether the suspicion can be considered to be objectively justified . In assessing the case from this point of view ORG supposes that a layman can not be considered disqualified merely on the ground that he is employed by a party to the proceedings . Attention has to be paid on the one hand to the size of the employer and the importance of the case in question to the employer and on the other hand to the character of the employee 's functions . In the present case , by DATE , the city of GPE had CARDINAL employees , including both permanent and temporary staff . Lay judge T. , in his capacity as a temporary special teacher , was not part of the city 's governing body nor had he any commission of trust . Neither was he involved in the housekeeping service in question . T. had a permanent post as a school welfare officer within the ORG federation of municipalities vocational school , to which he could return when his temporary post ended . According to PERSON , special attention was paid to the guarantees of an impartial trial when the lay judges were chosen to sit in on the present case . In these circumstances , PERSON 's doubts as to the impartiality of the court can not be considered to be justified from an objective point of view .", "Thus , ORG finds that the afore - mentioned relationship between ORG and the city of GPE , the complainant in these criminal proceedings , is not such that it could justifiably call his independence and impartiality as a lay judge of ORG into question . Thus , ORG can not be considered to be disqualified .", "ORG furthermore , noting that ORG had found that holding an oral hearing would not have clarified the matter , saw no reason to differ . It upheld the applicant 's conviction , but reduced the sentence to DATE suspended imprisonment .", "LAW , LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , as in force at the material time , provided in relevant part :", "\u201c ... The following shall be the legal grounds for disqualification [ of a judge ] : when the judge is related by blood or marriage to CARDINAL or the other party in a manner where marriage is prohibited under LAW , including cousinship by blood although not by marriage ; when the judge is the opposing party or a public opponent of a party ; when the judge or his or her relative here listed has an interest in the case , when they stand to obtain particular benefit or suffer particular loss as a result of it ; when the judge has served as a judge in the case in another court ; when the judge has served as an advocate or a witness in the case ; or when the judge has previously , on the orders of a court , decided a part of the case ; or when the judge has a similar case pending before another court . ... \u201d", "According to the LAW section CARDINAL , the provisions of law concerning disqualification of a judge apply also to laymen ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
