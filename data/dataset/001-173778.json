It took me over DATE to figure out a solution to this problem . I came to the realisation that the best way to approach [ it ] would be to file a request with the Mayor of the District in order to clarify the issue , even though I had already informed the current local mayor and Mayor of ORG ( w\u00f3jt ) of the allegations .", "The facts and circumstances are as follows .", "The local mayor of GPE , PERSON , whose term in office was concluded on the election of the current local mayor , PERSON , received grants for the benefit of the village from the LOC and accepted payments from the lease of the village shop .", "During his term in office , he never asked the residents or the local council for what purpose the money should be used . He managed the funds arbitrarily and , I think , used them for building works , namely the renovation of the community hall ( \u015bwietlica \u2013 dom ludowy ) .", "However , he never shared the accounts with the residents of the village ; in particular how much money there was and what it was spent on .", "There are many rumours going around the village , which out of respect for your office I will not be repeating .

The residents explained that their intention had been to clarify the questions raised , given PERSON \u2019s involvement in matters such as the community hall refurbishment and running of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s letter from DATE contained false information , which supported the finding of a violation of ORG personal rights . This included statements claiming that PERSON , acting in his capacity as local mayor , had taken rent from the lease of the village shop . The domestic court established that even if PERSON had taken any payments , he had done so as chairman of the ORG . The court also found that the village shop was located in the building owned by the ORG , which also hosted the community hall , and that the rent under the lease was paid to the ORG through an intermediary , its treasurer . PERSON , as chairman of the ORG , merely set the amount of rent to be paid DATE . The court also found that during PERSON \u2019s time in office , the community hall had been open for public use ; in that respect it dismissed the testimony of some witnesses stating the opposite . At the time , there were also building works being carried out in the same building . It was established that nobody , and this included PERSON , had received any money in cash for the work . It was also established that the village had not received any funds directly from the commune . The commune had paid the costs of the renovations of the ORG \u2019s building .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , emphasising that the publishing of false information would result in a violation of a person \u2019s personal rights . It rejected the applicant \u2019s claim that the petition was merely an expression of doubt concerning the lawfulness of PERSON \u2019s actions when he was local mayor . The court considered that the timing of the applicant \u2019s actions proved that they had not served the public interest and had been motivated by his desire to win the elections . He had raised his concerns DATE after DATE PERSON \u2019s mandate during the electoral campaign which PERSON had lost . The applicant received a copy of the judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
