THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE . At the time of the introduction of his application , the applicant was detained in FAC the GPE , GPE , GPE .", "The applicant is represented before the ORG by PERSON ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE , GPE , and by Mr PERSON ORG and Mr PERSON , both of ORG .", "A.", "On DATE a bomb exploded at FAC in GPE killing CARDINAL members of the security forces and wounding CARDINAL others . A young girl was also injured in the explosion . The bomb had been planted near FAC , situated at the basement level at the point of entry to the military wing of the hospital . The basement of the military wing of the hospital was linked to the basement of the main block ( \u201c the PERSON wing \u201d ) by an underground passage . A steel door separated the PERSON end of the passage from the tunnel leading to ORG . The draw - bars of the door had been wholly or partly sawn through with a hacksaw .", "The applicant , who was a porter at the hospital , was arrested while on duty at TIME on CARDINAL DATE pursuant to section DATE of ORG ( Temporary Provisions ) Act DATE . He was taken to ORG for questioning . Traces of explosive were found in the interior of his car and on a pair of white cotton gloves found under the front passenger seat of the car . CARDINAL pieces of metal swarf were found in the front passenger \u2019s foot - well and CARDINAL pieces of swarf were found on a pair of trousers belonging to the applicant which were seized following a search of his house . The applicant was cautioned under LAW ( GPE ) Order DATE at the time of his arrest and before his first interview .", "The applicant was first interviewed at TIME on DATE . When questioned , he replied : \u201c I \u2019ll not be saying anything until I see my solicitor \u201d . At his second interview , his only comment was : \u201c I \u2019ll make a statement when I see my solicitor \u201d .", "In the early part of his third interview from TIME to TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant continued to say nothing when questioned about his involvement in the explosion . However at some stage in the course of the third interview the applicant was asked : \u201c to get this matter out into the open \u201d . The applicant then proceeded to give an account of his involvement . This account was explored in the course of the subsequent interviews . The essence of the applicant \u2019s explanation was that he had agreed , under duress , to take CARDINAL men to the hospital on DATE . On DATE he drove the CARDINAL men to the hospital and parked his car in the hospital car park . They all went to the basement of the PERSON wing and he held the steel door open to allow the CARDINAL men to enter the military side of the underground passage . After the QUANTITY men had emerged from the passage he shut the steel door . They all exited the basement . The applicant stated that when he was told by the QUANTITY men to hold the steel door open he knew then that they were going to plant a bomb .", "The applicant \u2019s solicitor was not present during any of the interviews . The applicant saw his solicitor between the conclusion of his interview at TIME on DATE and the beginning of his next interview at TIME on DATE . The applicant continued to speak freely to the police after seeing his solicitor .", "After CARDINAL interviews the applicant was charged at TIME on DATE . He replied \u201c not guilty \u201d to the murder charges put to him .", "The applicant was tried before a judge sitting without a jury at ORG . At his trial , no challenge was made to the admissibility of the applicant \u2019s various statements on any ground . The applicant himself gave evidence and , while repeating facts suggesting duress , changed his defence and pleaded a lack of knowledge , foreseeability and intention of the crimes with which he was charged . The trial judge found :", "\u201c In the context of this case however , I had not the slightest difficulty in finding that [ the applicant ] was putting forward a completely lying defence . Hearing and observing him over DATE in the witness box left me in no doubt at all . His lies were deliberate and comprehensive \u2026 He was cunning in his attempts to build up his new defence of lack of knowledge of the operation \u2026 In cross examination he was evasive and sought to contradict an earlier answer or obscure it with vagueness when he thought it suited . My conclusion about the complete lack of credibility of his defence was based not only on my subjective conclusion , that is , a compelling impression of his lying demeanour in the witness box , but also on the objective view that the story he was telling was inherently unbelievable \u2026 \u201d", "The trial judge found that the applicant was a willing participant in the plan to blow up FAC . He further found that the applicant had full knowledge of and was party to the plan and knew it was organised and would be carried out by members of the IRA . The judge observed that the applicant knew the layout of the hospital and its system of working , its security and where the military congregated . In the judge \u2019s view , the applicant , before he set out to drive the CARDINAL men to the hospital , knew that their plan was to plant and explode a bomb close to FAC with the intention of killing soldiers congregated there . The applicant gave the CARDINAL men assistance in the preparation , planting and priming of the bomb in the tunnel . In giving this assistance , the applicant knew that it was in furtherance of the plan and particularly in the tunnel he knew that he was assisting the planting of a bomb which , when exploded , would cause grievous bodily harm , if not death , to the soldiers in FAC . For the trial judge , the applicant , like the other participants , had intended to kill the soldiers .", "The trial judge concluded that the applicant was guilty of murder , attempted murder and the related charges on those findings .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted on CARDINAL counts of murder , CARDINAL counts of attempted murder , of causing the bomb explosion and of being in possession of the bomb with intent contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE . The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder counts and to DATE imprisonment on the attempted murder counts . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment on the count of causing the explosion and DATE imprisonment for being in possession of a bomb . All the sentences were to be served concurrently .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . He contended , inter alia , that his trial was unfair since the police refused him access to a solicitor during interview and that the trial judge had made extensive use of the applicant \u2019s admissions during interview . Counsel for the applicant submitted that the trial judge , in the exercise of his discretion , should have excluded the admissions because the applicant did not have his solicitor present during interview .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s reliance on the opinion of ORG in the PERSON v. the GPE application : Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c We therefore hold that , whatever view ORG may eventually take of the content of the rights under LAW , it is not to be regarded as ipso facto unfair within the meaning of section ORG GPE ( Emergency LAW Act DATE if a person detained under LAW Act DATE has not been permitted to have his solicitor present during the process of questioning by the police . Accordingly the learned trial judge could not properly have been required to exercise his discretion under section ORG ) of the DATE Act in such a way as to exclude the [ applicant \u2019s ] statements on the sole ground that he was refused permission to have his solicitor present with him during the interviews . This ground of appeal must therefore fail .", "In reaching this conclusion we have borne in mind [ the applicant \u2019s counsel \u2019s ] related point that LAW ) Order DATE created such a \u201c coercive pressure \u201d ( to use his phrase ) that the requirement of a solicitor \u2019s presence during interview was highlighted . We do not accept that LAW implies such a requirement . If that had been the intention of ORG we have no doubt that it would have said so in clear terms . We do not agree that LAW creates a \u201c coercive pressure \u201d : it represents a conscious attempt by ORG to achieve a balance of fairness when \u2026 the law abiding members of the community are beset by so much ordinary as well as terrorist crime . \u201d", "B.
