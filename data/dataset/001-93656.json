Finally , it should be underlined that even if the accused requests to be brought to an appeal hearing , the court may establish that the presence of the lawyer at the appeal hearing would be sufficient .

ORG on many occasions found that a refusal to bring the accused to the appeal hearing was a flagrant breach of law that could significantly affect the substance of the second - instance judgment . In such cases , ORG quashed the appeal judgment and remitted the case ( judgment of DATE , III KKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , III KKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that when the defendant remanded in custody was unable to have effective contact with his legalaid lawyer and was not summoned to the hearing before the appellate court because the summons had been sent to his home address , the defendant \u2019s defence rights had been breached .

A new decision on legal aid has to be made if the convicted person wishes to institute further proceedings in order to lodge a cassation appeal with ORG .

In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( V ORG CARDINAL , OSNKW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG stated that cassation proceedings had a special character in that the judgment essentially became final after it had been upheld by the appellate court . Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings , the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights . It was the lawyer \u2019s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court . If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so , there was no legal basis in LAW that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment , or to oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the refusal of a legalaid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time ( V ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of DATE . ORG observed that the court could only assign a new legalaid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success . If this were not the case , a court was not obliged to assign a new legalaid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .
