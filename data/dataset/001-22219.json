DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , living in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The respondent Government are represented by its Agent Mr PERSON , ORG , and its Co - Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "By indictment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant , at that time a practising lawyer , jointly with CARDINAL of his clients , henceforth called ORG , was charged with aggravated breach of trust alleged to have been committed in their roles as manager and/or chairman of the board of CARDINAL companies , owned by ORG over a short period DATE , during which period , they had let the companies purchase CARDINAL industrial properties from a company controlled by ORG at a price substantially above market value , the amount including an agency commission to ORG exceeding MONEY ( ORG ) , whereby the acquiring companies suffered or risked suffering a corresponding financial loss . The companies went bankrupt on DATE .", "Moreover the applicant ( and ORG ) was charged with fraud alleged to have been committed in the same period relating to the sale of CARDINAL cars to a person henceforth called ORG under the pretence that the cars were not in pawn .", "The applicant and ORG pleaded not guilty on both counts . As regards the second count they claimed that ORG acted in bad faith . Several hearings were held in ORG . During these proceedings ORG and CARDINAL other witnesses were heard , including CARDINAL witnesses henceforth called ORG , ORG and ORG .", "The prosecution and the defence agreed not to hear CARDINAL witnesses henceforth called ORG and ORG .", "By judgment of DATE ORG of Ballerup ( ORG ret ) convicted the applicant ( and ORG ) . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and deprived of his right to practise law . From the judgment it appears that in order to convict the applicant ( and ORG ) of aggravated breach of trust the court relied partly on the testimonies given by ORG and ORG concerning the contents and aim of some particular transactions these witnesses had with ORG . As regards the charge of fraud it appears that the court relied partly on the testimonies given by ORG and IK concerning the sale of the CARDINAL cars .", "The applicant ( and ORG ) appealed against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) . During these proceedings CARDINAL witnesses were heard , including ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . As regards these witnesses the applicant expressed doubts during the proceedings in ORG as to their credibility and therefore requested the prosecution to provide information about their criminal records , and that counsel for the defence be allowed to ask questions , in writing , about any pending charges which might have been brought against them concerning financial crime . In accordance with LAW ( PERSON ) this was complied with . ORG and ORG confirmed that charges were brought against them . ORG had previously been convicted of fraud and fraudulent preference .", "On DATE the High Court of Eastern Denmark upheld the judgment , but increased the sentence to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . As regards the conviction for aggravated breach of trust ORG referred to the reasoning given by ORG . However , regarding the conviction for fraud ORG relied , in addition to the reasoning given by ORG , on testimony given by a witness who was not heard before ORG .", "After the trial in ORG and due to press coverage , the applicant and counsel for the defence , accidentally became aware that within the police a so - called ORG in DATE had composed a note called \u201c Anti - Social Trade \u201d ( PERSON ) , henceforth called the note , illustrating a new pattern of crime , and outlining CARDINAL named individuals suspected of being interrelated in a network of financial crimes in GPE , mainly concerning fraudulent trading in connection with deliberate bankruptcy intentions , breaches of laws concerning bookkeeping and accounting in companies , customs and excise fraud committed in connection with car sales , and finally fraud related to the raising of credit secured on real property . Among the persons mentioned in the note were the applicant , GPE , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . The note contained information about judgments , charges , dropped charges , and mere suspicions against each person in regard to the above criminality , and a statement of their assumed mutual business connections . According to the note it was ascertained that this limited circle , among others , systematically exploited those loopholes and ambiguities in the NORP legislation , which sometimes arise in connection with new legislation and/or reorganisation of administrative procedures .", "It appears from the introductory paragraphs of the note that ORG for ORG PERSON ) in DATE decided that ORG was to illustrate this new pattern of crime . ORG was not supposed to go into depth as to bring forth evidence to prove that crimes had been committed , it was merely intended to outline the information available . If the result turned out as expected the purpose was to have a special group appointed from several different police units , as none could manage the task alone for resource reasons . This group was then to make concrete investigations with the targeted attempt to have proceedings instituted against the individuals in question .", "The note was distributed to ORG , ORG ( GPE ) , the ORG Commissioner of Police ( GPE ) and the various police districts .", "The prosecution did not submit the note , either to the applicant , or to the court during the criminal proceedings against the applicant", "The applicant requested leave to appeal against the above judgment of ORG to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . With a view to this counsel for the defence asked the prosecution , on DATE , to submit a copy of the above note . However , access to the note was refused by ORG on DATE , by ORG on DATE and by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "The applicant then brought legal proceedings before ORG of Eastern GPE against ORG requesting that counsel for the defence be given access to the note .", "Before ORG as regard the nature of the note in general ORG referred to its reply of CARDINAL DATE to a question from ORG , according to which inter alia :", "\u201c The note has been drafted by ORG ... mainly for use in deliberations on how to rank the cases in order of priority , on combinations of resources and on prosecution competence ...", "On the basis of the note ... concrete investigative steps were taken , and that was the primary purpose of the note ... several of the individuals referred to in the note have been prosecuted and a number of them have been convicted .", "The note contains a compilation of a series of particulars and suspicions ... concerning CARDINAL named individuals . The note was thus a good foundation , in an investigating context , for the police and the prosecutors to ensure better co - ordination of the investigation and the commencement of prosecution in cases regarding financial crime ... \u201d", "ORG of LOC found for ORG . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG , before which the prosecutor in the applicant \u2019s trial as a witness stated that he was given a copy of the note as general material like all other prosecutors working for ORG , but since the note did not form part of any specific case , he did not use it in connection with his work on the applicant \u2019s case .", "ORG found for the applicant on DATE , stating as follows :", "\u201c According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of ORG the defence is entitled to have access to material produced by the police . As stated by ORG in his notice No . CARDINAL of DATE , to come within the scope of this provision , the material needs to have some connection with the relevant trial . However , it does not have to be of real importance to the investigation or to the possible continuation of the prosecution .", "From the Minister of ORG \u2019s answer of CARDINAL DATE to ORG it appears , among other things , that as a result of the \u201c Anti - Social Trade \u201d note and in accordance with the main aim of the note , specific measures and investigation were initiated .", "ORG does not dispute that the applicant , the co - accused and some of the witnesses who were heard during the applicant \u2019s trial figure in the note , including the mutual relationship among some of them . The investigations were initiated shortly after the note was composed , and both the persons in charge of the investigations and the prosecutor were in possession of the note .", "In these circumstances , ORG considers that the note has such a connection with the applicant \u2019s trial that the defence is entitled to have access to it cf . section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of ORG . \u201d", "A copy of the note was hereafter sent to the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . Subsequently , in support of his request for leave to appeal the applicant alleged that LAW had been violated , notably as the principle of equality of arms had not been complied with . In this respect he referred to the content of the note , with which both the police and the prosecution were familiar , but which was not available to counsel for the defence during the criminal trial .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal to ORG for which reason the High Court judgment of DATE became final ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
