{"ITEMID": "001-22959", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "STANFORD v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and currently in prison in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was convicted of rape , indecent assault , kidnapping and threats to kill in relation to CARDINAL girls , aged QUANTITY and CARDINAL respectively . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . In DATE he was again imprisoned having been found guilty of CARDINAL counts of indecent assault .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG on CARDINAL counts of rape and CARDINAL counts of indecent assault concerning CARDINAL male minors , CARDINAL brothers aged QUANTITY and DATE . He was further convicted on CARDINAL charge , and he pleaded guilty to CARDINAL charges , of taking indecent photographs of CARDINAL of those minors .", "He was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG in relation to the rape conviction .", "In that regard , the trial judge stated inter alia :", "\u201c the evidence and your demeanour in the witness box throughout this case demonstrate that you are a scheming , manipulative and highly plausible paedophile with a quite appalling record behind you ... You are in my view a dangerous man when at large where young children of either sex are involved . Under LAW ... I have no alternative but to pass an automatic life sentence , which I do with no lack of conviction or enthusiasm . \u201d", "The applicant was also sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for each indecent assault conviction , DATE being concurrent to each other but consecutive to the rape sentence . For each of the indecent photograph convictions , he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , concurrent with each other and with the indecent assault sentences .", "In fixing the tariff in respect of the life sentence , the trial judge made it clear that if he had been required to set a determinate sentence , he would have chosen CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , made up of DATE in respect of the rape offences and DATE to run consecutively in respect of the indecent assault offences . He explained that the period of DATE had been chosen in view of :", "\u201c the aggravating features , that is to say your previous convictions and indeed the rest of your track record , the breach of trust , the number of victims here , their youth , the frequency of the acts and the nature of them . \u201d", "The trial judge accordingly fixed the tariff at DATE imprisonment since the applicant would normally have had to serve CARDINAL of any determinate sentence . Taking account of the period already spent in custody pending trial ( DATE ) , the minimum period to be served by the applicant was fixed at a further DATE and DATE . The trial judge stated that in matters of parole :", "\u201c ... my present feeling is that great care should be exercised . I do not doubt that it always is , but in this case particular care should be exercised before you are let loose on the community . \u201d", "The applicant applied for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence . Concerning his conviction , he argued that the judge was wrong to refuse to sever the indictment so that the jury would not be aware of the counts of the taking of photographs to which he had pleaded guilty as this was likely to have an overwhelmingly prejudicial effect on the jury so as to render a fair trial impossible . He also argued that the judge had been wrong to direct that the jury could consider the evidence of CARDINAL of the boys as probative in respect of the evidence of the other . Concerning his sentence , he argued that the life sentence was imposed in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE leave to appeal was refused by a single judge .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence and conviction . On the grounds of appeal against conviction , they found no point of merit , there being no ground to criticise the refusal to sever the indictment and the judge \u2019s direction being clear and appropriate concerning the relevance of the photographs and the supportive value of the PERSON evidence . As regarded the applicant \u2019s sentence , it stated that it had no doubt that this was a case which called for severe sentences . It reiterated the trial judge \u2019s remarks and stated :", "\u201c So far as that is concerned , the applicant contends that the imposition of an automatic life sentence , pursuant to the then current LAW was contrary to the Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW in that it was arbitrary to impose that sentence without any specific assessment of whether the accused is dangerous . Of course that is wholly wrong . The sentencing remarks just quoted clearly indicated the judge \u2019s view as to the dangerousness of this particular applicant .", "It is not the view of this ORG that these automatic life sentences were obviously contrary to LAW , the contentions are not supported by authority and are not supportable by authority and are not sustainable .", "In any event , within the context of this case , as the Single Judge observed , a discretionary life sentence would not have been excessive in any event . \u201d", "The applicant applied to ORG for a review of his conviction and sentence . In a decision dated DATE , the ORG found no grounds for referring his case to ORG on either sentence or conviction .", "The DATE Act came into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) provide as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where -", "( a ) a person is convicted of a serious offence committed after the commencement of this section ; and", "( b ) at the time when that offence was committed , he was DATE or over and had been convicted in any part of GPE of another serious offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall impose a life sentence , that is to say -", "( a ) where the person is ORG over , a sentence of imprisonment for life ; ( b ) where he is DATE , a sentence of custody for life under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ,", "unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which justify its not doing so .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the court does not impose a life sentence , it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) listed the offences considered \u201c serious \u201d for the purposes of the section . The offences listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were already punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment and they include rape .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act impose mandatory penalties of DATE for a third conviction on class A drug trafficking offences and domestic burglaries , respectively . Both sections oblige the court to impose the fixed sentence when the statutory conditions are fulfilled except :", "\u201c where the court is of the opinion that there are specific circumstances which --", "( a ) NORP relate to any of the offences or to the offender ; and", "( b ) would make the prescribed custodial sentence unjust in all the circumstances . \u201d", "In this case , decided after the entry into force of LAW DATE , ORG adopted a more flexible interpretation of the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in section QUANTITY of LAW .", "The appellants contended that section CARDINAL was incompatible with , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . ORG agreed that the manner of interpreting section DATE meant that that section could clearly operate in a disproportionate manner , it not being difficult to find examples of situations where it would be wholly disproportionate to impose a life sentence even for a second serious offence .", "It considered that the problem would disappear if the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in section CARDINAL were construed in a manner which accorded with the policy of ORG in adopting the section . That policy was to protect the public . Accordingly , a finding that an offender does not constitute a significant risk to the public should be considered to constitute \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d which approach , ORG considered , would accord with parliamentary intent and with the provisions of the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
