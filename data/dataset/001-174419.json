The applicant company is the publisher of an NORP DATE newspaper , the LOC . At the time of the events giving rise to this case , the title of the newspaper was ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , ORG , published a series of articles about the awarding of Government contracts to a public relations consultant , PERSON The articles pointed out that she was a supporter of , and well acquainted with , a prominent political figure , Mr C. , both of them coming from the same city . She had been hired as a consultant by ORG beginning in DATE , when Mr C. was the minister with responsibility for this department of Government . When he was appointed in DATE to the more senior political post of Minister for the Environment , ORG , PERSON was then hired as a consultant by that ORG , and was still working for it at the time the articles appeared .", "CARDINAL . The Evening Herald called into question the manner in which the tendering procedure had been conducted , the qualifications of PERSON for the work involved , the high level of remuneration she received , as well as the amount of work that was in fact done by PERSON It referred to CARDINAL trips abroad on which PERSON had been part of the ministerial entourage , in particular a trip to GPE to attend a ORG conference . The newspaper stated several times that the relevant ORG department could find no trace of Mr C. having taken part in the conference , even though his ORG maintained that he had attended it . A later article stated that ORG did in fact have a record of the Minister \u2019s attendance .", "CARDINAL . The story was developed in CARDINAL articles published over DATE in CARDINAL editions of the newspaper . It became headline news and formed the subject - matter of an editorial decrying apparent favouritism in the award of Government contracts and calling for an inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The articles referred to rumours of an intimate relationship between Mr C. , who was at that time separated from his wife , and PERSON , who was married with CARDINAL teenage children . There were also references to PERSON attractive appearance and her lifestyle . Various photographs were included , including one that showed the CARDINAL standing side by side in TIME wear as if a couple . This image was obtained by altering the original photo , which contained CARDINAL people . CARDINAL of the front page articles was accompanied by a large photomontage containing the same image of PERSON in evening wear , but modified to suggest that the skirt had a slit that reached almost to her hip . The montage showed her standing very close to the Minister , whose image had been taken from another photo , with the GPE skyline behind them . The headline read \u201c The Minister , PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the articles complained of amounted to a serious and sustained attack on Ms. PERSON \u2019s business and personal integrity and were part of a sustained campaign building up over a period of DATE . She had been accused of engaging in an adulterous relationship for the sake of obtaining lucrative contracts and at DATE , she had gone from a person who would not have been known to the general public at all to someone who was notorious ( see further paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The issue of the contracts awarded to PERSON was taken up by other parts of the NORP media , and led to questions in the NORP parliament ( ORG ) . A report issued in DATE at the request of the then Prime Minister ( Taoiseach ) found that while there had been certain shortcomings in the way that the contracts had been awarded and in the monitoring and recording of the work done , there had not been any specific infringement of the relevant norms , guidelines or practices .", "CARDINAL . Ms L. sued the applicant company for defamation . The case was heard before a jury in ORG over DATE in DATE . The CARDINAL issues put to the jury were whether the articles , as a whole , including the accompanying photographs , meant that PERSON had an extra - marital affair with PERSON , and whether the last article in the series meant that PERSON had travelled to GPE at Government expense in the company of Mr C. for a ORG conference , but that she had not in fact attended it .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with NORP law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below for further details ) , the jury was directed that if it found in favour of PERSON on either issue , or both , it should assess damages .", "CARDINAL . In his charge to the jury , the trial judge explained that in an action for defamation , damages serve CARDINAL functions : to afford consolation for the distress caused by the defamatory statement ; to repair the harm to reputation , including business reputation ; and to vindicate the person \u2019s reputation . He stated that the jurors could take account of PERSON standing in society and in the business community , the nature of the libel ( the insinuations that she had betrayed husband and family and that she had misused public funds ) , the mode and extent of publication ( carried repeatedly in a widely - read DATE newspaper ) , the absence of an apology , and the fact that the applicant company pleaded the defences of justification and fair comment throughout the trial . If the jury were to make an award , it must be appropriate and fair to both parties . The rules governing the trial judge \u2019s directions to the jury are known as the PERSON rules , laid down by ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge did not give any specific guideline to the jury regarding the appropriate level of compensation , stressed the limited nature of the guidelines he could provide and indicated , in broad terms , that , when assessing damages the jury must bear in mind reality , the current times , the cost of living and the value of money . He added a cautionary note :", "\u201c On CARDINAL famous occasion I told a jury that the plaintiff , if he won , had n\u2019t won the [ national lottery ] and they immediately awarded a MONEY . Now , that was n\u2019t what I meant when I was saying that to them . \u201d", "He explained that the law did not permit him to suggest a figure or a range of figures to the jury :", "\u201c The amount of damages , ladies and gentlemen , is a matter for you , should you choose to award them . I ca n\u2019t suggest a figure to you , I am not permitted to suggest a figure to you . I ca n\u2019t give you a range of figures , I am not permitted to give you a range of figures . I can give you what help I can , and I will , in coming to an appropriate figure for damages . But , ultimately , the figure is yours . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He warned the jurors not to be \u201c overcome by feelings of generosity and give PERSON a ridiculously large amount of money \u201d . Any award must be of an appropriate amount . He continued his charge to the jury as follows :", "\u201c ... [ T]hat appropriate figure must also take into consideration the Defendant . You must also be fair to the Defendant too ... [ Y]ou must consider the Defendant as well because your decision must be a fair decision and must be fair to both parties . ... You must come to a figure that is an appropriate figure and that is , I fully realise , ... not an easy thing to do . I would like to be able to tell you what other figures have been given in the recent past in similar cases , but I ca n\u2019t do that and I must n\u2019t do that . If any of you think you remember newspaper headlines over DATE or so of damages awarded in cases , every case is different . Put those out of your mind completely ... It is this case and what is appropriate in this case that is important and you have to reach that decision yourself and without as much help as I would like to be able to give you , but I am not permitted to give you . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the jury had retired , the plaintiff \u2019s counsel requested the trial judge to retract the reference to the lottery , as he feared it would be understood by the jury as a warning to keep any award significantly lower than QUANTITY . He contended that no figure should have been suggested . Counsel for the applicant company disagreed , taking the view that the jury would have clearly understood the trial judge \u2019s remark was not to make any suggestion about the appropriate level of damages in the instant case . The trial judge declined to revisit this aspect of his charge to the jury as it could cause confusion in ORG minds , who might think that in withdrawing the reference the trial judge might have been suggesting less or more than that figure . He observed to counsel :", "\u201c I do find myself in difficulties because of ORG ruling [ in the De Rossa case ] in that I ca n\u2019t even indicate to a jury upper and lower in the most general terms , which I would like to be able to do because I think it would save a lot of trouble and I ca n\u2019t do it because of the decision of ORG . \u201d", "He concluded the exchange with counsel on this matter as follows :", "\u201c I did think that I had traversed the question of damages and , each successive case I do , I get more long - winded about it because I started with very short charges and I used to be very surprised , CARDINAL way or another , at the amounts juries brought in . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the first issue the jury found that the newspaper had alleged an extra - marital affair between the plaintiff and PERSON On the second issue , it found that the meaning of the article was not defamatory .", "CARDINAL . The jury assessed damages at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the trial judge gave judgment in this amount . He granted a stay on payment pending appeal , with the proviso that the applicant company make an interim payment of LAW to PERSON , with an additional LAW in legal costs . These payments were made , ORG having refused on DATE to set aside ORG order on interim payment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company accepted the jury \u2019s decision that it had defamed PERSON Evening Herald published an apology to her in its edition of DATE . It appealed the amount of damages , arguing that no reasonable jury could have made such an award , that it was disproportionate to the damage caused and amounted to an unlawful interference with the applicant company \u2019s rights under LAW and the Convention . In its subsequent submissions to this Court on just satisfaction , it considered that a much lower sum \u2013 EUR DATE would have been sufficient compensation in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In the event that ORG set aside the award of damages on appeal , PERSON sought to have the matter remitted to ORG for a fresh assessment by a new jury . In its notice of appeal , the applicant company also sought an order directing a retrial on the issue of damages . It appears from the case file that , in its subsequent submissions before ORG , in the event that the latter set aside the High Court award , it argued that ORG should itself decide the amount of compensation .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its ruling on DATE . All CARDINAL judges found that the award to PERSON was excessive and must be set aside . The majority decided to substitute its own assessment of damages ( EUR CARDINAL ) , while the other judge took the view that the case should be re - tried before a different jury . As this would not happen , he indicated that he would have assessed damages at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of the majority was given by PERSON J. , with whom PERSON concurred . She noted that the case did not come within the current law on defamation ( the Defamation Act DATE , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , but had to be decided in accordance with the previous law . Under that regime , the trial judge was limited in the directions that could be given to a jury regarding the appropriate level of damages . It had not been suggested that the trial judge had committed any error in his charge to the jury on the question of damages . Rather , the complaint was that the award was so disproportionately high that it should be set aside . She referred to the relevant ORG case - law , which held that it was the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury that damages must be confined to an amount that will fairly and reasonably compensate the plaintiff for injured feelings and loss of standing . Furthermore , as a fundamental principle of the law of compensatory damages , the award must be reasonable and fair and bear a due correspondence with the injury suffered ; a disproportionately high award would be set aside . She rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that larger libel awards should be subjected to more searching scrutiny on appeal than had been customary in the past . Nor did she accept that the relevant legal test should be whether a reasonable jury would have thought such an award necessary to compensate the plaintiff and to re - establish her reputation . She stated :", "\u201c If such were the test to be applied , it would remove from the jury award the \u201c very unusual and emphatic sanctity \u201d referred to [ in previous case - law ] .", "Consequently , while awards made by jury must , on appeal , be subject to scrutiny by the appellate court , that court is only entitled to set aside an award if it is satisfied that in all the circumstances , the award is so disproportionate to the injury suffered and wrong done that no reasonable jury would have made such an award . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She further recalled the need for the law to reflect a due balancing of the constitutional right to freedom of expression against the constitutional protection of every citizen \u2019s good name , which , as stated in case - law , brought the concept of proportionality into constitutional jurisprudence . Referring to this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG and ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ( extracts ) ) , she observed that it did not alter or reconfigure NORP law in respect of awards of damages in defamation . She stated :", "CARDINAL . She reviewed the terms used by the trial judge in his charge to the jury . He had told them they could consider the plaintiff \u2019s position in the business community . They could also consider the nature of the libel , which contained the suggestion that she was immoral , had been unfaithful to her husband and had betrayed her family . The mode and extent of publication were relevant , as were the absence of an apology and the company \u2019s decision to stand over the articles to the end .", "CARDINAL . Dunne J. then considered the applicant company \u2019s argument that the amount of damages awarded against it should be compared to awards that had been set aside as excessive in previous defamation cases . She agreed that the comparison might provide some assistance in assessing the gravity of the libel . But she also underlined the need for caution , given the wide variety of factual circumstances of such cases and also the passage of time since previous appellate decisions . As for comparison with personal injury awards , she recalled the different function of damages in the CARDINAL types of case . In defamation , the function of damages was both to compensate the injury to reputation and to vindicate the person \u2019s good name , a consideration which was not relevant in personal injuries cases .", "CARDINAL . The judge then set out the relevant factors for considering the proportionality of the damages awarded to PERSON The first was the gravity of the libel . The more closely the libel touched the plaintiff \u2019s personal integrity , professional reputation , honour , courage , loyalty and the core attributes of their personality \u2013 as was the case here DATE the more serious it was likely to be . She described the libel as a serious and sustained attack on the business and personal integrity of PERSON It could be fairly compared with a previous case involving the defamatory allegation against a prominent businessman of bribing a Government minister in order to obtain a licence to operate a radio station ( the O\u2019Brien case , summarised in ORG and ORG judgment at \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . It could not , however , be regarded as being in the category of the gravest and most serious libels to come before the courts , as was the libel in the LOC case ( the case that led to ORG and ORG case , it having been alleged that PERSON PERSON personally supported anti - Semitism and violent communist oppression ) . But the libel of PERSON was nonetheless a very serious one . The allegation of adultery must have been a course of real hurt and distress to her .", "CARDINAL . The next factor was the extent of publication . PERSON had cited CARDINAL articles concerning her . There had been some more articles focussing on the role of the Minister . It was a sustained campaign over DATE . The newspaper had a DATE circulation throughout the ORG of CARDINAL copies ; its readership would be higher still . PERSON had gone from being unknown to the public to being notorious . The publication had therefore been particularly widespread and extensive .", "CARDINAL . The third factor was the conduct of the defendant . It had run a defence of justification that the jury had rejected . It had not offered any apology to PERSON before the verdict , which was a point the jury could have taken into account . The articles had been accompanied by photographs that had been cropped and manipulated to lend force to the implication that PERSON got her contracts by virtue of the fact that she was having an affair with the Minister . That too could have been taken into consideration by the jury .", "CARDINAL . The fourth factor was the impact of the defamation on PERSON The articles had attacked her moral character and her professional reputation . They had implied that she was unfaithful to her husband and had played a part in the break - up of PERSON marriage . They had conveyed the impression that she was prepared to engage in an adulterous relationship in order to advance her professional standing and career . Her ability to do the work she was hired for had been called into question . A new business initiative she was involved in ended when the partner had withdrawn following the publication of the articles , and her consultancy work for the Government had come to an end . PERSON had given evidence of her own personal hurt and distress at the articles , and described the impact on her husband and sons , one of whom had had to change school in his final year while he was preparing to sit important public examinations . PERSON had received personal abuse in her hometown . Overall , the articles had had a profound effect on her in every aspect of her family and professional life , which was a consideration that was also relevant to the jury \u2019s award .", "CARDINAL . She then assessed the sum awarded in damages :", "\u201c The award of damages in this case in the sum of \u20ac CARDINAL is a very large award by any standard . ... Overall , I am satisfied that the defamation in this case was a very serious defamation . Undoubtedly , if CARDINAL was to place the defamation in this case on a scale of seriousness , it would certainly be towards the higher end of the scale . A somewhat unusual feature of this case was the sustained campaign in the Evening Herald in respect of Ms. PERSON The consequences of it affected her in DATE to day life , personally and in her business life . Her newly launched business was destroyed before it could become established . I have no doubt that from her point of view it was a very serious matter . Nevertheless , I do not think it could be classed as CARDINAL of the most serious libels to come before the Courts ... [ T]he award made to Ms. PERSON in this case was CARDINAL of the highest ever awards made in a case of this kind in this country . Even accepting that this case is CARDINAL that comes towards the higher end of the scale , I am satisfied that the award made by the jury in this case was excessive and must be set aside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She continued :", "\u201c I am conscious of the firm instructions of Ms. PERSON to her legal representatives that in the event that this ORG came to the conclusion that the amount of the award was excessive that the ORG should in those circumstances remit the matter to ORG for assessment by a jury again . Whilst I understand those to be her instructions I am satisfied that in the context of this case it would be desirable for all parties to bring an end to the litigation between the parties and in those circumstances it seems to me that the approach to be taken by the ORG should be to set aside the verdict of the jury on damages and to substitute a sum in the figure of \u20ac CARDINAL for damages . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The other , partly - dissenting judgment was given by PERSON J. He stated that the issue was whether the award was reasonable and fair and bore a due correspondence with the injury suffered , which was essentially a matter of proportionality . He rejected the suggestion that the jury should be informed of awards made in personal injury actions . The nature and purpose of the CARDINAL types of damages were inherently different . As for comparison with previous defamation awards , he opposed this for practical reasons . Even with the greatest of care , he did not see how cross referencing to a previous award could aid in determining the compensation to be paid to a particular plaintiff in respect of a particular publication for a particular injury . At most , he could accept that some benefit could be obtained if the comparison was applied within the same or similar class of defamatory remarks .", "CARDINAL . He observed that since the jury represented the community , and defamation was rooted in community values , jury awards in defamation cases enjoyed an eminence and distinction significantly higher than other types of award , including jury awards in non - defamation cases . This point was supported by numerous dicta of ORG . He said :", "\u201c ... Appeal judges , when conducting such a review , are not the jury and can not assume the jury \u2019s role . Intervention will be justified only where the award obviously falls outside permitted parameters which , in determining , the court must have due regard , inter alia , to the uniqueness of the jury \u2019s representative function in this particular judicial process . ... Therefore , an award will not be disturbed easily or second guessed purely to fine tune it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He analysed the libel in detail and also concluded that the award was not proportionate , failing to reflect the necessary objective relationship between wrongdoing and harm . Although he considered that the issue of damages should be submitted for consideration by a fresh jury , in the light of the majority \u2019s decision to set aside the jury verdict and substitute its own award , he offered his own view on the appropriate level of damages , placing it at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company duly paid an additional ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation to PERSON On DATE , ORG ordered that the applicant company should bear the legal costs incurred by PERSON in the appellate proceedings . According to the applicant company , this came to ORG CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
