The applicants submitted that on DATE at TIME the first applicant had been standing with a friend in the street outside the door of the building where he lived with his family , and , since he had forgotten his keys , had been ringing the bell so that his parents would let him in , when a plain - clothes policeman , ORG , had asked him to present his identity card . The first applicant had refused to comply , asking the officer to show his credentials . The officer had then grabbed him by his jacket DATE tearing it \u2013 and taken him to the police station . The first applicant had been placed in a room and , while he was alone with ORG , the officer had slapped him in the face as he was protesting about his arrest .", "CARDINAL .

The Government submitted that , on account of the first applicant \u2019s refusal to show his identity card , officer ORG had had no choice but to take him to the police station for identification . The first applicant had then caused a scene , claiming to have suffered an injustice and been subjected to an unlawful identity check , and had insulted an officer who was telling him to calm down . He had been allowed to leave the police station once his identity had been verified and after being informed by ORG that a police report would be filed against him for forceful resistance to a public officer , abusive behaviour and verbal threats .
