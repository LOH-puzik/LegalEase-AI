The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . On DATE he was charged with unlawful fishing and misappropriation of QUANTITY of fish .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a closed sitting , heard an application to remand the applicant in custody , which it granted . The reasons for remanding him in custody relied upon by the court were that he had changed his address and that he might re - offend . Neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present at the hearing and they found out about the detention order DATE , when the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant was arrested at his home in PERSON and taken to ORG where an investigating judge saw him and confirmed the detention warrant of DATE . He was then taken to the ORG detention centre .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was kept in a small cell called the \u201c aquarium \u201d until TIME DATE , when he was moved to cell no . CARDINAL . The \u201c aquarium \u201d was QUANTITY long and QUANTITY wide and did not have a bed , chair , toilet or sink . It was intended for periods of detention not longer than TIME . Cell no . CARDINAL was located below floor level and did not have windows . There was no ventilation . The electric light was always on , although it was so weak that it was difficult to distinguish the faces of the co - detainees . The cell was QUANTITY long and QUANTITY wide and there were QUANTITY detainees in it . The cell was not equipped with a toilet but instead had a big bucket in a corner which was not separated from the rest of the cell . There was no sink and the detainees had to keep water in plastic bottles which they were allowed to refill once in a while outside the cell . There were no beds , but only a brick shelf a little higher than the floor on which CARDINAL people could sleep . The cell was not provided with any bedding and the applicant alleged that he was only able to sleep for TIME per day . The cell was infested with insects , with the result that the applicant was covered with painful bites , some of which later became wounds . The applicant sent the ORG photographs showing the bites on his body . The food was insufficient and of very poor quality . The detainees were fed only once a day from dirty plates and the applicant was permanently hungry . His relatives were not allowed to bring him food because he would not confess to the charges against him . The applicant was unable to have any contact with his relatives and the outside world . He did not have any paper , pen or envelopes . The room was not provided with a radio or television and due to the lack of natural light the applicant never knew what time of day it was .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife hired a lawyer and learned about the detention warrant of DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged the detention order before ORG . He complained , inter alia , LAW , of the inhuman and degrading conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention . After giving a detailed description of the conditions in which the applicant was being detained , he asked the court to find that the applicant \u2019s rights guaranteed by LAW had been breached and to award him compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer repeated the habeas corpus request and the complaint under LAW before the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal . The above complaints have never been examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant complained on several occasions to the prison authorities and to the sanitation department about the poor conditions of detention . However , his complaints were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer complained to the ORG district prosecutor about the applicant \u2019s poor conditions of detention . As a result of that complaint the prison authorities moved the applicant to another cell without disinfecting it and reported to the prosecutor that the problem had been remedied . According to the applicant , the only shower in the prison was fixed then .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the detention warrant expired and the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings against the applicant ended with the judgment of ORG of DATE , by which the applicant was ordered to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP lei ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG , unofficial translation ) read as follows :", "\u201c B. Establishments visited", "... - EDP of ORG ( Follow - up visit )", "... b. remand centres ( EDPs )", "CARDINAL . In its report on the DATE visit ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and , in addition , constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained . While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments TIME , the ORG recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity .", "CARDINAL . NORP Unfortunately , during the DATE visit , the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures , in fact quite the opposite . ...", "CARDINAL . One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the NORP authorities have paid no attention to the ORG recommendations . In fact , this state of affairs strongly suggests that , setting aside economic considerations , the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the other EDPs visited across GPE , with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions . A detailed description is superfluous , since it has all been highlighted already in DATE of the report on the DATE visit .", "In PERSON , these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding . At the time of the visit , there were CARDINAL prisoners for CARDINAL places , requiring QUANTITY persons to cram into a cell measuring QUANTITY into cells of CARDINAL m\u00b2 .", "CARDINAL . The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited . This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning , cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in TIME . In some establishments , food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup . ...", "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time , the ORG wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of CARDINAL or several other persons , in a confined space such as the ORG cells which also serve as their living space , is in itself degrading , not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening . Consequently , the ORG recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should DATE if they so request \u2013 be taken out of their cell without delay during DATE in order to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also recommends that steps be taken to :", "- reduce the overcrowding in PERSON as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level ;", "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets ;", "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter .", "In the light of certain observations made , particularly in the ORG of ORG , the ORG also reiterates its recommendation concerning strict compliance , in all circumstances , with the rules governing separation of adults and minors . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Conditions of detention .", "a. Institutions of ORG", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , when it first visited GPE , the ORG has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of ORG .", "The ORG notes that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL EDPs have been subjected to \u201c cosmetic \u201d repair and that CARDINAL have been equipped with places for DATE walks . Nevertheless , the DATE visit did not allow lifting the concern of ORG . In fact , most recommendations made have not been implemented .", "CARDINAL . Whether CARDINAL refers to the police stations or EDPs visited , the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past . Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited such access ; artificial light \u2013 with rare exceptions \u2013 was mediocre . Nowhere did the persons obliged to pass TIME in detention receive mattresses and blankets , even those detained for prolonged periods . Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives ...", "CARDINAL . As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report on that visit ) : generally CARDINAL modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning , a bowl of cereals at TIME and tea or warm water in TIME . Sometimes there was CARDINAL distribution of food per day . Fortunately , the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed , which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre DATE portions .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations ; they remain disastrous in EDPs , continuing in many aspects to amount , for the detainees , to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d", "\u201c II . Institutions of ORG", "In so far as the conditions of detention in the police establishments are concerned , it appears that this is the field in which the least progress has been achieved . It is not necessary to enumerate here in detail all the shortcomings observed by the delegation , which are more or less the same as those observed during past visits ( and of which ORG is perfectly aware ) . ... Numerous persons are still detained overnight in police establishments , in cells which should not be used to detain persons for TIME . It is high time to remedy these problems , in particular by placing accused persons under the supervision of institutions of ORG and building new prisons corresponding to ORG standards and to the norms laid down by the NORP legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
