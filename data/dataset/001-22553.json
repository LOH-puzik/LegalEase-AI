On DATE the hearing was scheduled to commence on DATE . On that date the applicant appeared with the intention of being represented by her husband . However , ORG found it impossible to give the case a proper consideration without legal assistance and pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Administration of Justice Act ( retsplejeloven ) the applicant was ordered to retain counsel . According to the said provision the court can order a litigant in civil proceedings to be represented by counsel \u201c if the court finds it impossible to hear the case properly ( \u201c p\u00e5 forsvarlig m\u00e5de \u201d ) without such representation \u201d .

On DATE the applicant submitted her reply . Thereafter , on DATE drawing attention to the scope and complexity of the case she requested that a named attorney , who apparently had agreed to represent her , be appointed . At a court session held on DATE ORG refused to appoint a lawyer , but ordered that the applicant be represented by one . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the said named lawyer informed the applicant \u2019s husband that he could not undertake to represent the applicant , partly because he found the prospects of success extremely poor . Subsequently , although the applicant alleged that she could not find a lawyer who would represent her without being appointed ORG upheld its decision on this subject on CARDINAL and DATE . Having succeeded in finding an attorney who would represent her , at a session held on DATE the lawyer in question requested an adjournment in order to procure additional evidence .

In the circumstances on DATE ORG decided to release the applicant from its previous order , and her husband subsequently represented her . On DATE the court received a pleading from the applicant replacing the former of CARDINAL DATE and entailing new submissions .
