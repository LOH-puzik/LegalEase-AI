In PERSON v. PERSON , ORG considered the refusal of the ERO for GPE , GPE and GPE to enrol a convicted prisoner on the electoral register on the basis of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , in anticipation of elections to ORG . The Secretary of ORG conceded in the proceedings that in light of the judgment of this ORG in ORG section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act was incompatible with LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW and that the appellant 's rights under that LAW had been violated . He also accepted that for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL ORG was a legislature . The court , handing down its judgment on DATE , summarised the matters for examination in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Since section CARDINAL ) of LAW , giving the words of that provision their ordinary meaning , was incompatible with LAW , the ORG should consider whether it was possible , in terms of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , to read it down in such a way as to make it compatible . If that was possible , it should be done and the appeal should be allowed .", "CARDINAL . If , however , that was not possible , then the appeal would be refused but the ORG should consider whether it could and should make a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW in terms of LAW section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . If that could be done , it should be .", "CARDINAL . If the ORG did not take that course , it should consider , in the context of the requirement in terms of section CARDINAL of LAW for the Court not to act in a manner incompatible with the appellant 's Convention rights , whether by refusing the appeal and providing the appellant with no remedy it would be acting in breach of that statutory requirement . If it would , then the ORG was obliged to give such remedy as was open to it within its powers at common law or under any statute . Such a remedy would include granting a declarator that the appellant 's rights under LAW had been violated . It was open to the ORG in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to grant such a declarator . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the appellant argued that if there was some \u201c possible \u201d interpretation ( or \u201c reading down \u201d ) of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act which would remove the incompatibility identified by this ORG in ORG , ORG should adopt it . He considered that insertion of words to the effect that any ban on prisoner voting \u201c would apply at the discretion of the sentencing judge \u201d would qualify , but not contradict , the \u201c grain of the legislation \u201d and that the case should accordingly be resolved along those lines . Counsel for the respondent submitted that while section CARDINAL of LAW empowered the court to interpret legislation , where possible , in a certain way , it did not entitle the court to amend or reverse clear legislative provisions , nor otherwise to usurp the legislative function of ORG . The court summarised counsel 's argument as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act clearly provided for a blanket ban on voting which applied to all convicted prisoners serving custodial sentences . There was thus no ' grain of the legislation ' which could properly serve as a starting point for any interpretation designed to clothe some or all of such prisoners with voting rights . Over and above that , it was necessary to recognise the complexity of the issues which had been opened up by the decision of ORG in ORG , and the extensive consultation which would have to be undertaken before the Government could form a view as to the appropriate way forward . Since the Convention rights conferred by LAW were in no way absolute , there were many possible levels at which the line might be drawn for the enfranchisement or disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners in different categories , and it could be no part of this ORG 's function to make an uninformed choice among such alternatives . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Against that background , we are clearly of the opinion that the appellant 's submission must be rejected and we decline to ' read down ' section CARDINAL ) of LAW in the manner proposed ... In our opinion to read down section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW as providing for full or partial enfranchisement of convicted prisoners serving custodial sentences would be ... to depart substantially from a fundamental feature of the legislation . Without the benefit of consultation or advice , this ORG would , in a real sense , be legislating on its own account , especially in view of the wide range of policy alternatives from which a ' possible ' solution would require to be selected ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court , however , made a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of ORG considered the disenfranchisement of prisoners in judicial review proceedings challenging the legality of an order made by the Secretary of ORG for GPE regarding the organisation of the elections to ORG in DATE and the involvement of ORG in those elections . The challenge was based on the provisions of LAW DATE and in particular the requirement that NORP legislation and acts of ORG be compatible with the Convention . Lord PERSON rejected the claim for interdict ( injunction ) , emphasising that it was for ORG to decide whether to remove the incompatibility between domestic legislation and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On the question of declaratory relief , he added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I should record that I was asked to repeat the declarator of incompatibility pronounced in PERSON . There is no dispute in these petitions as to the incompatibility between section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and article CARDINAL of the first protocol . The discussion focused on other matters . That incompatibility has been authoritatively determined in GPE . I am satisfied that a further declarator in these proceedings is unnecessary and inappropriate ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG and ORG , CARDINAL convicted prisoners sought , in light of ORG , a declaration that the disqualification of convicted prisoners from voting did not apply to elections to ORG . After careful consideration of the judgment of this ORG in ORG and the decision of ORG in PERSON , PERSON held :", "\u201c CARDINAL(iv ) . I consider that the [ GPE ] court has deliberately left the method of compliance in the hands of ORG subject to the overriding veto of the court ... Accordingly I see nothing intrinsically objectionable about the various options being explored by the Government proposals contained in the consultation paper of DATE which makes up its response to the ORG decision . The consequence of this is that not only is Mr PERSON [ Deputy Director , Rights and International Relations in ORG at ORG ] entitled to say ... that the Government is unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as those of the applicants should become entitled to vote whilst detained , but I am left singularly unconvinced that the applicants are currently or will ever be able to lay claim to a right to vote . I reject the argument of Mr PERSON [ for the applicants ] that because a blanket prohibition on prisoners is incompatible with the Convention that somehow converts into the proposition that all prisoners are currently entitled to vote until the vacuum is filled . In my view that conforms neither with principle nor logic and certainly does not find any authority in ORG which expressly recognises that restraints on LAW are justifiable provided they pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In judicial review proceedings brought in ORG in GPE v. Secretary of ORG for ORG and another , the claimant , a prisoner , argued that his disqualification from voting in the then pending DATE ORG elections breached his rights under LAW No . CARDINAL and under ORG law . He was granted permission to bring his claim on DATE . At the hearing before PERSON , he argued that section DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) Act should be \u201c read down \u201d in order to enable him to vote or , in the alternative , a declaration of incompatibility as regards section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW should be made . He accepted that no argument could be mounted that a \u201c reading down \u201d of LAW CARDINAL of the DATE Act would be feasible , within the parameters of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The claim was dismissed by PERSON on DATE . As to the possibility of \u201c reading down \u201d section CARDINAL , PERSON held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I am being asked effectively to draft fresh legislation by bolting on to existing legislation additional words which not only dramatically change its nature , but are imminently to be considered by the ORG . CARDINAL competing alternatives are presented to me for consideration . CARDINAL of these affects the franchise by allowing all convicted prisoners to vote . The other amends the statute so as to allow CARDINAL particular category of convicted prisoners , the post - tariff lifers , to vote , while still retaining a bar on all other prisoners , including those only serving very short terms of imprisonment , to whom it seems , on any basis , the ORG is proposing that the franchise should be extended ; and to make such differentiation simply because the claimant in this case happens to be one of the category in whose favour the statute would now be amended .", "CARDINAL . The first proposal is not acceptable , not least for the same reasons as were enunciated by PERSON in paragraph CARDINAL(iv ) of his judgment [ in ORG and ORG ] , which I have cited earlier . Enfranchisement of all prisoners , including those with a minimum term / tariff of life which may or may not be what the legislature after full consultation and discussion of all the issues may consider , but it would be a dramatic change , was not , as PERSON points out , required by ORG . As for the alternative , selection of CARDINAL particular category of prisoner simply because CARDINAL of that category happens to be the Claimant , to effect what would in fact be a substantial amendment of the legislation , but CARDINAL category of convicted prisoner , can not be an appropriate exercise of this jurisdiction . It would lead to piecemeal and possibly continuous amendments , without consideration by ORG , of legislation dealing with matters of important social policy , all depending upon which claimant happened to be before the ORG at any one time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded that if and in so far as section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was incompatible with the LAW or with ORG law , reading it down was not an available remedy .", "CARDINAL . As to whether it would be appropriate to make a declaration of incompatibility in respect of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , PERSON concluded :", "\u201c DATE . ... I am content to say that there is no need for any declaration to be made by yet another court , as one has already been made which is binding on ORG .", "CARDINAL . However , towards the end of his submissions , PERSON [ for the claimant ] put forward another basis upon which to support his case for such a declaration . He submitted that , as the grant of a declaration is discretionary , there is no reason why it can not be made again , if it is made on different grounds . He submits that I can and should make a declaration that ORG of the DATE Act is incompatible with the ORG , and do so by reference to the fact that it excludes ( together with all other convicted prisoners ) post - tariff lifers . Then there would be some point in making the declaration , given that the ORG 's proposed legislation seems , subject to what may have emerged from the second consultation , to be intended not to make any change in their position . Hence , it would be a declaration as to the incompatibility with regard to the present legislation , but to be made because it does not appear as if there is going to be any amelioration of his client 's position by reference to the proposed legislation . This would effectively simply amount to the declaration of incompatibility being a peg upon which Mr Southey can hang his substantive submissions , to which I shall come in a moment . Subject however to that argument ... I reject his suggestion that I should make a declaration of incompatibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the application for a declaration of incompatibility as regards section CARDINAL of LAW , PERSON said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I am satisfied that , but for PERSON proposed legislation argument ' , this course is wholly inappropriate as a matter of discretion :", "( i ) Simply as a matter of context and background , there is no presently intended NORP election , to which alone sCARDINAL would apply ... These proceedings were brought at the time when the DATE NORP elections were still in the future . There will now not be further such elections for DATE . By that time , whatever the ORG 's personal position may be , new legislation , whatever it may be , will be well in place ( and will have been capable of challenge , if appropriate ) .", "( ii ) More significantly , it is plain that the challenge to sCARDINAL is purely parasitic to the real challenge , which is to ORG . SCARDINAL merely provides that ( with the exceptions discussed ) the same people can vote in NORP elections as can vote in GPE elections . When there is new legislation in place of ORG , sCARDINAL will automatically follow . A declaration has already been made in relation to ORG , upon which ORG wholly hangs , and legislation is to be put before ORG with the intention of curing the contravention of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . For the reasons I have given , namely that there is already a declaration of such incompatibility in relation to the governing section , ORG , upon which sCARDINAL entirely depends , the same reasons drive me to conclude that there is no basis in the exercise of my discretion to grant a declaration of incompatibility in relation to sCARDINAL , any more than there is to sCARDINAL ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the need for a further declaration of incompatibility as a result of the apparently limited scope of the proposed legislation , PERSON considered that any declaratory or other relief which was intended to interfere with the process by which new legislation resulting from the consultation process was put before and debated by ORG was inappropriate and was not to be granted . In any case , he concluded that the court was :", "\u201c ... ill - equipped to decide this issue of social policy , and certainly ill - equipped to legislate and provide for the consequences of any view , plain and obvious or otherwise , as to which category of prisoners ought to be enfranchised as a result of the removal of the absolute ban . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The claimant appealed and on CARDINAL DATE , was granted leave to appeal by ORG . The appeal was heard on DATE and the judgment is pending .", "CARDINAL . In its recent report , \u201c Enhancing ORG 's role in relation to human rights judgments \u201d , CARDINALth Report of DATE , published in DATE , a parliamentary committee , ORG , considered domestic developments in the execution of ORG judgment in ORG and noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... our overriding disappointment is at the lack of progress in this case .

Where a breach of the ORG is identified , individuals are entitled to an effective remedy by LAW .

On DATE a short debate took place in ORG following a question to the Government regarding their plans to give prisoners the right to vote .
