CARDINAL/CARDINAL . He stated that he was a member of a family whose income did not exceed the ceiling of MONEY ( ORG ) above which the bursary , which amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , could not be granted .", "In a decision of DATE , of which the applicant was notified on DATE , the governing body of ORG rejected Mr PERSON \u2019s application on the ground that his family \u2019s income exceeded the prescribed limit . The Director of ORG informed the applicant that he could challenge the decision in ORG .", "On DATE the applicant served notice on the governing body of ORG that he was appealing to the President of the Republic .", "On DATE he asked the governing body for information as to progress of the proceedings .

They are lodged by the appellant directly with the head of ORG and are limited to a review of the lawfulness of the decision being challenged .", "A special appeal precludes bringing an action in the administrative courts . It follows that once an appellant challenges an administrative decision by way of a special appeal to the President of the Republic , he or she can no longer bring an action in the courts .

It must , within the same time period , be served on the authority which made the decision and be lodged with the relevant ministry ( or the authority which made the decision , which must then forward it to the relevant ministry ) .", "The relevant ministry investigates the case and must complete its investigation within DATE of the expiry of the time allowed to the other party to submit their observations . When that time has expired , the appellant can ask the relevant ministry whether the appeal has been forwarded to the PERSON for an opinion , as is compulsory , and , if no reply or a negative reply is received , can himself file a copy of the appeal with the PERSON .", "On a proposal by the appropriate minister , the President of the Republic makes a ruling by decree .
