He informed the public prosecutor of the name and address of PERSON , who had been driving his car on DATE . The applicant further explained that , after he had been declared bankrupt on DATE , he had become embroiled with Mr B. to such a degree that reclaiming the fine from him was bound to fail .", "On DATE the public prosecutor of The Hague rejected the applicant 's appeal , holding that the applicant , being the registered owner of the car , remained liable under LAW to pay the fine .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the ORG Judge ( kantonrechter ) under LAW . At a hearing held on DATE before the ORG Judge , the applicant stated that he was the registered owner of the car , but that PERSON was the actual driver who had committed the offence .", "On DATE the ORG Judge rejected the applicant 's appeal , holding that the fact that the applicant was not the driver who had committed the traffic offence did not mean that a fine could not be imposed as , in accordance with the LAW , the person in whose name the car was registered remained liable .", "A subsequent cassation appeal by the applicant was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .

It held in this respect :", "\u201c This conception of LAW [ of the LAW ] can not be accepted as correct . It rests on an unjust understanding [ of this provision ] ...

CARDINAL ) :", "' A large part of the detection of minor offences against traffic regulations takes place with the aid of technical equipment ... There is no direct confrontation between a police officer and an offender in such cases . The same applies to the majority of parking offences . In such cases , where it can not be immediately established who was the driver of the vehicle with which ... the offence has been committed , the administrative sanction will be imposed on the registration - number holder , pursuant to [ LAW ] . '", "On this basis it must be assumed that the expression contained in LAW ] ' if it can not be immediately established who ... is the driver ' relates to those cases in which traffic offences are detected by technical means or otherwise in the absence of a realistic opportunity for the police \u2013 taking into account factors such as road and traffic safety and the factual impossibility of having recourse to continuous surveillance \u2013 to stop the driver .", "The mere circumstance that the registration - number holder , immediately after having received the decision imposing the administrative sanction , has informed the public prosecution department who the driver was , does not therefore exclude the application of LAW of the LAW ] . \u201d", "In a judgment given on DATE ( PERSON , no .

The explanatory memorandum to the bill which gave rise to the [ Act ] states , inter alia , ... ' The bill departs from the idea that the administrative sanction ( which is to be understood as a payment to the ORG of a certain sum of money ... ) is imposed , according to LAW ] , on the person in whose name a [ motor vehicle ] licence ( kenteken ) is registered at the material time , if it has been established that the act [ in violation of the DATE LAW ] has taken place with ... a motor vehicle for which a licence has been issued and where it can not be established immediately who the driver is . This rule , to which an exception is possible ... ( Article CARDINAL) ... will have as its consequence that the above - mentioned time - consuming procedures entailing a hearing and the sending out and processing of response coupons , will become defunct .

The memorandum of reply to the cited bill states , inter alia , ... : ' The question whether or how the registered owner wants to reclaim the amount due from the \u201c minor \u201d offender is governed by the rules of civil law . ' and ' Our conclusion is that there is a possibility of limiting the strict liability rule for the registered owner , but we consider such a limitation in respect of minor traffic offences , to which this bill relates , neither necessary nor desirable . The person concerned has , after all , other ways of reclaiming the amount of the fine from the user of the car . '", "DATE . During the oral debate on the bill in ORG , the Minister of ORG stated , inter alia , ... : ' In an administrative - law system , I consider it more correct to leave it to the registered owner himself to take the necessary action to collect the sum he has lost as a result of the commission of the minor offence . He ought not to be permitted to leave that risk to society .

[ in violation of the DATE LAW ] ... but is merely made liable to pay \u2013 for the driver who is guilty of the conduct at issue \u2013 the amount of the administrative sanction imposed , and subsequently to reclaim , if so desired , the sum from the [ actual driver ] .
