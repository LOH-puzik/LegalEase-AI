The first applicant has CARDINAL children from previous relationships ; CARDINAL of them is a girl , X , born in DATE , whose biological father \u2019s identity remains unconfirmed . The other CARDINAL daughters are grown up . They have never lived with the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have been in a relationship since DATE and were married in DATE . In DATE twins , a girl W and a boy Y , were born to the applicants . On DATE , W died in suspicious circumstances . The autopsy report showed that she had several bone fractures and had sustained severe injuries to her internal organs . On DATE , the first applicant was found guilty of continuously causing severe bodily harm to W and of negligent manslaughter of PERSON She was sentenced to DATE in prison . The second applicant was found guilty of negligent manslaughter of W and was sentenced to DATE in prison . ORG confirmed the verdict and the proceedings are currently pending before ORG following the request for protection of legality ( extraordinary remedy ) lodged by the applicants . The first applicant started serving her sentence on DATE . The second applicant has a serious heart condition and his prison sentence has been temporarily suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following W \u2019s death , a social worker from ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) called the applicants and asked them to bring X and Y , who both lived with the applicants , to the paediatric hospital for examination . The children stayed in the hospital until DATE . In the meantime , it was established that X was traumatised by the death of W and that Y had delayed psychophysical development . Measures were taken by the social workers to find a suitable foster family that would receive X and Y.", "CARDINAL . Following several meetings with the applicants and in view of psychological reports prepared during ORG and ORG hospitalisation , ORG , on DATE , issued an emergency care order removing Y , then DATE , from the applicants and PERSON , then DATE , from the first applicant , and placing them in foster care . In the emergency care order , ORG referred to suspicious circumstances of W \u2019s death and found that there were indications of possible domestic violence and neglect . It also noted that the applicants had not been critical of their situation and that X and Y would have been at risk if left at home . The order stated that contact between the applicants and Y as well as between the first applicant and X be allowed for TIME DATE under supervision , beginning on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , presumably before the children were taken to the foster home , ORG issued a decision allowing the enforcement of ORG emergency care order . The applicants were verbally informed of the order on DATE . They received it in writing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the emergency care order stating , inter alia , that a medical examination had not shown any signs of maltreatment , that no measures had previously been taken against them by ORG and that they had taken proper care of X and Y. They also submitted that CARDINAL of the first applicant \u2019s children had been successful in school and were now already grown up , and also that X had no learning difficulties . Their appeal was dismissed by ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged that decision before ORG . The latter , relying on ORG findings , rejected their claim on DATE . It found that the procedure had been conducted properly .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , ORG established an internal expert panel consisting of CARDINAL employees , namely a sociologist , a lawyer and a social worker ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the GPE panel \u201d ) . It also obtained a psychological report concerning X and Y. After each contact between the applicants and the children took place , a record was made by the social workers . The applicants were offered counselling , which they refused . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG , at which the applicants were present . On DATE ORG issued an ordinary care order , by which Y was removed from the applicants , X was removed from the first applicant , and both were placed in foster care . At the same time , ORG set out contact arrangements , stating that the applicants could see Y and the first applicant could see PERSON under ORG supervision for TIME DATE . It found that the children were living under psychological pressure and were neglected , in that they did not have a proper behaviour model at home . Y needed more support to catch up in his development and X needed therapy due to being under severe psychological pressure . Her psychological needs were entirely ignored by her mother , who was extremely egocentric . The applicants were advised to undergo parenting counselling .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the care order . On DATE the Ministry dismissed their appeal , by which the order became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged this decision in a claim before ORG . On DATE the court issued a judgment rejecting their claim .", "CARDINAL . On a further appeal ORG , on DATE , quashed ORG judgment and ordered a re - examination of the case in so far as the removal of the children and their placement into foster care were concerned . They found that a removal order could only be issued if supported by a report from an independent expert . In the instant case , however , the psychologist who had drawn up the report was an employee of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG again considered the case and quashed the ORG \u2019s decision on DATE . It ordered that an independent expert be appointed and that the applicants\u2019 ability to ensure the normal mental and physical development of X and Y , which was crucial for the care order , be further assessed . On DATE the ORG ordered ORG to re - examine the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the quashing of the ordinary care order by ORG , ORG issued a new emergency care order , by which the children were to remain in the foster home . In the written grounds , it stated that the reason for re - examination of the matter concerning the ordinary care order was the fact that no independent expert had been appointed and that the higher courts had given no indication that the children should be returned to their parents . In addition , ORG referred to the fact that an indictment had been lodged against the applicants , alleging that they had caused the death of W by negligence , which would have in itself been a sufficient reason for taking their remaining minor children into public care . The order did not set out any new contact arrangements , as this issue was pending before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the emergency removal , on the grounds that it was unjustified . The appeal was rejected by ORG , which found that there were sufficient grounds for emergency placement of the children in foster care . On DATE the applicants lodged a claim with ORG , which was rejected on DATE , as the court agreed that the facts as established by ORG and its panel were sufficient to justify the emergency placement of the children in foster care pending the outcome of the proceedings concerning the ordinary care order .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG appointed a forensic expert in psychology to draw up a report on the applicants\u2019 capacity for parenting . He submitted his report on DATE . On the basis of the examination of the applicants , Y and X , the first applicant \u2019s other daughters , the social workers and neighbours , and having regard to the circumstances surrounding W \u2019s death , the expert found that ORG and ORG psychophysical development would be at a serious risk if they stayed with the applicants , who were unable to satisfy their basic needs . It found that the second applicant was passive and as such unable to take an active role in the family , and that the first applicant had developed an \u201c emotionally unstable personality disorder with querulous and socially inadaptable behaviour \u201d . He also found that the contact should certainly not be extended and that the applicants should be given clear limits as regards their contact with Y and X.", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG , at which the applicants were present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry allowed the applicants\u2019 request for a change of venue . The case concerning the care order was consequently allocated to ORG ( hereinafter referred to as the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which appointed their internal expert panel ( hereinafter referred to as the \u201c PERSON panel \u201d ) on DATE . After the change of venue , ORG regularly reported to ORG on the contact between the applicants and the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the reports collected so far , the PERSON panel issued an opinion that the applicants were unfit parents . It also noted that the children could potentially be returned to their parents if the latter underwent appropriate therapy .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE before ORG , which allowed the evidence proposed by the applicants - an opinion of another independent expert , reports from the primary school , an interview with X -and ordered a home visit to be carried out . An interview was also held with the applicants , foster parents and a social worker with responsibility in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The expert in psychology requested by the applicants was appointed on DATE . She was asked to assess the applicants\u2019 capacity for parenting , whether the return of the children would be in the latter \u2019s interest , and what the children \u2019s wishes were . On DATE additional questions proposed by the applicants were forwarded to the expert for reply . Subsequently , a forensic expert in psychiatry was also requested to prepare a report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert in psychology submitted her report . She concluded that the applicants were unable to take proper care of X and Y , and that it was in the children \u2019s interest to stay with the foster family . She also noted that contact should continue to be supervised and should not be extended . According to the opinion of the psychiatrist , both applicants had a personality disorder although the first applicant \u2019s disorder was particularly severe . The report suggested that the normal development of the children was likely to be jeopardised if they returned to their primary family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON panel , on the basis of the new expert reports , issued another report proposing that a care order be issued and that the children remain in foster care . The PERSON panel also took into account the social workers\u2019 reports drawn up after each contact between the applicants and the children , and noted that the applicants had not improved their behaviour towards the children , despite being constantly provided with advice in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG at which the applicants , who contested the experts\u2019 reports and the report by the PERSON panel , were also present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to the evidence obtained in the proceedings , delivered a care order by which it decided that Y and X should be taken from the first applicant and Y should also be taken from the second applicant . Both should remain in foster care . It proposed that the parents undergo appropriate therapy , after which their parenting ability would be examined again .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal with ORG , which was dismissed . At that point the second ordinary care order become enforceable and replaced the emergency order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants challenged this decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment rejecting the ORG claim . The court , having regard to the evidence collected in the administrative proceedings , concurred with the findings of the administrative authorities and rejected the ORG claim . The applicants did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicants CARDINAL times requested access to ORG file , which was granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested ORG to initiate proceedings for the return of the children . They stated that no measures had been taken with a view to reuniting the family ; in particular , that a \u201c project group \u201d , including them , should have been set up and had not been . It should also have included X and Y and the foster parents and should have aimed to draw up a schedule for the return of the children , as stipulated in the domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request as essentially the same as the issue of the children \u2019s care and contact , which had already been decided by the decision of DATE , which was enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants . However , on DATE ORG quashed that decision and ordered a re - examination of the case , finding that the ORG request concerning the implementation of the foster care and the proceedings concerning the taking of the children were CARDINAL separate issues with different legal bases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants attended a meeting with ORG , where they were invited to explain their request . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings . The applicants appealed , stating that ORG had conducted proceedings arbitrarily and it should have invited them formally and in writing to correct the request if it considered it incomplete . On DATE the Ministry set aside ORG decision of DATE , finding that the applicants had never withdrawn their request and that ORG should therefore have decided on it . However , it stressed that although this was a separate request it was nevertheless connected to the issue of the taking of the children and should be decided at the same time . Consequently , ORG decided the issue in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , by which the children were to remain in foster care . The ORG appeal and a claim to ORG was rejected ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has remained responsible for the contact arrangements , counselling and monitoring of the children \u2019s foster care . It set out contact arrangements in its emergency order of DATE and then in its ordinary care order of DATE . The applicants were allowed to see X and Y under the ORG \u2019s supervision for TIME DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the applicants requested contact with X and Y during DATE . This was rejected by ORG as in breach of the valid decision on contact arrangements . On DATE the applicants requested that their contact take place out of doors and to have X and Y at home at DATE . The latter request was transferred to ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After the children were taken into foster care , reports were regularly prepared by social workers indicating several problems which occurred during the visits , in particular due to the first applicants\u2019 abrupt behaviour and the pressure she put on the children as regards their behaviour towards her , in particular on X , whom she pressured , among other things , to write requests to return home . The first applicant was intensively involved in the organisation of the leisure activities and schooling of X and problems regularly occurred in this respect as well . On DATE ORG also decided that the first applicant should not have telephone conversations with X , to whom she had given a mobile phone and made frequent calls , as this was causing X a lot of stress . During DATE after the children were taken into foster care the applicants often tried to approach them at the foster GPE home or at school , for which reason a restraining order was requested by ORG . In DATE ORG prepared a care plan , which included steps planned with a view to possible family reunification , such as assistance in order to improve contact , the applicants\u2019 attendance at special counselling and therapy sessions and attention to be given to the children \u2019s wishes as well as regular reviews of the situation with reunification in mind . The plan also noted that the return would depend on whether the applicants would be sentenced in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG regularly organised thematic meetings at which social workers discussed the situation regarding X and Y. The applicants had been regularly ( often DATE and occasionally DATE ) invited to discuss issues relating to X and Y as well as to attend consultations . The reports drawn up during or after these meetings indicated that the applicants did not have a constructive attitude and were unwilling to undergo therapy .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition to the above meeting , the \u201c individual project group \u201d was set up in DATE and has held meetings since then . The applicants , foster parents and social workers dealing with the case were usually invited to these meetings , where they discussed issues relating to the day - to - day life of the children and the applicants\u2019 parenting and visiting arrangements .", "CARDINAL . The reports of the meetings between the applicants and the social workers show that both applicants were involved in contact arrangements and had the opportunity to express their opinion as regards X and Y. The reports also indicate that the applicants were normally also able to have contact with the children on special occasions such as birthdays , ORG \u2019s first communion and the applicants\u2019 marriage ceremony .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that during DATE or so the contact between the applicants and the children has improved and is now no longer being supervised . At the meeting of the \u201c individual project group \u201d held on DATE , at which the applicants were present , the following was agreed : contact would take place DATE , namely once on DATE ( from TIME , with the applicants picking up and returning the children ) and once on DATE ( from TIME , with a social worker bringing the children to the applicants\u2019 home and picking them up at the end of the visit ) . According to the information supplied by the applicants following the first applicant \u2019s incarceration , the second applicant takes Y and X from the foster family and spends DATE with them DATE . ORG report of CARDINAL DATE also indicates that during each meeting the second applicant takes Y and X to visit the first applicant in prison and afterwards spends the rest of DATE with them . The latter report also noted that Y expressed the wish to visit the first applicant once DATE and the second applicant DATE , and did not wish to visit the applicants without the presence of X. Likewise , X stressed in her letter to the first applicant dated DATE that she wished to have contact with her no more than once a month .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG forwarded to ORG the applicants\u2019 request of CARDINAL DATE for extended contact with X and Y ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court held CARDINAL hearings and appointed an expert in psychology . The court regularly inquired about the progress of the criminal proceedings against the applicants : the latest inquiry was made on DATE . The proceedings appear still to be pending .", "CARDINAL .

As regards the contact rights of parents and estranged children , the old section CARDINAL of LAW ( in force until DATE ) provided that the parent who did not live with his or her child had a right to have contact with him or her unless ORG decided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG set aside this provision in its decision no . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL delivered on DATE . This decision was primarily concerned with the contact rights of parents who did not live together but had never been married , and therefore the issue of contact arrangements could not have been part of divorce proceedings before a court . ORG found that the system whereby the welfare authorities decided on contact arrangements was unconstitutional in that it did not provide for the same level of protection of the children \u2019s rights to participate in the proceedings as would have been provided by way of court proceedings . ORG however noted that the system was not problematic in respect of the protection of the GPE rights of participation . Parents were able to be sufficiently involved in administrative proceedings by having the right to express their opinion , to request evidence , to comment on submissions by other participants , to participate in the hearing and to lodge appeals . Because it was determined that there was insufficient protection for children \u2019s rights , ORG ordered that new legislation should be adopted within DATE with a view to transferring matters concerning contact arrangements to courts .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above ORG decision , an amendment to LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL ) was adopted and entered into force on DATE .
