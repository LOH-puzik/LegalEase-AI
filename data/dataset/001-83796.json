{"ITEMID": "001-83796", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "OMWENYEKE v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr DATE PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer working for the AIRE ( Advice on Individual Rights in LOC ) Centre in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant entered GPE and requested asylum .", "On DATE ORG rejected his asylum request and declared that there was no prohibition on deporting him because he did not face political persecution in GPE . The applicant brought an action in ORG seeking to have this decision quashed .", "On DATE the applicant , who had been issued with a provisional residence permit ( PERSON , see ' Relevant domestic law ' below ) , was directed to reside and remain within the city of ORG pending the decision on his asylum request .", "DATE and DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to quit the city of ORG on CARDINAL occasions in order to attend conferences for refugees and on CARDINAL occasion to meet a lawyer .", "In DATE the applicant left the city of ORG in order to help in preparations for and to attend another congress for refugees , despite the fact that ORG had refused him permission to leave the city . The applicant left ORG on CARDINAL further occasions without having requested authorisation to do so . On DATE the ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant for repeated disregard of a territorial restriction of residence , since it considered the applicant 's offence to be of a minor nature .", "On DATE the applicant was again stopped by the police outside the ORG city limits ; again , he had not requested and obtained the necessary authorisation .", "On DATE the applicant was granted a residence permit ( ORG ) following his marriage to a NORP national and was thus no longer subject to restrictions on his movements .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of repeated disregard of a territorial restriction of residence in view of his residence outside ORG in DATE and on DATE , and ordered him to pay a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "ORG conceded that the application of section QUANTITY ( see ' Relevant domestic law ' below ) led to hardships for asylum seekers in many cases . Nevertheless , contrary to the applicant 's view , that provision was compatible with LAW . This had been confirmed by ORG , in particular , in its decision dated DATE . The legislator had restricted the right to free development of one 's personality , guaranteed by LAW in a proportionate manner . The impugned provision was intended to accelerate the treatment of asylum requests by securing the asylum seekers ' availability , and to distribute between the ORG and cities the tasks and costs incurred by taking in asylum seekers . There was no milder , equally effective means to secure the achievement of the aims pursued by the provision . In particular , the option of restricting merely longer absences from the assigned district and authorising shorter absences without prior permission could not be controlled in practice and would entail considerable administrative expense . Given that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see ' Relevant domestic law ' below ) allowed for exceptions from the restriction of residence , that restriction was not disproportionate . Likewise , it was not disproportionate to enforce the restriction by means of criminal law ( section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "ORG further found that the territorial restriction of residence pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW did not contravene any provisions of public international law . Both LAW relating to LAW ( ORG ; see ' Relevant domestic and public international law ' below ) granted freedom of movement only to refugees who were lawfully on the territory of ORG . This was only the case where an asylum seeker was recognised by a final decision as a person being persecuted for political reasons . The applicant had resided lawfully in GPE only since LAW DATE , when he was granted a residence permit following his marriage to a NORP national .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found that the appeal , which had been lodged in accordance with the formal requirements and time - limit laid down in LAW , was manifestly ill - founded and therefore inadmissible . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , ORG confirmed that the applicable provisions of LAW complied with the provisions of LAW and of public international law .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "ORG found that the complaint had no prospects of success . In so far as the applicant considered sections CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW to be unconstitutional , he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint . He had failed to address the reasons given in ORG decision of DATE in which it had found that the impugned provisions complied with LAW . In so far as the applicant contested the application of the impugned provisions to his case , his submissions were inconsistent . He now claimed to have travelled for the benefit of a refugee organisation on DATE , a fact which he had failed to mention in the proceedings before the criminal courts .", "The decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "LAW ) lays down the rules which are applicable to foreigners who seek asylum on account of political persecution or who seek protection from deportation to a country where their life or freedom would be at risk .", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a foreigner who requests asylum is permitted to reside on ORG while the relevant asylum proceedings are pending ( provisional residence permit \u2013 PERSON ) . He or she is not entitled to reside in a particular Land or place .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that the provisional residence permit is territorially restricted to the district of ORG in which the institution responsible for reception of the foreigner is located .", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , ORG may grant a foreigner who is not or is no longer obliged to live in a reception centre authorisation to leave temporarily the district for which his or her provisional residence permit is valid or , generally , to reside in a neighbouring district . Leave must be granted if there is a pressing public interest or compelling grounds to do so , or if a refusal to grant leave would entail an undue hardship . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL stipulates that leave is to be granted to facilitate appointments with representatives , with the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees and with organisations providing care for refugees . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , a foreigner does not require permission to keep appointments with authorities and courts where his or her appearance in person is necessary .", "Section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW provides that anyone who repeatedly contravenes a restriction of residence imposed under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year , or to a fine .", "The relevant provision of ORG relating to ORG , adopted on DATE , reads :", "Article CARDINAL . Freedom of movement", "\u201c Each Contracting State shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances . \u201d", "LAW , adopted on DATE , provides :", "\u201c Everyone lawfully within the territory of a ORG shall , within that territory , have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
