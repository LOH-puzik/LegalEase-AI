PERSON took Mr PERSON and brought him in front of room CARDINAL . PERSON and PERSON PERSON stood a little south of the room \u2019s door , so that PERSON and PERSON GPE could not establish eye contact .

Another fact which had not been clarified were the circumstances of Mr GPE \u2019s detention leading up to the incident on DATE . Also , it was unclear how many objects Mr GPE \u2019s body had hit during the fall and what was the number of impacts . No inspection had been carried out of the roof of the motorcycle shed . It was apparent from the photographs that it was not deformed although the doctor \u2019s report had stated that on his way down Mr PERSON had first hit the roof and only then the iron grill on the ground .
