Counsel indicated that Mr PERSON and his mother had expressed their wish to continue the proceedings before the ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Mr PERSON runs a CARDINAL-hectare farm in the administrative district of GPE ( d\u00e9partement of ORG ) . His father was joint manager until his death . The farm was acquired in DATE following the expropriation of a previous agricultural holding based in Lognes .", "The central part of the farm consists of various farm buildings around an inner courtyard and includes a chapel and a chapter house dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , which are the remains of the NORP commandery of GPE . Both of those edifices are tightly integrated into the surrounding buildings .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP prefecture offered a ORG grant for the restoration of the chapel and chapter house . The proposed grant was to cover PERCENT of the initial work . The applicant company declined the offer in view of the excessive share of the cost that it would have to bear .", "By a decision of the prefect dated DATE , the remains of the commandery were added to the secondary list of historic buildings .", "Following the approval of ORG on DATE and by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the chapel and chapter house of the historic GPE commandery were added to the primary list of historic buildings under FAC of DATE . The reason for the listing was that \u201c the preservation [ of the buildings ] ha[d ] public - interest value in relation to the history of art , in view of the rarity and authenticity of the LOC architecture \u201d . This status gave rise to various sets of proceedings .", "As the applicant company had envisaged building a farm shed near the chapel and chapter house , various meetings were organised with the national heritage architect and the architecture authority for the d\u00e9partement of ORG with a view to finding a new location , since the applicant company \u2019s initial plan could no longer be implemented owing to the constraints of the historic monument protection . On DATE the applicant company lodged an application for a building permit in respect of a farm machinery workshop , in spite of the national heritage architect \u2019s negative opinion , which was subsequently confirmed on CARDINAL DATE . By a decision of the prefect dated DATE , the building permit was refused on the ground that \u201c the intended construction would have an adverse effect on the chapel of the NORP commandery and would undermine the current harmony of the buildings as a whole \u201d .", "The applicant company applied to the ORG for judicial review of the prefect \u2019s decision .", "On DATE a further meeting was held on the site with a view to finding a possible location for the farm machinery workshop . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the national heritage architect informed the applicant company , among other things , that the purpose was not to prevent it from building but to help it draw up the best possible plan , taking into account all the technical , operational and site - related constraints .", "In a judgment of DATE , the ORG set aside the decision of CARDINAL DATE to refuse the building permit , on the ground that the prefect had based his decision on an incorrect assessment of the facts . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal by the Minister for Infrastructure , ORG on the ground that the national heritage architect had not given his opinion within the statutory period .", "On DATE the applicant company applied for a permit to build a shelter .", "On DATE the national heritage architect advised against the granting of a permit . By a decision of DATE , the prefect denied the applicant company a building permit in respect of a maintenance and repair workshop on the ground that", "\u201c the work envisaged is capable of adversely affecting the surroundings of the historic monument protected under LAW of DATE ( chapel and chapter house ) \u201d .", "On DATE the national heritage architect received PERSON , who submitted to him a plan for the construction of a farm building situated to the west of the main farm and aligned with an existing shed ( adjoining the chapel ) . The national heritage architect gave his approval in principle , subject to a few minor adjustments , as the plan complied with the main guidelines laid down by the architecture and heritage authority of the d\u00e9partement of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant company applied for a building permit . By a decision of the prefect dated DATE , the building permit was granted subject to certain conditions , such as the obligation to plant a screen of standard trees of local species . The extra cost incurred on account of the permit conditions was MONEY ( FRF ) .", "On DATE the applicant company applied for a permit to demolish CARDINAL unlisted buildings that were not adapted to the needs of the farm . By a decision of the prefect dated DATE , the demolition permit was refused on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... the work envisaged is capable of adversely affecting the surroundings of the historic monument protected under LAW of DATE ( ORG ) .", "... the disappearance of these traditional constructions with their specific character would detract from the immediate surroundings of the above - mentioned protected buildings and would undermine the quality of their environment ; restoration with a view to reuse has to be envisaged . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant company lodged CARDINAL fresh applications for building permits .

As the applicant company failed to proceed with the building work within the periods laid down in the decisions , the validity of the CARDINAL building permits has since lapsed .", "On DATE the applicant company applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat for judicial review of the listing decision of CARDINAL DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the applicant company \u2019s application for judicial review and confirmed both the formal validity and the substantive legality of the impugned decision . The PERSON d\u2019Etat noted in particular , concerning the substantive legality of the listing decision , that", "\u201c the chapel and chapter house of the GPE commandery ... constitute a rare example of PERSON architecture ... the preservation [ of which ] has public - interest value for artistic and historical reasons , such that the listing thereof as a historic monument can legally be justified ... [ and ] the second paragraph of LAW of DATE ... can not have the purpose or effect of obliging the authorities to attach any easements or obligations to the listing status other than those resulting , pursuant to the LAW of DATE , from the listing itself \u201d .", "On DATE , in a letter addressed to the prefect of the d\u00e9partement of ORG , the applicant company sought ORG CARDINAL in compensation under section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , on the ground that", "\u201c the listing has clearly caused harm to the claimant company \u2019s agricultural activity , by creating in the very heart of the farm an easement capable of rendering impossible any development of the farm , or even of seriously undermining its day - to - DATE operations \u201d .", "Having regard to the fact that the listing had obliged the company to \u201c rebuild all the farm buildings currently at its disposal in a position other than that in which the operational buildings [ we]re currently located \u201d , and to the fact that this total reconstruction had been assessed by experts at ORG CARDINAL , the applicant company concluded its letter with a claim for that sum under the second paragraph of LAW above - mentioned LAW .", "Having failed to reach a friendly settlement of the compensation claim , the applicant company lodged an application for compensation on DATE with the expropriations judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance . At a hearing on DATE , the Government Commissioner noted that there was \u201c some confusion between obligations for owners of properties located in the vicinity of listed buildings and easements arising directly from a listing decision \u201d .", "In a judgment of DATE , the tribunal de grande instance rejected the application , noting in particular :", "\u201c In the present case ... CARDINAL parts of the farm buildings have been listed , representing PERCENT of the total developed area .", "The damage claimed by ORG mainly concerns developments affecting non - listed structures ; accordingly , the applicant company has not shown that it has sustained damage in respect of the listed premises alone or as a result of a change affecting the premises and capable of causing such damage ; it is not therefore entitled to rely on the provisions of LAW of DATE since the dispute concerns only the area surrounding the listed premises and , moreover , the applicant company is bound only by restrictions that do not preclude it from altering neighbouring premises if it abides by the prescriptions laid down by the authorities .", "In these circumstances , it is appropriate to reject the application by ORG , which has not sustained direct and established pecuniary damage as a result of the listing of its buildings . \u201d", "The applicant company appealed against that judgment , maintaining in particular that LAW of DATE was to be construed as creating an entitlement to compensation for all forms of damage sustained by an owner as a result of a listing decision , and not simply that sustained in respect of the listed buildings themselves . The applicant company further argued that \u201c such a restrictive construction of section CARDINAL ... would in effect deprive the owner of the compensation due to him for damage arising from a serious violation of his right of property , in breach of the French Constitution and LAW , which expressly guarantee respect for such right \u201d . The Government Commissioner noted , as at first instance , that there was \u201c some confusion between obligations for owners of properties located in the vicinity of listed buildings and easements arising directly from a listing decision \u201d . He stated that the case in issue \u201c concern[ed ] an easement for the protection of the vicinity of a listed structure ... [ which was ] not to be confused with easements arising directly from a listing decision \u201d . He concluded that the grounds submitted in support of the applicant company \u2019s claim did not derive directly from the listing decision . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment and gave the following reasoning :", "\u201c \u2013 Construction of section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE", "The appellant company claims that LAW ... is to be construed as pertaining to the entire grouping of buildings , incorporating the listed structures .", "However , that provision refers only to the listing decision .", "The notion of \u2018 ORG as used in the second paragraph of LAW of DATE pertains only to the LOC designated in the listing decision .", "The decision of CARDINAL DATE states that \u2018 the chapel and chapter house of the historic GPE commandery shall be listed as historic monuments ... \u2019 .", "It is therefore appropriate to dismiss the claim of ORG whereby it contends that the term \u2018 premises\u2019 as used in the above - mentioned section CARDINAL should be construed as covering the entire property , which would be tantamount to the listing of the whole complex of buildings .", "\u2013 Conditions of application of LAW of DATE", "For there to be an entitlement to compensation , the easement relating to the listing must have entailed a change in the condition or use of the LOC giving rise to direct , substantiated and established damage , for which the burden of proof lies with the claimant .", "In this connection ORG based its claim on the restrictions imposed on it , as a result of the listing , in respect of its plans for demolition , the construction of a farm shed or development of the farm site .", "However , those restrictions , created by prior agreement with the national heritage architect , are not the result of any change in the status or use of the LOC , as the chapter house and chapel have not been affected by such changes .", "The restrictions imposed on the company result from the application of LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , which protects the view around a listed building by requiring the agreement of the national heritage architect prior to any demolition or construction .", "Such an easement , pertaining to the protection of the area surrounding a listed building , does not give rise to the compensation provided for in the current legislation .", "Moreover , ORG has obtained permission to erect a storage building , subject to the approval of the plan by the national heritage architect .", "Lastly , such easements for the protection of the area surrounding a listed building derive from the law and can not give rise to compensation unless it is specifically provided for in a statutory instrument . ... \u201d", "The applicant company subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law , in support of which it submitted a single ground with CARDINAL limbs . CARDINAL of its claims was that ORG decision had been devoid of the statutory basis required by LAW , as it had denied compensation for damage resulting from the listing without considering whether such refusal was contrary to the provisions of LAW .", "On DATE ORG , rejecting the submissions of ORG , dismissed the appeal in a judgment containing the following reasoning :", "\u201c ... having found , firstly , that LAW of DATE provided for compensation following a listing by official order if the resulting easements and obligations entailed a change in the condition or use of the LOC and , secondly , that the easement pertaining to the protection of the area surrounding a listed building did not give rise to any compensation under the current legislation , ORG , leaving aside a subsidiary consideration and without being required to make a determination that had not been sought from it as to the applicability of LAW , rightly considered that the notion of \u2018 premises\u2019 pertained only to those designated in the listing decision and dismissed the company \u2019s compensation claim , thus justifying its decision in law . \u201d", "...", "In GPE , the first provisions for the protection of historic monuments date back to DATE , when the church of FAC was listed .
