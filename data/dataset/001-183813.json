The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in GPE and the second applicant lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Ts . Mihalev , father of the first applicant and grandfather of the second applicant , owned a machinery factory in GPE , which was nationalised in DATE . After the nationalisation the property was allocated for use to a ORG - owned enterprise , which in DATE was transformed into a ORG - owned company named T .. Under domestic law , such a transformation entailed the newly - created company becoming , in principle , the owner of the assets which had until then been allocated to it for use and management ; some assets allocated to ORG - owned enterprises or companies could nevertheless be the subject of restitution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After ORG of Nationalised Real Property Act ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) came into force in DATE , the first applicant and his brother asked the mayor of GPE to strike the factory building out of the register of ORG properties . Their request was allowed in a decision of the mayor of CARDINAL DATE , which explicitly referred to LAW . On that basis in DATE the first applicant and his brother obtained a notary deed , which also stated that the property had been subject to restitution under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant and his brother concluded a rent contract with company ORG , which undertook to pay rent in exchange of the use of the building . The term of the contract was extended on several occasions , the last of which in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant \u2019s brother transferred his share in the building to his daughter , the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . After the entry into force of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in DATE the first applicant and his brother applied to receive compensation for moveable properties such as industrial equipment and materials which had been nationalised together with the factory . In a decision of DATE the Minister of Economy awarded them compensation for these properties , noting in addition that the factory building had been the subject of restitution and no compensation was due for it . That decision was upheld in a final judgment of ORG of DATE , after the first applicant and his brother sought its judicial review , contesting the manner of compensation . Eventually , in DATE they received compensation bonds with a face value of MONEY ( ORG , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Company T. was privatised in DATE and the new management stopped paying rent to the applicants for the factory building , arguing that it had in fact never been subject of restitution .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE company T. brought proceedings against the applicants , claiming to be the factory building \u2019s owner . It argued that the restitution of the property had not taken place , because the preconditions under LAW had not been complied with , and that it had become the owner of the building as a result of its transformation into a company ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the claim . However , on DATE the ORG of Appeal quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and allowed the action against the applicants , finding that the preconditions for restitution had indeed not been met . On the basis of expert evidence and witness testimony , it concluded that after the nationalisation the building had been modified in a manner and to a degree which meant that in DATE it had not existed in its state prior to DATE . Accordingly , the applicants could not rely on restitution and company ORG had become the owner of the building on the strength of its transformation from a ORG - owned enterprise into a company in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to accept for examination the ORG appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants applied to the GPE regional governor to receive compensation for the factory building under LAW . In a decision of DATE the governor dismissed their request , as it had not been submitted within the time - limit provided for under that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . After the applicants applied for its judicial review , the governor \u2019s decision was upheld in a final judgment of ORG of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
