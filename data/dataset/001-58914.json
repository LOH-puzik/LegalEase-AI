CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 14+8;Not necessary to examine Art. 14+P1-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Luzius Wildhaber", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE . He is a retired civil servant . On DATE he rented from ORG a house in which he has been living ever since with his wife and CARDINAL children . The tenancy agreement had many of the features of a typical contract for the lease of property with provisions on the payment of rent by the applicant , the use and maintenance of the property , the giving of notice and a termination date . The agreement provided that the tenancy would come to an end in the event of the applicant being transferred to a district other than the one in which the property was situated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the permission by virtue of which he occupied the LOC was revoked and that he had to surrender the property by DATE . He failed to do so and on DATE the Attorney - General notified him that if he did not vacate the house before DATE legal action would be taken against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant replied that he had been living together with his family in the house for DATE . He had been obliged to spend significant sums of money on the maintenance and improvement of the house since the competent public authorities had shown no interest in its upkeep . He claimed that he was a \u201c statutory tenant \u201d within the meaning of the Rent Control Law DATE ( Law no . DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) and stated that he would continue to occupy the LOC as long as he was protected by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , replying to a second letter from the Attorney - General dated DATE , the applicant reiterated his earlier position .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government of GPE instituted proceedings against the applicant before ORG of GPE to have him evicted . The government submitted , inter alia , that the applicant did not occupy the house under a tenancy agreement within the meaning of LAW DATE , but that the LOC had been allocated to him by administrative order because of his position in the civil service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE gave judgment against the applicant . The court did not pronounce on the issue of the title under which the applicant occupied the LOC . The court \u2019s interpretation of LAW DATE led it to conclude that its protection did not extend to the applicant since it only bound private owners of property and not ORG . A person who rented LOC owned by the ORG could not therefore be considered a \u201c statutory tenant \u201d protected by that PERSON .", "The applicant was ordered to vacate the premises before DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG relying on LAW . At the hearing before ORG the applicant relied essentially on the following argument : his rights as a tenant were \u201c property rights \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL and he was the victim of discrimination in the enjoyment of these rights because LAW DATE , as interpreted by ORG of GPE , gave no protection to tenants of the ORG whereas the same PERSON protected the State as a \u201c statutory tenant \u201d when it rented LOC owned by a private individual . The applicant also submitted that he was the victim of a further act of discrimination in that he enjoyed less protection under the relevant PERSON than tenants of private persons .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , considering that he could not claim any property rights under LAW as a tenant . The court also found that , in any event , the notion of equality did not require that a person who enjoyed the protection of ORG as a tenant should be automatically required to grant the same protection to his or her tenants if that person happened to own property . Finally , the court considered , in an obiter dictum , that even if the case concerned the different treatment reserved by the law to property rented out by private owners and to property rented out by the ORG , there would be no violation of the LAW or the LAW because \u201c it would be reasonable to consider that it is not necessary to grant protection [ to tenants ] vis - \u00e0 - vis the [ ORG ] which [ is ] not in the same position as a private owner and [ is ] not expected to administer the property of the ORG according to criteria similar to those guiding a private owner \u201d .", "Further to this decision , the applicant has been threatened with imminent eviction .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the Rent Control Law DATE applies only to dwellings and shops in areas designated \u201c regulated areas \u201d , which are defined in LAW as every area which was declared as such under the previous rent control legislation and includes every other area so declared by order of ORG . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , which has been unaffected by subsequent amendments to the DATE PERSON , sets out the circumstances under which an order may be made .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides as follows :", "\u201c Whenever it is considered by ORG to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing the availability of dwellings and shops for reasonable rents and the security of possession thereof , or whenever the public interest otherwise so requires , ORG may by Order published in ORG declare any area in GPE as a regulated area , and thereupon the provisions of this PERSON shall apply to all dwellings or shops within such area . \u201d", "\u201c PERSON \u03c4\u03bf \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd PERSON \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd \u03ae \u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd , \u03ae \u03bf\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae , \u03c4\u03bf \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd PERSON \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03cd\u03be\u03b7 \u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd \u03b5\u03bd PERSON \u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03bd , \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ORG \u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03b4\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2. \u201d", "CARDINAL .
