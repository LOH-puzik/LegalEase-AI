SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG and her son PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and are currently in GPE .", "On DATE the applicants ( together with S. , the husband / father of the applicants ) arrived in GPE from GPE and , on DATE , they applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and residence permits . The first applicant stated that she was a trained engineer and had worked at a construction site in LOC where she had met PERSON who also worked there . In DATE the family had moved to GPE , where they had lived until the departure to GPE . According to the applicants , the first applicant had been working as an election administrator during the mayor \u2019s election in DATE and had revealed irregularities , for which reason she had been dismissed from work . Following this , the authorities had harassed the family in different ways , inter alia , by creating administrative problems for them ( their apartment had not been repaired , they had been prohibited from using electrical appliances in their home , their telephone had been cut off and they had not received proper medical care ) . The first applicant had complained about their problems to the authorities , the PERSON and the President but the only result had been that the local authorities had threatened them and had told the first applicant to stop complaining . In DATE the applicants had been assaulted and battered by unknown men ; they strongly suspected that the authorities were responsible . The second applicant had been granted MONEY in compensation for the battering but he had only received MONEY . He alleged that the persons who had battered him had told him that his mother should stop complaining . He still suffered from headaches and problems with his heart . The second applicant further stated that he feared being drafted for military service and being sent to GPE , where several of his friends had died .", "On DATE ORG rejected the family \u2019s application for asylum and residence permits . It found that the difficulties which the family had endured in their home country could neither be classified as persecution nor be considered serious enough to grant the family residence permits on humanitarian grounds . With regard to the second applicant \u2019s fear of being drafted for military service , ORG observed that this was not a ground on which he could be granted leave to stay in GPE .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , maintaining their claims and adding a number of examples of how the family had been treated unjustly by the authorities because of the first applicant \u2019s complaints to them . The applicants had , inter alia , not been given a proper apartment to live in and had also been refused housing benefits from the ORG . The first applicant further alleged that she had been threatened and harassed in GPE because she had reported a person for drug abuse . She stated that she could take no more and that both she and PERSON were receiving psychiatric help following an attempt by S. to hang himself . The second applicant claimed that he suffered from recurring headaches .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , sharing ORG reasoning and conclusion . It further found that the applicants\u2019 mental health problems were not of such a serious nature that they could be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicants then lodged a new application for residence permits , relying on the same grounds as before and adding that the NORP authorities had not examined their application properly . The first applicant claimed that her life would be in danger if she were forced to return to GPE , since they had been denied all civil and human rights there . Moreover , she had written more letters to the NORP President and ORG which had led to her sister being harassed by Government representatives and local authorities in GPE . The sister had been asked questions about the whereabouts of the first applicant and threatened .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application . It observed that it had already considered the applicants\u2019 claims in its earlier decision and found no reason to change it . In reaching this conclusion , it had regard to the additional submissions made by the applicants .", "The applicants lodged another new application with ORG , adding to their earlier claims that the second applicant would face a real risk of being bullied if , upon return , he had to do his military service . Due to the family \u2019s very difficult situation , he had tried to commit suicide in DATE and the personnel at the hospital had had to watch over him TIME a day . He had remained in psychiatric care as an in - patient on a voluntary basis for DATE . They submitted several medical certificates concerning the entire family .", "On DATE ORG also rejected this application , noting that the second applicant did not suffer from a serious mental disorder but that his poor mental health was due to the family \u2019s stressful and insecure living situation . It therefore concluded that neither his nor his GPE mental health was so poor that the family could be granted leave to stay in GPE", "On DATE the applicants were deported to GPE .", "On DATE the second applicant returned to GPE and his girlfriend \u2019s mother let him stay with them . However , he did not apply for asylum and a residence permit until DATE . Before ORG , he claimed that he and his parents had been detained by the police for DATE upon return to GPE and that he had been beaten with batons . When they had returned to their home town , GPE , he had once been attacked by CARDINAL unknown persons at the entrance to their apartment building . His mother had also been threatened on the phone by unknown persons . It had been impossible for him to live in GPE because of all the threats against him and his parents . If he had to return , he would not be able to study , get a job or have access to health care . Moreover , he alleged that he had been called to do his military service and that , since he had left the country , he was considered a deserter and would risk a long prison sentence . The second applicant further stated that he was depressed and feeling unwell , for which he was seeing a counsellor . Lastly , he invoked his relationship with his NORP girlfriend ( born in DATE ) and the fact that he lived with her and her family . They had met in DATE and been together since then .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the second applicant could not be granted asylum because he had evaded military service and it found nothing to suggest that he would receive a disproportionate sentence if he was tried and convicted of desertion . ORG then considered that it was for the NORP authorities to deal with threats and violence from unknown persons and that the second applicant had failed to show that the NORP authorities neither could nor would help him . Moreover , he could not be granted leave to stay either based on reasons of a social / economic nature or based on his alleged poor health . Lastly , the ORG noted that the second applicant \u2019s girlfriend was DATE and that it was normally required that both persons in a relationship were adults ( over DATE ) for ORG to consider granting a residence permit based on a close relationship . In any event , it observed that the second applicant could apply for a residence permit based on the relationship from GPE , as was the normal procedure .", "The second applicant appealed to ORG , relying on the same grounds as before and adding that it would be inhumane to send him back .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision in full .", "ORG then carried out a new examination of the second applicant \u2019s case under the interim amendments to LAW in force at the time . The second applicant submitted that he should be allowed to stay in GPE since he had been in the country for a long time and had developed strong ties to NORP society . In this respect , he referred to his girlfriend with whose family he lived , that to the fact that he was playing in a local football club and that he had been promised a job if he got a residence permit . He further stated that it would be devastating to his mental health and development if his medical treatment was interrupted . Lastly , he claimed that the NORP military authorities were looking for him because he had not yet done his military service .", "On DATE ORG decided that he could not be granted leave to stay in GPE based on the interim amendments to LAW . It considered that the second applicant had not been in GPE for such a long time that he had established strong ties to NORP society . Moreover , his medical condition was not so serious that he could be granted leave to stay on this ground and he should have applied for a residence permit on the basis of his relationship with his girlfriend before having entered GPE . ORG concluded that the second applicant had not invoked any new circumstances which had not already been considered by itself or ORG and that there were no reasons to depart from their earlier conclusions . This decision could not be appealed against .", "During DATE the first applicant returned to GPE and renewed her application for asylum and a residence permit . This application is still pending before ORG . It would seem that PERSON remains in GPE .", "According to medical certificates , dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , written by PERSON , counsellor , PERSON , resident doctor , and PERSON , chief physician and specialist in psychiatry , at the child and youth psychiatric unit at ORG hospital , the second applicant had been in contact with the unit since DATE . He had contacted them for problems with recurring headaches which he claimed had been caused by the battering in GPE and for which he had also seen a neurologist in GPE . The second applicant had been very afraid , anxious and stressed by the thought of being deported and had preferred to be with his friends , playing football , instead of being at home . His insecure living situation had deeply affected him and , on DATE , he had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of pills . He had been hospitalised and , initially , kept under surveillance . He had left the hospital at DATE but had been hospitalised again on DATE , following another rejection by ORG . Apparently , he had threatened to kill himself using a knife but his mother had intervened . This time he had remained at the hospital for DATE , diagnosed as suffering from severe depression and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) caused by various traumas over DATE .", "After his return to GPE , in DATE , he had contacted the psychiatric unit at the hospital . He had begun to have regular contact with his counsellor , PERSON , who , in a medical certificate dated DATE , stated that , on DATE , he had tried to commit suicide by taking pills , following a rejection of his application for asylum by ORG . He had been urgently hospitalised as he had lost consciousness . He had been disappointed that the suicide attempt had failed but had been released from hospital after DATE when the treating physician considered that he was no longer suicidal . The counsellor concluded that the second applicant was in great need of care and treatment to deal with his situation and the trauma of having been an asylum seeker for DATE without any stability in his life . There was a risk that his mental health had been seriously damaged which could lead to him developing a serious mental disorder .", "The last medical certificate , dated DATE , was written by ORG and stated that the second applicant suffered greatly from his insecure situation and had lost faith in the future . The doctor considered that the second applicant was on the verge of a serious mental crisis and that there was a clear risk of suicide .", "On DATE the applicants requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of their deportation to GPE .", "On DATE the President of the Second Section decided to apply Rule CARDINAL . He further decided to request ORG to provide information on the second applicant \u2019s current mental health and whether it would be an impediment to his deportation .", "On DATE the Government informed the ORG that , on DATE , ORG , following the ORG \u2019s request , had decided to stay the deportation of the second applicant until further notice . However , since the first applicant \u2019s application for asylum and a residence permit was still pending before ORG , no enforceable deportation decision existed against her which could be suspended .", "As concerned the second applicant \u2019s mental health and the possibility to deport him , the Government submitted that , based on the medical evidence available , his poor mental health related primarily to his uncertain situation as an asylum seeker in GPE and the prospect of being expelled . In this respect , they noted that both his suicide attempts had been directly linked to decisions to reject his asylum applications or preparations to enforce the deportation orders . Moreover , the care offered by the psychiatric unit had focused on ways for the second applicant to cope with his situation and to support him . The diagnosis from DATE that he suffered from PTSD and severe depression had not been repeated and , in the Government \u2019s view , there was nothing to support such a diagnosis at the present time . On the contrary , they observed that he had only met with the counsellor CARDINAL times DATE . In any event , they found nothing in the medical evidence available to substantiate that his current state of health was so poor that he could be considered to be suffering from a serious mental disturbance . In these circumstances , and referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , the ORG considered that there were no impediments to deporting the second applicant to his home country . They also expressed their confidence that a deportation would be carried out in such a manner as to minimise the suffering of the second applicant , taking into account his medical condition .", "The basic provisions , applied in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE were laid down in the CARDINAL LAW ( utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . However , LAW was replaced , on DATE , by a new LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslag , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Both the DATE and DATE Acts define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , LAW provided that an alien staying in GPE for DATE should have a residence permit . Such a permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , should be allowed to settle in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . For example , serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the grant of a residence permit if it was a life - threatening illness for which no treatment could be provided in the alien \u2019s home country .", "Further , according to LAW , an alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to residence in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether the persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( LAW , LAW ) . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d was meant , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "An alien who was to be refused entry , deported or expelled , in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force , could be granted a residence permit if he or she filed a new application based on circumstances which had not previously been examined , and if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , LAW , or it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce such a decision ( LAW , Section CARDINAL b ) . Regard could also be had to serious illness under this provision . Such new applications were filed with and examined by ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a refusal of entry , deportation or expulsion , account had to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "In essence , LAW did not substantially amend the above provisions , except for the following .", "By LAW , ORG has been replaced by ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW ) . Moreover , it is no longer possible to renew applications but , instead , ORG shall , on its own initiative , determine whether there is any impediment to the deportation or expulsion ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Furthermore , DATE and DATE , certain interim amendments to the DATE Act were in force , according to which ORG , upon application by an alien or on its own initiative , could re - determine final decisions already taken by ORG . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
