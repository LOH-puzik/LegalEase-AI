The second applicant stated that she had met with lawyer PERSON at the detention centre and they had agreed that the lawyer would not appear in court .

ORG had failed to ensure order and it had been impossible to examine evidence and to submit new evidence in an objective and fair manner because of the repeated scuffles and stressful atmosphere . The conflicts , threats of violence , verbal abuse and scuffles had worsened during the last CARDINAL hearings in ORG . The court , however , had failed to take any measures , which precluded her further participation and even made it impossible to make her final pleading which , as a result , she had been forced to submit by post .
