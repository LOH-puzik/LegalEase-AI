The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant tried to smuggle alcohol to his friends , who were detained in prison . When police officers PERSON and PERSON tried to arrest him he apparently resisted the arrest . Subsequently , the applicant was accused of assaulting officer S.", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was charged with violence against a public official . The investigator in the NORP district prosecutor 's office of ORG noted in his decision that the applicant had committed an administrative offence of smuggling prohibited goods to detainees ; he had resisted lawful arrest during the commission of that offence ; the latter act constituted a criminal offence punishable under LAW . The investigator 's decision also contained a list of procedural rights under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It appears that the applicant was given a copy of the above decision .", "CARDINAL . During the preliminary investigation , officer PERSON explained that on DATE when together with officer PERSON he was patrolling in the vicinity of the prison they had noticed the applicant and CARDINAL other persons throwing certain objects over the prison wall . When they had attempted to arrest them , the applicant and others had assaulted them and tried to escape . Officer A confirmed his fellow officer 's statement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disagreed with their version of the events and claimed in essence that the police officers had been drunk and had beaten him up and shot his friend .", "CARDINAL . At the trial , on DATE the applicant made a written statement declining the services of his counsel . He declared that this waiver was not based on any \u201c financial considerations \u201d and that he would continue to ensure his own defence . The hearing was adjourned because certain witnesses , including officers PERSON , had not answered the court summons .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the trial court received a note of a telephone conversation between the court registry and ORG 's grandmother . The latter explained that PERSON had resettled to GPE for permanent residence ; that she had informed him on DATE about the court summons and that he had asked her to inform the court that he maintained his earlier statement and could not attend the trial because his wife was about to be admitted to a maternity hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial judge received a note of a telephone conversation between the court registry and investigator PERSON , who informed the judge that PERSON had reportedly moved to LOC without giving his new address ; PERSON was still an officer and was living at the same address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , noting the officers ' absence , the trial judge enquired with the parties as to the admission in evidence of the officers ' pre - trial statements . As can be seen from the trial verbatim record , both the prosecutor and the applicant consented to the reading out of the officers ' pre - trial statements .", "CARDINAL . The court also referred to the statements from the prison guard PERSON , who had been on duty DATE and had seen several persons throwing certain objects over the prison wall . The court also heard guard PERSON , who had been patrolling at the territory of the prison and had seen the bottles being thrown over the prison wall . According to CARDINAL medical reports , PERSON were sober on DATE and PERSON had various injuries on his body . During a pre - trial identification , he had pointed to the applicant as his assailant .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected as unreliable the applicant 's version of the events , which was supported by CARDINAL witnesses on his behalf . The court also dismissed the fourth witness 's allegation that CARDINAL of the officers had been drunk on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the ORG of ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed contending that the court had not given a proper weight to the fact that despite the summons PERSON had not appeared before the trial court and thus had not been examined at the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c The court rightly founded the judgment on the testimonies by DATE because those testrroborated by other evidence presented in the judgment , such as the medical report indicating that PERSON had [ injuries ] , PERSON 's statement ... , PERSON 's statement ... The reference to the failure of ORG to appear before the court on the summons is not a valid reason for annulment of the judgment because the court obtained the parties ' opinion on the possibility of reading out their depositions in view of their absence from the trial ; [ the applicant ] did not object to the reading out ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for supervisory review of the above judgments . In DATE the Prosecutor of the LOC applied for supervisory review , considering that there was no corpus delicti and that there was no case to answer against the applicant . On DATE the Acting President of ORG dismissed the prosecutor 's application and refused leave to supervisory review .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , a defendant has a right to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence . LAW contains a list of procedural rights , including a right to legal assistance and to free legal representation in certain circumstances , a right to participate in hearings before first - instance and higher courts , to have access to the trial record and to lodge comments on it . During the first interview the defendant should be informed of the above procedural rights ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . All evidence should normally be presented at a court hearing during which the court should hear statements from the defendant , victim , witnesses and so on and examine physical evidence ( LAW ) . The reading of pre - trial depositions should only be allowable under ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Code ( ibid ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , in its version before DATE , the reading out of earlier statements made by the victim or witness was allowable if the parties gave their consent to it and if ( i ) there were substantial contradictions between the earlier and the later statements , or ( ii ) the victim or witness had not appeared before the trial court .", "CARDINAL . Sitting as a court of appeal in a criminal case examined by the first - instance court in DATE , ORG interpreted Article CARDINAL as requiring consent from both parties only when it was the intention of the trial court ex officio to read out a pre - trial statement rather than a request from CARDINAL of the parties ( Appeal decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its admissibility decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL-O ) , ORG held that the reading out of pre - trial depositions should be considered as an exception to the court 's own assessment of evidence and should not upset the procedural balance between the interests of the prosecution and those of the defence . If a party insists on calling a witness whose testimony may be important to the case , the court should take all available measures to ensure this witness 's presence in court . When that witness is available for questioning , the reading out of his or her deposition should be considered inadmissible evidence and should not be relied upon . However , when the witness is not available for questioning , the defence should still be provided with appropriate procedural safeguards such as challenge to the read - out deposition , a request for challenge by way of examining further evidence , as well as pre - trial face - to - face confrontation between that witness and the defendant when the latter was given an opportunity to put questions to the former ( see also the admissibility decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL-O ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
