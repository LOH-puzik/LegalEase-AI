The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the applicant was captured in GPE , in GPE . By DATE , he was transferred to the custody of the ORG . This fact is mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE ORG :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ REDACTED ] By DATE , the ORG had PERSON and another high - value detainee , PERSON , in custody [ REDACTED ] and ORG ( OMS ) provided medical care to detainees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , GPE agents took him to a secret ORG prison in GPE known as the \u201c GPE \u201d . During his detention , the interrogators subjected him to prolonged stress standing positions , during which his wrists were shackled to a bar or hook in the ceiling above the head for DATE .", "CARDINAL . After a brief stay at the \u201c GPE \u201d , GPE agents took him to another secret ORG prison in GPE , GPE , code - named \u201c Cat \u2019s Eye \u201d ( often written as CARDINAL word \u201c GPE \u201d in ORG documents ) , where he remained until DATE . Mr PERSON was detained in the same facility throughout the relevant time ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) . At this site , the interrogations of both applicants were videotaped .", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE ORG , at that black site the ORG subjected the applicant to the EITs ( see also paragraphs PERSON above ) from DATE until DATE .", "In the chapter \u201c ORG at [ NAME REDACTED ] \u201d , which is in most part redacted , paragraphs CARDINAL read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ REDACTED ] psycholgist / interrogators [ REDACTED ] led each interrogation of PERSON and PERSON where EITs were used . The psychologist / interrogators conferred with [ REDACTED ] team members before each interrogation session . Psychological evaluations were performed by [ REDACTED ] psychologists .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not contradict the facts as related by the applicant .", "In their written observations filed on CARDINAL DATE , they submitted that until the criminal investigation in GPE had been terminated they reserved their right to comment on and rectify the facts of the case as supplied to them when they were given notice of the application .", "In their pleading of DATE they stated the following : \u201c ORG do not contest in the proceedings before the ORG the allegations submitted by the applicant \u2019s plenipotentiaries , nor [ do they ] contest the alleged facts \u201d .", "At the oral hearing , the ORG said that they were not prepared to affirm or negate the facts submitted by Mr PERSON and PERSON Abu Zubaydah because they believed that those facts should first be established and evaluated by the NORP judicial system . They added that , in contrast to the case of ORG , in these cases the ORG was not confronted with CARDINAL different versions of facts or differences in accounts of facts . Accordingly , in their view , there was no need for the Court to take the role of a first - instance court and to establish the facts of the cases itself before the domestic proceedings had been completed .", "CARDINAL . As regards the documentary and oral evidence obtained by the ORG throughout the proceedings , the Government did not at any stage contest the admissibility , accuracy or credibility of the relevant materials and testimonies . Furthermore , at the hearing in camera held on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , during which the parties were asked to state their positions on the oral evidence taken and on whether the parties could rely on that evidence at the public hearing , they confirmed that they had no objection to the parties\u2019 referring at the public hearing to the testimony of the experts and the witness . In their words , \u201c this [ was ] knowledge that [ was ] already accessible , albeit via other channels , in the public domain anyway \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the public hearing , in relation to that testimony , the ORG drew the ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that both Senator PERSON and PERSON had carried out inquiries which were not judicial proceedings . Those inquiries , they said , were \u201c pre - procedural examinations \u201d instituted for the purpose of corroborating the participation of the NORP countries in the ORG . They had not dealt with individual cases . In terms of the standard of proof they were not comparable to criminal proceedings . In contrast , the investigation in GPE was being conducted in order to obtain evidence concerning all possible offences , to establish individual perpetrators and to determine whether it was possible to bring an indictment to the court .", "The Government admitted that the findings of the relevant international inquiries were a source of information about the potential evidence and indicated the direction for subsequent actions to be taken by prosecutors . However , they did not constitute evidence in the strict sense of the word and relying on them would not be sufficient for a prosecutor to bring a charge or indictment against an individual in respect of a specific offence .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG , responding to a question from ORG at the hearing , concerning the injured party status accorded to the applicant and Mr PERSON by the investigating prosecutor , explained that for a procedural decision to identify an individual as an injured party in criminal proceedings CARDINAL elements had to be present . First , the subjective element , that is to say a person must have a sense of having suffered prejudice on account of the commission of an offence . The second , the objective element consisted in an indication that there existed a sufficient level of credibility that an offence had been committed to the detriment of that person in GPE . In the applicant \u2019s case the credibility was sufficiently high for him to be treated as a victim of an offence and the investigation continued in order to determine the extent to which he had been harmed and by whom .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , in his submissions concerning GPE \u2019s knowledge of the ORG , the probative value of the evidence before the ORG , the burden of proof and the standard of proof as applicable in the present case stated , in particular , as follows .", "CARDINAL . Numerous documents , including reports prepared by international organisations , recounted that on DATE the ORG had transported Mr LOC on a plane registered NCARDINALMU from GPE to GPE airport . The airport was TIME drive from Stare Kiejkuty .", "Official documents disclosed by ORG , the DATE ORG and other reports before the ORG confirmed that this flight had landed on DATE at Szymany airport . PERSON submissions , which the applicant adopted in so far as they supported his claims , provided further evidence corroborating the fact that he and PERSON Al Nashiri had been flown from GPE to GPE on the same flight .", "CARDINAL . The material before the ORG also confirmed that the applicant had been transferred from GPE to Rabat on a plane registered NCARDINALP on DATE .", "Official documents disclosed by ORG and ORG , the DATE ORG and ORG stated that rendition aircraft NCARDINALP had departed from PERSON airport on DATE for Rabat with the assistance of the NORP authorities . The oral evidence from experts demonstrated how the NORP authorities had filed false flight plans and assisted in the cover - up of the ORG operations .", "CARDINAL . Evidence before the ORG clearly showed that it had been NORP officials who had granted ORG rendition planes licences and overflight permissions as well as special exemptions . It had been the NORP authorities who had guided the planes in to land , and who had cleared the runway and secured the perimeter and grounds of PERSON airport so that detainees like Mr PERSON could secretly be offloaded into vans bound for the secret prison .", "In the Polish ORG , officials had assisted in disguising the existence and exact movements of incoming ORG rendition flights . ORG officials had ensured that ORG flights were exempt from normal procedures for incoming foreign passengers . In the ORG officials had resolved irregularities in the payment of fees related to ORG operations . The manager of PERSON airport had provided significant information with respect to abnormal procedures allowed for rendition aircraft . The ORG had heard expert testimony confirming that after a rendition operation \u2013 the very DATE \u2013 NORP airport employees had been paid cash at a rate far higher than the usual rate .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE ORG showed that NORP officials had provided extraordinary physical security by setting up \u201c buffer zones \u201d around the ORG \u2019s detainee operations . The same report confirmed that several high - ranking NORP officials had known about , and had authorised , GPE \u2019s role in the secret ORG prison . The existence of an operational agreement between ORG and the ORG had been mentioned in the DATE ORG and various other material before the ORG and had been confirmed by Senator PERSON \u2019s testimony . The agreement had set out detailed rules for running the prison on NORP territory and a provision for what would have to be done if a detainee had died there . Prime Minister PERSON and President PERSON had reportedly received oral reports from NORP intelligence officials about what had been going on in that ORG prison , including on the fact that GPE had been detaining individuals there .", "CARDINAL . Senator PERSON had publicly said that he had information showing that ORG at FAC had commissioned a local contractor to build a prisoner \u2019s cage . In his testimony to before the ORG , he had confirmed that the cage had been built by a NORP company from GPE with specifications as to the thickness of the bars and size \u2013 the cage had been supposed to be big enough to hold a grown man and a portable toilet .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further stressed that at the fact - finding hearing the Court had heard cogent , credible and consistent evidence from CARDINAL persons of the highest integrity and the highest professional calibre , who had demonstrated that :", "CARDINAL ) NORP there had been a secret ORG prison at FAC from DATE to DATE ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the applicant had been detained in that prison from DATE to DATE ; indeed , the fact that the applicant had been granted injured party status in the investigation by a decision which was non - discretionary but mandated by evidence confirmed the fact that the prosecutor was in possession of evidence that that would support his claims ;", "CARDINAL ) in Stare Kiejkuty the applicant had been tortured and subjected to unauthorised interrogation techniques specifically set out in the DATE ORG ;", "CARDINAL ) GPE had known , or should have known , of the ORG prison on its territory . It had known because it had been directly involved and entered into a secret agreement with the GPE to host that prison ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the NORP authorities had displayed a pattern and practice of obscuring the truth , and during the relevant international inquiries there had been an extreme reluctance on their part to disclose what had in fact happened .", "CARDINAL . The applicant concluded that he had met his burden of proof in the present case . In contrast to the \u201c strong , clear and concordant \u201d facts put forward by him , ORG had failed to answer the ORG \u2019s questions on the merits . Where , as in the present case , \u201c the events at issue lie wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities \u201d , the burden of proof could be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a convincing explanation . Where , as here , the authorities had failed to provide a convincing explanation , failed to conduct an effective investigation and failed to furnish the ORG with the necessary information , the ORG was entitled to draw inferences adverse to the authorities and in favour of the applicant .", "In addition , unrebutted presumptions of fact led to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s factual allegations were true . Indeed , the Government had conceded that they had not contested the facts as related by the applicant and his allegations .", "CARDINAL . Referring to knowledge imputable to any ORG at the relevant time , AI and the ICJ pointed out , among other things , to the following facts that had been a matter of public knowledge .", "On DATE GPE President PERSON signed a military order authorising the indefinite detention without trial , and without access to any court in the GPE or elsewhere , of foreign nationals deemed by the President to be involved in international terrorism . In the same order , he had authorised military commissions , executive bodies in which the ordinary rules of criminal justice would not apply , for the trial of non - GPE nationals accused of broadly defined terrorism - related offences . On DATE the GPE had published rules for the military commissions , which showed that these were purely executive bodies .", "Reports of GPE renditions to secret detention were in the public domain as DATE and continued through DATE . It was widely disseminated that detentions at FAC in LOC had begun in DATE , and that by DATE there had been CARDINAL detainees held in that prison . By the same time it was also known that those who had been transferred to ORG had included individuals picked up far from GPE .", "In major reports issued in DATE AI had warned that the GPE was engaging in arbitrary detainee transfers into and from its custody and that some individuals had disappeared into secret GPE detention .", "The DATE AI report documented that there were over CARDINAL detainees then at ORG and reported on the GPE \u2019s recourse to secret detention and transfer of detainees to possible torture in third countries . The report and documents published during DATE provided further credible evidence of the GPE \u2019s use of detention and rendition in the context of the \u201c war on terror \u201d , including the use of undisclosed and incommunicado detention by GPE forces in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In short , during DATE and DATE credible information emerged that the GPE had committed and was continuing to commit gross human rights violations , including enforced disappearances by means of arbitrary , incommunicado and secret detention outside GPE territory as well as secret detainee transfers , in respect of individuals whom the GPE authorities suspected of involvement in or having knowledge of international terrorism .", "Thus , by DATE any ORG would have known that the GPE was engaging in the use of the death penalty ; the secret detention of individuals it suspected of involvement in or having information about international terrorism ; the holding of individuals incommunicado or virtually incommunicado in indefinite military detention without charge or trial ; and preparations to subject individuals to an unfair trial by military commission , at ORG , or elsewhere , without access to civilian courts , including in respect of individuals facing capital charges .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the Government did not take advantage of the opportunity to make comments on the facts as supplied by the applicant and that it was not their intention to contest them . It also notes that they did not challenge the admissibility , accuracy or credibility of documentary and oral evidence obtained by the ORG throughout the proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Consequently , the ORG will proceed on the basis of there being no contestation as such by the ORG as to the facts of the case as put forward by the applicant and no discernible dispute between the parties as to the evidence from various sources which was admitted by the ORG and summarised above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the assessment of the facts and evidence gathered in the present case , the ORG would first wish to reiterate the relevant principles .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and has consistently recognised that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see GPE , cited above , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; GPE and Others v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ; and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL . )", "CARDINAL . In assessing evidence , the ORG has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard . Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the LAW . The specificity of its task under LAW to ensure the observance by GPE of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof . In the proceedings before the ORG , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre - determined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions .", "According to the ORG \u2019s established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof , are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see , among other examples , GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ; ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ; and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . While it is for the applicant to make a prima facie case and adduce appropriate evidence , if the respondent Government in their response to his allegations fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the ORG to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred , strong inferences can be drawn ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE , with further references ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . ORG , LAW , DATE ; and ORG and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , where the events in issue lie wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , for instance as in the case of persons under their control in custody , strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention . The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL-IV ; PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII ; and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXIII ( extracts ) ; ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "In the absence of such explanation the ORG can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government ( see PERSON , ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes at the outset that , in contrast to many other previous cases before it involving complaints about torture , ill - treatment in custody or unlawful detention , in the present case it is deprived of the possibility of obtaining any form of direct account of the events complained of from the applicant ( for example , compare and contrast with PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALV ; PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG DATE ; and ORG and Others v. GPE and GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ) .", "As stated in the application , since DATE , when the applicant was captured by the ORG in GPE , he has continually been in the custody of the GPE authorities , initially in the hands of the ORG in undisclosed detention at various black sites and then , as confirmed by President PERSON on DATE , in the custody of GPE military authorities in ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regime applied to High Value Detainees in ORG custody such as the applicant is described in detail in the ORG documents and also , on the basis , inter alia , of the applicant \u2019s own account , in the DATE ORG . It \u201c included transfers of detainees to multiple locations , maintenance of the detainees in continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention \u201d . The transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention were specifically designed to deepen their sense of disorientation and isolation . The detainees were usually unaware of their exact location ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL,CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . It is submitted that since an unknown date in DATE the applicant has not had contact with the outside world , save the ORG team in DATE , the military commission \u2019s members and his GPE counsel . In this regard , the ORG also takes note of the statement by the applicant \u2019s representative at the public hearing :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is gagged from speaking publicly of his own torture in GPE because GPE takes the remarkable position that disclosure of his own memories , observations and experiences of what happened to him would reveal classified sources and methods . In addition , GPE regulations prevent his GPE lawyer , PERSON , who is also counsel in this case , from addressing the issues before this Court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above circumstances have inevitably had an impact on the applicant \u2019s ability to plead his case before this ORG . Indeed , in his application the events complained of were to a considerable extent reconstructed from threads of information gleaned from numerous public sources .", "The difficulties involved in gathering and producing evidence in the present case caused by the restrictions on the applicant \u2019s communication with the outside world and the extreme secrecy surrounding the GPE rendition operations have been compounded by ORG failure to cooperate with ORG in its examination of the case .", "In consequence , the ORG \u2019s establishment of the facts is to a great extent based on circumstantial evidence , including a large amount of evidence obtained through the international inquiries , considerably redacted documents released by the ORG , other public sources and evidence from the experts and the witness ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the ORG official documents clearly confirm that by DATE the ORG had the applicant and Mr PERSON , both referred to as \u201c High - Value Detainees \u201d , in its custody and that they were interrogated at a ORG black site with the use of the EITs \u2013 the applicant immediately after his arrival at that place on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "Those documents also attest to the fact that as from DATE the applicant and Mr PERSON were held in the same detention facility , that they were interrogated by apparently the same team of \u201c psychologist / interrogators \u201d , that their interrogations were videotaped and that the series of the applicant \u2019s enhanced interrogations , including the so - called \u201c waterboarding \u201d , \u201c continued through QUANTITY DATE \u201d ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG material further confirm in the cables of CARDINAL and DATE that this specific detention facility was closed following an inventory of the videotapes recording the enhanced interrogations of Mr GPE and Mr PERSON \u2019s . The inventory was carried out on DATE . No ORG cables from that location were sent to the ORG after DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The DATE ORG states that , after the enhanced interrogations of Mr PERSON which , as noted above , continued at that black site until DATE , both he and Mr PERSON were moved to \u201c another ORG black site \u201d . The same fact is mentioned in the DATE ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Senator PERSON and Mr GPE , the experts who gave evidence to the ORG , in their presentation at the fact - finding hearing explained in detail the above sequence of events with reference to documentary evidence available in the public domain , in particular the material released by the ORG . They identified the ORG detention facility in which the applicant and PERSON PERSON had been held during the period under consideration as the one known under the codename \u201c Cat \u2019s Eye \u201d or \u201c GPE \u201d and located in GPE . They conclusively confirmed that the closure of the site and interruption of Mr PERSON interrogation schedule on DATE indicated the date of his physical transfer by means of the HVD rendition out of the black site in GPE to another black site ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above first - hand ORG documentary evidence and clear and convincing expert evidence , the ORG finds established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant , following his capture , was detained in the ORG detention facility in GPE from DATE to DATE , that Mr PERSON was also held in the same facility at that time and that they were both moved together to \u201c another ORG black site \u201d on DATE ( see PERSON ( PERSON ) , cited above , \u00a7 FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . It is alleged that on DATE the applicant , together with Mr PERSON , had been transferred by the ORG under the ORG from GPE to GPE on a ORG contracted aircraft , registered as NCARDINALMU with ORG . The flight flew on DATE from GPE via GPE and landed at FAC on DATE . The applicant was then secretly detained in the NORP intelligence training base at FAC .", "It is further alleged that during his undisclosed detention in GPE the applicant was subjected to torture and various other forms of ill - treatment and deprived of any contact with his family . He was held in GPE until DATE . On DATE he was secretly transferred by the ORG from GPE to Rabat on a rendition plane with tail number NCARDINALP ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the fact that after DATE the applicant and Mr PERSON were detained together to the same detention facility is conclusively confirmed in paragraph QUANTITY of the DATE ORG . The paragraph states that the same \u201c interrogation team \u201d was \u201c to interrogate PERSON and debrief PERSON \u201d and that \u201c the interrogation team continued EITs on LOC for DATE in DATE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the aircraft indicated by the applicant , the ORG observes that there is abundant evidence identifying them as rendition planes used by the ORG for the transportation of detainees under the HVD ORG . That evidence includes data from multiple sources , such as flight plan messages by ORG and information provided by ORG and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which was released and subsequently analysed in depth in the course of the international inquiries concerning the ORG secret detentions and renditions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of that accumulated evidence , there can be no doubt that :", "CARDINAL ) the NCARDINALMU , a Gulfstream jet with capacity for CARDINAL passengers , flew on DATE from GPE via GPE to GPE and landed there on DATE at CARDINAL . ORG official documents recorded that on arrival there were CARDINAL passengers and CARDINAL crew and that the plane departed from PERSON on DATE at CARDINAL:CARDINAL with no passengers and CARDINAL crew ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the NCARDINALP , also known as \u201c Guant\u00e1namo Express \u201d , a Gulfstream V with capacity for CARDINAL passengers but usually configured for CARDINAL , arrived in PERSON on DATE at TIME from GPE , GPE . It stayed on the runway for TIME and then departed for GPE , GPE . ORG official documents recorded that on arrival there was one passenger and CARDINAL crew and on departure there were no passengers and CARDINAL crew .", "CARDINAL . As regards transfers of High - Value Detainees between ORG black sites , the ORG declassified documents give , in meticulous detail , a first - hand account of the standard procedures applied to them . The transfer procedure is also related in the DATE ORG , which compiled consistent and explicit descriptions given by the CARDINAL High - Value Detainees , including the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "Nothing has been put before the ORG to the effect that upon and during his transfer to and from \u201c another black site \u201d on , respectively , DATE and DATE , the applicant could have been subjected to less harsh treatment than that defined in the strict and detailed rules applied by the ORG as a matter of routine . It accordingly finds it established beyond reasonable doubt ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that for the purposes of his transfers on CARDINAL DATE and DATE :", "CARDINAL ) NORP the applicant was photographed both clothed and naked prior to and again after the transfer ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP he underwent a rectal examination and was made to wear a diaper and dressed in a tracksuit ;", "CARDINAL ) earphones were placed over his ears , through which loud music was sometimes played ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP he was blindfolded with at least a cloth tied around the head and black goggles ;", "CARDINAL ) he was shackled by his hands and feet , and was transported to the airport by road and loaded onto the plane ;", "CARDINAL ) he was transported on the plane either in a reclined sitting position with his hands shackled in front of him or lying flat on the floor of the plane with his hands handcuffed behind his back ;", "CARDINAL ) during the journey he was not allowed to go to the toilet and , if necessary , was obliged to urinate or defecate into the diaper .", "In that regard , the ORG would also note that a strikingly similar account of his transfers in ORG custody was given by the applicant in GPE ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s actual presence in GPE , the ORG takes due note of the fact that there is no direct evidence that it was the applicant who was transported on board the NCARDINALMU flight from GPE to PERSON on DATE or that he was then taken from PERSON to other ORG secret detention facilities on board NCARDINALP on DATE .", "The applicant , who for DATE on end was held in detention conditions specifically designed to isolate and disorientate a person by transfers to unknown locations , even if he had been enabled to testify before the ORG , would not be able to say where he was detained . Nor can it be reasonably expected that he will ever on his own be able to identify the places in which he was held . Also , having regard to the very nature and extreme secrecy of the ORG operations in the course of the \u201c war on terror \u201d and to how the declassification of crucial material demonstrating the ORG activities at that time currently stands \u2013 this being a matter of common knowledge \u2013 , no such direct evidence will soon be forthcoming in this regard .", "CARDINAL . No trace of the applicant can , or will , be found in any official records in GPE because his presence on the plane and on NORP territory was , by the very nature of the rendition operations , purposefully not to be recorded . As unequivocally confirmed by the expert , ORG records showing numbers of passengers and crew arriving and departing on the rendition planes in question \u201c neither include[d ] , nor purport[ed ] to include detainees who were brought into or out of NORP territory involuntarily , by means of clandestine ORG renditions \u201d and those detainees \u201c were never listed among the persons on board filed vis - \u00e0 - vis any official institution \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , in order to ascertain whether or not it can be concluded that the applicant was detained in GPE at the relevant time , the ORG has taken into account all the facts that have already been found established beyond reasonable doubt ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and analysed other material in its possession , including , in particular , the expert evidence reconstructing the chronology of rendition and detention of the applicant and PERSON in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . It has already been established that on DATE the applicant was transferred from the black site in GPE together with Mr PERSON and that they were subsequently detained in the same ORG detention facility ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The date of the transfer coincides exactly with the path followed by the NCARDINALMU , which took off from GPE on DATE and then , after the stopover in GPE , arrived in PERSON on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "The flight was the subject of protracted and intense investigations by the experts who gave evidence to the ORG , who had investigated it \u201c in its most intricate detail from its planning and authorisation to its execution through multiple , different corporate shells \u201d . They found no alternative explanation for its landing in PERSON other than the transfer of the applicant and Mr PERSON from GPE to \u201c another black site \u201d , which they categorically identified as the one codenamed \u201c Quartz \u201d and located at the NORP intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty near Szymany ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above )", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that ORG have offered no explanation for the nature of , the reasons for , or the purposes of the landing of the NCARDINALMU on their territory on DATE , a plane which in all the relevant reliable and thorough international inquiries was conclusively identified as the rendition aircraft used for transportation of High - Value Detainees in ORG custody at the material time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above , with further references ) .", "Nor have they explained the reasons for the subsequent series of landings of the ORG rendition aircraft ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The landing of NCARDINALMU on DATE was followed by CARDINAL further landings of the NCARDINALP ( the \u201c Guant\u00e1namo Express \u201d ) , the most notorious ORG rendition plane . CARDINAL of those landings took place on DATE the date indicated by the applicant as that of his transfer from GPE and conclusively confirmed by the experts as that on which he had been transferred out of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The series ended with the landing of NCARDINALP on DATE the date indicated by Mr PERSON for his transfer from GPE , confirmed by the experts as the date of his transfer out of GPE and identified by them as the date on which the black site \u201c Quartz \u201d in GPE had been closed ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and also PERSON ( PERSON ) , cited above , \u00a7 FAC ) . Indeed , no other ORG - associated aircraft appeared in PERSON after that date ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the lack of any explanation by the Government as to how the events in the present case occurred and their refusal to disclose to the ORG documents necessary for its examination of the case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the ORG will draw inferences from the evidence before it and from the Government \u2019s conduct ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "Consequently , on the basis of unrebutted facts and in the light of all the relevant documentary material in its possession and the coherent , clear and categorical expert evidence explaining in detail the chronology of the events occurring in the applicant \u2019s case DATE and DATE , the ORG finds that the applicant \u2019s allegations to the effect that during that time he was detained in GPE are sufficiently convincing .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as regards the applicant \u2019s treatment in ORG custody over the period under consideration , a detailed description of \u201c unauthorised techniques \u201d applied to him by a ORG \u201c senior operation officer \u201d or \u201c debriefer \u201d in DATE and DATE comes from the most authoritative sources : the DATE ORG and the DATE ORG ( see CARDINAL above ) .

ORG Several sources of evidence obtained by the ORG confirm that the NORP authorities followed a special procedure for the landing of ORG rendition flights in PERSON .", "That procedure was related before the ORG by an eye - witness , a certain PERSON , who had been the manager of PERSON airport at the material time ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . On the basis of her detailed account and statements from other persons , including the former director of PERSON airport and the former Chairman of ORG of that airport , the summary description of that procedure was included in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , the DATE ORG contained a compilation of testimonies obtained from confidential sources among PERSON airport employees , civil servants , security guards , and ORG and military intelligence officials , who had given an account of what had happened at the time immediately following the landing of the ORG aircraft landed in PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The above - mentioned accounts of the special procedure , which are concordant and complementary , can be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL ) NORP all the landings were preceded by a telephone call to PERSON airport from ORG of ORG or a military intelligence official , informing the authorities of the airport of an arriving \u201c NORP aircraft \u201d ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the army was informed at the same time and CARDINAL military officials were on duty in the airport at that time ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP prior to the landings CARDINAL high - ranking ORG officers always appeared in the airport ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP orders were given directly by ORG , emphasising that the airport authorities should not approach the aircraft and that the military staff and services alone were to handle them ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the airport manager was instructed to adhere to strict protocols to prepare for the flights , including clearing the runways of all other aircraft and vehicles , and making sure that all NORP staff were brought in to the terminal building from the vicinity of the runway , including local security officials and airport employees ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the role of the airport personnel was only to complete the technical arrangements after the landing ;", "CARDINAL ) the planes were treated as military planes and were not subjected to customs clearance ; the military character of the flight was determined by ORG and the relevant procedure was to be followed by the airport staff ;", "CARDINAL) the perimeter and grounds of the airport were secured by military officers and ORG ;", "CARDINAL ) the aircraft touched down in PERSON and taxied to a halt at the far end of the runway , QUANTITY ( and out of visible range ) from the QUANTITY terminal control tower ; it always parked with the doors facing towards the wood ;", "CARDINAL ) the passengers never entered the airport ;", "CARDINAL ) ORG approached the aircraft first and then drove away ;", "CARDINAL ) NORP the \u201c landing team \u201d waited at the edge of the runway , in CARDINAL or CARDINAL vans with tinted windows , bearing the Stare Kiejkuty army unit \u2019s registration plates ; the vans , with their engines often running , were parked in close proximity to the aircraft ;", "CARDINAL ) after ORG drove away , the vans with tinted windows drove up to the aircraft and then drove away ;", "CARDINAL ) the planes left shortly afterwards ;", "CARDINAL ) the landing fees were paid to the airport in cash by a LOC ( or a person who spoke NORP very well ) DATE and were considerably higher \u2013 several times more \u2013 than those normally applicable ( QUANTITY ) , including an amount for \u201c non - standard handling \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Several sources of evidence obtained by the ORG reveal that , in addition to granting the ORG rendition aircraft overflight permissions and navigating the planes through GPE \u2019s airspace , the NORP authorities , including ORG , accorded them special status , various exemptions and authorisations . They also cooperated with the ORG in disguising the aircraft \u2019s actual routes and validated incomplete or false flight plans which served to cover - up the ORG activities in GPE , in contravention of international aviation regulations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As explained in the DATE ORG and by Senator PERSON and Mr GPE orally before the Court , Jeppesen , a usual provider of services for the ORG for rendition flights ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , filed multiple false \u2013 \u201c dummy \u201d \u2013 flight plans for those flights , including the landings in GPE . Those plans often featured an airport of departure and/or destination that the aircraft never intended to visit . In CARDINAL out of CARDINAL instances of the ORG aircraft landings in PERSON , including the landing of NCARDINALMU on DATE with the applicant and Mr PERSON on board ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , flight plans were disguised , false plans were filed and ORG navigated the aircraft into PERSON without a valid flight plan ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A detailed analysis of the rendition circuit of the flight NCARDINALP , including the stopover in PERSON on DATE is included in ORG . That report explains how the aircraft made the entire circuit under various forms of exemption and special status , which indicated that the flights were planned and executed with the full collaboration of the GPE authorities and the \u201c host \u201d States through which the NCARDINALP travelled . Such exemptions are only granted when specifically authorised by the national authority whose territory is being used ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG navigated the NCARDINALP into GPE , despite the fact that all relevant flight plans named GPE as the airport of destination . The fact that ORG accepted ORG \u2019s flight plan naming GPE but navigated the plane to PERSON demonstrated that the NORP authorities did not require it to comply with international aviation regulations and that they knowingly issued a false landing permit . In consequence , the rest of the aviation monitoring community , including ORG , mistakenly recorded the aircraft \u2019s stopover in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Several sources of evidence before the Court have suggested the existence of a special bilateral agreement between GPE and the GPE on the setting up and running of a secret prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE PERSON , based on evidence from confidential sources , states that the ORG brokered an \u201c operating agreement \u201d with GPE to hold its High - Value Detainees in a secret detention facility and that GPE agreed to \u201c provide the LOC in which [ that facility was ] established , the highest degrees of physical security and secrecy , and steadfast guarantees of non - interference \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "In the context of the authorisation of GPE \u2019s role in the ORG rendition operations , the DATE Report mentioned a number of names of the NORP high - ranking officials , stating that they had known and authorised the country \u2019s role \u201c in the ORG operation of secret detention facilities for High - Value Detainees on NORP territory \u201d and that they \u201c could therefore be held accountable for these activities \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL , see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Senator PERSON confirmed those statements before the ORG and added that the operation had been organised within the framework of ORG . It had been decided that the ORG would be in sole charge of the operation and , if requested , the member countries would provide cooperation . As regards the specific names of NORP officials that had been given in the DATE ORG , he explained that they had been indicated \u201c because the sources that [ had ] provided us with these names [ had been ] of such value , they [ had been ] so authoritative and there [ had been ] so much concurring evidence of the involvement of those persons \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , when heard by the Court , said that whilst in the course of ORG they had not seen the classified documents in question , they had been made aware of the existence of authorising agreements , which granted extraordinary protections and permissions to the ORG in its execution of the rendition operations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Senator PERSON , both in his affidavit and oral testimony before the ORG , stated that he had been informed by an authoritative confidential source of a document DATE a draft prepared by the NORP intelligence DATE drawn up under the auspices of PERSON Government for the purpose of regulating the operation of the ORG prison in GPE . According to him , that document , which was currently in the NORP prosecution authority \u2019s possession , contained precise regulations concerning the functioning of the prison and , among other things , a proposed protocol for action in the event of a prisoner \u2019s death . The word \u201c detainees \u201d was used in the text . The draft had not been signed on behalf of the GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE EP Resolution \u201c note[d ] with concern \u201d that the NORP authorities\u2019 official reply of DATE to the to the Secretary General of ORG , \u201c indicate[d ] the existence of secret cooperation agreements initialled by the CARDINAL GPE secret services\u2019 themselves , which GPE ] the activities of foreign secret services from the jurisdiction of the NORP judicial bodies \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not find it necessary for its examination of the present case to establish whether such agreement or agreements existed and if so , in what format and what was specifically provided therein .", "It considers that it is inconceivable that the rendition aircraft crossed NORP airspace , landed in and departed from a NORP airport and that the ORG occupied the LOC in FAC without some kind of pre - existing arrangement enabling the ORG operation in GPE to be first prepared and then executed .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the respondent ORG \u2019s lack of cooperation in the course of the international inquiries into the ORG rendition operations in LOC undertaken in DATE is an element that is relevant for its assessment of GPE \u2019s alleged knowledge of , and complicity in , the ORG rendition operations .", "CARDINAL . To begin with , in their response dated DATE to the Secretary General of ORG questions in the procedure launched under LAW , the authorities \u201c fully denied \u201d the allegations of \u201c the alleged existence in GPE of secret detention centres and related over - flights ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; the relevant letter is also mentioned above in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In that regard , they relied on the findings of \u201c ORG internal inquiry \u201d . It is not clear what kind of \u201c internal inquiry \u201d was carried out and whether the authorities in fact meant the ORG inquiry conducted in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) but , be that as it may , they could not have been unaware of the ORG operations in the country in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A similar obstructive attitude was displayed during ORG . In the DATE Marty Report it was noted that \u201c the NORP authorities ha[d ] been unable , despite repeated requests , to provide [ the rapporteur ] with information from their own national aviation records to confirm any ORG - connected flights into GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The DATE ORG noted that \u201c in DATE of correspondence , GPE ha[d ] failed to furnish [ the ] inquiry with any data from its own records confirming ORG - connected flights into its airspace or airports \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Senator PERSON , at the fact - finding hearing , added that \u201c GPE [ had been ] no exception \u201d and that practically all governments that [ had ] had links with the secret detention centres or with \u2018 extraordinary rendition\u2019 not only [ had ] not ORG ] but [ had done ] everything that they could in order to stifle the truth , to create obstacles in the search for the truth \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The conduct adopted by the authorities in respect to ORG was no different . PERSON explicitly stated that the NORP authorities cooperation with the GPE delegation had been \u201c regrettably poor \u201d , that the delegation had not been able to meet any representatives of ORG and that the ORG had been \u201c reluctant to offer full cooperation ... and receive [ the ] delegation at an appropriate political level \u201d . It was also noted that there had been confusion about flight registers of ORG planes transiting through GPE and contradictory statements about the existence of flight logs ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The same observations were made in the DATE EP Resolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "In his testimony before the ORG , PERSON stated that ORG had \u201c cooperated very little \u201d with the ORG and that almost all representatives of the Government whom they had asked for a meeting had declined the ORG \u2019s request . He also confirmed that during his visit to GPE with the ORG delegation he had \u201c definitely \u201d had the impression that there had been attempts on the authorities\u2019 part to conceal information ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the above facts , the ORG finds that in the course of the relevant international inquiries the NORP authorities displayed conduct that can be characterised as denial , lack of cooperation with the inquiry bodies and marked reluctance to disclose information of the ORG rendition activities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , in his oral testimony described in detail a document \u2013 the records or \u201c the debriefing \u201d of the informal transatlantic meeting of ORG and ORG foreign ministers with the GPE Secretary of ORG PERSON , which had taken place on DATE . The meeting was convened in connection with recent international media reports concerning the ORG secret detentions and rendition , naming NORP countries that had allegedly had ORG black sites on their territory . The debriefing , obtained by the ORG from a credible confidential source in the offices of ORG , confirmed that the member GPE had had knowledge of the ORG rendition programme and there had been an \u201c animated discussion \u201d on the practices applied by the ORG . While PERSON could not recall whether there had been any intervention by ORG at that meeting , he said that it had appeared from PERSON statement \u201c we all know about these techniques \u201d that there had been an attempt on the GPE \u2019s part to share \u201c the weight of accusations \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further notes that PERSON also referred to the meeting held in the context of ORG with the former NORP head of the security service who , \u201c although ... with great diplomacy \u201d , had confirmed that the ORG officials often landed in PERSON and that the NORP intelligence and the ORG had had \u201c frequent relations of cooperation ... consisting in sharing certain practices and objectives \u201d ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Former President of GPE , PERSON , in his press interview given on DATE , also referred to the \u201c intelligence cooperation \u201d with the ORG and stated that \u201c the decision to cooperate with the ORG carried the risk that the NORP would use inadmissible methods \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the procedure for High - Value Detainees\u2019 transfers under which , as established above , a detainee such as the applicant was blindfolded , wore black goggles and was shackled by his hands and feet for the duration of his transfer ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the ORG considers that those of the NORP authorities who received the ORG personnel on the PERSON airport runway , put them on the vans and drove them to the black site could not be unaware that the persons brought there with them were the ORG prisoners .", "In particular , the ORG finds it inconceivable they would not have seen or , as described by PERSON , \u201c witnessed ... the unloading of bound and shackled detainees from aircraft \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . There are also other elements that the ORG considers relevant for its assessment of GPE \u2019s knowledge of the nature and purposes of the ORG activities on its territory at the material time .", "As recounted by Senator PERSON in his affidavit and subsequently confirmed in his oral testimony given to the ORG , \u201c in the period when the ORG prisoners were detained in Stare PERSON the authorities of the military base ordered from a NORP company a metal cage of the size fitting a grown man with the option of adding a portable chemical toilet ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . No explanations have been offered by the respondent Government as to what kind of purposes that cage was to serve .", "Furthermore , there were , as pointed out by CARDINAL of the experts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , other aspects of the ORG activity in GPE that were extraordinary from the perspective of the normal operation of an airport like PERSON .", "For instance , the landing of the ORG CARDINAL ( NCARDINALP on which Mr PERSON was transferred from GPE ; see PERSON ( PERSON ) , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) on CARDINAL DATE at PERSON took place despite the fact that the airport did not have the necessary technical conditions for receiving such a large aircraft , in particular the facilities to refuel it , and the fact that the airport fire brigade was not adequately equipped for that purpose ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In the view of PERSON , the airport manager at the relevant time , \u201c there must have been some very pressing reasons \u201d for allowing that landing ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) .", "On another occasion in DATE , notwithstanding the severe weather conditions and the fact that snow had not been cleared at the airport for DATE , the airport management were not in a position to refuse the ORG aircraft \u2019s landing and had to clear the runway because \u201c if the aircraft concerned did not land , \u2018 heads w[ould ] ORG \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "For the airport civilian staff , the landing of the ORG aircraft was a \u201c major event \u201d . Despite the fact that they were excluded from the handling of the aircraft and were taken to the airport terminal building during the ORG landings and departures ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , they perceived those events as \u201c spies \u201d coming or a \u201c changeover of intelligence staff \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG attaches importance to the fact that already DATE and DATE ill - treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in GPE custody at different places , including LOC or GPE base in GPE was largely in the public domain through numerous statements or reports of international organisations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "At the material time that topic was also present in the international and NORP media , which paid considerable attention to the situation of ORG prisoners in GPE custody ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has taken due note of the fact that knowledge of the ORG rendition and secret detention operations and the scale of abuse to which High - Value Detainees were subjected in ORG custody evolved over time ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . In particular , the ORG \u2019s various secret or top secret documents , including the DATE ORG , the ORG Background Paper and the DATE ORG DATE which , in the present case and in GPE ( PERSON ) , are among important items of documentary evidence relevant for the establishment of the facts relating to both applicants\u2019 rendition , secret detention and treatment by the GPE authorities DATE were disclosed to the public , in a heavily redacted form , as late as DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) . The DATE ORG , including the applicant \u2019s account of the treatment and material conditions of detention to which he was subjected under the ORG , was leaked into the public domain in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The reports following ORG and ORG emerged earlier , in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and DATE ) , but this was CARDINAL after the events complained of . As stated by Senator PERSON , even \u201c the picture provided by the DATE [ ORG is still very much a partial CARDINAL \u201d , having regard to the subsequent developments , such as the publication of the ORG materials and the availability of statements from detainees ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As already stated above ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) , the ORG has relied extensively on those sources of evidence in its retrospective reconstruction and establishment of the facts concerning the applicant \u2019s transfers to and from GPE and his secret detention and ill - treatment by the ORG in GPE . However , the NORP ORG \u2019s knowledge of and complicity in the HVD Programme must be established with reference to the elements that it knew or ought to have known at or closely around the relevant time , that is , DATE and DATE in respect of the applicant and DATE and DATE in respect of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , the ORG has taken into account the various attendant circumstances referred to above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . In the ORG \u2019s view , those elements taken as a whole demonstrate that at that time the NORP authorities knew that the ORG used its airport in PERSON and the Stare Kiejkuty military base for the purposes of detaining secretly terrorist suspects captured within the \u201c war on terror \u201d operation by the GPE authorities . It is inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have crossed NORP airspace , landed in and departed from a NORP airport , or that the ORG occupied the LOC in FAC and transported detainees there , without the NORP State being informed of and involved in the preparation and execution of the ORG on its territory . It is also inconceivable that activities of that character and scale , possibly vital for the country \u2019s military and political interests , could have been undertaken on NORP territory without GPE \u2019s knowledge and without the necessary authorisation being given at the appropriate level of the ORG authorities .", "The ORG would again refer to the testimony given by the experts who , in the course of their inquiries , had the benefit of contact with various , including confidential , sources . They all stated , in unambiguous terms , that at the relevant time GPE had had , or should have had , knowledge of the ORG rendition operations . GPE had ensured the security of the area and had collaborated in concealing the rendition flights . The NORP officials\u2019 liaison units must have been aware of the preparation or execution of particular operations and their timing . They had known that the ORG interrogations had contributed intelligence to GPE on terror ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) .", "This did not mean , in the experts\u2019 view , that the NORP authorities had known the details of what went on inside the black site , since the interrogations had been the exclusive responsibility of the ORG , or that they had witnessed treatment to which High - Value Detainees had been subjected in GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . ORG , being confronted with no evidence to the contrary , accepts the experts\u2019 above - mentioned assessment .", "Notwithstanding the foregoing proviso as to the lack of direct knowledge of the treatment to which the applicant was subjected in GPE , as noted above , already DATE and DATE numerous public sources were consistently reporting ill - treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in GPE custody in different places . Moreover , in the DATE ORG adopted in DATE of which GPE , as any other ORG was aware DATE ORG of ORG was \u201c deeply concerned at the conditions of detention \u201d of captured \u201c unlawful combatants \u201d held in the custody of the GPE authorities . All these sources reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the GPE authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Consequently , there were good reasons to believe that a person in GPE custody under the HVD Programme could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles ( see also GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Taking into consideration all the material in its possession ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , the ORG finds that there is abundant and coherent circumstantial evidence , which leads inevitably to the following conclusions :", "( a ) that GPE knew of the nature and purposes of the ORG \u2019s activities on its territory at the material time and that , by enabling the ORG to use its airspace and the airport , by its complicity in disguising the movements of rendition aircraft and by its provision of logistics and services , including the special security arrangements , the special procedure for landings , the transportation of the ORG teams with detainees on land , and the securing of the Stare Kiejkuty base for the ORG \u2019s secret detention , GPE cooperated in the preparation and execution of the ORG rendition , secret detention and interrogation operations on its territory ;", "( b ) that , given that knowledge and the emerging widespread public information about ill - treatment and abuse of detained terrorist suspects in the custody of the GPE authorities , GPE ought to have known that , by enabling the ORG to detain such persons on its territory , it was exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to the Convention ( see also PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
