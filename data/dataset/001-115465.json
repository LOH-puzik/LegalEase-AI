NORP The applicant is a limited liability company with its registered office in GPE . It was represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , first Mr J. ORG and , subsequently , PERSON , both of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company acquired the right of perpetual use of a plot of land ( prawo u\u017cytkowania wieczystego ) located at QUANTITY in GPE . It appears that it carried out some business activity on the plot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company instituted administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining planning permission for the construction of a block of flats on the plot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of GPE granted planning permission . The decision was served on ORG ( Gmina Wyznaniowa \u017bydowska w Warszawie ; \u201c the Community \u201d ) which owned an adjacent plot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appealed against the decision of the Mayor . It argued that on DATE it had filed an application with ORG on ORG ( PERSON . PERSON , \u201c the Commission \u201d ) to institute so - called regularisation proceedings ( post\u0119powanie regulacyjne ) pursuant to ORG on relations between the ORG and ORG in GPE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . In those proceedings the ORG sought , inter alia , an award of compensation for properties located on FAC , including the property which the applicant company had acquired as a \u201c perpetual user \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG argued that since the regularisation proceedings in respect of the said plot were pending , the administrative proceedings concerning the grant of planning permission should be suspended pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Lublin Governor and GPE were parties to the regularisation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company objected to the ORG \u2019s appeal , relying on LAW . This provision stipulated that regularisation proceedings could not affect the rights of third parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the PERSON decision of DATE and remitted the case to him . It observed that in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW a court or administrative proceedings concerning a property which was subject to regularisation proceedings should be suspended . However , a decision on the suspension fell within the competence of the first - instance authority .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal against that decision with ORG . It argued , amongst others , that the ORG had not sought restitution of the plot which the applicant company had acquired as a \u201c perpetual user \u201d in DATE . LAW entered into force on DATE and thus could not affect the relations between the ORG and the applicant company . Furthermore , the applicant company submitted that its vested rights to the plot had been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that in accordance with ORG an administrative authority could grant planning permission provided that a number of specific conditions were met . CARDINAL of the conditions was the compliance with other relevant laws and LAW belonged to that category . The court found that the ORG had instituted regularisation proceedings in respect of , among others , the plot subject to the administrative proceedings , and that those regularisation proceedings were still pending . In those circumstances the suspension of the administrative proceedings pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was justified . It noted that it was necessary to quash the decision of the Mayor of GPE granting planning permission since that decision should not have been issued given the statutory obligation to suspend the administrative proceedings on account of the pending regularisation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged a cassation appeal with ORG which was dismissed on DATE . This court upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . In addition , it observed that ORG was not competent to review the legality of the Commission \u2019s acts , such as its allegedly flawed decision to institute the regularisation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The case was remitted to the Mayor of GPE . On DATE the Mayor stayed the administrative proceedings concerning the applicant company \u2019s request for planning permission on the ground that the regularisation proceedings in respect of the same property had been pending . The applicant company did not appeal this decision . Neither did it request to resume the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . It alleged that sections CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE of LAW were unconstitutional . It argued that those provisions had violated its right to property , the right to a fair trial and the right to review of administrative decisions . The applicant company referred to ORG judgment of DATE as a final decision in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company concluded a contract with company L. and transferred to it the right of perpetual use of the plot of land at issue and the right of ownership of the buildings constructed on the plot .", "CARDINAL . Company L. instituted administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining planning permission for the construction of a block of flats on the plot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG on ORG informed the parties to the regularisation proceedings that it did not reach a decision in respect of the property located at QUANTITY . Subsequently , the ORG filed a compensation claim against the ORG with ORG . That claim was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of GPE granted planning permission to company L. Subsequently the right of perpetual use was transferred to company ORG On DATE the Mayor of GPE granted company ORG a building permit for the construction of a block of flats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings instituted by the applicant company . It emphasised that at the time of the lodging of the constitutional complaint the issue of suspension of the proceedings for planning permission had not been finally determined . It found that ORG judgment of DATE had not constituted a final ruling with regard to the applicant company \u2019s property rights to the plot in question . A possible interference with the claimant \u2019s property rights may have occurred as a result of the suspension of the administrative proceedings for planning permission in respect of the property which the claimant used as a \u201c perpetual user \u201d on account of the pending regularisation proceedings . ORG found that the applicant company had not exhausted the available domestic remedies as it should have appealed against the decision on the suspension of the administrative proceedings for planning permission . Accordingly , its constitutional complaint was premature .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE on relations between the ORG and ORG in GPE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that ORG may request the institution of proceedings ( the so - called \u201c regularisation proceedings \u201d ) with a view to restitution of their properties which on DATE had been owned by them or other NORP legal persons .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW expressly provides that the regularisation proceedings may not affect the rights acquired by third parties .", "Section CARDINAL stipulates that the regularisation may consist of :", "CARDINAL ) transfer of the ownership of property ,", "CARDINAL ) the grant of suitable alternative property ,", "CARDINAL ) the award of compensation if neither of the above solutions is possible .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW provides that regularisation proceedings are conducted by ORG on ORG ( PERSON ) composed in equal numbers of the representatives nominated by the Minister of ORG and ORG .
