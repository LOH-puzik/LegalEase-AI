At the same time they invited the ORG to indicate whether it intended to exercise its right of pre - emption under PERSON no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE the Ministry informed the parties that it was unable to exercise its right of pre - emption validly since there had been no contract and a mere unilateral declaration of an intention to sell was insufficient .

On DATE Mr Petretti , acting for and on behalf of the applicant alone , confirmed that his client agreed to the painting 's being moved . At that juncture , following an informal request from ORG , he also produced a copy of the declaration of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant wrote to ORG in connection with the technical arrangements for the painting 's transfer . On DATE the ORG gave permission for the painting to be moved to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a note to Mr GPE of CARDINAL DATE the ORG referred to the communication of DATE and requested the documents showing that Mr GPE had bought the painting on behalf of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister ordered that the painting be sent to GPE for temporary custody in the LOC and Contemporary Art Gallery . The order , in which express reference was made to the communication of DATE , was issued after the relevant authorities had expressed concern about the conditions in which the painting was being kept , particularly in the light of the uncertainty as to who was the real owner and the failure by ORG in GPE to comply with its undertakings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for the first time to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for judicial review of the order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , who had replaced PERSON as the applicant 's lawyer , sent a letter to the director of ORG in GPE assuring him that the applicant had no intention whatsoever of infringing NORP law and referring , among other things , to the authorities ' fears that the painting might be illegally exported .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON asked the Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery in GPE for authorisation to check the painting 's condition at the gallery on his client 's behalf ( the lawyer referred to his client as the \u201c owner of the painting \u201d ) . On DATE , with the agreement of ORG , a meeting was therefore held at the FAC and Contemporary Art Gallery in GPE . It was attended by , among others , the applicant , his new lawyer , the director of the gallery and an expert from ORG ( as recorded in TIME ) . The director said that uncertainty had arisen ( as she explained to the applicant 's lawyer in a letter of CARDINAL DATE ) as a result of the above - mentioned application to the ORG . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the director that he intended to discontinue those proceedings on account of , among other things , the fact that in the meantime the director of the gallery had allowed him , as owner of the painting , access to it at his simple request . A copy of that letter was also sent to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG sought clarification from Mr PERSON about the applicant 's alleged ownership of the painting . The applicant replied by sending a copy of the communications of CARDINAL and DATE . He also stated that there had been no subsequent transfer of title between Mr GPE and himself as he had acquired ownership of the painting directly .", "CARDINAL . It is apparent from CARDINAL letters sent by the applicant 's lawyer to the relevant Director - General of the Ministry on CARDINAL and DATE , the contents of which have not been contested by the ORG , that the ORG had informed the applicant alone on CARDINAL occasions ( one of which was during a meeting with CARDINAL of PERSON lawyers at ORG office on DATE ) that the NORP ORG was interested in purchasing the painting , but stressed that it had a limited budget for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . A letter of CARDINAL DATE sent by PERSON to ORG shows that on DATE the latter had telephoned Mr PERSON asking for the applicant 's permission , as owner of the painting , to exhibit it in the Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery in GPE . The contents of that telephone conversation and of the letter referring to it have not been contested by the Government , although the ORG has not been provided with a full transcript of the conversation .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant told ORG , referring to their earlier conversations on the subject , that he was willing to sell the painting to the NORP ORG for CARDINAL and stated that it was a much lower price than that being proposed in negotiations with individuals interested in buying the painting . On DATE the applicant drew the ORG 's attention to the fact that it had not responded to his offer within the time - limit he had indicated in his letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sold the painting to ORG in GPE for CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The following day the parties served notice of the sale agreement on ORG , as required by CARDINAL of PERSON no . DATE and LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the parties that it could not ascribe to the declaration the effects provided for under the aforementioned provisions since the applicant did not have valid title to the painting . In particular , the ORG considered that the declaration of the sale in DATE by PERSON to PERSON and the declaration of DATE conflicted with the purpose of LAW no . DATE and did not satisfy the requirements of LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the ORG to return the painting , which was still in the custody of the Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery in GPE . The request was made pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , which provides , inter alia , that a work of art kept in accordance with the provisions of the decree may be returned to the owner if he can guarantee that it will be kept in good condition . ORG did not reply , however .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON replied to the note of DATE , pointing out , among other things , that from DATE the NORP ORG had treated the applicant as the lawful owner of the painting , in particular by giving him permission to move the painting from GPE to GPE and by intimating that it wished to buy it from him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to an informal request from the NORP authorities , the applicant sent them the bank statements showing that PERSON GPE had purchased the painting on the applicant 's behalf .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the ORG exercised its right of pre - emption in respect of the DATE sale . It contended that the notice served on DATE was invalid as the communications of CARDINAL DATE and DATE did not contain the information required for the sale to be valid under LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE . ORG considered that on those dates it had not been in a position to establish the true identity of the contracting parties as the applicant had not signed the declaration giving notice of the contract and had thus prevented it from deciding in the light of all the facts whether to exercise its right of pre - emption . In addition , it said that the public interest in acquiring the painting was justified by the dearth of works by PERSON in NORP museums and the need to ensure compliance with the statute that had been infringed . It observed , further , that the fact that the real purchaser of the painting , PERSON , was of foreign nationality took on particular importance for the purpose of protecting the painting .", "Accordingly , the Ministry concluded", "( a ) that the documents relating to payment for the painting made by PERSON PERSON to Mr PERSON , through Mr GPE , proved that the painting had been sold directly by PERSON to PERSON ;", "( b ) that , under LAW of PERSON no . DATE , the right of pre - emption provided for in DATE and CARDINAL subsisted ;", "( c ) that it should exercise its right of pre - emption ; and", "( d ) that payment of the price stipulated in the DATE agreement , namely ORG CARDINAL , should be made to the title - holder .", "CARDINAL . The order was served on Mr PERSON and the applicant on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant and ORG had on DATE , DATE respectively sought an order from the ORG annulling the note of DATE . The applicant maintained in particular that the ORG had acted ultra vires , that the relevant provisions of PERSON no . DATE had been infringed and that in this case ORG had made an incorrect assessment of what was in the public interest . The applicant also submitted that LAW of that statute was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a further application , challenging the failure to reply to his request of CARDINAL DATE for the painting to be returned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG to have the ministerial order of CARDINAL DATE set aside . He complained , inter alia , that the impugned decision had been made ultra vires , that the reasoning was insufficient and self - contradictory , that the inquiry conducted by ORG had been inadequate , that there had been a breach of the relevant provisions of PERSON no . DATE and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP LAW concerning agency and that the decision had not been made in the public interest as it was incomprehensible that a public interest should exist in DATE when none had existed in DATE . The applicant argued that he had in any event now acquired title by adverse possession . He also complained that the impugned order had been made because he was a foreign national . He alleged , too , that there had been a violation of LAW of LAW , which concerns damages arising out of pecuniary obligations , in that the price paid had not been revised .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant asked the ORG to refer to ORG the question whether the relevant provisions of PERSON no . DATE were consistent with Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ordered the joinder of the various applications before dismissing them all in a judgment of DATE , which was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the declaration made on DATE had not contained all the essential information required by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE and accordingly had to be regarded as \u201c null and void \u201d . It had not been signed by the real buyer and the place of delivery in GPE had not been indicated . In addition , the ORG held that the communications of CARDINAL and DATE could not have started time running for the purposes of the DATE limitation period as they had not been made by the seller and did not satisfy the requirements of LAW . The uncertainty as to who the real owner of the painting was had consequently prevented the DATE limitation period from starting to run , bearing in mind , too , that the authorities had had to make inquiries to establish who the owner was and that it was for the person declaring the sale to prove ownership . The ORG considered that the parties had had a duty to declare the sale and that their failure to do so meant that the DATE time - limit was no longer applicable . The authorities ' right of pre - emption , which was no longer subject to a time - limit , had thus become \u201c permanent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also found that the relevant authority had given valid reasons for finding that there was a legitimate public interest in the acquisition of the work ( in particular , the fact that there were no major works by PERSON in the ORG 's collections and the need to protect the public interest from unfair conduct by the parties ) . In addition , it considered that the fact that the ORG had twice declined to exercise its right of pre - emption in DATE was irrelevant as what was in the public interest had to be assessed in the light of the current position and requirements . In that regard it observed that not all the information needed for the purposes of identifying the owner of the painting had been made available to ORG , which had thus not been in a position until DATE to decide in the light of all the facts whether to exercise its right of pre - emption .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further found that , although the applicant 's nationality had been one of the factors the Ministry had taken into account when deciding whether to exercise its right of pre - emption , it had not been the main factor .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's claim for compensation for the failure to revise the value of the painting , the ORG held that LAW no . DATE conferred no discretion on the authorities since it provided , inter alia , that they had to pay the owner of the work only the agreed price stipulated in the deed of transfer , even in the event of pre - emption under section DATE ( which refers to section CARDINAL ) . The ORG found , however , that the applicant could have asked for the value of the painting to be revised by bringing an action in damages in the ordinary civil courts .", "CARDINAL . As to the applications concerning the failure to reply to the applicant 's request of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG considered that they were no longer relevant in view of the pre - emption order made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG declared the constitutional issues raised by the applicant manifestly ill - founded as in the instant case the exceptional nature of the work and the improper conduct of the parties had justified extending the right of pre - emption indefinitely , which had the effect of restricting the property right .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with the Consiglio di Stato . Among other things , he argued that the administrative courts had no jurisdiction in the instant case as the authorities had exercised powers which they did not possess and had failed to exercise properly those they did possess .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the ORG in its entirety . It held that the instant case related to a defective declaration , not a failure to make a declaration , and that it was within the jurisdiction of the administrative courts because it concerned the exercise of existing powers . It went on to confirm that since the DATE declaration did not contain all the essential information required by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE \u2013 notably the identity of all the contracting parties \u2013 the authorities were entitled to exercise their right of pre - emption under LAW of PERSON no . DATE at any time , that right being subject to a limitation period only if a fresh declaration were made in accordance with the law . The PERSON also held that the applicant could not have acquired the painting definitively by adverse possession .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON considered that the authorities had not erred in considering the applicant to be the person on whom they should serve the pre - emption order and that in the present case the right of pre - emption of the authorities was different from the CARDINAL existing under the general law . It had amounted to an actual expropriation measure , the transfer of the work being merely the condition allowing the authorities to expropriate it lawfully . The PERSON held as follows :", "\u201c Therefore , even acknowledging that , as the appellants maintain , Mr GPE had purchased the painting from Mr PERSON as Mr PERSON 's indirect agent , the fact remains that it is the latter 's position which is affected in the final analysis by the agreement signed .", "...", "The administrative authorities thus committed no error of fact as regards the identification of the real purchaser on whom the order announcing their intention of exercising their right of pre - emption had to be served , as well as on PERSON ...", "Further , the fact that the right of pre - emption provided for in LAW no . DATE has to be exercised against the real owner , and in any event against the end purchaser in a line of transactions complicated by the intervention of an agent , is also closely linked to the special nature of pre - emption ...", "Pre - emption , as provided for in sections CARDINAL et seq . of Law no . CARDINAL ... , does not operate in the same way as the civil - law transaction of the same name ... , so that the mechanism by which the right of pre - emption is actually exercised must therefore be considered as belonging to the more general category of measures of dispossession ( in respect of which the deed of transfer is merely a pre - condition for the exercise of the right of pre - emption ) . The validity of the transfer is not therefore a decisive factor , given that the exercise of the right of pre - emption does not have the effect of substituting the authorities for the vendor in negotiations between individuals , but rather the \u2013 opposite \u2013 effect of annulling the sale and constituting an acquisition ...", "... it is ... rather an actual act of expropriation , which can concern only the real owner of the property , this being the only person against whom the act of dispossession can be validly exercised ... \u201d", "\u201c ORG , ORG , a voler ritenere , come pretendono gli appellanti , che il GPE abbia acquistato il dipinto dal PERSON mandatario senza rappresentanza del Beyeler , \u00e8 pur sempre a quest'ultimo che devono ricondursi gli effetti finali del concluso contratto .", "...", "E ' da escludere , pertanto , che vi sia stato errore di fatto da parte dell'Amministrazione relativamente alla individuazione del soggetto effettivo acquirente e nei cui confronti andava esercitata la prelazione ed PERSON andava notificato il relativo decreto , PERSON ...", "D'altra parte , che la prelazione di cui all'art . CARDINAL della legge n. CARDINAL/CARDINAL debba esercitarsi nei confronti del proprietario effettivo e comunque del destinatario finale di una fattispecie acquisitiva complessa ORG \u00e8 il mandato , si ricollega anche alla ... particolare natura dell'istituto .", "GPE , di cui all'art . CARDINAL e segg . della legge indicata ... non opera alla stregua dell'omonimo istituto civilistico ... , sicch\u00e9 il provvedimento , con cui , in concreto , si esercita la prelazione deve essere ricondotto alla pi\u00f9 generale ORG degli atti ablatori ( rispetto PERSON negozio di alienazione costituisce mera condizione legittimante del potere ) , con la conseguenza che non assume valore determinante la validit\u00e0 dell'atto di alienazione presupposto , dal momento che nessuna sostituzione dell'amministrazione PERSON alienante nel negozio posto in essere da privati avviene col provvedimento della prelazione dal quale , anzi , ORG un effetto propriamente costitutivo ( acquisitivo ) discende un ( ulteriore ) effetto caducatorio del negozio di alienazione medesima ...", "... trattasi ... piuttosto di un vero e proprio atto espropriativo , che non pu\u00f3 non riguardare se non il proprietario effettivo del bene stesso , ORG a poter essere utilmente inciso dall'atto ablativo ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON observed further that the conduct of the authorities could not be considered to be contradictory : as the ORG had already pointed out , the authorities had approached the matter carefully and ultimately had not decided to exercise their right of pre - emption until they were certain , on the basis of documentation in their possession , that the painting had been purchased on behalf of PERSON and paid for by him . The PERSON also pointed out that the nationality of the applicant had increased the ORG 's determination to exercise its right of pre - emption .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON also held that the issues raised by the applicant as to the unconstitutionality of DATE , CARDINAL and DATE of Law no . DATE were manifestly ill - founded . Those issues concerned in particular LAW , which DATE among other things \u2013 the non - discrimination principle , LAW , which guarantees the right of property and , lastly , LAW , which establishes the principle of sound public administration . As to LAW , the PERSON observed that in the instant case the special nature of the situation resulting from an invalid declaration of sale justified different treatment . As regards LAW , it considered \u2013 with regard to transfers of title to protected works DATE that private individuals had duties of good faith and transparency . Lastly , as regards LAW , it found that the ORG 's delay in exercising its right of pre - emption should be attributed to the improper conduct of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then appealed to ORG , arguing that his case came within the jurisdiction of the ordinary civil courts , not the administrative courts . He submitted again that sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of Law no . DATE were unconstitutional in the light of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the constitutionality issues did not appear to be manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled firstly that if the authorities could exercise their right of pre - emption at any time the seller 's rights would always be restricted , thus creating continual uncertainty as to the legal position with regard to the work . ORG observed in that regard that , even if the first declaration had been invalid , the right of pre - emption could nonetheless have been exercised once the authorities had received all the information required under the statute ( pointing out in that connection , as the PERSON had already noted , that ORG had not exercised its right of pre - emption until it was certain that the painting had been purchased on behalf of PERSON and in consideration of a sum of money paid by him ) . The authorities had not been certain of that until the ORG had received the bank statements relating to the DATE sale . ORG noted that the pre - emption order had been issued and served on the parties DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG then found that even supposing that the pre - emption order did amount to an actual expropriation measure , as the Consiglio di Stato had said , the applicant had been treated differently from anyone else whose property had been expropriated . Compensation to which owners of property over which the ORG exercised its right of pre - emption were entitled was calculated on a different basis from the one used to calculate compensation payable in other cases of expropriation ; furthermore , there was no right of judicial review . Although the agreed price stated in the transfer document might constitute sufficient compensation where the pre - emption occurred within DATE period laid down by the statute , that was no longer true where the right of pre - emption was exercised DATE , as had happened in the instant case . The applicant had also been treated differently from a person who had failed to make a declaration of transfer . The court considered , having regard to section ORG ) of PERSON no . DATE , that where , in the latter type of case , it was impossible to determine the agreed price , the ORG would have to pay the owner compensation equivalent to the market value of the work .", "CARDINAL . It observed , lastly , that if ORG held that the provisions in issue were unconstitutional , one of the consequences would be that the ordinary courts dealing with such cases would have jurisdiction and the applicant would be able to challenge the impugned decision in those courts and rely on the NORP authorities ' delay in exercising their right of pre - emption .", "CARDINAL . ORG stayed the proceedings before it and ordered the case to be referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the constitutionality issue raised by ORG unfounded . It stressed , firstly , the special nature of the provisions of PERSON no . DATE , which were intended to \u201c protect assets related to the fundamental interests of the cultural life of the country \u201d . The special nature of such assets had accordingly justified the authorities ' being granted different , more restrictive powers than those they had in respect of other property . Consequently , there had been no discriminatory treatment as the property was different in kind from that concerned in ordinary expropriation proceedings . Nor was there any difference in treatment between cases where an invalid declaration was made and cases where the sale had not been declared , as , even in the latter case , the compensation payable would be the price agreed at the time of the sale . If the agreed price on an undeclared sale was not known , it had to be determined on the basis of any available evidence .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , as regards the appropriate price payable by the ORG when it exercised its right of pre - emption late , ORG reiterated that that issue could not be decided on the basis of the criteria used to determine the amount of compensation in ordinary expropriation proceedings , as the proceedings were of a different kind and the amount paid in situations such as the one in the instant case was , in any event , dependent on a contractual element that had been freely decided by the parties . It followed from this latter point that , under normal circumstances , namely in cases where the right of pre - emption was exercised within the prescribed time - limit , the price , despite being less than the market value , would nonetheless not be derisory or symbolic . Lastly , ORG noted that LAW no . DATE was to be found in the part of the statute dealing with \u201c penalties \u201d . A crucial factor was , therefore , the fact that the owner 's economic loss was a consequence of an irregularity or of a failure on his part to declare the sale of the property , thus rendering the sale nugatory and entitling the ORG to exercise its right of pre - emption at any time . However , as it did not amount to a real criminal or administrative penalty , it was right that the authorities should have a discretion to exercise their right of pre - emption at any time . Moreover , individuals could rectify the position at any time by filing a late declaration .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of ORG , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal in a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE . It held that the administrative courts had jurisdiction in the case and that , both as regards the exercise by the ORG of its right of pre - emption at any time and the allegation that service of the pre - emption order had been defective , the case concerned issues that related to the way in which the authorities had exercised their powers , not to the exercise of powers which they did not possess .", "CARDINAL . Among other things , ORG considered that , in the absence of any legal provision in that respect , it would have been arbitrary for the compulsory DATE time - limit to run from the time at which the ( unspecified ) departments of the authorities had learnt of the sale on the basis of undetermined factors or circumstances . However , ORG found that the right of pre - emption had properly been ruled to be exercisable at any time and against anyone in possession of the property ( reiterating that the authorities had not exercised their right of pre - emption until they had been certain that the painting had been purchased on behalf of the applicant ) . Moreover , it pointed out that the argument concerning the reference in section CARDINAL to section DATE ( which , inter alia , provided for a DATE time - limit ) was irrelevant as section DATE contained procedural provisions that also applied to ORG pre - emptions that were not subject to any time - limit , such as the rule that the ORG acquired title to property when the pre - emption order was made or the rule that the provisions of a sale agreement did not bind the ORG .", "CARDINAL . During TIME CARDINAL DATE the painting , which was still in ORG , was stolen in an armed robbery along with CARDINAL other paintings . It was found by the carabinieri and NORP police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the sale of movable property through an agent acting in his own name but on behalf of his principal ( indirect agency ) has the effect of automatically transferring title to the property to the principal , who can then claim it from the agent .", "CARDINAL . In respect of works of art which are of interest for the artistic heritage of the nation , transfers and other legal transactions are subject to certain conditions . LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE provides that the owner or person in possession , in any capacity whatsoever , of property considered to be of cultural or artistic interest within the meaning of section CARDINAL must declare to the Ministry responsible for works of cultural interest ( from DATE ORG \u2013 Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali ) any transaction , whether for consideration or by way of gift , transferring full or partial title to or possession of the work ( \u201c PERSON chiunque a qualsiasi titolo detenga una delle cose che abbiano formato oggetto di notifica a PERSON degli artcioli precendenti \u00e8 tenuto a denunziare PERSON per CARDINAL nazionale ogni atto , a titolo oneroso o gratuito , che ne trasmetta , in tutto o in parte , la propriet\u00e0 o la detenzione \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .
