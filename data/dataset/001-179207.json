The applicant \u2019s detention measure was made subject to several judicial reviews by ORG and ORG .

He was assisted by various officially appointed lawyers , who , in the proceedings completed before DATE , had confined themselves to referring to the findings of the forensic medical assessments carried out , and had either left it to the discretion of the courts whether or not to maintain the measure or objected to the lifting thereof .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the decisions adopted after DATE , the case file does not indicate whether the prior decisions had been served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to the forensic medical reports drawn up after each review , the applicant , who had not fully acknowledged the fact of his mental illness , had been calm , had not refused his treatment and had refrained from causing trouble with the other patients . On the other hand , the reports stated that he had vehemently denied having committed the criminal offences with which he had been charged , claiming that his former wife had been plotting against him .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG maintained the detention measure in respect of the applicant .

Furthermore , although this aspect was not mentioned by the court , it transpires from that report that the applicant \u2019s ORG had noted an erotomaniac obsession with his former wife , which had indicated a total incapacity for social reintegration and would most likely have triggered conflicts or unforeseeable , potentially dangerous situations had he returned to the apartment where he had lived with his family . The report further noted that the applicant \u2019s friend , who had attended most of the medical boards\u2019 meetings , had come down emphatically in favour of the applicant \u2019s release , claiming that he would accommodate him indefinitely in the apartment which he shared with his mother . However , the assessment board doubted the reality of such support proffered by someone who was himself suffering from psychiatric problems . On the other hand , the report mentioned that the applicant had been plainly rejected by his daughters and his former wife , and that despite the rejection by his former wife and the fact that he himself considered that his detention was the result of scheming on her part , he intended to get back together with her if he was released .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s second application for release on the grounds that its decision of CARDINAL DATE had meanwhile become final and was therefore res judicata .

In its decision of CARDINAL DATE the court further had regard to a forensic medical report drawn up following an examination of the applicant carried out DATE previously , in DATE . Furthermore , it referred , broadly , to the \u201c aim of the preventive measures , which was to put an end to a situation of danger and prevent the perpetration of acts punishable under criminal law \u201d , and concluded that the criteria set out in LAW had been satisfied .", "CARDINAL .

ORG has not received copies of those reports and decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to the courts to declare the applicant incapable and place him under guardianship ( see paragraph CARDINAL et seq . below for the conduct of the related proceedings ) .", "CARDINAL .

It confirmed the existence of the practice criticised by the applicant , but pointed out that it had been caused by the medical authorities\u2019 delay in forwarding their expert reports and not in any breach by the judges of their attributions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the delegated judge requested ORG to conduct a further psychiatric expert assessment with a view to periodically reviewing the need to maintain the applicant \u2019s psychiatric detention . The applicant filed a separate action seeking the replacement of the detention measure with a compulsory medical treatment measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also examined the applicant . The applicant \u2019s lawyer representing him in the present application before the ORG sent a reasoned letter to the ORG strongly advocating the replacement of the measure implemented in respect of his client .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG drew up its forensic medical report recommending the replacement of the detention measure with a compulsory medical treatment measure . It emphasised that the persistence of the applicant \u2019s delusional ideas concerning the setting up of a \u201c new ORG \u201d and his lack of social and family support , a factor conducive to social reintegration , supervision of his medical treatment and the management of the applicant \u2019s DATE needs relating to the purported \u201c new ORG \u201d , had justified maintaining the detention up until then . It noted that the applicant had not been aggressive to others or to himself during his detention . In that context , it welcomed the steps taken by ORG to place the applicant under guardianship , which it considered appropriate in the perspective of his release , given that the applicant had been rejected by his family ( his brother , sister , former wife and daughters ) . Finally , the ORG recommended that the social welfare services of the applicant \u2019s district of residence should be informed that they had to take the necessary action with a view to releasing him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which was responsible for the review , ordered a fresh forensic medical report from ORG ( ORG ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

Indeed , it considered that although , from the psychiatric point of view , the applicant could be released subject to compulsory medical treatment on the basis of LAW , that measure was inconceivable in the absence of social support . Consequently , it proposed provisionally maintaining the detention until the social welfare services could transfer the applicant to a specialised institution capable of providing him with appropriate living conditions and treatment .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , referring to the findings of DATE forensic medical rapport ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ordered the maintenance of the detention measure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against that decision . He was represented by an officially appointed lawyer , who argued that the applicant \u2019s wishes should be complied with . Questioned by the court , the applicant stated that he would live with his former wife and one of his daughters in their apartment . He added that he had a retirement pension .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the CARDINAL DATE decision . It held as follows :", "\u201c Given the absence of improvement in the patient \u2019s state of health and the fact that the members of his family can not monitor his continued medical treatment , and having regard to the nature of the charges against him which had resulted in his medical detention , family members against whom [ the applicant ] has committed antisocial acts can not be expected to cohabit with him .", "Nevertheless , the director of the establishment [ where the applicant is detained ] must inform the social welfare services responsible for transferring [ the applicant ] to a specialised institution capable of providing proper living conditions and treatment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
