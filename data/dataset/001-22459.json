He was represented before the Court by Mr K .- PERSON , of GPE . The applicant died on DATE , but his sons ( Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ) wished to continue the proceedings before the ORG .", "The applicant was a urologist and had opened his own surgery in GPE ( GDR ) in DATE .", "From DATE he had subscribed to the GPE \u2019s general pension scheme by paying compulsory social - insurance contributions ( ORG ) and , from DATE , optional supplementary pension insurance ( freiwillige PERSON ) . He had also subscribed to additional pension schemes ( Zusatzversorgungssysteme ) of the GPE by taking out optional pension insurance ( freiwillige PERSON ) and paying contributions to ORG and Dentists ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG in eigener Praxis ) .", "From DATE the applicant received a DATE pension of ORG marks from the compulsory social - insurance fund and MONEY from the optional supplementary pension fund .", "The applicant also received a DATE pension of MONEY pursuant to ORG ( Verordnung \u00fcber die freiwillige ORG ) of DATE , and a DATE supplementary pension of MONEY from ORG and Dentists , which was increased to MONEY from DATE .", "As at DATE , after a number of increases , the applicant was receiving a total DATE pension of MONEY ( excluding the pension paid pursuant to ORG of DATE ) .", "Pursuant to LAW of DATE between GPE ( FRG ) and the GPE on ORG ( Staatsvertrag \u00fcber die LANGUAGE einer W\u00e4hrungs- , Wirtschafts- und MONEY Bundesrepublik GPE und der GPE Republik \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , GPE pensions were converted at the rate of CARDINAL GPE mark for CARDINAL FRG mark ( ORG ) and paid in that currency .", "From DATE the applicant accordingly received a DATE pension of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "In CARDINAL decisions of ORG for Salaried Employees ( GPE f\u00fcr ORG ) of DATE and DATE on the conversion and alignment of GPE pension rights from DATE , the applicant \u2019s pension was incorporated into the ORG \u2019s general pension scheme and paid as an \u201c ordinary old - age pension \u201d ( PERSON ) in accordance with the method of calculation provided for in the new pensions law ( LAW and CARDINAL of Social Code no . VI ( GPE ) DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "At first ORG for Salaried Employees continued to pay the applicant DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It subsequently increased the applicant \u2019s pension to DEM DATE from DATE .", "In a decision of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed an objection lodged by the applicant on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE against the decision of ORG challenging , among other things , the basis on which his pension rights under the GPE \u2019s additional pension schemes had been calculated .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( ORG ) also dismissed an appeal by the applicant .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( Landessozialgericht ) of ORG modified the earlier decisions and judgments in part and awarded the applicant , from DATE , a pension indexed to the cost of living ( anzupassende GPE ) of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL per month and a non - indexed pension ( nichtanpassungs - f\u00e4hige PERSON ) of DEM CARDINAL per month , making a total of DEM DATE .", "ORG held that the applicant \u2019s pension should be calculated on the basis of LAW no . VI ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) because he had also paid contributions to the GPE \u2019s optional supplementary pension fund .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( ORG ) set aside that judgment , on appeal by the authorities , on the ground that the alignment and transfer of the applicant \u2019s pension should be based exclusively on LAW no . VI because the total amount of the pension was based at least in part on pension rights accrued under an additional or special retirement scheme ( ORG aus einem Zusatz- oder LAW ) of the GPE .", "ORG reiterated that , in this type of case , it was always the special law relating to the GPE \u2019s additional and special retirement schemes as set out in LAW ( Einigungsvertrag \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) and the provisions of the PERSON on ORG ( Anspruchs - und ORG ) and LAW no . ORG that were applicable .", "ORG held that the difference in treatment between persons having acquired \u201c real \u201d pension rights under the GPE \u2019s general pension scheme , comprising the compulsory social - insurance fund and the optional supplementary pension fund , and persons having acquired pension rights under the GPE \u2019s additional and special pension schemes was justified . In the former case there was a clearly established link between the contributions paid and the benefits received , and it was possible to rely on the data in the files kept by the insurance funds ( ORG in den Sozialversicherungsausweisen ) . However , with regard to pension rights under the additional and special retirement schemes , the position was much more confused ( un\u00fcbersichtlich ) : the legal basis was unclear , there was only a partial obligation to pay contributions , which , even where it existed , was treated inconsistently both in respect of the income to be taken into account and of the total contributions payable ; lastly , the data available on the insured \u2019s life was often unusable .", "ORG added that the possibility could not be ruled out , having regard to the fact that the benefits paid under the additional and special pension schemes were far greater than those paid under the general pension scheme , that the former pension rights had been greater than those of other employees in the GPE for political reasons .", "ORG concluded that the legislature was therefore justified , under the provisions applicable during the transitional period ( LAW no . VI ) , in making a standardised calculation and taking as a basis the average salary used as a reference by the compulsory social insurance fund .", "In DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . He submitted that the reduction ( \u201c Abschmelzung \u201d ) of his pension rights under the additional pension scheme had breached his right of property and constituted unjustified discriminatory treatment compared with his counterparts of the ORG and with persons eligible for a pension under the GPE \u2019s general pension scheme . The amount of his pension had , accordingly , fallen to an abnormally low level compared to the rights acquired in the GPE .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG , after hearing submissions from ORG , ORG for ORG , ORG , ORG and CARDINAL experts , also dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , on the ground that the impugned provisions were not contrary to LAW ) .", "ORG first reiterated the general difficulties involved in transferring and incorporating the pension rights of all pensioners from the GPE into the ORG \u2019s pension scheme . Those difficulties were due to the large number of pensioners ( CARDINAL ) to be incorporated and the fact that the CARDINAL schemes were based on very different principles . Whereas in the FRG the amount of benefits depended mainly on the contributions paid , the system in the GPE had been a mixture between an insurance scheme and a pension scheme ( GPE zwischen Versicherungs- und NORP ) .", "ORG went on to stress that the legislature had had a wide margin of appreciation in that regard and that , for practical reasons , it had been justified for at least a transitional period of DATE in using a standardised method of calculation resulting DATE provisionally \u2013 in certain differences of treatment regarding , inter alia , the time at which the amount of the pension was finally determined ( GPE endg\u00fcltigen GPE ) , the taking into consideration of DATE of service in calculating the DATE pension ( LOC der PERSON Ermittlung des monatlichen PERSON ) and the determination of the minimum protected amount ( GPE ) between pension rights under the general pension scheme and those under the GPE \u2019s additional and special schemes . However , from DATE those pension rights had been recalculated and the difference paid retrospectively , as had been the case for the applicant .", "ORG added that , having regard to the difficulties of incorporating CARDINAL scheme into the other , the legislature had not exceeded its margin of appreciation , considering that \u2013 during DATE the pensioners whose pension rights had accrued under the additional pension schemes were not so severely affected by the provisional difference of treatment because they had a higher standard of living than the pensioners whose pension rights had accrued under the general pension scheme .", "ORG pointed out that in the case of the applicant ORG for Salaried Employees had further adjusted his pension on DATE , increasing it retrospectively from DATE .", "In the same judgment ORG found that at DATE , when it came to calculating the definitive amount of pensions , an inequality of treatment remained regarding the taking into consideration of the total number of DATE of service between pension rights accrued under the general pension scheme ( where only DATE of service were taken into consideration ) and pension rights accrued under the additional pension schemes of the GPE ( where DATE of service were taken into consideration ) .", "ORG found that this difference in treatment breached LAW and ordered the NORP legislature to put new rules in place by DATE . However , that complaint had not been raised by the applicant , but by a third party who had also lodged a constitutional appeal .", "On DATE ORG delivered several leading judgments in other cases which also concerned the method used to transfer former GPE citizens\u2019 pension rights .", "From DATE the applicant received a DATE pension of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "The pension system of the GPE comprised the general pension scheme , which was composed of the compulsory social insurance fund ( GPE ) and the optional supplementary pension fund ( freiwillige PERSON ) , and a host of additional pension schemes ( Zusatzversorgungssysteme ) , including , among others , the optional pension fund ( freiwillige PERSON ) and ORG and Dentists ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG in eigener Praxis ) , which paid extra benefits in addition to the pensions payable under the general scheme .", "LAW of DATE between the ORG and the GPE on ORG ( Staatsvertrag \u00fcber die LANGUAGE einer W\u00e4hrungs- , Wirtschafts- und MONEY der Bundesrepublik GPE und der GPE ) provided for pension rights accrued under the GPE scheme to be brought into line with those accrued under the ORG scheme and to be reconverted into MONEY ( ORG ) at the rate of CARDINAL GPE mark for CARDINAL FRG mark ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) , and set out the terms and conditions of transfer of those pension rights .", "LAW in question is worded as follows :", "\u201c \u2026 Acquired rights and future rights shall be transferred to the [ FRG ] pension scheme , but the benefits payable under the special provisions shall be re - examined with a view to eliminating unjustified benefits and reducing excessive benefits \u2026 \u201d", "Those principles also appear in LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) of CARDINAL DATE ( see PERSON , Chapter VIII , section H , paragraph III no . CARDINAL ( b ) ) .", "On the basis of that treaty the GPE legislature decided , in accordance with ORG ( Rentenangleichungsgesetz ) of DATE , that pensions under the general pension scheme and pensions under the additional pension schemes would be paid in full from DATE until their full and final incorporation into the FRG pension scheme .", "After NORP reunification on DATE the retirement scheme of the GPE remained in force until DATE , the date of entry into force of the ORG \u2019s PERSON of DATE on ORG ( Gesetz zur Herstellung der LANGUAGE in der gesetzlichen Renten- und GPE \u2013 ORG ) .", "During the transitional period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , the CARDINAL pension schemes operated side by side in GPE .", "From DATE all DATE pension amounts were determined in accordance with a new formula , whereby the pensions paid to former GPE pensioners were progressively brought into line with those paid to ORG pensioners until such time as ORG incomes were the same throughout the ORG .", "The DATE pension amounts were determined in accordance with Articles ORG ( for the pension rights under the general pension scheme of the GPE ) and CARDINALb ( for the pension rights under the additional and special retirement schemes of the GPE ) of ORG no .

ORG also provided for the conversion of pension rights under the additional and special retirement schemes by taking as a basis the average salary over DATE of service , but this was the average salary which had been used as a reference by the compulsory social insurance fund , and not individual salaries .
