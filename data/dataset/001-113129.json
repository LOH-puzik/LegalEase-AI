An oral hearing took place DATE in ORG and DATE in ORG in respect of the claim for possession against the applicant . In a witness statement lodged prior to the hearing , the applicant indicated that she intended to leave the site when her parents left .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge Bidder PERSON gave a judgment on the preliminary issue of whether the applicant could challenge the making of a possession order in her case . He considered himself bound by the decision of ORG in PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraph DATE below ) , which had examined the effect of this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG v. GPE , no .

Thus , he concluded , the only options open to the applicant were to challenge the domestic law itself or to commence judicial review proceedings based on conventional grounds .

I do not consider it to be arguable that the decision of the claimants to seek possession against her was unreasonable or that their decision to invoke their domestic law rights could be castigated as unreasonable ...", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the fact that parliament has amended the applicable domestic legislation to afford the gypsy occupier the opportunity to contend that any possession order should be suspended for DATE at a time distinguishes that case from ORG , and given that that amendment was considered in PERSON and PERSON I find it impossible to say ... that there is a seriously arguable point raised that the law which enables the court to make the possession order is incompatible with article CARDINAL ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He invited submissions from the applicant as to the possible temporary suspension of any possession order . He added :", "\u201c DATE . I should say that on the issue of suspension of the ... order against the [ applicant ] of possession I would invite the parties to consider the date of CARDINALth DATE being the date on which the [ applicant \u2019s ] parents are required to leave and on which she indicates that she would leave anyway ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s submissions that any possession order against her should be suspended , the judge handed down his judgment on the remaining issues . Having reviewed the allegations made against the applicant by the claimant , the judge concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I am not satisfied that PERSON has herself been guilty of any offensive behaviour on site , or of any breach of licence , apart from the relatively minor failure to pay the water charges . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He was , however , satisfied that her son , who resided part of the time with her , had been involved in an incident on site in which he threatened someone with a gun , although it was not clear whether the gun had been real or merely an imitation ; and had dumped garden refuse on the site .", "CARDINAL . Turning to consider whether the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , and those of her son , justified a suspension of the possession order which he would be making in her case the judge noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In relation to PERSON , while I am obliged to make a possession order , I find her only breach of site conditions has been recent and is a very modest failure to pay water charges . She has indicated in a recent statement that she intends to move from the site when [ her parents ] leave , that is on or before TIME on DATE . I do consider it appropriate to suspend enforcement of the possession order against her until the same time and date . However , I am clear that the behaviour of [ her son ] on this site and his attitude towards the ORG [ the family of the site manager ] is such that I have to impose conditions on her continued possession , as sought in the draft order \u2013 [ her son ] lives half his time with his father , and I have no doubt that if he can not live with his mother , he will be able to live with his father ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He made an order for possession against the applicant , which he suspended until DATE upon the condition that her son leave the site and that she discharge the GBP CARDINAL arrears of water charges at the rate of GBP DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was still resident at the site , was granted permission to appeal the possession order to ORG . A stay of execution of the order of DATE was also ordered .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a bill which would amend LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was introduced to ORG . The effect of the proposed amendment was to allow a defendant in possession proceedings such as the applicant to challenge before ORG the reasonableness of making a possession order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed . Considering the impact of the amendment to the DATE Act to allow suspension of a possession order on whether the applicant could succeed in a conventional public law challenge to the decision to seek a possession order , Lord Justice PERSON noted :", "\u201c DATE . The significance of the amendment is that a claimant \u2019s decision to seek possession does not involve summary eviction without judicial scrutiny of the justification of the claim to possession . By issuing proceedings , the claimant submits to the jurisdiction of the court , , including the claimant \u2019s complaints about the defendant \u2019s behaviour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It may be that , for the reasons given by Lord PERSON [ in PERSON ] , a public law defence could have been raised successfully in ORG . I would suggest that this is not so much because the family had been in occupation for a great length of time , but rather because it was unreasonable and grossly unfair for the local authority to seek a possession order and obtain the eviction of the occupier merely on the basis of a termination of the licence \u2018 without the need to make good any underlying reason for taking such precipitate ORG . The real difference between the present case and ORG is not that the appellant had been in occupation for a shorter period than was the family in Connors ... On any view , the site was her home and had been for a substantial period of time . The fact that she had not been in occupation for as long as the family in ORG is not , in my judgment , of much significance . The real difference between the CARDINAL cases is that in ORG , once the licence had been terminated , the authority was entitled to an order for possession whose enforcement could not be suspended by the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that since the amendment to LAW , it was difficult to conceive of a case in which a public law defence would succeed . Referring also to the fact that Judge Bidder had made a finding of misconduct on the site by the applicant \u2019s son , for whose behaviour she was responsible under the terms of the licence , ORG considered that the judge was right to hold that the public law defence was not seriously arguable .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the factual situation of ORG was not materially different from the present case in that in both cases the defendant had occupied a site as a home for DATE . Further , in both cases the claimant had validly and properly terminated the defendant \u2019s licence to occupy so that the defendant had become a trespasser ; the claimant was entitled to an order for possession as the owner of the land ; and no further justification was required to seek an order for possession . However , it was agreed by the parties that it was not necessary to decide whether the present case could be distinguished from ORG as the distinction was only relevant for any appeal before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in respect of the applicant \u2019s argument that the amendment to section CARDINAL of LAW did not remedy the incompatibility with LAW , ORG emphasised that , in principle , a wide margin of appreciation was left to the national authorities in such matters . However , he accepted that the vulnerable position of gypsies as a minority meant that \u201c some special consideration should be given to their needs and different lifestyle both in the relevant regulatory framework and in reaching decisions in particular cases \u201d ( citing ORG , \u00a7 DATE ) . He found that the main reason for the narrowing of the margin of appreciation in ORG itself was that the complete absence of any procedural safeguards was a serious interference with the applicant \u2019s LAW rights in that case , which called for particularly weighty reasons of public interest in justification . However , the precise scope of these safeguards was in his view , a matter for the national authorities to determine . He considered that provided that a reasonable degree of protection was afforded by the domestic law , ORG would not interfere , even if a greater degree of protection could have been afforded . He accordingly rejected the applicant \u2019s submissions , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The objectionable feature of the legal regime in place before the amendment was that the court was bound not merely to make an order for possession , but to order the eviction of an occupant such as the appellant provided that the CARDINAL GPE notice was given . Absent a public law challenge , the occupant had no opportunity to challenge the reasons given by the local authority for seeking possession and the court had no jurisdiction to take the reasons into account in deciding whether to order the occupant \u2019s eviction . The local authority \u2019s reasons were irrelevant as were the occupant \u2019s personal circumstances . Nor did the court have power to suspend an order for possession even in circumstances of extreme hardship which indicated that eviction would not be justified under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In short , there was no opportunity for the court to make any assessment of the justification for eviction in order to determine whether the interference with an occupier \u2019s rights under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was justified on an application of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Provided that the relevant formal requirements had been satisfied , the role of the court was purely mechanistic .", "CARDINAL . The amendment has introduced procedural protections which ensure that the role of the court is no longer a mechanistic one even when a local authority seeks to evict a licensee from a caravan site . Summary eviction has been replaced by judicial examination . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) now provides that the enforcement of a possession order may be suspended for such period DATE \u2018 as the court thinks ORG . The court has a wide discretion under subsection ( CARDINAL ) to impose conditions when making an order for suspension . By subsection ( CARDINAL ) , the court may extend the suspension of the possession order for DATE at a time . Subsection ( CARDINAL ) requires the court to have regard to \u2018 all the LOC in deciding whether to exercise its power to suspend . The court is , therefore , ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded :", "\u201c DATE . In my judgment , the decision to provide the procedural safeguards introduced by the amendment of section CARDINAL of LAW was within the margin of appreciation available to GPE . More generous safeguards could have been introduced ( and they will be when LAW is amended ) . But the amendment goes far enough to meet the real thrust of the criticisms made in ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the legislation discriminated against gypsies , ORG found that although the discrimination point was CARDINAL of the features of the ORG \u2019s reasoning in ORG , it was not the main reason for the decision . Even if that was wrong , ORG considered that by addressing the lack of procedural safeguards for gypsies of local authority sites , the amendment had also gone a long way to meeting the discrimination point . While discrimination would not be cured completely until LAW was amended , it had been much mitigated . Thus to the extent that the discrimination persisted , the decision not to eliminate it altogether fell within the margin of appreciation accorded to the contracting GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for permission to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant left PERSON caravan site for alternative accommodation on land owned by her brother . She claims that her departure was the result of the refusal of leave to appeal and in the face of further threats of eviction The land owned by her brother has no planning permission for residential use and its occupants , which include the applicant \u2019s brother , his CARDINAL children and the applicants\u2019 parents , share minimal facilities , namely CARDINAL toilet and CARDINAL sink with cold running water in a shed with no lighting .", "CARDINAL . Part I of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) provides limited security of tenure to certain occupiers of caravans and caravan sites . LAW provides that CARDINAL GPE notice of termination of a licence to occupy a caravan site must be given .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that when a court makes an order for the removal or exclusion of an occupier from a caravan site , it may suspend the enforcement of that order for DATE at a time .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that in considering whether or how to exercise its powers under this section , the court shall have regard to all the circumstances , and in particular to the questions :", "\u201c ( a ) whether the occupier of the caravan has failed , whether before or after the expiration or determination of the relevant residential contract , to observe any terms or conditions of that contract , any conditions of the site licence , or any reasonable rules made by the owner for the management and conduct of the site or the maintenance of caravans thereon ;", "( b ) whether the occupier has unreasonably refused an offer by the owner to renew the residential contract or make another such contract for a reasonable period and on reasonable terms ;", "( c ) whether the occupier has failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain elsewhere other suitable accommodation for his caravan ( or , as the case may be , another suitable caravan and accommodation for it ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act formerly excluded the court \u2019s power to suspend the enforcement of a possession order under section CARDINAL ) in the case of possession proceedings brought by local authorities . However , the exclusion of local authority caravan sites from the ambit of the power to suspend under section CARDINAL ) was removed by LAW , which entered into force on DATE , in respect of proceedings begun on or after that date .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to section CARDINAL and Schedule CARDINAL of ORG DATE , which was enacted on DATE , the exclusion of land used for accommodating gypsies from the definition of \u201c protected site \u201d in section CARDINAL ) of LAW is removed .

Price and others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , Lord Hope of PERSON clarified that a challenge to possession proceedings could only be based either on an argument that the law itself was incompatible with Article CARDINAL ; or on conventional judicial review grounds .", "CARDINAL . The subsequent case of PERSON and others v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , decided after the applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed , concerned the eviction of gypsies from a local authority caravan site . Lord Hope concluded that it was open to the defendant to argue that the law itself was incompatible with the Convention because the relevant legal framework was indistinguishable from that which applied in ORG . He considered that in light of the clear terms of the legislation allowing the local authority possession , there was no scope for interpreting it in a manner which was Convention - compatible and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... This raises the question whether your Lordships should make a declaration of incompatibility ... The incompatibility with the appellant \u2019s article CARDINAL rights that was to be found in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the DATE Act has been removed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . As already noted , a clause was included in LAW to remove the exclusion of local authority sites which provide accommodation for gipsies from the protection of LAW . Nevertheless , prior to its receiving LAW ... , Lord PERSON favoured the making of a declaration of incompatibility in relation to section CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . I was at first inclined to doubt whether a declaration was necessary . The power to make a declaration ... is , after all , a discretionary one . But on reflection I agreed that it would be appropriate to make such a declaration in this case . Indeed I considered that the decision of the GPE court in ORG left the ORG with no alternative but to do this . That was a judgment which was pronounced in a case against GPE . Its decision is as plain an indication as there could be that there was an incompatibility in our legislation that ought to be addressed by ORG ... In such circumstances the decision as to whether the incompatibility should remain was not for the court to take . It had to be left to the government and to ORG , and it could not be taken for granted that the amending legislation would be passed . In the events that have happened , however , the making of a declaration has become unnecessary ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( \u201c Pinnock \u201d ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges . The case concerned possession proceedings brought against a demoted tenant . Following a review of the case - law , ORG considered the following propositions to be well - established in the jurisprudence of this ORG :", "\u201c ( a ) Any person at risk of being dispossessed of his home at the suit of a local authority should in principle have the right to raise the question of the proportionality of the measure , and to have it determined by an independent tribunal in the light of DATE , even if his right of occupation under domestic law has come to an end ...", "( b ) A judicial procedure which is limited to addressing the proportionality of the measure through the medium of traditional judicial review ( i e , one which does not permit the court to make its own assessment of the facts in an appropriate case ) is inadequate as it is not appropriate for resolving sensitive factual issues ...", "( c ) Where the measure includes proceedings involving CARDINAL stage , it is the proceedings as a whole which must be considered in order to see if article CARDINAL has been complied with ...", "( d ) If the court concludes that it would be disproportionate to evict a person from his home notwithstanding the fact that he has no domestic right to remain there , it would be unlawful to evict him so long as the conclusion obtains \u2013 for example , for a specified period , or until a specified event occurs , or a particular condition is satisfied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that in order for domestic law to be compatible with Article CARDINAL of the Convention , where a court was asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a person \u2019s home , the court had to have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order , and , in making that assessment , to resolve any relevant dispute of fact . In terms of the practical implications of this principle , ORG noted that if domestic law justified an outright order for possession , the effect of Article CARDINAL could , albeit in exceptional cases , justify granting an extended period for possession , suspending the order for possession on the happening of an event , or even refusing an order altogether . Finally , the court observed that the need for a court to have the ability to assess LAW CARDINAL proportionality of making a possession order in respect of a person \u2019s home might require certain statutory and procedural provisions to be revisited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment in the joined cases of Mayor and PERSON of the London Borough of GPE v. PERSON ; ORG v. Hall ; ORG v.
