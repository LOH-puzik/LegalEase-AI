The second applicant is living in Meneou and the third , fourth and fifth applicants are living in Paralimni . The first and sixth applicants have dual NORP and NORP nationality and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants brought their application on their own behalf and on behalf of PERSON , a NORP national of NORP origin who was born in DATE and died on DATE . The first , second , third , fourth and fifth applicants are the children of PERSON , and the sixth applicant is his grandson .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was born and raised in the village of GPE in the NORP peninsula , district of GPE , in northern GPE . He worked there as a farmer and owned a house with some land .", "CARDINAL . Following the NORP intervention of DATE , PERSON remained in GPE as one of the \u201c enclaved \u201d , that is , a small remaining group of NORP residents of the NORP peninsula who continue to live there under NORP occupation . In DATE he gave evidence to the delegation of ORG in the course of the GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) proceedings at a hearing held at FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was found dead in his house in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a post - mortem examination was carried out by Dr Horoz , a general practitioner authorised by the local authorities . He concluded that PERSON had died of a myocardial infection . Consequently , a press statement was issued by ORG of GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) confirming the findings of this report . A medical officer from ORG in GPE ( ORG ) was present at the post - mortem examination . He also prepared a brief report , without referring to the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . The applicants allege that they were unable to bury the deceased in his home village because of restrictions on freedom of worship and repeated vandalism of NORP graves . Thus they arranged for him to be buried in the southern part of GPE . They allege that the body was handed over to them in a particularly distressing and disrespectful manner and that the NORP authorities showed a total lack of regard for the grieving family . In particular , they state that when it was delivered to them , the deceased \u2019s body was partially covered in an old sheet and was not in a temporary coffin or body bag . Further , the sixth applicant , the grandson of the deceased , was refused permission to accompany the first , second and third applicants ( that is , his father and CARDINAL uncles ) to GPE village on DATE for a brief visit to retrieve the clothes of PERSON and other things necessary for the funeral and burial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a second post - mortem examination was conducted in ORG in GPE by CARDINAL specialists , PERSON and PERSON ( one appointed by the family of PERSON and one by ORG ) , in the presence of ORG observers . A video and photographs were taken during the autopsy . The conclusions of these examinations were that there was \u201c no evidence of coronary artery thrombosis , myocardial infarction or significant previous ischemic episodes \u201d and that the cause of death was \u201c severe trauma in the cervical vertebra due to the application of excessive force \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the Attorney General of GPE , the reports of both post - mortem examinations were reviewed by Professor PERSON , State Forensic Pathologist at ORG at ORG . He agreed with the conclusions of the second post - mortem report and criticised the first as not living up to international standards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the file was referred to the \u201c TRNC \u201d Attorney - General , who recommended a coroner \u2019s inquest . The coroner examined the file and came to the conclusion that the deceased had died a natural death due to myocardial infarction and that there was no indication that he had been the victim of an act of violence . In view of the above , the coroner decided that it was not necessary to carry out an inquest .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG , the Government produced a report from Dr PERSON Cassidy , Deputy State Pathologist and Senior Lecturer at ORG . At the request of the ORG , PERSON examined various documents , scientific reports , videos and photographs concerning the death of PERSON . She also interviewed all persons who could give information about the case , including the members of the deceased \u2019s family .", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Dr PERSON \u2019s report read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Summary", "CARDINAL Mr PERSON was an elderly NORP , residing alone in the NORP region .", "CARDINAL He was receiving treatment for heart disease and had been hospitalised for a \u201c heart attack \u201d and for treatment of an arrhythmia .", "CARDINAL He was at his neighbour \u2019s home on TIME CARDINAL and was said to have been seen and spoken to early on DATE .", "CARDINAL NORP In the mid DATE TIME PERSON was found dead lying on the floor of his bedroom .", "CARDINAL NORP He was fully clothed , including jacket , apart from his shoes . He was lying face down and on his right side . There was a pool of fluid and blood at his head . There were a few injuries on the right side of head .", "CARDINAL His body was removed to the local hospital and a post - mortem examination was carried out on DATE . This was limited to removal of the cerebral hemispheres , the lungs and the heart . The latter only was dissected .", "CARDINAL ORG examination showed bruising around both eyes and CARDINAL injuries to the right side of the head . Post mortem staining was noted over the back and multiple \u201c bruises \u201d over the upper chest .", "CARDINAL NORP An area of discoloration on the heart was interpreted as an infarct , and the cause of death was determined as due to a heart attack .", "CARDINAL NORP The body was transported to the NORP region and a second post - mortem examination was carried out .", "CARDINAL NORP This described additional injuries including superficial flapped injury to the left side of the scalp , marks on the cheeks and lips as well as minor injuries on the hands . PERSON haemorrhage was noted in the eyes .", "CARDINAL NORP Internally the most significant finding was of bruising in the soft tissues of the neck and a fracture of the spine .", "CARDINAL These injuries were interpreted as indicating an assault , death being due to a broken neck , caused in an arm lock , which was thought to have caused asphyxia . Other explanations were dismissed .", "CARDINAL The photographs of the scene and the body pre - autopsy , after the first autopsy and during the second autopsy were taken .", "CARDINAL The body is seen fully clothed , apart from shoes lying on his right side , face down on a stone floor . A few minor injuries were noted on the right side of the head and there was fluid and blood under the head apparently from the injuries .", "CARDINAL ORG after the first post mortem confirm the paucity of injuries .", "CARDINAL ORG of the second post mortem now show well developed bruising of the eyes and petechiae are now prominent around the eyes , the neck and over the upper chest . A post mortem injury is now apparent on the left side of the scalp and some other indistinct marks are shown . There was definite bruising under the injuries on the right side of the scalp but no skull or brain injury .", "CARDINAL NORP Internally a fracture of the cervical vertebra is demonstrated .", "CARDINAL . Interpretation", "CARDINAL NORP This elderly man was found dead in his home .", "CARDINAL LOC position of the body at the scene is consistent with slumping forward onto the ground from a sitting position on the bed , no attempt being made to save himself , as determined by the position of the hands .", "CARDINAL The injuries apparent were to the right side of face and head , consistent with impact with the stone ground .", "CARDINAL NORP Despite lying in this position after death , when the body is examined later , at the second post - mortem , lividity is on the back of the body , therefore he had not been lying long after death . This would be consistent with him dying on DATE TIME and therefore he could have been seen alive at TIME .", "CARDINAL NORP The position of the body also suggests sudden collapse .", "CARDINAL LOC haemorrhage are seen around the eyes , on the face , neck and upper chest . The presence of petechial haemorrhages indicates hypoxia / asphyxia , and obvious causes of mechanical asphyxia must be excluded , particularly strangulation . However , petechial haemorrhage around the eyes are commonly seen in deaths from natural causes , particularly if due to heart disease which causes hypoxia . ORG / purpuric haemorrhage are also commonly found within areas of post - mortem lividity and as Mr PERSON was found lying \u201c face down \u201d this is CARDINAL possibility which must be considered .", "The pattern of distribution of the haemorrhage may give some indication of their cause . In strangulation the haemorrhages are above the level of compression of the neck .", "As the distribution of the haemorrhages continues below the neck , a cause other than compression of the neck must be considered .", "In cases of suspected neck compression , the neck is always examined last , first draining the area of blood by opening and removing the organs from the cranial and chest and abdominal cavities . This is done as artefactual haemorrhages can be produced in the neck area during manipulation and dissection of the neck organs . Therefore the interpretation of bruising in the anterior compartment of the neck , on the surface of the strap muscles , is fraught with potential difficulties . A post - mortem examination had been performed , the blood vessels in that area are seen to be congested , the neck was said to have been manipulated before the second post mortem and at the second post mortem the neck was dissected with the chest organs in situ . In view of this the bruising can not be unequivocally attributed to pre - mortem compression of the neck .", "CARDINAL NORP The injuries to the face are concentrated on the right side , as illustrated in photograph CARDINAL . This was the side of the face in contact with the ground , and therefore all of these injuries could be caused by CARDINAL impact with the ground . The soft tissues of the face were not dissected and therefore the other injuries described were not proven to be associated with subcutaneous bruising .", "The pattern of bruising under the eye is of bruising related to the injury below the outer corner , which is an abrasion injury , more likely due to contact with the ground rather than a punch .", "While one can never totally exclude that each and every injury is due to a separate impact , the pattern of injuries is the key factor .", "CARDINAL One positive finding was fracture of the first cervical vertebra . There was haemorrhage over the front of the upper cervical spine indicating bleeding from this injury . Bodies can bruise and bleed after death , while the blood is still fluid within the vessels . This injury can therefore be interpreted as a pre or peri - mortem injury . This type of injury is due to compression of the head on the neck splitting the vertebra , + /- hyperextension . The mechanism of causation is a force transmitted through the head to the neck .", "It is unlikely to be caused by a force from the front of the neck as such a force would be expected to be associated with more severe injury to the structures at the front of the neck .", "If such an injury was the cause of death , damage to the upper cervical cord / brain stem would be expected . Firstly this area was damaged during the first post - mortem . Secondly there is no evidence of bleeding around the site in the photographs and no demonstrable damage . Microscopy may show haemorrhage into the tissue , which must be differentiated from congested vessels which can be misinterpreted as petechial haemorrhage . There is no evidence that the spine fracture had caused damage to the spinal cord nor that it caused his death .", "QUANTITY The injuries to the hands are minor injuries , described as , and with the appearance in the photographs of , abrasions and lacerations . There are quite different injuries to those on the head area . These injuries are caused by contact with something rough or sharp , and while from their position they could be interpreted as defence injuries , as they are different and caused in a different manner from other injuries , they are not defence injuries caused by attempting to ward off blows of his head . CARDINAL explanation is that these injuries could be inflicted by handling branches with rough or sharp edges .", "CARDINAL Examination of the heart was incomplete at both post - mortems . Weighing the heart would have given an indication as to whether or not the heart was enlarged . However Mr GPE had a well documented history of heart problems including arithymia and cardiac failure , and was prescribed treatment for this .", "Whether or not he was taking his medication , he was still at risk from collapsing and dying from his heart disease , despite no obstruction of the vessels being found at the second post - mortem .", "Again the post - mortem findings must be interpreted in light of his medical history . Again histological examination of the tissues may show myocyte damage and fibrosis not obvious with the naked eye . In particular the area of discoloration described at the first post - mortem could have been proved or disproved as an infarct . The lack of acute findings in the heart does not negate the conclusion that death was due to heart disease .", "CARDINAL Although he may have collapsed suddenly , PERSON may not have died instantly and may have survived unconscious for TIME .", "CARDINAL . Summary", "After examination of the statements , reports , photographs and post - mortem reports I am of the opinion that PERSON appears to have been sitting on the edge of his bed when he suddenly keeled over , with a \u201c heart attack \u201d , falling heavily to the floor , the impact site , to the head and right side of the face . The force from the impact was transmitted across the head to the top of the spine , crushing and splitting the first cervical vertebra . He appears to have made no attempt to save himself as implied by the position of the hands and arms , suggesting that he was either dead or unconscious when he pitched forward to the ground . The injuries to the hands could have occurred separately during the course of his work . Death appears to be due to natural causes . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
