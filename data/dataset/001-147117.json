These requests were rejected because her sponsor ( referent ) was insufficiently solvent , had failed to sign the required affidavit of support ( garantverklaring ) or had failed to supply sufficient information required for the assessment of the visa request . The applicant did not challenge any of these rejections in administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a sixth visa request for the purpose of visiting a relative .

This request was rejected because the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) .

The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure in the form of an injunction on her removal pending the determination of her appeal were rejected on DATE by the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . In its relevant part , this ruling reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL It is not in dispute that the appellant does not hold a valid provisional residence visa and that she is not eligible for an exemption from the requirement to hold such a visa under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) or section QUANTITY of LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit DATE ) . It is only in dispute whether reason dictates that the defendant should exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on the basis of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW [ for reasons of exceptional hardship ( onbillijkheid van overwegende ORG ) ] .", "CARDINAL NORP ORG finds that the defendant could reasonably conclude that in the present case there are no special and individual circumstances on the basis of which insistence on compliance with the visa requirement would entail exceptional hardship . ...", "CARDINAL NORP The appellant \u2019s reliance on LAW fails . There is family life between the appellant and her husband and her minor children , but the defendant \u2019s refusal to exempt her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa does not constitute an interference with the right to respect for family life as the defendant \u2019s decision did not deprive her of a residence permit enabling her to enjoy her family life in the GPE .", "CARDINAL It does not appear that there is a positive obligation for GPE under LAW to exempt the applicant , contrary to the policy pursued in this area , from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa . It is of importance at the outset that there has been no appearance of any objective obstacle to the enjoyment of family life outside the GPE . Taking into account the young age of the appellant \u2019s children , it can also reasonably be expected that they would follow the appellant to GPE for the duration of the proceedings relating to the provisional residence visa . This is not altered by the fact that both children are GPE nationals . The fact that the appellant \u2019s husband is currently being detained gives no cause for finding that ... there is an objective obstacle .", "CARDINAL The appellant has cited the judgments of ORG in the cases of PERSON [ and PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ] , PERSON [ v. the GPE ( striking out ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ] and PERSON [ v. the GPE ( striking out ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ] . This can not succeed , for the following reasons . The case of PERSON did not concern a temporary separation in connection with maintaining the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa , so the case can not be said to be comparable . In the cases of PERSON and PERSON ORG found that the reasons for lodging the complaints had been removed , because a residence permit had been granted to the complainants in those cases . For that reason , their complaints were not considered further . ORG fails to see in what manner ORG findings in those CARDINAL cases could be of relevance to the appellant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL The appellant has further invoked LAW . In so far as the provisions invoked entail a directly applicable norm , they have no further implications beyond the fact that in proceedings such as those at hand , the interests of the children concerned must be taken into account . In the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the situation of the appellant \u2019s CARDINAL minor children was explicitly taken into account in the assessment . As the provisions invoked do not contain a norm as regards the weight that must be given in a concrete case to the interests of a child , there is no ground for finding that those provisions have been violated .", "CARDINAL NORP ORG will declare the appeal unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon his return to the GPE from a trip to GPE for the funeral of his foster mother , the applicant \u2019s husband had been found to have swallowed cocaine pellets . He was placed in pre - trial detention . On DATE , a single - judge chamber ( politierechter ) of ORG convicted him of offences under LAW ( PERSON ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On the basis of this conviction , ORG ( ORG ) included his name on a blacklist provided to airline companies operating direct flights between the GPE and GPE , the former GPE , GPE and GPE . His name was to remain on the list for DATE , the aim being to prevent him from reoffending . On DATE , after having served his sentence , the applicant \u2019s husband was released from prison . His name was removed from the airline blacklist on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE to ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON ) against the judgment of DATE of the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The Hague was dismissed on DATE . ORG found that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling ( kan niet tot vernietiging PERSON aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) . Having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant filed a fifth request on DATE for a residence permit with the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) for the purpose of stay with a child , arguing that she should be exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on grounds of special and individual circumstances .", "CARDINAL . This request was rejected on CARDINAL DATE by the Minister , who held that there was no reason to exempt the applicant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa and that the refusal of a residence permit was not contrary to LAW . While accepting that there was family life within the meaning of LAW between the applicant , her husband and their children , the Minister found that there was no interference with the right to respect for family life as the refusal to grant the applicant \u2019s request for exemption did not deprive her of a residence permit which enabled her to exercise her family life in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW entailed a positive obligation for the GPE to grant her a residence permit , the Minister found that the interests of GPE in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicant \u2019s personal interest in exercising her right to family life in the GPE . In balancing these competing interests , the Minister took into account the following : already in GPE and before her arrival in the GPE the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse ; she had entered the GPE without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules ; and she had created her family in the GPE without holding a residence permit . When it transpired in the course of the proceedings that the applicant was pregnant , the Minister further held that it had not been established , nor did it appear that the applicant would be unable DATE should hospitalisation be necessary DATE to give birth in a hospital in GPE or that there would be any insurmountable objective obstacles to the exercise of family life in GPE . On this point , the Minister noted that NORP was spoken in GPE and that the transition would not therefore be particularly difficult for the applicant \u2019s children , who could continue their education in GPE in a normal manner .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister added that the mere fact that the applicant \u2019s spouse and children were GPE nationals did not entail an automatic obligation for the GPE authorities to grant the applicant a residence permit , or lead to the conclusion that the exercise of family life would only be possible in the GPE . The GPE authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant \u2019s personal choice to come to , settle and create a family in the GPE without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence . In the balancing exercise , the Minister attributed decisive weight to the fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the GPE and that there was no indication whatsoever that it would be impossible to exercise family life in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister further rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that she ought to be exempted from the visa requirement , on the basis that inter alia the length of the applicant \u2019s stay in the GPE was a consequence of her personal choice to continue to remain there . She had met with several refusals of her applications for a GPE residence permit but had nevertheless opted each time to file a fresh request , thus accepting the risk that , at some point in time , she would have to leave the GPE , at least , temporarily . The Minister further considered that the applicant had been born and raised in GPE where she had resided most of her life and , given her age , she should be regarded as capable of returning to and fending for herself in GPE , if need be with financial and/or material support from the GPE , pending the determination of an application for a provisional residence visa to be filed by her in GPE . The Minister concluded on this point that the case disclosed no circumstances warranting a finding that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted exceptional hardship within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection against this decision with the Minister . She filed additional grounds for her objection and furnished further information by letters of CARDINAL and DATE May and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested ORG of The GPE to issue a provisional measure ( injunction on expulsion pending the outcome of the objection proceedings ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a court hearing held on DATE and having regard to pending proceedings taken by the applicant seeking deferral of her removal under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE rejected the request for a provisional measure on the basis that it was moot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE . An appeal by the applicant against that decision was rejected on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . In so far as relevant , its judgment reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It must be examined whether the defendant could have refused to exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa , as required under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , on the ground that removal is not contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . It is not in dispute between the parties that there is family life between the appellant and her husband and their CARDINAL minor children . Refusing the application [ for a residence permit ] does not constitute interference within the meaning of LAW . No residence permit which actually enabled the appellant to enjoy family life in the GPE has been taken away from her . The subsequent question arises whether there exist such facts and circumstances that the right to respect for family life may be said to entail a positive obligation for the defendant to allow the applicant to reside [ in the GPE ] . In making this assessment , a \u2018 fair balance\u2019 must be found between , on the one hand , the interests of the alien concerned in enjoying family life in the GPE and , on the other , the general interest of ORG in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy . In this balancing exercise , the defendant has a certain margin of appreciation .", "CARDINAL . It was reasonable for the defendant to attach more weight to the general interest of GPE than to the personal interests of the appellant and her family members . The defendant did not have to accept an obligation to grant the appellant residence in the GPE on the basis of LAW . In this balancing exercise , the defendant was entitled to weigh heavily to the appellant \u2019s disadvantage the fact that she had started family life in the GPE when she had not been granted a residence permit for this purpose , and that she had further intensified her family life despite the refusal of her requests for residence . This is not altered by the fact that for a certain period the appellant was lawfully resident while awaiting the outcome of proceedings concerning a request for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The defendant was entitled to take the position that the consequences of the appellant \u2019s choices were at her own risk . According to the case - law of ORG ( PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE [ no . MONEY , ORG CARDINALI ] ) , where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted , removal will lead to a violation of LAW only in the most exceptional circumstances . The appellant has not established that , as regards her and her family , there are such exceptional circumstances . Her reliance on the judgments in PERSON and PERSON and GPE v. GPE ( no . MONEY , DATE ) fails , as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of PERSON and PERSON . In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin . With the removal of the mother , contact with the children would become impossible . However , in the appellant \u2019s case , it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there . The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering GPE . The consequence of her husband \u2019s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the GPE to GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE during the period DATE and DATE . This does not mean that it is self - evident that the husband will not be admitted to GPE . The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to GPE in another manner . In addition , it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . No other circumstances have appeared on the basis of which the existence of an objective obstacle to continued family life in GPE must be accepted . There is also no question of excessive formalism . The appellant \u2019s situation is not comparable to the one in the case of PERSON . The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise . The children were all born in the GPE and hold GPE nationality . At the time the impugned decision was taken , they were respectively CARDINAL , DATE . The children have always lived in the GPE . Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the GPE , the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in GPE . In this connection it is also relevant that NORP is spoken in GPE and that both parents hail from GPE .", "CARDINAL . This is not altered by the fact that the appellant \u2019s husband and children hold GPE nationality and , on the basis of LAW on the Functioning of ORG ( hereinafter \u2018 TFEU\u2019 ) , can derive rights from their ORG citizenship . It can be deduced from the considerations of ORG of ORG ( hereinafter \u2018 ECJ\u2019 ) in the Dereci et al . judgment of DATE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in which a further explanation is given of the PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , that in answering the question whether a citizen of the ORG who enjoys family life with a third - country national will be denied the right to reside in GPE territory flowing directly from LAW , only a limited importance is given to the right to respect for family life . As follows from DATE and CARDINAL of the ORG judgment , this right is not , as such , protected by LAW but by other international , ORG and domestic rules and regulations , such as LAW , ORG and LAW . In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the GPE or ORG is , inter alia , also of limited importance .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The situation of an ORG citizen being denied the right to reside in GPE territory arises only when the GPE citizen is so dependent on the third - country national that , as a consequence of the decision by the defendant , he has no other choice than to stay with that national outside GPE territory . In the appellant \u2019s case , that has not occurred . The appellant \u2019s children can be cared for by their father . The father also has GPE nationality . The appellant \u2019s husband and children are not obliged or actually compelled to go with her to GPE in connection with the application for a provisional residence visa . Their rights as ORG citizens are thus not breached .", "CARDINAL . It was reasonable for the defendant to take the view that there was no appearance of very special individual circumstances leading to undue hardship . The proceedings concerning the appellant \u2019s previous requests for a residence permit and the course of events during her placement in GPE detention for removal purposes can not be regarded as such . The lawfulness of the decisions taken in those proceedings can not be examined in the present appeal proceedings . The appellant has further not substantiated her claim that , when she submitted her first request for a residence permit , she complied with all the requirements and that she should then have been granted a residence permit . ... \u201d", "ORG went on to find that the applicant had not substantiated her alleged medical problems or why these problems should lead to exempting her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa . The court further found that the applicant had not demonstrated her claim that , apart from the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa , she met all requirements for the issuance of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a further appeal with ORG . No further information about the proceedings on this latest request for a residence permit has been submitted by the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the NORP police ordered the applicant to report to them on DATE so that she could be served with notice to leave the country within DATE . This order was withdrawn owing to the applicant \u2019s third request for a residence permit filed on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed by the NORP police that \u2013 as the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) did not have suspensive effect \u2013 they would proceed with the applicant \u2019s removal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having failed to respond to a summons of DATE to report to the NORP police , the applicant was placed in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for removal purposes in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW . She was taken to the GPE detention centre where she was found to be pregnant , her due date being DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL successive release requests were rejected by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE on DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively . In each decision , ORG found that there were sufficient prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time frame and that the GPE authorities were pursuing the applicant \u2019s removal with sufficient diligence . In its rulings , ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments that her pregnancy rendered her detention contrary to LAW and that , against that background , her conditions of detention were incompatible with that provision . In this context , in a letter of QUANTITY DATE and addressed to the applicant \u2019s lawyer who submitted it in the proceedings to ORG , the GPE section of ORG expressed its concern about the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention . Although aware that the applicant had failed to respect the duty to report imposed on her , ORG considered that a less severe measure than deprivation of liberty would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of her placement in GPE detention , the applicant , on DATE , DATE and DATE , also filed complaints about her conditions of detention with the competent ORG ( GPE PERSON ) of the CARDINAL detention centres where she was held . These complaints were decided in CARDINAL decisions given on CARDINAL and DATE , respectively . Apart from the applicant \u2019s complaint of CARDINAL DATE that she had been required to wear restraints during transports to hospital , which was accepted as well - founded in the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s complaints were dismissed . On DATE ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( PERSON GPE ) gave final decisions on the applicant \u2019s appeals against the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE .
