In addition , the judgment of ORG delivered on DATE is relevant to the present case . In that judgment , the aforementioned court rejected a claim under LAW concerning damage allegedly sustained due to inadequate living conditions in Dob Prison . The claim was lodged by a prisoner who was held in FAC in a cell of QUANTITY together with CARDINAL inmates . The court , which also heard a number of witnesses from the prison , found as established that the claimant , apart from his cell and the lavatories , also had access to the TV room and hallway during DATE , TIME It also found that chairs and tables were situated in the hallway and that CARDINAL of the prison population was working TIME a day , which reduced the number of those who stayed in the cells during that time . The court acknowledged that the situation as regards overcrowding ( number of inmates held in the cells ) was in breach of the domestic regulation providing that CARDINAL prisoners should be held in one cell , and found that the ORG , by virtue of paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW , would be responsible to prisoners for any damage sustained on that account . However , the court , referring to , inter alia , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , concluded that the situation , though difficult , was not such as to violate the claimant \u2019s personal rights . No legally recognized damage had therefore been sustained by the claimant . The court also assessed the claimant \u2019s allegations concerning sanitary conditions , access to the telephone , nutrition and cohabitation with persons affected by transmissible diseases . These aspects of the prison \u2019s conditions were found not to be in breach of the law .", "ORG upheld the above judgment on DATE . It found that the claimant \u2019s claim contained allegations of torture and breach of one \u2019s right to dignity . It endorsed the lower court \u2019s legal qualification and factual findings . ORG also referred to the ORG \u2019s report of DATE , which , in its opinion , did not point to serious violations . Acknowledging that the situation was not perfect and could cause discomfort to the claimant , ORG concluded that , in the aggregate , the conditions did not amount to undignified treatment or torture .", "The relevant extracts from the general reports by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) are set out in Mandi\u0107 and PERSON , cited above , LAW DATE .", "The ORG visited PERSON in DATE . In DATE the number of prisoners held in FAC was significantly lower than it currently is . CARDINAL prisoners were held in the closed section of FAC ( see document ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) . After the visit in DATE , the following recommendations were made to the NORP authorities ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c i. Dob Prison", "CARDINAL . NORP ... The ORG recommends that efforts be made to reduce the occupancy rate of the CARDINAL ORG dormitories , having regard to the new minimum standards for prison accommodation . Further , the ORG wishes to reiterate that smaller accommodation units for prisoner[s ] are far preferable to large units such as the CARDINAL ORG dormitories seen in FAC .", "... \u201d", "In the chapter concerning the living conditions in NORP prisons , Annual Reports by ORG Sentences include information on prison overcrowding . The rate of overcrowding is calculated on the basis of the domestic statutory requirement for the imprisonment of sentenced individuals , which is QUANTITY for a single - occupancy cell and QUANTITY per person in a shared cell . According to the DATE and DATE reports , nationwide prison occupancy exceeded the official capacity by CARDINAL and PERCENT respectively . Almost all closed prison facilities accommodating male prisoners were overcrowded . PERSON , with an official capacity of CARDINAL prisoners , held on average CARDINAL and CARDINAL prisoners in DATE and DATE respectively . This meant that the level of overcrowding was CARDINAL and PERCENT respectively ( DATE Report , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; DATE Report , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . According to ORG , the level of overcrowding in DATE and DATE was CARDINAL and CARDINAL percent respectively ( p. CARDINAL ) . The DATE Report also noted ( p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... Poor living conditions are coupled with overcrowding , which is most present in the large prisons in GPE : Dob , GPE and GPE prisons . The urgency of improving living conditions has been stressed by ORG , the ORG and other institutions .", "... It is understandable that such living conditions adversely affect ORG hygiene and privacy . Poor living conditions sometimes also obstruct the exercise of ORG rights ( work , exercise and recreation , [ attending ] religious services ) . In some establishments , prisoners on remand live in worse conditions than sentenced prisoners . The outdated and inadequate furniture in living rooms and other areas presents an additional problem ... \u201d", "On DATE the Ombudsman for Human Rights conducted a visit to Dob Prison under LAW to LAW and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and issued a report , which , as far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ... the official capacity is still CARDINAL prisoners , including CARDINAL prisoners in the closed section , CARDINAL prisoners in the semi - open section and CARDINAL prisoners in the open section . At the time of our visit , the establishment held CARDINAL prisoners , including CARDINAL in the closed section , which is CARDINAL beyond the official capacity . The prison administration has stressed that it has previously been faced with an even higher occupancy rate . During a certain period in DATE , the prison held CARDINAL prisoners ...", "We found that since our last visit the overcrowding has only intensified . This raises concerns . The prison administration has agreed with this finding and stressed that it is of particular concern that the overcrowding can not be reduced by placing prisoners in other establishments , as the number of prisoners is rising everywhere . On the other hand , we welcome the fact that preparatory work on the renovation and expansion of the prison has finally started . The capacity of the prison should be increased to CARDINAL beds and the inmates should be accommodated in single or CARDINAL - bed cells . Large multi - occupancy cells should be abandoned . The office [ of ORG ] expects and hopes that the progress of the renovation of the prison will lead to an improvement in the living conditions therein .", "We have again stressed that in most cases the furniture in the rooms was outdated and urgent repairs and replacements were therefore needed", "The closed section had sufficient outside areas at the time of the visit ...", "According to the prison administration , illegal drugs present a serious problem . CARDINAL of the prisoners are addicted to drugs or alcohol ... The prison administration further explained that the operation of the drug - free section , [ CARDINAL of ] which was located in every block ( except ORG ) , was also restricted due to the fact that there was only one therapist responsible for the programme ... \u201d", "In its DATE report , ORG noted :", "\u201c In the closed section of Dob Prison there are still CARDINAL single cells and only a few cells with CARDINAL beds available . Large multi - occupancy cells are [ the norm ] , in particular those measuring QUANTITY and accommodating CARDINAL prisoners . Each inmate has QUANTITY of personal space , which falls short of the standard of QUANTITY .... It is true that this standard was intended for new facilities or renovations , where possible . However , DATE have already passed since the adoption of the Regulation on the Execution of Prison Sentences [ providing the aforementioned standard ] , there should be a commitment that this standard is also complied with in the largest prison in the country . Likewise , one can not ignore section CARDINAL of ORG , which states that inmates should in principle be accommodated in a single cell , and that shared cells should have CARDINAL beds at most . The prison conditions in which the prisoners live are therefore unacceptable and in breach of the law .", "The shared cell with CARDINAL beds has CARDINAL lavatory .... During the TIME rush , this ( the facilities in the lavatory ) is insufficient for the number of inmates whom it is intended to serve . The number of inmates simultaneously using the lavatory is also restricted by its size . [ The ombudsman \u2019s office ] was therefore not surprised to hear complaints that inmates had to wait TIME to use the shower and TIME to use the toilet , which we believe is also inhumane . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
