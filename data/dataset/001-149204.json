The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a professor and the head of ORG and Venereal Diseases of ORG ( hereafter \u201c ORG ) , which is a ORG university . The applicant had been elected to the position of head of department with effect until CARDINAL DATE . He was also an elected member of the constituent assembly of ORG sapulce ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to merge ORG and Venereal Diseases and ORG . That decision was approved by the ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) on the following day . It appears that as a result of the merger the position of head of department occupied by the applicant was abolished . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant received a warning ( br\u012bdin\u0101jums ) to that effect and was given the opportunity to agree to the changes in his contract with ORG . He was also informed that if he refused , his employment relationship with the University would be terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent various emails to the Rector of the University concerning the circumstances of the reorganisation and the abolition of his department . He criticised the decisions taken by the deputy dean , PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent another email to the Rector of the University and to several other recipients , including the members of the ORG . The email criticised the lack of democracy and accountability in the leadership of the organisation , which , according to the applicant , stemmed from the fact that all the members of the ORG were also a part of the executive authority of the ORG and there was thus an inadequate system of checks and balances . He also drew the recipients\u2019 attention to the alleged mismanagement of the GPE \u2019s finances . In support of this allegation the applicant relied on the conclusions adopted by ORG ( ORG ) in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further spoke in unfavourable terms about several representatives of the management of ORG , stating , for example , that [ Mr ... ] . \u201c pretends to be a God - fearing NORP ... yet , as far as is known , has several children born out of wedlock \u201d , that [ Mr ... ] \u201c can not decide a single question by himself , does not keep his word , is lying \u201d and that [ Mrs ... ] \u201c has called me and asked me to break the law in the interests of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant came up with a proposal involving several amendments to the constitution of the University , such as changes in the election of the members of the ORG ( an obligation to inform the constituent assembly of the candidate \u2019s CV at least one week before the elections , the setting - up of an independent electoral commission ) ; separation of powers between the ORG \u2019s governing bodies ( ORG members should not be part of the executive body of the University ) ; and the granting of independence to the ORG ( changing the remuneration system so that the Rector did not unilaterally fix the remuneration of members of the ORG ) . He asked the Rector to forward his proposals to the members of the constituent assembly and to send him the email addresses of those members or inform him where to find those contacts .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE the applicant expressed his disagreement with the reorganisation at the meeting of the ORG of the university which upheld the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent an email to the Rector of the University . The subject - line of the email read \u201c Settlement agreement \u201d . The text of the email read as follows :", "\u201c To the Rector of ORG Confidential", "[ CARDINAL ] Dear Rector ,", "[ CARDINAL ] In view of the situation which has evolved and the advice of my lawyers and supporters , I hereby propose the following settlement agreement .", "[ CARDINAL ] It would entail :", "[ CARDINAL ] Version CARDINAL", "[ CARDINAL ] You ( the University ) revoke all the orders and decisions of the ORG concerning the abolition / merger of ORG and Venereal Diseases . I for my part withdraw all my appeals , thereby restoring the situation as it was before the decision of the ORG of CARDINAL DATE . Meanwhile the CARDINAL lecturers ... ( all of them were recognised as plagiarists by a decision of the [ NORP association of doctors ] ) who expressed their intention to move to ORG , are transferred to that ORG . I have no objections if the specialist ... who , it is common knowledge , is the mother of ... \u2019s daughter , is transferred to another post or fired . DATE she did not spend DATE at work in ORG and Venereal Diseases ( presumably she reports to ... or has been transferred to ... or another department , or maybe [ she has ] submitted her resignation , I do n\u2019t know ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] Version CARDINAL . I , as a head of department elected until DATE , and after having received a certain amount of compensation on which we would agree ( for example , ORG CARDINAL ) , as provided for by my agreement with the ORG , agree terms with you , the dispute is terminated and I leave the post .", "[ CARDINAL ] Of course I understand that at the constituent assembly of the ORG you , as Rector , can secure a decision that is favourable to you . However by this means nothing would come to an end but would only start , as I reserve the right to appeal against all the decision [ adopted by ] ORG in the administrative , district and regional courts , while of course making everything public beforehand and attracting the attention of society .", "[ CARDINAL ] I do not believe that in DATE , taking into consideration the latest news ( the conclusion adopted by ORG on the illegalities at the ORG , plagiarism on the part of lecturers and professors of the GPE etc . ) , you would want to have additional tasks and trouble ( nodarbo\u0161anos un nepatik\u0161anas ) .", "[ CARDINAL ] I am sure that I do n\u2019t want this and I wish to be allowed to work in a creative manner with students in my field as before . In addition , I have much work to do organising CARDINAL large NORP congresses in DATE and DATE in GPE , in both of which my participation as president has been confirmed .", "[ CARDINAL ] Since I have also not received the list of members of the constituent assembly of ORG ( which was requested from you and the ORG in my letter of DATE ! ? , a fact which demonstrates the lack of democracy [ at ] ORG ) , I will await a reply from you by DATE , DATE at TIME If we are unable to reach agreement by signing a settlement agreement I will make all my current information public in the form of an open letter so that the members of the constituent assembly of the University also have DATE before the meeting to think about their vote .", "Professor PERSON", "P.S. [ contains a request concerning one of the applicant \u2019s staff members who was on sick leave but at the same time attended meetings of the ORG ] .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Rector replied to the applicant that he could not agree to any of the proposals .", "CARDINAL . The following day , DATE , at the meeting of the constituent assembly of the University , the applicant expressed his disagreement with the reorganisation and asked that the decision concerning the merger of faculties be annulled . His request was not upheld . On DATE the national news agency ORG published the applicant \u2019s views about the alleged shortcomings in the management of ORG . The criticisms referred to the conclusions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the Rector asked an ad hoc investigative committee and the ethics committee to review the applicant \u2019s conduct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a notice of termination of employment ( uzteikums ) from the University , in which he was informed that his employment contract with the ORG would be terminated DATE after receipt of the notice . The legal basis for the applicant \u2019s dismissal was section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , and the applicant was deemed to have acted in contravention of several provisions of the ORG \u2019s staff regulations ( see Relevant domestic law part , DATE below ) . The notice stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The ground for dismissal is the email you sent to the Rector of [ the University ] on DATE , in which , while addressing the Rector concerning issues of interest to you , you included inappropriate demands , including elements of blackmail and undisguised threats . As a consequence your actions are considered as very grave infringements of basic ethical principles and standards of behaviour , and as absolutely contrary to good morals . The fact of sending such a letter , and its contents , are clearly contrary to good morals , all the more so taking into account the circumstances in which the letter was sent and your attitude . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the University dismissed the applicant from his post . Soon afterwards he took up a post in another university in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a claim to ORG , asking the court to invalidate the notice of termination and to order his reinstatement and payment of the unpaid salary and benefits together with compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim in part . It held that the fact that the applicant \u2019s employer had been offended by his email was not a legitimate reason for his dismissal , since section CARDINAL of ORG did not include such a ground . The court considered that the allegation that the applicant \u2019s email had contained elements of blackmail and threats was merely speculation on his employer \u2019s behalf . It was additionally found that the applicant had not been given an adequate opportunity to respond to the allegations contained in the termination notice before that notice was sent to him . Accordingly the court annulled the termination notice and ordered the applicant \u2019s reinstatement with back - payment of his salary . The applicant \u2019s claim for compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage was rejected as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the ORG appealed . During the court hearing the applicant mentioned that he had requested that several illegalities be examined at the meeting of the constituent assembly of DATE . Counsel for the defendant stated that both the ad hoc investigative committees set up by the Rector had found that the content of the letter was to be perceived as blackmail and threats . He contended that the request to receive a certain amount in compensation and the deadline by which the reply had to be received all proved the breach of ethical norms . The defendant further alleged that several \u201c defamatory facts about the University \u201d had been published on DATE by ORG , and considered that the above activities therefore confirmed the threats made in the applicant \u2019s email .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim in full . The appeal court considered that in his email of DATE the applicant had invited the Rector to carry out \u201c unlawful actions \u201d , namely to annul a decision of the ORG of the University ( concerning the merger of CARDINAL departments within ORG ) . Such action was deemed to be \u201c unlawful \u201d because annulling decisions of the ORG of the ORG exceeded the Rector \u2019s authority . The court also considered that the applicant had requested \u201c unreasonably high compensation \u201d for the termination of his employment . These CARDINAL considerations led the appeal court to conclude that the applicant had failed to observe basic ethical principles such as honesty , collegiality and responsibility .", "CARDINAL . The conclusions of the appeal court echoed those reached by the ORG \u2019s ethics committee and by CARDINAL ad hoc investigative committees set up on DATE and DATE . In particular , the court observed in point CARDINAL that the committee had concluded that the infringements committed by the applicant were demonstrated by the fact that he had sent the email and had carried out \u201c other activities after the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ... including making unfounded statements , for example , about the abolition of the department , the circumstances of the reorganisation that had been directed against the applicant , and threats made by PERSON against the applicant . The email of DATE ... comprises statements , for example , about ... private life and religious convictions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further noted that it was apparent from the materials in the case file that on DATE the national news agency ORG had published the applicant \u2019s views about events in the ORG , in which he had criticised the leadership of the ORG , stating that a group of CARDINAL to fifteen persons had usurped all power and set up an authoritarian or even dictatorial regime . The court also referred to the content of the email the applicant had sent on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and came to the conclusion that he had contravened the obligation to treat the staff of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court turned next to the question of \u201c good morals \u201d and , after finding that this term had no precise legal definition , proceeded to conclude that it consisted of CARDINAL \u201c basic ethical principles \u201d : \u201c the principle of integrity and righteousness \u201d , \u201c the principle of responsibility \u201d and \u201c the principle of loyalty \u201d . It found that the applicant had acted in breach of these principles and that there was :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] ... no reason to conclude that the applicant had only intended to inform [ the Rector ] about [ his plan ] to exercise his democratic rights , [ that is ] , to submit complaints to the courts and to publish information in the media , while respecting the interests of society . The content of the letter [ of DATE ] attests to [ the applicant \u2019s ] wish to act for a selfish cause , namely to retain his position as a head of department , contrary to the ORG \u2019s decision on reorganisation , or to receive substantial financial compensation , regardless of [ the need to use ] the budget of [ the University ] in an economical and reasonable way in compliance with the goals of the [ University ] .", "[ The appeal court ] finds that there is no evidence that prior to the letter of DATE [ the University ] had obstructed the applicant \u2019s democratic rights to inform society and the competent institutions about the alleged violations in the [ University ] .", "Taking into account the aforementioned finding , [ that is ] , that the [ applicant \u2019s ] aim in writing the letter of DATE was selfish , the [ appeal court ] finds that the [ applicant ] sought to achieve a result beneficial to himself by trying to persuade [ the Rector ] to take unlawful steps . In view of the aforementioned considerations , this should be considered a threat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Turning to the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage , the appeal court cited section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see the Relevant domestic law part , paragraph CARDINAL below ) and disagreed that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had created \u201c unjustified consequences \u201d ( nepamatotas sekas ) or caused non - pecuniary damage simply because the applicant had expressed legitimate concerns about the reorganisation of ORG and about the way its financial resources were used . The court \u2019s reasoning in that regard read as follows :", "\u201c [ The appeal court ] , on the basis of experience and logic , finds that a calm and positive atmosphere and a respectful attitude among colleagues best contribute to achieving constructive dialogue .", "Having analysed the above - mentioned evidence , the [ appeal court ] considers that nothing prevented the applicant from expressing his opinion in a manner compatible with ethics and the staff regulations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law , disputing , inter alia , the appeal court \u2019s findings to the effect that , by sending CARDINAL confidential letter to CARDINAL recipient ( namely the Rector of ORG ) , in which he had raised points concerning the unjustified use of funds from the ORG budget , he had committed an infringement of work - related rules and ethics of such gravity as to justify his dismissal . The applicant also invoked in this connection that he had an obligation to inform the society about the unjustified use of funds , therefore the appellate court had erred in finding that the impugned email was unethical . The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law was rejected by the ORG of ORG in a preparatory meeting on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Rector of the ORG sought to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant for extortion . The criminal proceedings were instituted on DATE on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW ( extortion ) and the applicant was ordered not to leave his permanent residence for CARDINAL without the permission of the competent investigative authority . The criminal proceedings were discontinued on DATE for lack of corpus delicti . The decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings stated , inter alia , that according to the linguistic expert \u2019s conclusions the impugned email contained clearly expressed demands to pay a certain amount of money as well as undisguised threats to disclose disreputable information about [ the Rector ] prior to the meeting of the ORG . It also noted that the email demonstrated the applicant \u2019s wish to act selfishly , either in order to maintain his post or to receive a significant amount in compensation for the termination of his employment contract . However , as the Rector \u2019s attitude demonstrated that the threats were not perceived as real , the court ruled that the criminal proceedings should be terminated and that the Rector had the right to institute defamation proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
