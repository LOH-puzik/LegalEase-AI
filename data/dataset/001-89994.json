This was so because the spouse was entitled to remain in the flat in the capacity of a household member , pursuant to section CARDINALa ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , until the provider of the flat either gave him or her the same flat for use or provided him or her with other appropriate lodging .

ORG held that the exclusion of that option in respect of state - owned flats was unwarranted and thus amounted to constitutionally impermissible discrimination .
