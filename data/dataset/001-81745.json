{"ITEMID": "001-81745", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "MLT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "MINTOFF AND OTHERS v. MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON Bland are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first CARDINAL applicants live in GPE and the third applicant lives in GPE , GPE . They are represented before the Court by Dr PERSON and Dr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , GPE .", "The first applicant is a former leader of ORG and a former Prime Minister of GPE , and the second and third applicants are his children . They are joint owners of a residence in LOC in an undeveloped coastal area of GPE .", "In DATE the nationalist government , ordered the construction of a new power station . Consequently , it selected and legally expropriated a site in PERSON , QUANTITY from the applicants ' property .", "At the relevant time , the first applicant objected to the proposed power station on the ground that it would pollute his property and render it unusable . Unsuccessfully , he submitted to the authorities proposals for a number of alternative locations and suggestions as to how the power station could be constructed in order to minimise the damage to his property .", "In CARDINAL/CARDINAL the power station began operating . Due to the resulting noise and pollution the applicants had to leave their residence and move to their other house in GPE .", "The abandonment of the property meant that it became subject to a number of break - ins during which movables and furniture were stolen . Since then the first applicant has been unsuccessfully endeavouring to recover the possession of CARDINAL other properties , situated in GPE , which he had intended for storage purposes , and which had been in his possession for DATE but to which road access had been denied .", "On DATE the first applicant and his wife instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction , alleging a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention , in respect of their property in LOC .", "On DATE ORG found a violation of LAW to the LAW . Despite the fact that the property had not been formally expropriated and that therefore the claimants had not received compensation , they had been deprived of the enjoyment of their property to the extent that they could not use it as a residence due to the noise and toxic emissions , and there had therefore been a de facto expropriation . Moreover , the property had suffered a dramatic depreciation in value . The court considered that although the ORG had had the right to decide where and when to build the power station , which was undoubtedly in the public interest , it was essential that a fair balance be struck between the general interests of the community and individual rights and this could not be achieved if the claimants were made to suffer an excessive burden . ORG deferred the proceedings for further submissions in respect of an adequate remedy .", "Both parties appealed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . However , it did not determine the amount of compensation . It remitted the case to ORG , with a view to reaching a friendly settlement .", "A number of meetings were held over DATE but no agreement was reached between the parties , in particular because the planning authority failed to approve building permits for any of the sites which were suggested as replacements for the expropriated property . Numerous hearings took place , evidence was heard , various pleadings were made by the first applicant 's lawyers , who were replaced regularly , and various court - appointed technical architects , including additional architects as requested by the first applicant , submitted their evaluations . The parties drew up CARDINAL signed private deeds of agreement .", "On DATE , ORG declared the deeds of agreement between the parties null and void as they had not been done by means of a public deed as required by law and it went on to determine the issue of compensation . It emphasised , that his status as a former politician should neither create an advantage for nor prejudice the first applicant , whose rights had to be respected . It awarded him MONEY ( ORG \u2013 QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) , having taken into consideration the fact that the applicant and his wife had been suffering a continuous violation since DATE ( when the power station was built ) , the inconvenience caused to them , the fact that the first applicant , in using the property in the exercise of his duties as Prime Minister , had rendered it of historical interest , the agreements which the parties had attempted to reach and the fact that the property would remain in the applicant and his wife 's possession even though it was unfit for habitation and that its value had greatly diminished . However , it refused to consider the damage caused to movables kept in the property and other damage suffered by them ( see Part CARDINAL below ) as these were irrelevant , since this was a case concerning adequate compensation and not damages . It further rejected as unsubstantiated the first applicant 's submission that he had been offered a sum of over FAC ( CARDINAL ORG ) in compensation , an offer he had refused . It also held that the payments which had already been made to him in DATE and DATE amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) should be deducted from the sum awarded .", "Both parties appealed . The first applicant 's children ( the second and third applicants ) were granted leave to pursue the application in the first applicant 's late wife 's stead . In particular the applicants claimed that the remedy granted had not been adequate and that the sum awarded was too low . Particular reference was made to the first applicant 's prominent public position , the continuous breach they were suffering , the inconveniences suffered in relation to their other properties , the estimates of the property 's value , the failure to provide an alternative property , the fact that the amounts already paid had to be deducted , the offer of FAC ( CARDINAL ORG ) which they had received and that allegedly had not been taken into consideration by the court , and the length of the proceedings .", "They further alleged that during the appeal proceedings it had transpired that in similar proceedings , namely , PERSON vs. Commissioner of GPE , the valuation provided by the court - appointed architects was much in excess of that provided in the applicants ' case . However , it does not appear from ORG judgment that this argument was raised before it .", "On DATE ORG upheld the reasons given by the first - instance court and the consequent award of compensation . It affirmed that the applicants had the right to be reimbursed the value of the residence which had been rendered uninhabitable . It re - examined the estimates of the value of the property in DATE before the power station was constructed , provided by the court appointed experts and the additional experts , amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and LAW ) and the estimated value of the property in DATE had the power station not been constructed , which amounted to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . It took account of the fact that the applicants had had to bear various inconveniences and the delay in granting the remedy , notwithstanding that part of the delay was due to the applicants ' intermittent filing of irrelevant notes and depositions . It further considered that DATE the sum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) had already been paid to the applicants , the first payment amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in DATE . All this could be considered together only by determining a sum arbitrio boni viri which the first court had correctly done .", "By DATE , the first applicant , who was living in his other house in GPE , was contacted by ORG ( CARDINAL of the parties to the above - mentioned proceedings ) and ORG , which have a joint debt collecting procedure , for payment of outstanding water and electricity bills relating to the house in GPE , amounting to CARDINAL NORP Liras .", "Given that the applicants had already been declared to be owed compensation from ORG and that his utilities were being provided intermittently and suffered from numerous faults , the first applicant refused to pay the bills . As a result , on DATE the utilities supply was cut off and was restored CARDINAL parties paid the bill , against the first applicant 's wishes .", "When the water supply was restored , the pressure was initially too high and caused the pipes to burst , effectively depriving the first applicant of access to clean water , thus rendering his property in GPE uninhabitable too .", "With respect to the property in LOC , apart from noise and smoke emissions , further damage was caused by flooding , affecting the roofs and the electrical installations , and causing an infestation of rats . Historical documents and other possessions were also damaged and since no public funds were available to cover the necessary repairs , the insurance company which would not pay damages unless such works were done , threatened to withdraw insurance cover completely .", "On DATE the applicants instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional and \u201c conventional \u201d jurisdiction against the respondents , inter alia , ORG and ORG regarding damage to their PERSON property . They invoked ORG , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL , and requested the court to provide them with an adequate remedy .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicants ' claims , in part because the respondent had been incorrectly cited and for the rest it declined from exercising its constitutional jurisdiction on the ground that the applicants had not made use of the ordinary remedies available to them .", "On DATE the applicants appealed . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment .", "The applicants make reference to a set of legal proceedings in relation to the reinstatement of the PERSON property , but it is not clear whether these are in fact the same proceedings as are mentioned above or new proceedings and if they are new proceedings whether they have terminated .", "According to the applicants ' submissions of DATE , both their houses remain uninhabitable . Moreover , according to their communication , dated DATE , the first applicant has ongoing problems with his telephone line and does not receive regular post , and as a result , his PERSON telephone service - which he alleges is being tampered with - his correspondence with banks and his receipt of payments due and timely court notifications are adversely affected . Lastly , they allege that the garden of the PERSON property has been invaded by wild cats and that the local council has not taken any steps to resolve this problem .", "Under NORP law , a person alleging a breach of human rights as guaranteed by LAW or LAW may , without prejudice to any other remedy with respect to the same matter that is lawfully available , apply to ORG ( FAC ) for redress . The latter 's practice and procedures are governed by ORG .", "In respect of an action for damages in tort or quasi - tort , section CARDINAL of LAW , LAW of LAW , regarding the measure of damages , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The damage which is to be made good by the person responsible in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall consist in the actual loss which the act shall have directly caused to the injured party , in the expenses which the latter may have been compelled to incur in consequence of the damage , in the loss of actual wages or other earnings , and in the loss of future earnings arising from any permanent incapacity , total or partial , which the act may have caused . \u201d", "Mr B. owned property ( a residential home and adjacent land ) in PERSON which in DATE had been expropriated for the construction of the said power station . He had been offered ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation , which he contested as being inadequate . In the meantime building work had begun on the land contiguous to his property and as a result he suffered damage over DATE . Pending proceedings regarding the determination of adequate compensation , he was informed that his property was no longer required by the authorities and was asked to sign a disclaimer of responsibility towards them in respect of it , which he refused to sign .", "On an unspecified date PERSON instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction . He claimed that he had sustained damage both to his quality of life and to the value of his property , which remained in his possession , and that the authorities were liable for damages , this being without prejudice to any other remedy available to him for the determination of a violation of his fundamental rights under LAW .", "On DATE ORG found in favour of PERSON and concluded that the authorities ' actions had been abusive and illegal and in violation of his rights as property owner . Consequently , it held the authorities liable for damages and deferred the proceedings for the determination of compensation .", "On DATE ORG held that in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW , damage had to be assessed according to the estimated value of the property had the power station not been built which corresponded to ORG ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , and its actual value , namely FAC ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Consequently it awarded Mr B. MLT MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in damages .", "According to ORG website , in DATE an appeal was lodged and the case is currently pending before ORG , superior jurisdiction ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
