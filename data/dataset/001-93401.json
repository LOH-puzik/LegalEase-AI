On DATE ORG issued a decision refusing both requests , citing a lack of substantive grounds relating to PERSON peformance or professional ethics and pointing out that a replacement of counsel could cause delays in the proceedings which would affect the applicant \u2019s right to an expeditious trial .", "CARDINAL .

Mr Sj . lodged an appeal against ORG decision . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . In so doing it considered that the applicant had failed to demonstrate any error of ORG in its impugned decision that would warrant the interference of ORG and that it was in the interests of justice that the applicant retain his assigned counsel , and that the applicant \u2019s trial had been adjourned pending the outcome of his appeal .", "CARDINAL .

ORG then sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , putting the time which he had spent in ORG \u2019s custody to his credit towards the sentence .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . The judgment names the applicant \u2019s counsel as Mr PERSON , who is also his representative in the proceedings before ORG .", "The judgment contains the following passages ( footnote references omitted ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . PERSON submits that ORG violated his right to counsel of his choice when it refused to replace his entire defence team after the breakdown in trust and communication between him and his assigned counsel . This submission consists of CARDINAL principal arguments . First , PERSON maintains that , even as a participant in ORG legal aid system , he has a right to counsel of his choice . This argument has no merit . An accused who lacks the means to remunerate counsel shall have the right to have counsel assigned to him by the PERSON from the list drawn up in accordance with Rule CARDINAL(B ) , provided that there is no impediment to the assignment of that counsel . While there is the additional limitation placed on the right of an indigent accused to choose counsel in so far as the choice is limited to the list of counsel maintained in accordance with Rule DATE , as previously explained in this case , the Registrar normally takes account of an accused \u2019s preferences in assigning counsel , as was done in the present case , but it is also within the Registrar \u2019s discretion to override that preference in the interests of justice . Once counsel has been properly assigned , as was the case here , counsel has a professional obligation to continue representing the accused and may only be withdrawn or replaced , if sufficient cause exists .", "CARDINAL . Second , Blagojevi\u0107 disputes the conclusion of ORG that he was not justified in resisting his assigned legal representation and that he did not show good cause for removing his assigned counsel . PERSON contends that the breakdown was not , in fact , unilateral because his counsel falsely accused him of trying to engage in fee - splitting . PERSON argues that this \u2018 false and tendentious GPE destroyed all possibility of re - establishing any form of cooperation between them because in his view his counsel had accused him of being a \u2018 common ORG . Though ORG found this argument to be without merit at the pre - trial stage , PERSON points to an exchange at a status conference during the trial where Mr. PERSON , in his view , acknowledged and apologized for making false accusations against him , thereby vindicating his refusal to deal with his counsel .", "CARDINAL . ORG previously explained that the matter of alleged fee - splitting had no bearing on ORG decision to maintain PERSON \u2019s assigned counsel . ORG nonetheless considered the nature and possible impact of such an allegation on the lawyer - client relationship \u2018 for completeness and to ensure DATE . ORG noted that the assigned counsel did not breach any client confidence by raising the issue of fee - splitting , as he was ethically bound to bring such issues to the attention of the Registrar . ORG also determined that this issue should not unduly impact the relationship , in particular , noting that Mr. PERSON did not place blame on PERSON for attempting to enter into a feesplitting arrangement and instead explained that it resulted from \u2018 family ORG . ORG observed that this was consistent with PERSON \u2019s own explanation . A review of the transcripts of the status conference pointed to by PERSON does not , contrary to his submissions , indicate that Mr. [ PERSON ] admitted to falsely accusing him of trying to engage in fee - splitting . Rather , Mr. [ PERSON ] simply made clear , consistent with the submissions previously considered by ORG , that he never accused PERSON himself of trying to engage in feesplitting .", "CARDINAL . In addition , PERSON seeks to reopen the issues considered and decided in the interlocutory appeal by arguing that ORG failed to appreciate that the breakdown of his relationship with his counsel would last throughout the trial and prevent him from playing any meaningful role in his defence . However , PERSON \u2019s submissions before trial clearly indicated that he considered the breakdown irreparable . Nonetheless , PERSON correctly notes that both ORG expressed measured optimism that the situation between him and his counsel would improve . This view resulted from the determination that there was no objective basis for PERSON to be dissatisfied with his counsel \u2019s performance . PERSON has not called this conclusion into question . More importantly , however , PERSON \u2019s argument on this point fails to address the key aspect of ORG earlier holding . In dismissing PERSON \u2019s interlocutory appeal , ORG stated :", "[ sub - quotation ]", "In circumstances such as this , where an Appellant unjustifiably resists legal representation from assigned Counsel , Counsel \u2019s professional obligations to continue to represent the accused remain . ORG is satisfied that Counsel in this case is committed to representing the Appellant , and that the Appellant will receive a fair trial with the assistance of his assigned Counsel . In dismissing the Appellant \u2019s appeal , ORG wishes to make it clear to the Appellant that he has now exhausted all avenues available to him to voice his objections that he has not been accorded that to which he has no justifiable reason to demand . The ORG will not entertain a demand by an Appellant for that to be granted to him to which he has established no legal entitlement .", "[ end of sub - quotation ]", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s own submissions under the present ground of appeal reflect that the continued breakdown during the trial and the resulting complaints about the conduct of his defence also resulted from his unilateral refusal to communicate with his counsel , rather than from any action on the part of his counsel and Defence team . ORG decision on PERSON \u2019s request to testify is exemplary of Mr. [ PERSON ] \u2019s continued willingness to meet with and assist him and of PERSON \u2019s unilateral resistance to any cooperation . ORG considers that an appellant can not premise a request for a new trial on a claim of a total breakdown in communication in circumstances where the appellant unjustifiably refused to cooperate with his or her assigned counsel throughout the trial proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG understands fee - splitting to be an arrangement under which an accused who has been granted legal aid makes his consent to be represented by assigned counsel conditional on payment to him or her of a portion of the legal aid fees paid to counsel . The judgment includes the following quotation of PERSON from the transcript of a status conference during the trial ( footnote DATE on page CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c I just want to reiterate , one , I have done nothing for which I need to explain or apologise . I have never divulged any attorney / client privileges , nor have I ever accused Mr. PERSON of making any attempts to fee split as he seems to indicate . I \u2019ve never accused him of that , nor has he ever made any efforts himself . So I want to make sure that \u2019s very clear on the record . I have nothing more , Your Honour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Appeals Chamber went on to dismiss the prosecution \u2019s appeal in its entirety and to allow the applicant \u2019s appeal in part . It reversed ORG conviction of complicity in genocide and reduced the sentence to DATE imprisonment , subject to credit being given for the period which the applicant had already spent in detention .", "CARDINAL . One judge , Judge PERSON , appended a partly dissenting opinion in which he expressed the view that the applicant \u2019s steadfast refusal to recognise Mr PERSON as his counsel ought to have been respected and that the applicant ought to have been granted a retrial .", "CARDINAL .
