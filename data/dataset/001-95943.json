GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "From DATE , assets of the applicant , who had made an investment in a NORP company in GPE , were expropriated by the NORP authorities without compensation . Relying on LAW between GPE and the former ORG ( GPE ) of DATE , which remained in force between GPE and GPE after the disintegration of the GPE , the applicant complained to an international arbitral tribunal in GPE , GPE , requesting compensation .", "On DATE the arbitral tribunal awarded MONEY ( ORG ) plus interest to the applicant . ORG refused to pay this arbitral award . It made a request before the NORP courts that the arbitral award be declared void . On DATE ORG dismissed the request ; GPE appeals were to no avail .", "On DATE ORG declared the arbitral award enforceable . Relying on LAW of DATE and LAW of DATE , it observed that GPE could not rely on a general immunity from execution . ORG added that it was not for it to decide , however , whether international law prohibited enforcement measures directed against specific assets such as assets serving a sovereign purpose . The applicant subsequently initiated execution proceedings in GPE .", "The applicant requested an execution order ( Pf\u00e4ndungs- PERSON ) for ORG claims against GPE concerning the reimbursement of GPE ( ORG ) . The VAT owed by GPE stemmed from ORG acquisitions of goods and services . In DATE , ORG granted the request , and attached and transferred GPE claims for NORP reimbursement . GPE objected to the order .", "On DATE ORG cancelled the order , holding that the attachment of the claims was not in accordance with international law . It observed that GPE had issued a declaration in which it had assured that the reimbursed VAT solely served to maintain the functioning of the diplomatic and consular missions . Therefore , the attached claims served sovereign purposes and were exempt from execution . Furthermore , GPE had not declared a waiver of immunity for the enforcement proceedings .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . It found that an execution would be inadmissible under the rules of international law . The assurance given by GPE that the reimbursed ORG served solely to maintain the functioning of the diplomatic and consular missions was sufficient .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law ( no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the enforcement of ORG claims of NORP reimbursement was inadmissible . GPE enjoyed diplomatic immunity in relation to these claims as they served for the maintenance of the diplomatic ORG sovereign functions . It was pertinent in that context that there was no need for an actual impediment of the diplomatic activities to have occurred ; an abstract risk of impediment sufficed . This general rule of international law was also applicable to assets which did not DATE as in the present case DATE within the ambit of LAW ; rather , the protection extended to all assets serving for the functioning of diplomatic and consular missions . It was also of no relevance whether GPE was capable of assuring sufficient funds for its missions by other means ; if it had been , diplomatic immunity would have to depend on a ORG \u2019s financial capacity . In the present case , ORG assurance had been sufficient and it would have amounted to an illegal interference in matters of a foreign State to ask GPE to specify the purpose of the assets .", "ORG also observed that diplomatic immunity was an essential element of effective international cooperation and had to be respected in order to be able to settle disputes by peaceful means . These principles prevailed over the applicant \u2019s interest in attaching the assets . As to GPE alleged waiver of immunity , ORG found that LAW , regulating the procedure on the merits , contained no waiver for enforcement proceedings . Such a waiver could also not be inferred from LAW ( in particular its LAW ) or LAW on ORG , or any other treaty . According to the spirit and purpose of LAW , enforcement proceedings were generally permitted , but did not extend to assets serving a sovereign purpose .", "On DATE ORG declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible without providing reasons .", "The applicant requested an execution order for ORG claims against the NORP airline ORG . Those claims allegedly arose from , inter alia , the granting of overflight , transit and landing permits . On DATE the GPE ORG granted the request . ORG and ORG objected to the order .", "On DATE ORG cancelled the order . It held that the claims in question could not be attached . They were of a sovereign nature and served a sovereign purpose , as they concerned the airspace over NORP territory . It observed that a measure enforcing those claims would only have been possible if GPE had consented to the execution .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It observed that the international competence of NORP courts was doubtful . In any case , while execution on assets of GPE was not generally precluded , the attached claims could not be executed as they served a sovereign purpose and were thus subject to ORG immunity from execution . ORG had sufficiently demonstrated that the fees were to be used for sovereign purposes , namely for air traffic administration .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law ( no . VII ZB CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on CARDINAL alternative grounds . First , it held that NORP courts lacked international competence to execute claims like those in question . Relying on NORP law as the lex fori , the court held that the claims concerned fees governed by public law , which could not be executed since NORP courts were only internationally competent for execution in assets that were located on NORP territory . The obligation of ORG to pay the fees had arisen , however , within the sovereign territory of GPE , not in GPE .", "Second , ORG held that , according to the rules of international law , GPE enjoyed immunity in relation to these claims as the fees for the air traffic served sovereign purposes . As ORG had held , the receipts of the fees were directly devoted to the air traffic administration , which was a sovereign task . In addition , ORG had not waived its immunity from execution . ORG found that LAW , which regulated the procedure on the merits , contained no waiver in respect of enforcement proceedings . Such a waiver could also not be inferred from LAW ( in particular its LAW ) or LAW on ORG , or any other treaty . According to the spirit and purpose of LAW , enforcement proceedings were generally permitted , but did not extend to assets serving a sovereign purpose .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication , without giving reasons .", "The applicant continued his attempts to execute the arbitral award in GPE . He requested an execution on a plot of land situated in GPE , which was owned by GPE . In DATE the GPE ORG ordered the judicial sale of the plot of land .", "GPE brought a civil action against the applicant , claiming that that the execution was illegal as the arbitral award had been obtained fraudulently . The courts rejected the claim . On DATE ORG refused to admit GPE constitutional complaint .", "A state - owned NORP enterprise , which then owned the plot of land , lodged a complaint against the judicial sale of the plot , arguing that the execution conflicted with the international law principle of ORG immunity . ORG rejected the complaint , finding that the plot of land did not serve a sovereign purpose and was therefore not exempt from execution by the principle of ORG immunity . On DATE ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint .", "LAW of DATE between GPE and GPE reads in its LAW in fine :", "\u201c The decisions of the arbitral tribunal shall be recognised and implemented in accordance with the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of DATE . \u201d", "LAW of DATE reads :", "\u201c Each Contracting State shall recognise arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon , under the conditions laid down in the following articles . There shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards . \u201d", "The relevant provisions of international law instruments governing State immunity are referred to in various cases examined by ORG ( see , among many other authorities , ORG v.
