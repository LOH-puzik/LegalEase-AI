On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife , PERSON . , gave birth to a son , A.", "CARDINAL . The family lived at the applicant \u2019s flat , where ORG had his registered residence . He received ongoing paediatric care at the neighbourhood children \u2019s clinic and attended a neighbourhood nursery school .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON . decided to leave the applicant . She moved back to her GPE residence and took PERSON with her . A. has been living with her ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Justice of the Peace of ORG of GPE of GPE for a residence order under which A. would live with him . He was instructed to make corrections to his claim , which he did on DATE . On DATE the case was transferred to ORG of GPE . It registered the case on DATE and scheduled the first hearing for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON . lodged a counterclaim , asking for a residence order under which A. would live with her , and for an interim measure pending the proceedings . She claimed , in particular , that there was a risk that the applicant might kidnap A. and take him to GPE , where his stepfather had a house . She stated that he had already tried to take GPE away from her and had in particular attempted to pick him up from the boy \u2019s nursery school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG allowed PERSON . \u2019s request for an interim measure and forbade the applicant from contacting PERSON or picking him up from the nursery school without PERSON . \u2019s prior permission . It held as follows :", "\u201c The subject matter of the case is the residence of a child [ A. ] born in DATE . The parents have been unable to come to an agreement on this matter . The child is now living with his mother [ PERSON . ] . The court therefore considers that the requested interim measure would be proportionate to the claim . Otherwise , failure to take interim measures might complicate or make impossible the execution of the forthcoming judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant learned of the interim measure on DATE . On DATE he came to visit A. at the nursery school and the teachers refused to let him see the boy , citing the interim order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the FAC and PERSON childcare authorities examined the applicant \u2019s and PERSON . \u2019s flats and found their living conditions satisfactory and suitable for a small child .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was scheduled for DATE but it was adjourned until DATE at the applicant \u2019s request . The next hearing was scheduled for DATE but it was also adjourned until DATE for the purposes of \u201c obtaining evidence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC childcare authority issued its report on the case . It considered that , by reason of his very young age , A. should reside with his mother . The childcare authority considered that it was particularly important for a child to be raised by the mother until DATE . A lack of maternal care during that period , and in particular during the behavioural crises that a DATE typically undergoes , could result in the child developing negative character traits , such as stubbornness , surliness , hysterical reactions and inadequate social adaptation . The residence arrangements could be reconsidered after A. had reached DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ordered an expert psychological examination and adjourned the proceedings . The experts were asked their opinion on what residence arrangements would be in PERSON \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision of DATE ordering an expert examination . The appeal hearing was scheduled for DATE but was adjourned until CARDINAL DATE because the parties did not appear . On DATE ORG upheld on appeal the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The case file was sent to the experts on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , as PERSON . had prevented him from seeing PERSON , the applicant applied to the childcare authority for a contact order . On DATE the childcare authority rejected the application , referring to the interim measure imposed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG received by post the applicant \u2019s appeal , dated DATE , against the decision of DATE ordering the interim measure . The applicant submitted that there had been no justification for the interim measure , which had been motivated solely by the prevailing belief that a child should be raised by the mother rather than the father . He further submitted that the interim measure was contrary to A. \u2019s best interests . A lack of contact with his father and the paternal family PERSON grandparents , uncle , aunt and cousins DATE to whom he was very attached might cause A. psychological trauma . It might , moreover , result in A. \u2019s estrangement from his father or , given his very young age , even his forgetting his father altogether . It also created a risk that PERSON . might turn PERSON against his father . It might in turn mean that the results of any future expert examinations \u2013 and , by extension , any future judicial decision on the child \u2019s residence DATE would be biased against the applicant . Lastly , the applicant submitted that the interim measure breached his right to maintain contact with his son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Justice of the Peace of ORG of LOC of GPE convicted PERSON . of assault and battery , a criminal offence under LAW . In particular , the court found it established that on DATE the applicant had approached PERSON . and PERSON while they were playing at the local public beach and had hugged his son . PERSON . had immediately snatched the boy away from him and had hit the applicant CARDINAL times , causing him bodily injuries , before carrying the boy away . A fine was imposed on her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts issued their report . They found that it would be beneficial for A. to maintain contact with both parents . He was equally attached to both of them . Both parents were equally capable of raising the child . The serious conflict currently persisting between the parents could negatively affect ORG \u2019s psychological development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were resumed . Hearings were scheduled for DATE and DATE but could not take place because some of the participants did not appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON childcare authority issued its report on the case . It found that A. should reside with his mother , referring to A. \u2019s young age and the fact that he had lived with his mother for some time already and was attending a neighbouring nursery school .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing of DATE the applicant lodged an objection against the judge of ORG , submitting that she ( that is to say the judge ) had stated on several occasions that she would rule against the applicant because according to the established practice of GPE a residence order was always made in favour of the mother . The judge dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed a request lodged by the applicant for the proceedings to be stayed ; it accordingly stayed the residence order proceedings pending the criminal proceedings against PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld PERSON . \u2019s criminal conviction on appeal . The conviction acquired binding force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed on appeal the decision of CARDINAL DATE ordering the interim measure . It found that the interim measure had been unconnected to the subject matter of the case and had therefore been disproportionate . There had been no evidence that the execution of the forthcoming judgment might be complicated or impossible . By applying the interim measure , the judge had prejudged the case . ORG remitted PERSON . \u2019s request for an interim measure for fresh examination by ORG , which rejected it on DATE as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the childcare authority instructed PERSON . that she should stop preventing PERSON from seeing his paternal family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the divorce of the applicant and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting by way of supervisory review , quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE upholding PERSON . \u2019s conviction and remitted the criminal case for fresh examination by the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG resumed the residence order proceedings and held a hearing .", "CARDINAL . During the hearings the applicant stated that he possessed a comfortable flat in a safe and ecologically clean neighbourhood , with parks and schools in the vicinity . Before the applicant \u2019s separation from his former wife , PERSON had attended a nursery school in that neighbourhood . The applicant also had a countryside residence . Being the owner of his own business , he had flexible working hours and could therefore devote a lot of time to his son . He had always paid child maintenance and his income permitted him to give the child a good education . There was a strong personal attachment between the applicant and his son ; PERSON was also very attached to his paternal family \u2013 especially his cousin , who was of the same age . The applicant had positive character references : he was calm , polite and affectionate towards his son . By contrast , PERSON . was aggressive and irresponsible . She had physically assaulted him in front of A. and had been criminally convicted in connection with that incident . She had also been convicted of the administrative offence of leaving the scene of a road accident and had had her driving licence suspended for DATE . As could be seen from the documents submitted by the applicant to the court , she lived in a severely polluted and criminally unsafe neighbourhood in the vicinity of an oil refinery plant and a prison . Moreover , PERSON . shared her flat with her mother , who smoked and abused alcohol and could therefore have a bad influence on A. Until recently , PERSON . had prevented the applicant and his relatives from seeing PERSON , and currently she allowed occasional contact only .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother and sister stated that PERSON . prevented them from seeing PERSON . was often aggressive and occasionally abused alcohol . All her family smoked , even in the child \u2019s presence . A. was very attached to his father and obviously suffered from their forced separation .", "CARDINAL . Ch . stated that the applicant would have no time to take care of the child as he was managing a business , was following a distance - learning course at a university and had earlier stated his intention of building a countryside residence . PERSON . had a higher education and was working . The alleged defects in her character and behaviour to which the applicant had referred had been confirmed by his relatives only .", "CARDINAL . A teacher from ORG \u2019s current nursery school stated that she had seen the applicant once and that he had made a bad impression on her . On DATE he had come to the nursery school and had told her that he wanted to take A. home with him . When she had refused to let him in , referring to the court order prohibiting any contact between them , he had become agitated and had talked about taking A. away with him when the children went out for a walk .", "CARDINAL . The director of the nursery school gave a similar description of the incident . She said that the applicant had become angry when he had learned of the court decision ordering the interim measure , had asked for a copy of that measure and had called his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The following documents were submitted by the parties for the court \u2019s examination : ( i ) the applicant \u2019s and PERSON . \u2019s pay statements , ( ii ) documents showing that the district where PERSON . lived was among the most polluted districts of GPE , ( iii ) documents from the criminal case file against PERSON . , and ( iv ) documents relating to A. \u2019s medical history and PERSON \u2019s pre - school education both at the applicant \u2019s place of residence prior to his GPE separation and at the mother \u2019s place of residence after the separation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted PERSON . \u2019s application for a residence order in her favour and dismissed a similar application by the applicant . It held as follows :", "\u201c Having examined the entirety of the evidence , the court finds that there is a very serious conflict between the parties as regards the child \u2019s residence arrangements , ... which has a negative impact on the child by creating a psychologically unhealthy and tense atmosphere around him . At the same time , each parent , taken alone , possesses moral , personal and other qualities rendering each of them capable of raising a small child . According to the expert report , the child is equally attached to both of them . It also follows from the expert report that the GPE improper behaviour towards each other may have negative psychological consequences for the child .", "The court notes that [ ORG . \u2019s ] criminal conviction for assaulting [ the applicant ] has not yet acquired binding force . It however takes into account the criminal charges brought against her . It is clear that the incident was prompted by the personal hostility [ between the applicant and PERSON . ] caused by a disagreement on the issue of their son \u2019s residence and education . In the court \u2019s opinion , these charges can not constitute a decisive reason for making a residence order in favour of the father . There is an accumulation of reasons on the basis of which the court considers that the child should live with the mother .", "In the present case the court is guided by the best interests of child [ A. ] , who at the moment of the judgment has not yet reached DATE and who has an established way of life . For a long time the child has lived with his mother at her place of residence and has attended a nursery school there . Given his age , a change of residence and a separation from the mother will have a negative impact on the child \u2019s general and psychological state .", "The court considers that [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments that the district where [ ORG . ] lives is polluted and that close members of her family smoke can not serve as a basis for making a residence order in favour of the father because , as mentioned above , a change of residence will have a negative impact on the child . [ The applicant \u2019s ] arguments that he has better living conditions and a better financial situation than [ PERSON . ] are not decisive for granting a residence order to the father either .", "The childcare authorities are unanimous that it is in [ A. \u2019s ] interests to live with the mother . The court agrees with that finding .", "The court also finds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] request for a residence order is at the moment premature . [ The applicant ] is entitled to apply for a reconsideration of the issue after ORG has reached a more conscious age [ \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430 ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , repeating the arguments he had raised before ORG . He relied , in particular , on the right to equality between spouses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE found it established that PERSON . was preventing the applicant and his family \u2013namely his mother , brother and sister \u2013 from seeing A. It held that PERSON was entitled to maintain contact with his father and his paternal family and determined the contact schedule as follows . The applicant should be able to have contact with PERSON ( i ) on DATE from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE at the applicant \u2019s place of residence , in the mother \u2019s absence and with the right to attend outdoor activities for children , and ( ii ) for DATE during DATE during DATE on dates agreed with the mother , provided that the child is in good health , with the right to leave GPE and to go abroad . The applicant \u2019s mother , brother and sister should be able to have contact sessions with A. from TIME until TIME on DATE at the applicant \u2019s place of residence .", "CARDINAL .
