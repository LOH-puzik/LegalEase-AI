The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he received an indeterminate sentence for public protection ( \u201c ORG sentence \u201d ) following his conviction of the sexual assault of a DATE girl . The offence had been committed while the applicant was on licence in the community following his release from a sentence for indecent assault against girls under DATE and while he was undertaking the Sex Offender Treatment Programme ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) in the community . A minimum term ( \u201c tariff \u201d ) of DATE was fixed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was initially detained in ORG . It was recommended in DATE that he complete the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he was transferred to ORG . He completed an Enhanced Thinking Skills ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) course in DATE and the core NORP on DATE . On an unknown date , he completed an ORG course .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a Structured Assessment of Risk and Need ( \u201c SARN \u201d ) report identified that further work was required to reduce the applicant \u2019s risk of reoffending . It was recommended that he complete the extended SOTP and , possibly , a ORG ( \u201c BLB \u201d ) programme . The extended ORG consisted of CARDINAL interactive sessions plus some individual work and generally lasted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a ORG review on DATE the ORG said that much offending work still had to be done in order to reduce the applicant \u2019s risk and that he should therefore remain in closed conditions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE ORG . He claims that he had been informed that the extended ORG was available at that prison .", "CARDINAL .

The [ Intensive Case Management ] decision provides a detailed account of the index offence and your previous offending record ... You are given credit for the offence related work you have undertaken but further work in the form of an Extended SOTP ( and possible a ORG programme thereafter ) is considered necessary to further address your risk factors ... It is clear that significant risk reducing work is required in closed conditions before you can progress further . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE ORG informed the applicant that the Secretary of ORG agreed with the ORG recommendation . She considered that a number of risk factors were outstanding , namely sexual offending , feelings of grievance , distorted thinking , alcohol misuse and outbursts of anger . She was of the view that the extended SOTP was necessary to reduce the applicant \u2019s risk level . She also indicated that an assessment for the ORG programme was necessary following completion of the extended ORG and recommended that the applicant continue addressing his alcohol misuse . The letter expressed the expectation that the relevant interventions , or other equivalent risk reduction work , would be completed prior to the next ORG review . It clarified , however , that the Secretary of ORG could not guarantee to place the applicant on the courses identified as there were limits on the availability of resources .", "CARDINAL . The review period was set at DATE and was made up the following : transfer to an establishment to undertake the extended SOTP ; participation in the extended SOTP ; participation in post - course reviews ; consolidate and test the skills learned ; continued development and practice of appropriate risk strategies ; assessment for the ORG programme ; continued monitoring of alcohol misuse and relapse prevention work if necessary .

Meanwhile , the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to PERSON seeking information on when he would be allowed to participate in the extended ORG . By reply dated DATE , the deputy extended ORG treatment manager explained :", "\u201c In order that we can be responsive to the needs of PERSON , it is essential that we allow him a period of settling in at PERSON before an assessment for ORG can take place .", "Assessments and placements are prioritised on a number of factors including tariff expiry , risk level and treatment readiness . However , please be assured that an assessment will take place as soon as practically possible .", "We anticipate delivering CARDINAL ORG in DATE and PERSON will be considered for one of these programmes , if he is found suitable .

By reply dated CARDINAL DATE he was informed that PERSON made \u201c every attempt to ensure prisoners are treated fairly and have access to offending behaviour programmes \u201d . However , the letter noted that there were limited resources and that there was a large number of ORG prisoners and life sentence prisoners at ORG whose tariffs had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the Governor of PERSON to notify him of the fact that judicial review proceedings were being contemplated . They sought an undertaking that the applicant would be given access to an extended ORG scheduled to begin in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant was reassessed for participation in the extended ORG . In a report dated DATE he was found not to be sufficiently motivated to undertake the course . The report noted that the second meeting had had to be terminated on account of the applicant \u2019s use of abusive and disrespectful language and his loud and aggressive tone . It explained that while , given the applicant \u2019s tariff expiry date , he would have been prioritised for DATE extended ORG course , it was considered that he was not ready for secondary treatment at that time . It was recommended that the applicant complete individual work with his offender supervisor to consider , inter alia , the costs and benefits of engaging in the extended ORG and to address his outstanding treatment needs . Further assessment would take place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently pursued a request for a place on an extended ORG scheduled to commence in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the applicant of its decision on the papers not to direct his release or to recommend his transfer to open conditions . ORG set out the details of the index offence and noted that the applicant had committed the offence while on a DATE extended licence following another conviction for sexual offences ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It considered that he had breached the trust placed in him and expressed concern that this might not bode well for the applicant \u2019s likely compliance with licence conditions . ORG reiterated the applicant \u2019s risk factors and turned to examine the evidence of any change during sentence . It explained :", "\u201c You completed the Core SOTP in DATE and the Thinking Skills Programme in DATE . It was then recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP . Once this has been completed you will be assessed for other programmes such as the Better Lives Booster Programme and ORG . You are reported to have attended for a programme assessment for the ORG at ORG GPE but prison records state that this was a challenging meeting and that you were not sufficiently motivated to commence the group . You do not agree with this assessment . You will be offered the opportunity to attend for suitability assessment in the future . You have also been put forward for the CALM programme due to the violent offences on your record and difficulties in managing your emotions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed that the applicant posed a high risk of harm to children . It commended the applicant on his completion of the ORG and core SOTP . However , it concluded :", "\u201c ... [ T]here is a considerable amount of accredited offending behaviour work still recommended for you to complete to reduce your risks to a level that can be safely managed in less secure conditions . In the first instance it is recommended that you complete the Extended SOTP and CALM and that following the SARN you may need to be assessed for ORG . Clearly this will take some considerable time and whilst core areas of risk remain unaddressed there is no merit in an oral hearing being held ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
