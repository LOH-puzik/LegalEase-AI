The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG acquitted the applicant of , inter alia , CARDINAL counts of assault , CARDINAL counts of dangerous assault , of sexual assault and of procuring for lack of criminal responsibility and ordered his placement in a psychiatric hospital under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that DATE the applicant , who had previously been convicted , in particular , of several counts of assault in GPE and GPE , had committed the offences he had been charged with . The applicant was found , in particular , to have violently threatened with a gun and knife , hit and attempted to strangulate his wife , partly using dangerous instruments or teargas , on a number of occasions . He inflicted on his wife multiple injuries including fractures of her jaw , cheekbones , nose and skull , snags to her nose and genitals as well as lacerations , bruises and swellings all over her body . He had further forced his wife to prostitution for his own material benefit , had forced her to dance naked for an acquaintance and had chased her naked in a forest . Moreover , he had assaulted and sexually assaulted his female friend and a relative of his wife with whom he had an intimate relationship ( fettering the latter naked to a tree , urinating on her and introducing fir cones into her rectum and vagina ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having consulted CARDINAL medical experts , found that the applicant suffered from a brain disorder , a borderline personality disorder manifesting itself in emotional instability and a paranoiac jealousy and had partly been drunk during his acts . Owing to his pathological mental disorder , it could not be excluded that he had acted without criminal responsibility . ORG further considered that the applicant was to be placed in a psychiatric hospital as he was liable to commit further serious offences and was therefore dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , the applicant was placed in different psychiatric hospitals . From DATE onwards , he was in ORG psychiatric hospital , from DATE in Straubing psychiatric hospital , from DATE in D\u00fcren psychiatric hospital and from DATE in GPE - Hau psychiatric hospital . Following his escape from that clinic in DATE , he was again detained in D\u00fcren psychiatric hospital from DATE and subsequently in ORG psychiatric hospital . His detention in a psychiatric hospital was confirmed DATE by the competent ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the city of ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE after he had renounced NORP nationality in DATE . The decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital ordered by ORG on DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) . It further delivered its decision , taken DATE , to order the applicant \u2019s provisional detention pending the competent court \u2019s decision whether or not he was to be placed in preventive detention retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . Having heard evidence from a psychiatric expert , PERSON , who had examined the applicant in person , ORG found that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder with paranoiac and dissocial elements . However , that disorder did not exclude or diminish his criminal responsibility . His continued dangerousness for women , in particular for his ex - wife , did not result from a pathological mental disorder but from his chosen attitude towards women .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was accordingly transferred from the psychiatric hospital to prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG , relying on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which it considered compatible with LAW , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention retrospectively ( nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG noted that , as required by Article CARDINAL of LAW , ORG had terminated the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital on DATE pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the requirements of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were met . The GPE ORG had ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital in DATE as the applicant had committed , inter alia , several counts of dangerous assault , an offence listed in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG considered that a comprehensive assessment of the applicant , his offences and his development during his placement in the psychiatric hospitals revealed that it was very likely that , if released , he would again commit serious offences , similar to those following which he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital , against women related to him , resulting in considerable psychological and physical harm to the victims ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . It noted that both psychiatric experts it had consulted had convincingly diagnosed the applicant with a dissocial personality disorder necessitating therapy , and CARDINAL of them , in addition , with sexual sadism , without his criminal responsibility being diminished or excluded thereby . Expert H. , in particular , had considered that the applicant suffered from a combined personality disorder with dissocial , psychopathic , paranoiac and emotionally unstable elements and had formerly abused alcohol . Expert PERSON had found , in particular , that the applicant was a psychopath .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s offences disclosed a violent , degrading and partly sadist attitude towards women which had not changed during his placement in different psychiatric hospitals . The preventive detention of the applicant , who had a propensity to commit serious violent offences , was proportionate . In particular , the applicant \u2019s planned departure to GPE was irrelevant in that respect because Article CARDINAL of LAW served to protect potential victims not only in GPE , but also in other GPE including GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law which he reasoned on DATE . He argued that LAW of LAW and the decisions ordering his preventive detention retrospectively , which were based on that provision , violated his right to liberty and were thus incompatible with LAW and with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that the retrospective order for his preventive detention , based on LAW , violated his right to liberty under LAW of LAW . It also disproportionately interfered with that right because his expulsion to GPE would have been as effective as his detention in order to protect potential victims in GPE while interfering less with his fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of CARDINAL judges of ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in Straubing Prison , CARDINAL doctors , CARDINAL psychologists , CARDINAL educationists and CARDINAL social workers offer help to detainees ( it has not been specified for how many detainees these staff members were responsible ) . Sexual and violent offenders may be transferred to a suitable social therapeutic institution if their reintegration into society may be better furthered thereby . If a group therapy proves unsuitable , they may be offered an individual therapy . There are additional courses aimed at preventing further offences on release , including antiaggression , anti - violence and reasoning and rehabilitation training . Furthermore , detainees who committed their offences under the influence of alcohol or drugs are offered addiction counselling .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant had initially not been ready to apply for his transfer to ORG social therapeutic institution which , according to the prison therapists , would offer him a suitable social therapy for sexual offenders . He claimed to be a violent offender in the first place and to have undergone a sexual therapy already in the psychiatric hospitals . The Erlangen prison authorities later refused the applicant \u2019s request dated DATE to be admitted to its social therapeutic institution for violent offenders . It argued that he did not fit into the institution \u2019s therapeutic concept targeted at offenders sentenced for offences of an average gravity . The applicant did not apply to be admitted to another social therapeutic institution in FAC . He further did not apply for any training courses or addiction counselling .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been working in Straubing Prison . He received a visit from his sister once , spoke to his mother on the phone regularly and exchanged letters with her and with CARDINAL other acquaintances . He has not received any relaxations in the conditions of his detention in view of the enforceable expulsion order against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to declare his preventive detention unlawful . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request of DATE to declare the execution of his preventive detention unlawful . It found , in particular , that the judgment of ORG DATE in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) did not constitute a bar to the execution of the judgment in the applicant \u2019s case . That court \u2019s judgments were only binding between the parties to the proceedings in the case of PERSON GPE , which had , moreover , concerned a different subject - matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It took the view that the question of whether the applicant \u2019s preventive detention breached the prohibition of retrospective punishment could not be examined in the present proceedings concerning the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . That issue had to be dealt with in review proceedings under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In those proceedings , it had to be examined whether , owing to specific circumstances relating to his person or his conduct , it was highly likely that the applicant would commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in review proceedings under Articles CARDINALd DATE of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , declared the applicant \u2019s preventive detention ordered by the GPE ORG on DATE terminated and ordered the applicant \u2019s supervision of conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in her report dated DATE , psychiatric expert PERSON had considered that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder with paranoiac , dissocial and narcissistic elements and from emotional instability . There was a risk of MONEY that the applicant would commit further violent offences against a person related to him in DATE to come if released . The applicant therefore suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of LAW . However , in ORG view , there was not a high risk , owing to specific circumstances relating to the applicant \u2019s person or conduct , that he would commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released . The requirements set up in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE for a continuation of the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention , which applied a fortiori in a case like that of the applicant who had initially been acquitted for lack of criminal responsibility , had therefore not been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing the prosecution \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of ORG and ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue . Contrary to ORG , it considered that under ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , it was sufficient for preventive detention ordered under LAW to continue if there was a risk , owing to specific circumstances relating to the applicant \u2019s person or conduct , that the person concerned would commit serious crimes of violence or sexual offences . These requirements were met in the applicant \u2019s case . It was not necessary that there was a high risk of the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences or that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder . These requirements applied only to the ( different ) cases of preventive detention with retrospective effects which had been at issue in ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant in person , dismissed the request made by the city of Straubing to order the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital under the NORP ( Mentally Ill Persons\u2019 ) Placement Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It found that the disorder the applicant suffered from was not so serious as to affect the applicant \u2019s free will . Consequently , the requirements for his detention under LAW of the NORP ( Mentally Ill Persons\u2019 ) Placement Act were not met . It was not the purpose of the said LAW to authorise the detention of all persons suffering from a mental disease or to close gaps in the provisions on preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC authorities lodged a request with ORG to order the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s provisional detention for a maximum period of DATE under LAW from the moment the termination of the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention became final . It noted that the psychiatric experts PERSON had found in their reports , drawn up on the basis of the case - file alone , that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder with dissocial , psychopathic / narcissistic and paranoiac elements and emotional instability . He had previously abused alcohol . He might suffer , in addition , from sexual sadism . The experts had considered that there was a high and a medium to high risk respectively that the applicant would commit further violent offences , in particular against persons closely related to him , if released . The court , endorsing the experts\u2019 findings , therefore considered that there were grounds for concluding that the requirements for the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW were met .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . A summary of the provisions of LAW the right to liberty ( LAW ) and the ban on retrospective application of criminal laws ( LAW ) can also be found in that judgment ( ibid . , LAW and DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) cover , in particular , placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) . They may be ordered for offenders in addition to their punishment ( compare Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . They must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants as well as to their dangerousness ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs orders for a person \u2019s preventive detention made by the sentencing court when finding the person guilty of an offence . That court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , first sentence , of LAW , in its version in force at the time of the order for the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention , preventive detention may be ordered in addition to a prison sentence if the perpetrator is sentenced for certain serious offences , including murder , rape and dangerous assault , to DATE imprisonment , if he has previously been convicted ( only ) once of CARDINAL or more such offences to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment and if the remaining requirements laid down in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) are met .", "CARDINAL . The Retrospective Preventive Detention Act ( Gesetz zur Einf\u00fchrung der nachtr\u00e4glichen GPE ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , inserted Articles CARDINALb and QUANTITY into LAW ; the latter provision was amended by LAW of DATE . The provisions in question were aimed at preventing the release of persons who could no longer be detained in a psychiatric hospital because the conditions for placement under LAW were no longer met ( including cases in which they had never been met from the outset ) , but who were still dangerous to the public ( see ORG documents ( ORG ) , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In fact , under the case - law previously established by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences , a person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital had to be terminated and the person concerned had to be released if he no longer suffered , or had in fact never suffered , from a condition excluding or diminishing his criminal responsibility , even if that person was still dangerous to the public ( see ORG , no .

The said CARDINAL provisions remained valid also under LAW ( Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Rechts der Sicherungsverwahrung ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , for offences committed after the entry into force of that LAW . As a result of the abolition of paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Article CARDINALb of LAW by LAW , the former paragraph CARDINAL , slightly amended , became the only provision of that Article .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW , the court ( that is , the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended and a measure of probation applied or should be declared terminated . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons in preventive detention , this time - limit is DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The detention of mentally ill persons is provided for , first of all , in LAW as a measure of correction and prevention if the detention is ordered in relation to an unlawful act committed by the person concerned . LAW provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court will order his placement \u2013 without any maximum duration \u2013 in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive assessment of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , on DATE , following the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ) , LAW Gesetz zur Therapierung und PERSON gest\u00f6rter PERSON ) entered into force . Under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Act , the civil sections of ORG may order the placement in a suitable institution of persons who may no longer be kept in preventive detention in view of the prohibition of retrospective aggravations in relation to preventive detention . Such a therapy detention may be ordered if the person concerned has been found guilty by final judgment of certain serious offences for which preventive detention may be ordered under LAW of LAW . The person must further suffer from a mental disorder owing to which it is highly likely that he will considerably impair the life , physical integrity , personal liberty or sexual self - determination of another person . The person \u2019s detention must be necessary for the protection of the public .", "DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for a complainant \u2019s preventive detention under LAW of LAW ( file FAC . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Reversing its previous position , ORG held that all provisions concerned , both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention , were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE and LAW in its version of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively , or ordered retrospectively under LAW of LAW ( but not preventive detention ordered LAW ) , the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned , owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct , were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if , additionally , they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act . As regards the notion of mental disorder , ORG explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of \u201c persons of unsound mind \u201d in LAW sub - paragraph ( e ) of the LAW made in this ORG \u2019s case - law ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . If the above pre - conditions were not met , those detainees had to be released DATE . The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality ; as a general rule , proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-a", "5-1-c", "5-1-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
