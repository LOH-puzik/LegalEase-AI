On DATE it was decided to deport her and to prohibit her from re - entry for DATE . The deportation was effected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the applicant returned to GPE with a different passport , according to which her name was GPE , she was born on DATE and indicating a different identity number from that in her previous passport . On DATE she married a NORP national and on DATE she applied for a residence permit . In her application she stated that she had not previously visited GPE and that she had no previous criminal convictions . She was granted a work permit on DATE for a period of DATE , which was renewed a number of times . On DATE she was granted a settlement permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she applied for NORP citizenship , but the processing of her application was discontinued as her husband on DATE applied for a separation .", "CARDINAL . In the course of DATE , the applicant started co - habiting with Mr O. , who also originated from GPE and who had held a settlement permit since DATE . Together , the couple had CARDINAL daughters , born on DATE and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE the police received information from a source that the applicant had previously been in GPE under the name PERSON . On DATE the police apprehended her while she was working in a hairdressing salon . After first denying having previously been in GPE under a different name she later admitted it . She explained that the name in the passport the second time she came to GPE had not been an incorrect name but had been her father \u2019s , whilst the name in the first passport had been her mother \u2019s . The difference in birth dates could be explained by the fact that it was her father who had arranged for the second passport . She admitted having used the second passport deliberately to avoid the prohibition on re - entry ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , after having put the applicant on notice on DATE that it was considering revoking her work- and settlement permits , on DATE ORG revoked her permits . In DATE ORG rejected her appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided that the applicant should be expelled and prohibited from re - entry for DATE , applying section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( according to which an alien may be expelled if he or she has committed serious or repeated violations of CARDINAL or more provisions of the LAW ) and finding that her expulsion would not be disproportionate for the purposes of section PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused a request by the applicant to stay the implementation of her expulsion . However , on DATE it confirmed that she had a right to such stay .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG was rejected on DATE . Its reasoning included the following considerations . The applicant had violated sections CARDINAL ( on visa requirements ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( according to which the provision with intent or gross negligence of essentially false or manifestly misleading information in a matter falling within the LAW is punishable by fines or CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or both ) , with reference to section CARDINAL ( on identity document requirements ) of LAW DATE . She had travelled to GPE DATE after having been expelled from GPE with DATE re - entry ban . In practice , unlawful travel to the country would always be considered a serious breach of LAW . The ORG further noted that the applicant had requested a residence permit by using a false identity and false documents in order to obtain such a permit . The applicant had violated LAW seriously and repeatedly . In the ORG \u2019s view the applicant \u2019s expulsion would not be a disproportionate measure either with regard to the applicant or her closest family members . In this connection the ORG had regard to the serious nature of the applicant \u2019s offences and the general preventative interests in expelling her , her personal links to GPE as compared to her home country as well as her relationship with her children . The latter could not be decisive .", "CARDINAL . The Board observed inter alia :", "\u201c ORG notes that the children , who are NORP nationals , are not registered in the Immigration authorities\u2019 computer system with any permit . Nor is there any registered application for a residence permit in GPE for the children . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE all foreigners , also children , who reside in GPE must hold a permit . This applies also to children of foreign parents . As long as the children do not hold a permit to reside in GPE they are obliged to leave the country . Whether or not [ the applicant ] and Mr O. opt to submit an application for family reunion with Mr O. is up to them and is in any event of no importance for the applicant \u2019s case . ORG also notes that it has been submitted that the father has periodically had DATE contact with his children and that he currently has contact visits DATE and an TIME visit during DATE when he does not have weekend visits .", "The ORG further refers to the fact that the children , born in DATE and DATE , are relatively young and their links to GPE can not be said to be very strong . It is assumed that their strongest ties are those with their close family , their mother and father . Whether the children remain in GPE or accompany their mother to her country of origin has no decisive significance for the outcome of the case .", "The [ applicant ] \u2019s children , born respectively in DATE and DATE , were conceived and born during the [ applicant ] \u2019s unlawful stay in GPE . She used a false identity to gain entry to GPE and to obtain permits ( subsequently revoked ) . On this basis , the [ applicant ] can not be said to have had a legitimate expectation of establishing a family life in GPE , and to stay here .", "The connection developed under the above circumstances is thus ascribed little weight in the assessment of proportionality .", "[ ... ]", "ORG has considered [ ... ] whether the [ applicant]s expulsion would be contrary to LAW and has found that this is not the case .", "[ ... ]", "[ ... ]", "for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , cf .

In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant and Mr O. separated . She then assumed the DATE care of the children whilst arrangements were made for him to receive them for contact visits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted PERSON , who then lived in GPE , the sole parental responsibilities and the daily care of the children until the applicant \u2019s return to GPE after the end of her expulsion . ORG granted the applicant a right of contact to the children . Until a possible expulsion this was to comprise a visit of the applicant at her residence in GPE from DATE . Thereafter the contact visits were to take place for DATE during the children \u2019s DATE and DATE during DATE . The father was to assume DATE care and the sole parental responsibilities until final judgment .", "CARDINAL . The City Court based itself on the assumption that relatively speaking there was little probability that the applicant would succeed in obtaining a reversal of the decision to expel her . In accordance with the assessment of the court appointed expert , it found that the father was the parent best suited to assume the care for the children and that it would be best for the children to live in GPE since their mother was sure that she would wish to return to GPE after the expulsion period . The children \u2019s contact with both parents would be optimised if the care was granted to the father . The applicant lodged an appeal against this judgment to ORG , the examination of which was at her request discontinued pending the outcome of the expulsion proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to reconsider its decision of DATE regarding her expulsion . She argued that the measure could entail a permanent separation between the applicant and the children , that she had not been guaranteed any right to return to GPE after expiry of the prohibition on re - entry and that the father was unlikely to enable the applicant to exercise contact rights in her home country . She conceded that her offences when seen in isolation could provide a basis for expulsion . However , she disputed that the measure would be proportionate in that insufficient weight had been attached to the fact that her expulsion would lead to a separation between her as a main carer and her CARDINAL small children . On DATE the ORG refused to alter its earlier decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s judicial appeal against ORG decision of DATE was rejected by ORG . But on DATE the ORG unanimously quashed the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . While it was undisputed that the conditions in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) had been fulfilled and ORG found that the measure would not be disproportionate vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant , it did find that they would be disproportionate vis - \u00e0 - vis the children , though it assumed that the decision of CARDINAL DATE was not incompatible with LAW", "CARDINAL . High Court held inter alia :", "\u201c In this concrete case expulsion can not be said to be a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the [ applicant ] . [ She ] had been fully aware that she returned to GPE with a false identity and has been aware of the consequences this could have for her . In such cases expulsion would be an ordinary reaction . The fact that criminal punishment was not added to the reaction can not be taken to mean that the offence was less serious [ ... ] .", "However , the wording of the statute does not solely cover the immigrant personally but encompasses also closest family , in this instance [ the applicant ] \u2019s CARDINAL daughters .", "ORG has found that the weight of their interests is such as to make the expulsion decision disproportionate and thereby invalid .", "The daughters are respectively CARDINAL and DATE . [ The applicant ] has lived together with them since their birth and it must be assumed that she has been their main care person since the break up of her relationship with the children \u2019s father in DATE until DATE when a judgment was delivered at first instance in the custody case . As stated above , the children now live with their father in GPE . Until an eventual expulsion contact visits are to take place from DATE . [ The applicant ] will then receive the children at her place in GPE . After expulsion , the contact visits should extend to DATE during DATE and DATE during DATE , according to point CARDINAL of the operative provision in the child custody case .", "The fact that [ the applicant ] lost the custody case in ORG is closely connected to the decision on expulsion . ORG found it best for the children to be able to stay in GPE . In light of what was stated in ORG judgment about the statement given by the expert witness , it seems that also the latter \u2019s statement in favour of the father was justified by the children being able to remain in GPE were he to be granted the daily care . In other words , the fact that [ the applicant ] lost the custody case in ORG does not mean that there was not a close and good relationship between her and the children . Also , the reason why ORG had prescribed limited access rights was the presumption that she would be expelled .", "If the final outcome in the custody case were to be as decided by ORG , the expulsion would entail a breaking off of the contact between [ the applicant ] and the children . It would no longer be an alternative that the children should accompany her to GPE . The duration of the separation is uncertain . It is most probable that [ the applicant ] would not come to GPE as long as the prohibition on re - entry applies . Whether or not she would be able to obtain a visa or a residence permit in GPE after having been separated from her children for DATE is difficult to predict , but appears hardly probable in light of the fact that she had previously entered the country with a false passport . In other words , in the worst case , the separation between mother and children could become permanent .", "The High Court finds that a long lasting separation between the mother and the children would have very serious consequences for the children . In DATE to come they would need close and frequent contact with both parents . It has not been submitted that the children have any relatives or close persons other than their parents , in GPE . This would mean that they would be particularly vulnerable should anything happen that make their father no longer able to assume parental responsibilities completely .", "The negative consequences that an expulsion of [ the applicant ] would have for the children must be weighed against the interests of immigration control and the importance of effective implementation of expulsion decisions . Particular weight \u2013 normally a decisive DATE ought to be attached to the latter consideration . However , in the present case ORG has found that the interests of the children should carry more weight . ORG finds that there are relatively few persons who are in the same situation as [ the applicant ] , with DATE of illegal stay in GPE and children who were born in this country and where there is hardly any prospect that the children will accompany [ the applicant ] if her expulsion were to be implemented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the ORG to ORG , the latter , by a judgment of DATE , upheld ORG judgment , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON gave the following reasons which in the main were endorsed by the CARDINAL other members of the majority :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) I have concluded that the appeal must succeed .", "( DATE ) The expulsion order under review was made pursuant to section CARDINAL ) , of LAW , whereby a foreign national may be expelled when the person concerned has \u2018 grossly or repeatedly contravened one or more provisions of this Act\u2019 . In the present case , there is no doubt that these conditions are met .", "( CARDINAL ) However , the issue is whether the decision satisfies section CARDINAL ) , which reads :", "\u2018 Expulsion pursuant to the first paragraph , ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) shall not be ordered if in consideration of the seriousness of the offence and the foreign national \u2019s connection with the realm , this would be a disproportionately severe reaction against the foreign national [ in question ] or the closest members of the latter \u2019s family.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) This provision suggest that the seriousness of the offence should be weighed against the foreign national \u2019s links to GPE . This is a matter of discretionary application of the law , where the courts have full power of judicial review , see PERSON ( \u201c FAC ) DATE - CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) I will first examine the seriousness of the offence .", "( CARDINAL ) As stated , [ the applicant ] is guilty of repeated and gross breaches of LAW . She came to GPE in contravention of a DATE prohibition on re - entry , cf . sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , as it was then worded . Moreover , she provided incorrect and misleading information concerning her identity , her previous residence in GPE and whether she had previously been sentenced , cf . sections DATE and CARDINAL of the Act . Finally , she has resided and worked here unlawfully , cf . section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) , of the LAW .", "( DATE ) When assessing the seriousness of these offences , one should not attach considerable weight to the assessment of criminal liability . The breaches of LAW must rather be viewed in an administrative law perspective . A major purpose of LAW is to \u2018 provide a basis for control of entry and exit of foreign nationals and of their presence in the realm in accordance with NORP immigration policy\u2019 , cf . section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In view of the large number of applications submitted pursuant to the LAW , the authorities must to a great extent base their control on the assumption that those who apply provide correct information and otherwise abide by the law and decisions taken under it . The system is thus based on trust . Regard for general deterrence therefore indicates that breaches should have consequences for applicants\u2019 possibility of obtaining the rights to which the law applies .", "( CARDINAL ) The views referred to are stated in Proposition No . DATE ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) to the PERSON [ the larger division of ORG ] on [ ... ] the ( ORG ] ) . The following is stated on page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 In the view of the Ministry , it is important to be able to respond with expulsion to cases of repeated and/or gross contraventions of LAW . Although such contraventions may normally also lead to criminal liability , from the point of view of procedural economy , it would be advantageous if an expulsion order could be made even in the absence of a legally enforceable criminal conviction and sentence . This would also enable a rapid reaction . It is noted that it would not be possible for the authorities to exercise effective control of all foreign nationals\u2019 entry to and presence in GPE . The system must to a great extent be based on trust that LAW is complied with by those to whom it applies , including that persons who need a residence permit submit an application and provide correct information to the authorities . Unlawful entry , residence or employment without the requisite permits or the provision of incorrect information breaches this relationship of trust and renders the authorities\u2019 enforcement of NORP immigration policy more difficult . If gross or repeated contraventions of LAW were to be left without consequences it may undermine respect for the legislation and have an unjust effect on those who abide by the law . Since an application would in any event be rejected if a foreign national does not fulfil the conditions for residence in GPE , a negative decision would not in itself constitute a sanction against the provision of incorrect information . The Ministry therefore regards it as important in the interest of general deterrence to be able to respond to cases of gross or repeated contravention of LAW with expulsion.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] \u2019s contravention of LAW gravely affects the control considerations that the LAW is intended to safeguard . In my view , her offences must therefore be characterised as very serious .", "( CARDINAL ) I will now examine whether there exists such a \u2018 connection with ORG that the expulsion is nevertheless disproportionate .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has resided continuously in GPE since DATE . It is nevertheless clear that the attachment she has thereby acquired to GPE does not make the expulsion a disproportionate measure in relation to her . The attachment has been established on the basis of unlawful residence and she has never had any legitimate expectation of being able to stay here . On this point , I find it sufficient to refer to PERSON GPE ORG ) CARDINAL \u201c GPE utlendingslov \u201d ( \u201c QUANTITY ) , page CARDINAL , where the following is stated :", "\u2018 In legal and administrative practice it is assumed that significant weight can not be placed on an attachment developed after the foreign national was aware that he or she could be expelled.\u2019", "( DATE ) CARDINAL and a half years elapsed from the [ applicant ] \u2019s arrest until ORG took its decision to order her expulsion . The long processing time was particularly due to the fact that the expulsion case was not dealt with until her work permit and residence permit had been revoked . If the processing had been conducted in parallel , the time could have been reduced considerably . However , I do not find that this entails that the expulsion is a disproportionate measure in relation to [ the applicant ] herself .", "( DATE ) I will now examine the interests of the children .", "( CARDINAL ) From section CARDINAL ) of LAW it appears that an expulsion must not constitute a disproportionately severe measure vis - \u00e0 - vis \u2018 the closest members of the foreign national \u2019s family\u2019 . As the case now stands , it must be assumed that the children will remain in GPE with the father , and that they will have a considerably reduced contact with the mother during the period which the expulsion applies .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG CARDINAL LAW [ GPE utlendingslov ] states on page CARDINAL that considerable weight ought to be attached to the interests of the children . After affirming that one could not place significant weight on a marriage contracted after the foreign national has become aware that he or she could be expelled , the following is added :", "\u2018 However , if the expelled person has a child of the new relationship , the proportionality assessment may have a different outcome , primarily out of regard for the child , but this question too must depend on a concrete assessment of all relevant considerations.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) The committee proposed that it be clearly stated in the text of the LAW that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration . This was approved by ORG . In Proposition No . DATE ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) to the PERSON on ... the [ new ] LAW , the following is stated on page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 In cases affecting children , the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration . The proposal to include a clarification to this effect in the text of the LAW has been supported by several instances consulted . ORG has pointed out that there is a danger of giving a distorted impression of relevance and importance by focusing on CARDINAL of the considerations that ought to be included in an overall assessment . It is nevertheless the ORG \u2019s view that it is correct to stress the regard for the best interests of the child in the text of the LAW in order to ensure particular awareness of this . This involves no change in relation to current law , but may have a pedagogical significance.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) Such a formulation has now been included in section CARDINAL ) , last sentence , of the new LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) That the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration is also stated in LAW [ providing that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration ] which , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , is applicable as NORP law . At the same time , it is clear that the Convention does not in itself prevent an expulsion order from being made , although this results in separation of the parents from the children . In ORG CARDINAL LAW , the following is stated at page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 However , none of the provisions of LAW on the Rights of the Child in itself prevents an expulsion order from being made . On the contrary , Article CARDINAL ) assumes that the GPE may make expulsion orders even though this would result in the child being separated from its father or mother.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) So far , the sources of law show that the interests of the children are primary , but not necessarily decisive .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG has previously considered the significance of the strain that children are subjected to by expelling one of their parents . The case , Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , concerned the proportionality assessment pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The foreign national concerned had committed what was characterised as \u2018 very serious crime\u2019 . With regard to the question of the applicant \u2019s children , the second voting judge stated DATE for the majority \u2013 that", "\u2018 it is normal for an expulsion to interfere with established family life in a manner involving strain , particularly when one must assume that the family will be separated as a result of the expulsion . However , in order for an expulsion to be deemed a disproportionate measure it must involve an extraordinary burden.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) In Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ORG unanimously concluded that this view must also be adopted in relation to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment it was stated :", "\u2018 I find these assumptions also to be applicable in relation to the provision in section CARDINAL ) of the LAW . When a foreign national has committed very serious crime , expulsion is only disproportionate when it results in an extraordinary burden.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) Paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment further stated :", "\u2018 It is normal for an expulsion to interfere with established family life in a manner involving a burden financially as well as emotionally and socially , and it may easily lead to psychological problems . This applies not least when a family is separated as a result of the expulsion . Such strain is not in itself a sufficient argument for finding an expulsion to be a disproportionate measure.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) As has been shown , both of the cases referred to above concerned expulsion on grounds of very serious crime . However , in line with my view regarding the seriousness of the contraventions of LAW , I find that a corresponding approach should apply in the present case .", "( CARDINAL ) I note that such an interpretation is consistent with LAW of LAW . The case of PERSON v. the GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) concerned a question corresponding to that of the present case . ORG held :", "\u2018 In the present case the ORG takes into consideration that the applicant was never given any assurances that he would be granted a right of residence by the competent GPE authorities . He was allowed to await the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision on his asylum request in the GPE . After asylum was denied him , his request for a stay of expulsion was refused by the competent court on DATE . From then onwards , the applicant \u2019s residence in the GPE , which was already precarious , lost what little foundation it had had until then . Family life between the applicant and his GPE national partner DATE and later , with their child \u2013 was developed after DATE . ORG is of the opinion that in these circumstances the applicant could not at any time reasonably expect to be able to continue this family life in the GPE .... \u2019", "( CARDINAL ) In its subsequent case - law , ORG has stuck to this approach ( see for example the judgment of DATE in the case of and PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . I refer also to ORG judgment in Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL .", "( DATE ) As has been shown above , my view is also consistent with LAW of LAW on the Rights of the Child , cf . Official NORP Report CARDINAL , page CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) I will now carry out a concrete assessment of whether the burden will be extraordinarily great for [ the applicant ] \u2019s children . I agree with the ORG that this assessment must take into consideration that [ the applicant ] is to be expelled for a period of DATE . When this period has elapsed , she may \u2013 like other people \u2013 apply for a residence permit . In my view , an evaluation of the probable outcome of such an application is not relevant to the current review . However , she would have the possibility to obtain judicial review of any rejection .", "( CARDINAL ) As already mentioned , it must be assumed that the children will continue to reside with Mr O .. They have lived with him since ORG by judgment of CARDINAL DATE granted him the DATE care and parental responsibilities in respect of the children . In its judgment , ORG placed great emphasis on the expulsion case , but added :", "\u2018 Like the expert witness , ORG has formed a reasonably good impression of the father , and considers that he is the parent who is best suited to take care of the children in the present situation . In the view of this court , there is much to indicate that the father , regardless of whether the mother after DATE obtains permission to return to GPE , is the party best suited to take care of the children . The father appears more outgoing than the mother . He speaks good NORP , is in employment and seems , to a greater extent than the mother , to be capable of stimulating the children and taking care of them.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) It is further stated in the judgment that Mr O. has stated that he will arrange for the children to have access to [ the applicant ] , also if she is expelled . He envisages that this might be possible during DATE . I have no grounds for assuming that it should not be possible to maintain contact between the children and [ the applicant ] during the expulsion period .", "( DATE ) In view of this , I find it established that the children \u2019s care situation will be satisfactory even if the [ disputed ] decision is upheld . In any event , it will not differ from what is normal in instances where CARDINAL of the parents is expelled from the country . Nor is there anything in the case to indicate that the children are more closely attached to their mother than to their father .", "( CARDINAL ) I add that there is no reason to believe that PERSON ability to assume care will be reduced in the nearest future . If this nevertheless were to occur , it would be possible to grant a dispensation from the prohibition of entry under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , third sentence , of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) There is no information in the case suggesting that the children have a special need for care . Little evidence has been adduced regarding the manner in which the expulsion case has affected the children , though it can not be excluded that it has caused a strain on them too . However , I do not find a basis for assuming that any such burden has been greater than ordinary .", "( CARDINAL ) In the above - mentioned decision reported in Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ORG concluded that the burden on the children had been so great as to make their father \u2019s expulsion a disproportionate measure . However , in that case , the children had special care needs . There was moreover uncertainty regarding the mother \u2019s ability to assume care . Paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment stated :", "\u2018 What is particularly significant in the present case is that both parents have been separated from the children on CARDINAL occasions owing to the circumstances that now constitute the grounds for expulsion , first in connection with their detention on remand and then in connection with their serving their sentences . ORG held that the children \u2018 according to the evidence adduced , have already been frightened by what has happened and by their parents absence during the remand and subsequent imprisonment . This burden would be reinforced by a new absence of the ORG . On the basis of the information received concerning the health of the spouse , there must in my view be a significant risk that she will neither be capable of dealing with the problems that expulsion of A would entail for the children nor with taking care of them . The fact that she will probably be able to obtain some help from her family is unlikely to significantly reduce the strain on the children , which ORG ... finds to be abnormally great.\u2019", "( DATE ) The first voting judge found the weighing of interests \u2018 particularly difficult\u2019 , but concluded \u2018 not without PERSON that the strain on the children was so great as to make the expulsion disproportionate .", "( CARDINAL ) As has been shown above , there are no corresponding circumstances in the present case . On the contrary , we are here faced with a normal situation . I therefore have difficulty in accepting that the strain on the children is so great as to make the expulsion a disproportionate measure .", "( CARDINAL ) The long processing time has also been raised in relation to the children . However , I can not see that this should be of significance in relation to their interests .", "( CARDINAL ) I add that , should the expulsion in the present case be regarded as disproportionate , it would be difficult to envisage when it should be possible to expel a foreign national who has a child with a person holding a residence permit . It would have the consequence that a foreign national in such a situation would normally be protected against expulsion . It would imply a change in current practice , and would moreover have clearly undesirable aspects . In the judgment reported in CARDINAL , the first voting judge expressed corresponding views . Paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment stated , inter alia :", "\u2018 As a general view , I note that , should it be deemed sufficient for obtaining the revocation of an expulsion order that the person concerned seeks political asylum and gives birth to a child here in GPE , the effectiveness of the expulsion order would be considerably undermined.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) I concur with this view . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mrs Justice PERSON gave the following reasons which in the main were endorsed by the other member of the minority :", "\u201c I have found that the appeal should be rejected . Like ORG , I hold the view that the decision to expel [ the applicant ] with a DATE prohibition on re - entry is disproportionate and thereby invalid .", "( CARDINAL ) I concur with the first voting judge that the proportionality assessment must consist of a balancing , on the one hand , of considerations pertaining to the seriousness of the offences of LAW committed by [ the applicant ] and , on the other hand , the interests of [ the applicant ] \u2019s CARDINAL children . The [ the applicant ] \u2019s own interests are not such as to make the decision disproportionate .", "( CARDINAL ) In judgments delivered by ORG in cases concerning expulsion on grounds of serious crime , cf . section CARDINAL ) or section CARDINAL ) of LAW , it has been held that strain owing to the splitting up of families as a result of expulsion is not in itself sufficient to make expulsion a disproportionate measure , cf . for example Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . It has furthermore been established that the more serious the criminal offence , the stronger the attachment must be in order to hinder expulsion , see paragraph CARDINAL of the same judgment .", "( DATE ) It is not certain how one is to judge the seriousness of [ the applicant ] \u2019s contraventions of LAW in relation to this case - law . I concur with the first voting judge that the prescribed penalty scale is not decisive . Regard must be had to the consideration that the purpose of LAW is to provide a basis for control of entry and exit of foreign nationals and of their presence in GPE in compliance with NORP immigration policy , cf . section CARDINAL of the Act . [ The applicant ] \u2019s entry DATE prior to expiry of the prohibition on re - entry and her subsequent continued presence in GPE were made possible by her use of a passport stating a different identity than that used in connection with her first entry and by her concealment of her conviction [ forelegget ] and prohibition on re - entry . This constituted serious contraventions of the legislation designed to safeguard these purposes . On the other hand , it can in my view hardly be correct to place these breaches of LAW on an equal footing with very serious crime .", "( CARDINAL ) As regards the interests of the children , a natural point of departure is LAW , which lays down that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration , inter alia , in cases where children are affected by the exercise of public authority . When assessing the weight to be attached to this consideration in expulsion cases , it is of interest that LAW , which will enter into force from DATE , contains a provision on proportionality , corresponding to that of section CARDINAL ) of LAW [ DATE ] , which states expressly that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in cases affecting children . In Proposition No . DATE ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) to the PERSON , the ORG has stated at page CARDINAL that the proportionality provision is a continuation of the law as currently applicable , but that the addition concerning the best interests of the child is intended to ensure particular awareness of this factor . The majority of ORG which considered the bill , stressed the need to ensure that sufficient regard be had to the best interests of the child in cases concerning expulsion , and requested ORG to consider issuing regulations to ensure that the best interests of the child be safeguarded to an even greater extent in connection with expulsion cases , cf . ORG Recommendation No . DATE ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) No evidence has been presented concerning the effects on young children of separation for DATE from their primary caregiver during early childhood . However , I would mention that ORG on the Rights of the Child in paragraph CARDINAL of its General Comment No . DATE ) points out that young children , i.e. children DATE , are especially vulnerable to adverse consequences of separations from their parents . It states inter alia :", "\u2018 PERSON children are especially vulnerable to adverse consequences of separations because of their physical dependence on and emotional attachment to their parents / primary caregivers . They are also less able to comprehend the circumstances of any separation . Situations which are most likely to impact negatively on young children include ... situations where children experience disrupted relationships ( including enforced separations ) , ... \u2019", "( CARDINAL ) The present case involves CARDINAL girls who are now respectively DATE and DATE . They were born in GPE and have lived there their entire lives . [ The applicant ] was their primary carer from the children \u2019s birth until the father \u2013 as a result of the expulsion case DATE was granted custody DATE . Since then [ the applicant ] has had an extended right of contact with the children . It must be assumed that [ the applicant ] , besides the father , is the most important person in the children \u2019s lives .", "( CARDINAL ) No assessment has been adduced regarding the children \u2019s problems or needs . However , in my view , it must be assumed that they are vulnerable . They have grown up in a family that has lived DATE of stress owing to the threat of expulsion of their mother . The children have experienced the GPE separation and subsequently their being moved from the mother to the father , and are now at an age where separation from the mother will be difficult to understand , cf . the above quotation from General Comment No . CARDINAL . Nor have the children any other relatives or close family in GPE . There can be no doubt that expulsion of [ the applicant ] with a CARDINAL years\u2019 prohibition on re - entry will be a particularly far - reaching measure for the children . In this connection , I would mention that ORG has assumed it to be most unlikely that [ the applicant ] will come to GPE during the period of prohibition on re - entry , and that it is very uncertain that the children will have the opportunity to visit her outside GPE . What will happen when DATE have elapsed is uncertain .", "( CARDINAL ) A survey has been submitted of ORG decisions to expel foreign nationals who have children on the ground of their having submitted incorrect information to the immigration authorities . Counsel for the ORG has referred particularly to CARDINAL decisions from DATE . In both cases , the prohibition on re - entry was reduced to DATE by ORG . The survey does not include such detailed information as to make it possible to see whether a decision in [ the applicant ] \u2019s favour would constitute a departure from these decisions , and I feel somewhat in doubt that these cases involved bonds of equal duration and closeness . Should there be question of a departure , this would be a result of increased emphasis being made on the needs of the children , in my view , in accordance with the indications provided in connection with adoption of the new LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) The first voting judge has stated that , if the expulsion in the present case were held to be disproportionate , it would be difficult to envisage when it should be possible to expel a foreign national who has children together with a person holding a residence permit . I do not agree with this . A concrete assessment must be made balancing the seriousness of the offence against the bonds between the foreign national concerned and the child , and having regard to the child \u2019s situation on the whole . A central factor in this case is the long - term bonds between the children and their mother and the strain to which they have been subjected . In such a situation , it is in my view difficult to reconcile the condition that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration with the view that expulsion of the children \u2019s mother is a proportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the children . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
