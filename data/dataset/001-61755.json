The ORG Secretary \u2018 ORG this undertaking in DATE on grounds of \u2018 the lack of capacity of the custodial clinics , including the Dr F.S. Meijers Institute\u2019 .

This situation only arises where it can no longer reasonably be held that the failure to admit a person to a custodial clinic remains to be justified by the circumstances . Only then can it be said that , although there is a legal basis for the continued detention in a remand centre of a person subject to a ORG order , the further duration of that detention is contrary to what is fitting conduct in society according to unwritten ( customary ) law ( in strijd is met hetgeen volgens ongeschreven recht in het maatschappelijk verkeer betaamt ) .", "PERSON For cases like the present one , this unwritten law is as follows .", "It must be stated first that the ORG order in cases like the present one starts to run from DATE release and that the Minister of ORG , pursuant to LAW as in force until DATE ) , had to decide \u2018 as soon as possible on the admission to a custodial clinic intended to execute the confinement ORG . This did not , however , mean that the Minister of ORG was obliged to ensure that the required capacity for persons subject to a ORG order was available at any given point in time . A certain friction between available and required capacity is indeed acceptable from the point of view of efficient expenditure of financial resources .

This complaint is also well \u2013 founded . The unlawfulness of detention in a remand centre after DATE does not arise from the continued deprivation of liberty but from the failure to start treatment in a timely manner in a custodial clinic intended for this purpose .

ORG found it established that the delay in the admission of the applicant to a custodial clinic constituted an unlawful act in so far as this delay had exceeded a period of DATE .

It agreed with both parties to the proceedings that it could not be determined what had been , in concrete terms , the effect of the applicant \u2019s lengthy stay in the remand centre on his treatment . Relying on a report of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , ORG further held that no general conclusive findings could be made on that issue .

Having found it established that the applicant \u2019s feelings of unrest had become more intense with the passage of time pending admission to a custodial clinic , it further held that he had sustained increasing non - pecuniary damage with the passage of time . As to this aspect , it considered that a DATE increase of the basic amount by NLG DATE on each occasion was , in the present case , in accordance with the requirements of equitable compensation . It consequently fixed the total amount of compensation at NLG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the compensation should be calculated on a DATE basis .
