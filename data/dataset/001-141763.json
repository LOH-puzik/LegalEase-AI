When bringing their civil action , the PERSON family gave the newspaper \u2019s registered office as the GPE address .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the postal service did not succeed in serving the summons and the statement of claim on the applicants at this address , as they were not to be found there .

ORG then asked the police to ascertain the applicants\u2019 addresses .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , after the police had completed their inquiries , they informed it of CARDINAL addresses in GPE : CARDINAL in the LOC neighbourhood ( PERSON no . CARDINAL ) , in respect of Mr PERSON , and the other in the Mecidiyek\u00f6y neighbourhood ( ORG no . CARDINAL ORG ) , in respect of PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

ORG concluded that the applicants had \u201c exceeded the limits of criticism by launching a personal attack on the deceased on the ground of his functions \u201d , especially since he had been a \u201c valorous army commander who [ had ] served the nation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it pointed out that inquiries had been carried out into the defendants\u2019 economic and social situation and that the turnover of the company owning the PERSON newspaper had been ascertained from the tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was not served on Mr PERSON because he no longer lived at the latest address known to the registry ( PERSON ) .

The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the CARDINAL DATE decision .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE challenged the lawfulness of serving the documents in question by publication in the press , contending that this procedure could only be used after all other methods had failed . He pointed out that he had been residing at the same address for DATE , and submitted that the requisite steps had not been taken to find his address . In his view , his address could have been easily ascertained by means of a simple letter to ORG ( PERSON ) or to ORG ( a department operating under the Prime Minister , with responsibility for issuing press passes ) .", "CARDINAL . He pointed out that the judgment had become enforceable on DATE and that the payment order had been drawn up and sent to his home within DATE of that date . Furthermore , the address had been given to ORG by counsel for the PERSON family . He specified that the latter had long been in possession of his address and had deliberately refrained from saying so until the judgment had become final .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , the record did not mention the reason why the documents had not been handed over to him in person .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE Mr PERSON submitted a request for rectification of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that ORG had not made any serious attempt to find his address .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON pointed out that the court had indeed submitted a request to the police and that the report sent to the court had indicated CARDINAL address for each of the other CARDINAL defendants , but that neither of these addresses had concerned him . He specified that the document in the case file contained a handwritten entry \u201c PERSON Is . Ad .

He based his whole line of reasoning on the case - law of ORG , including a judgment delivered by its ORG on DATE ( MONEY E \u2013 CARDINAL/CARDINAL K ) . In this judgment the court had stressed the importance of judicial notices , which were closely linked to the rights of the defence . It had held that efforts to ascertain an address should be very wide - ranging , covering enquiries to government bodies such as municipal councils , civil status and land registries and various professional bodies , and that such action should not be confined to police investigations .", "CARDINAL .

In support of their application , they submitted that criminal proceedings for an attempted coup ORG had been instituted against senior army officers who had been on ORG in DATE , and that those concerned had been taken into pre - trial detention . According to the applicants , this was a new fact that had been unknown to the court at the time of the judgment . They pointed out that this fact was liable to cast doubt on the court \u2019s use of such laudatory expressions as \u201c valorous army commander who served the nation \u201d in connection with the deceased . Furthermore , the applicants submitted that the applications which they had lodged with ORG were currently under examination and that a finding of a violation of the LAW was a ground for reopening the proceedings .
