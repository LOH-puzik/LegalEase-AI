The forensic medical experts also concluded that the medicine administered to ORG had been appropriate and had not caused his breathing to stop . They considered that the restraining of O. to the bed could have been justified in the instant case . As the characteristics corresponding to brain death had been ascertained , the discontinuation of feeding and the continuation of infusion therapy had been medically justified . The experts also concluded that the mechanical ventilation had been turned off only after his heart had stopped and thus could not have been the cause of his death . The forensic medical assessment found that ORG \u2019s death had been caused by malignant melanoma with multiple metastases , with further complications of cerebral haemorrhage and oedema .", "CARDINAL .
