Mr PERSON , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , is a NORP and a follower of ORG in GPE . In DATE he decided to set up PERSON ORG , through which he would apply for a broadcasting licence for a religious radio station . He obtained support for this initiative from many domestic and foreign religious figures of various denominations , as well as from ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG announced that a number of frequencies for local radio broadcasting would be made available to private operators in several cities . CARDINAL such licences were available for GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON EOOD applied to ORG ( \u201c the STC \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) for a broadcasting licence for a radio station with NORP religious programming for GPE . In support of its application it presented , inter alia , a business plan , a programme project , a programme concept , a programme profile , and a programme scheme . It was apparent from these that it intended to broadcast mainly NORP religious programming .", "CARDINAL . NORP In line with the established procedure , the application was forwarded to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . After deliberating on the application on DATE , the ORG refused in a decision of DATE , which was not notified to PERSON ORG , to grant a broadcasting licence . It stated , without adding further detail , that although the company had submitted all the requisite documents , its programme documents did not correspond to points CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG 's criteria for licensing regional overtheair radio operators , and only partly corresponded to points CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Furthermore , PERSON ORG had no prior experience of creating programmes in the region .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the established procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , this decision was sent to the STC .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the ORG refused to grant a broadcasting licence to PERSON ORG . It stated that its refusal was based on the ORG 's decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON EOOD lodged an application for judicial review of the ORG 's decision with ORG . It submitted that , since it was not clear whether the ORG 's decision was subject to direct review , the court should first examine its lawfulness before ruling on the lawfulness of the ORG 's decision . PERSON ORG further argued that it had produced all of the requisite documents , each of which corresponded to the ORG 's criteria . The fact that no reasons had been given on how , in the ORG 's view , these documents failed to meet the criteria , was in breach of the rules of procedure and the requirement that administrative decisions be reasoned . On the contrary , all of the ORG 's criteria had been complied with . The decisions had also been in breach of the substantive law and did not correspond to the latter 's object and purpose . In a supplementary memorial PERSON ORG made detailed submissions in respect of each of its alleged failures to comply with the relevant ORG criteria .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , a threemember panel of ORG dismissed the application . It held that the ORG 's decision was subject to review in separate proceedings . However , PERSON ORG had not sought such review , whereas indirect review of that decision in proceedings against the ORG 's decision was impossible . The court went on to say that the ORG 's decision concerned the allocation of the radio spectrum , whereas the ORG 's decision related to the broadcasting content . It was therefore impossible to grant a broadcasting licence without a prior finding by the ORG that it would be used for broadcasting quality programmes . In issuing its decision , the ORG was therefore bound by the ORG 's decision and the latter 's refusal had effectively precluded the former from granting the requested licence .", "CARDINAL . PERSON EOOD appealed on points of law to a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG . It argued , inter alia , that while it could be accepted that the ORG 's refusal was binding on the STC , the former was bound to give reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE the fivemember panel of ORG upheld the CARDINAL - member panel 's judgment , holding , inter alia , that the STC was bound by the ORG 's decision and could not have reviewed its lawfulness . Nor could the court , in proceedings against the ORG 's decision , examine the lawfulness of the ORG 's decision . It could do so only pursuant to an application for judicial review of the latter 's decision .", "CARDINAL . Having been apprised of the tenor of the ORG 's decision in the course of the proceedings for judicial review of the ORG 's decision , on DATE PERSON made an application for its judicial review . It submitted that it had provided all necessary documents , thus establishing that it had complied with the ORG 's licensing criteria . However , that body had not pointed out any perceived deficiencies , thus failing to provide a duly reasoned decision and acting in breach of the rules of administrative procedure .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE a threemember panel of ORG dismissed the application . It held that the ORG 's assessment of whether the licence application met its criteria was not subject to judicial scrutiny , since the ORG enjoyed discretion in that respect . In the instant case it had found that the programme documents submitted by PERSON ORG did not meet its requirements for regional targeting , societal function and business perspective of the programming , and only partially met its criteria regarding the justification and uniqueness of its programme profile , conformity with the audience 's expectations and professional and technological resources . These findings fell within the exclusive province of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . PERSON EOOD appealed on points of law to a fivemember panel of ORG , reiterating its arguments .", "CARDINAL .

The provisions of the [ Telecommunications Act DATE ] relate to licensing for the setting up of telecommunications networks and the provision of services through the radio frequency spectrum . Supervision of the preparation , creation and broadcasting of radio and television programmes ... falls outside the competence of the STC .", "As regards the media , and radio and television in particular , there exists the instruction [ implicit ] in LAW that they be transformed into autonomous public institutions , freed of the tutelage of a specific government agency .

These are CARDINAL differing types of activity : the first mainly monitors compliance with technological requirements under the [ Telecommunications Act DATE ] , whereas the second monitors aesthetical and artistic qualities under the [ LAW DATE ] . At the same time , the media law does not allow the independence of the procedure for issuing radio and television licences to be called into question , because section CARDINAL of the [ LAW DATE ] instructs the ORG to make a reasoned decision on each application for a licence for electronic media broadcasting .
