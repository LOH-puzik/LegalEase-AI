The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE , an important steel - producing centre QUANTITY north - east of GPE . In DATE her family moved to a flat situated at CARDINAL Zhukov Street , QUANTITY from the site of the Severstal steel plant ( \u201c the plant \u201d ) . This flat was provided by the plant to the applicant 's husband , PERSON , under a tenancy agreement .", "CARDINAL . The plant was built during the NORP era and was owned by ORG of the Russian NORP Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) . The plant was , and remains , the largest iron smelter in GPE and the main employer for CARDINAL people . In order to delimit the areas in which the pollution caused by steel production might be excessive , the authorities established a buffer zone around the Severstal premises \u2013 \u201c the sanitary security zone \u201d . This zone was first delimited in DATE . It covered a CARDINAL,CARDINAL-metre - wide area around the site of the plant . Although this zone was , in theory , supposed to separate the plant from the town 's residential areas , in practice CARDINAL of people ( including the applicant 's family ) lived there . The blocks of flats in the zone belonged to the plant and were designated mainly for its workers , who occupied the flats as life - long tenants ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . A decree of ORG , dated DATE , imposed on ORG the obligation to resettle the inhabitants of the sanitary security zone who lived in districts nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL by DATE . However , this has not been done .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the government of the ORG adopted a programme \u201c On improving the environmental situation in GPE \u201d . The programme stated that \u201c the concentration of toxic substances in the town 's air exceed[ed ] the acceptable norms many times \u201d and that the morbidity rate of GPE residents was higher than the average . It was noted that many people still lived within the steel plant 's sanitary security zone . Under the programme , the steel plant was required to reduce its toxic emissions to safe levels by DATE . The programme listed a number of specific technological measures to attain this goal . The steel plant was also ordered to finance the construction of QUANTITY of residential property DATE for the resettlement of people living within its sanitary security zone .", "CARDINAL . By Municipal Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , the boundaries of the sanitary security zone around the plant were redefined . The width of the zone was reduced to QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the steel plant was privatised and acquired by ORG . In the course of the privatisation the blocks of flats owned by the steel plant that were situated within the zone were transferred to the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government of GPE adopted Decree no . CARDINAL on the special federal programme \u201c Improvement of the environmental situation and public health in GPE \u201d for DATE \u201d ( in DATE this programme was replaced by the special federal programme \u201c GPE 's ecology and natural resources \u201d ) . Implementation of the DATE programme was funded by ORG . The second paragraph of this programme stated :", "\u201c The concentration of certain polluting substances in the town 's residential areas is CARDINAL times higher than the maximum permissible limits ( MPLs ) [ ] ... The biggest ' contributor ' to atmospheric pollution is ORG , which is responsible for PERCENT of all emissions . The highest level of air pollution is registered in the residential districts immediately adjacent to ORG 's industrial site . The principal cause of the emission of toxic substances into the atmosphere is the operation of archaic and ecologically dangerous technologies and equipment in metallurgic and other industries , as well as the low efficiency of gas - cleaning systems . The situation is aggravated by an almost complete overlap of industrial and residential areas of the city , in the absence of their separation by sanitary security zones . \u201d", "The decree further stated that \u201c the environmental situation in the city ha[d ] resulted in a continuing deterioration in public health \u201d . In particular , it stated that over the period from DATE the number of children with respiratory diseases increased from CARDINAL to CARDINAL cases per CARDINAL , those with blood and haematogenic diseases from CARDINAL cases per CARDINAL , and those with skin diseases from CARDINAL to CARDINAL cases per CARDINAL . The decree also noted that the high level of atmospheric pollution accounted for the increase in respiratory and blood diseases among the city 's adult population and the increased number of deaths from cancer .", "CARDINAL . Most of the measures proposed in the programme concerned the functioning of the Severstal steel plant . The decree also enumerated a number of measures concerning the city as a whole : these included the resettlement of CARDINAL people from ORG 's sanitary security zone . It transpires from the programme that the ORG was supposed to be the main source of funding for such resettlement . However , it seems that in subsequent DATE ORG continued to pay for the resettlement of the zone 's inhabitants , at least as regards districts nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Thus , according to Decree no . CARDINAL by the mayor of GPE dated DATE , in DATE the residents of the blocks of flats situated on FAC were resettled in another district of the city . According to a letter of DATE from the mayor of GPE , ORG funded CARDINAL of the cost of resettlement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief sanitary inspector for GPE decided that the width of the sanitary security zone should be QUANTITY from the main sources of industrial pollution . However , no specific boundaries were identified for the zone . In DATE the municipality challenged its own Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , which had established the zone 's boundaries ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the ORG declared Decree no . CARDINAL invalid on the ground that it was ultra vires . ORG ruled that at the relevant time the municipality had not had jurisdiction to define the width of the zone . The boundaries of the sanitary security zone around the Severstal facilities currently remain undefined .", "CARDINAL . In DATE implementation of the DATE government programme was discontinued and the measures proposed in it were included in the corresponding section of the sub - programme \u201c Regulation of environmental quality \u201d in the special federal programme \u201c GPE 's ecology and natural resources ( DATE ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter from the mayor of GPE dated DATE , in DATE the plant was responsible for PERCENT of industrial emissions into the town 's air . According to ORG on ORG , the ORG plant in GPE was the largest contributor to air pollution of all metallurgical plants in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , with her family and various other residents of the block of flats where she lived , brought a court action seeking resettlement outside the zone . The applicant claimed that the concentration of toxic elements and the noise levels in the sanitary security zone exceeded the maximum permissible limits established by NORP legislation . The applicant alleged that the environmental situation in the zone was hazardous for humans , and that living there was potentially dangerous to health and life . In support of her claims she relied mainly on the city planning regulations of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . According to the applicant , these regulations imposed an obligation on the plant 's owners to implement various ecological measures in the zone , including the resettlement of residents in an ecologically safe area . The applicant claimed that ORG had failed to fulfil this obligation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined the applicant 's action . The court recognised that the building at LOC , where she lived , was located within ORG 's sanitary security zone . The court noted that , prior to DATE , the applicant 's flat had been owned by ORG , which had also owned the plant . Following privatisation of the plant in DATE , it had become a privately owned entity and the applicant 's flat had become the property of the local authorities . Referring to the ministerial decree of DATE , the court found that the authorities ought to have resettled all of the zone 's residents but that they had failed to do so . In view of those findings , the court accepted the applicant 's claim in principle , stating that she had the right in domestic law to be resettled . However , no specific order to resettle the applicant was given by the court in the operative part of its judgment . Instead , the court stated that the local authorities must place her on a \u201c priority waiting list \u201d to obtain new local authority housing ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The court also stated that the applicant 's resettlement was conditional on the availability of funds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , claiming that the obligation to resettle was on the plant rather than on the municipality . She also maintained that the court had distorted the object of her claim : whereas she had been seeking immediate resettlement , the court had ordered that she be placed on a waiting list . In the applicant 's view , this decision was unworkable because its enforcement depended on too many conditions ( the existence of a resettlement order , the number of people on the waiting list , the availability of funds for resettlement , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld in principle the decision of DATE , and confirmed that the applicant 's home was located within the Severstal steel plant 's sanitary security zone . The appeal court further found that the applicant 's resettlement in an ecologically safe area was to be carried out by the municipality . Finally , the appeal court excluded from the operative part of the judgment the reference to the availability of funds as a precondition for the applicant 's resettlement .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court issued an execution warrant and transmitted it to a bailiff . However , the decision remained unexecuted for a certain period of time . In a letter of DATE , the deputy mayor of GPE explained that enforcement of the judgment was blocked , since there were no regulations establishing the procedure for the resettlement of residents outside the zone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff discontinued the enforcement proceedings on the ground that there was no \u201c priority waiting list \u201d for new housing for residents of the sanitary security zone .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a fresh action against the municipality , seeking immediate execution of the judgment of DATE . The applicant claimed , inter alia , that systematic toxic emissions and noise from ORG facilities violated her basic right to respect for her private life and home , as guaranteed by LAW and LAW . She asked to be provided with a flat in an ecologically safe area or with the means to purchase a new flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality placed the applicant on the general waiting list for new housing . She was no . CARDINAL on that list ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's action . It noted that there was no \u201c priority waiting list \u201d for the resettlement of residents of sanitary security zones , and no council housing had been allocated for that purpose . It concluded that the applicant had been duly placed on the general waiting list . The court held that the judgment of DATE had been executed and that there was no need to take any further measures . That judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG authorities conduct regular inspections of air quality in the city .

The applicant further produced a study paper entitled \u201c Economic effectiveness of public health measures at ORG \u201d , drawn up by ORG , a public body established in DATE under the supervision of the then ORG . The study was commissioned by the GPE municipality in order to obtain an analysis of the cost - effectiveness of various measures suggested in the DATE federal programme . The expert team had access to data on CARDINAL polluting elements contained in industrial emissions from the Severstal plant . The experts singled out the CARDINAL most toxic elements and , using a special dispersion dissemination model , established how these elements affected the morbidity rate in the city . The experts then calculated how the implementation of one or another measure from the federal programme would reduce the concentration of these pollutants , and , consequently , to what extent the morbidity rate would decrease .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant informed the ORG that further information on atmospheric pollution could be requested from the respondent Government . In particular , the applicant sought to obtain : ( a ) baseline emissions data for the Severstal plant , including data on the physical parameters of the stacks and the volume of chemicals emitted DATE by each process at the Severstal facility ; ( b ) dispersion modelling data for estimating the ambient air concentration of CARDINAL toxic pollutants at each of the x and y coordinate locations on the GPE city grid , based on the above emissions data . The applicant indicated that this information might be obtained from ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant also sought data on the ambient air quality in GPE , obtained DATE as part of ORG in GPE , implemented with financial support from ORG .
