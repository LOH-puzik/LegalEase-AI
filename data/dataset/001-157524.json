The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are legal successors of the former owners of a property in the vicinity of GPE , called PERSON , composed of a number of plots owned by several individuals .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the then owners of the property , including ORG , the ORG mother , were obliged by an administrative decision to transfer their land to ORG without compensation within the framework of a larger expropriation scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON w PERSON ) gave a decision concerning the applicants and CARDINAL other persons , legal successors of the other former owners expropriated by the DATE decision . It declared that that decision had been issued in flagrant breach of the law in force at the material time . The parties were further informed that the corrective decision gave rise to a compensation claim on their part for damage caused by the original unlawful decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought compensation for damage caused by the decision given in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 claim and awarded MONEY ( ORG ) to each of them , corresponding to the value of the expropriated land . It held that the conditions determining civil liability in tort , namely a tortious event which caused damage and the establishment of a causal link between the event and the damage , were met in the case . In respect of tort committed by ORG and caused by unlawful administrative decisions compensation could be sought only after a subsequent decision declared that the original administrative decision was unlawful . Such a corrective decision ( decyzja nadzorcza ) had been given in the applicants\u2019 case in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL alia , Article CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Procedure and enacted Article CARDINAL CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . NORP The defendant ORG , represented by the mayor of GPE , appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal and dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . It endorsed the findings of fact made by the lower court as to the existence of pecuniary damage and the causal link between the DATE decision and that damage . However , it was of the view that the provisions concerning the ORG \u2019s civil liability in tort should have been interpreted differently by the first - instance court , in particular as to the determination of the prescription period . The court observed that under the communist regime it was practically impossible , essentially for political reasons , to vindicate claims originating in unlawful administrative decisions or to seek compensation from ORG for damage in tort caused by such decisions . The earliest date on which it was possible to do so was DATE , when the first partially free parliamentary elections were held in GPE . It was from that date that the prescription period of DATE provided for by LAW started to run . The applicants should have availed themselves of the available remedy , namely they should have obtained a decision declaring the original expropriation decision unlawful prior to DATE when the DATE prescription period came to an end .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . They argued that the contested judgment was in breach of LAW in so far as it guaranteed the right to compensation for damage caused by the ORG . Neither the damage caused by the DATE decision nor its unlawfulness were in dispute between the parties .", "They further submitted that the case raised a significant legal issue in so far as there were divergent strands of case - law regarding the interpretation of legal provisions governing the ORG \u2019s civil liability for administrative decisions made prior to DATE and declared unlawful after that date . These differences in the judicial approach to similar cases , both as to the determination of the beginning of the prescription period and as to its length , had a decisive influence on the outcome of compensation cases brought by victims of unlawful administrative decisions and on the applicants\u2019 case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera as a single judge , refused to hear the applicants\u2019 appeal on points of law , holding that it did not raise any significant legal issue .", "CARDINAL . Parallel to the applicants\u2019 case , ORG , a successor of another owner expropriated by the same expropriation decision given in DATE and covered by the same corrective decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , sought compensation in civil proceedings for damage caused by the original decision . She lodged her claim with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed her claim and awarded her compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL , corresponding to the value of the plot of land owned by ORG \u2019s legal predecessor . It recounted briefly the divergent views expressed by the civil courts , including ORG , in cases concerning claims for pecuniary damage caused by administrative decisions declared unlawful after DATE . It noted that the manner in which the provisions concerning the ORG \u2019s liability in tort for unlawful administrative decisions were interpreted had given rise to serious difficulties and differences of opinion in judicial practice . It disagreed with the view expressed in certain judicial decisions that the DATE prescription period for bringing compensation claims before the courts had started to run when the unlawful decision had been given , but its running was subsequently stayed until DATE . ORG was of the view that the CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . On DATE R.W. , another legal successor of the original owners , brought a compensation case before ORG , claiming compensation from ORG , represented by the mayor of GPE , for damage originating in the DATE decision . He also referred to the corrective decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG allowed his claim and awarded him ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , corresponding to the value of the land concerned . The court stressed that it was not in dispute that the original administrative decision had been unlawful . Nor was it in dispute that that decision had caused damage to the claimant . The court referred to the resolution given by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It shared the view expressed by ORG in this resolution that it was not justified to interpret the applicable provisions in a way imposing on the applicant an obligation to seek a declaration of unlawfulness of the original administrative decision within DATE after DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
