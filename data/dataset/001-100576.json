The court decision referred to the police report and statements of CARDINAL of the policemen who had allegedly arrested the applicant near the metro station .

Damage caused to a citizen as a result of unlawful conviction , unlawful criminal prosecution , ... unlawful administrative detention ... shall be compensated at the expense of the ORG of GPE , and in the instances provided for by law , at the expense of the ORG of the subject of GPE ... in full , irrespective of the fault of the officials of the agencies ... \u201d", "The Civil Code provides that the damage caused by an unlawful criminal prosecution should be compensated irrespective of the fault of the tortfeasor ( that is , the ORG agency which decided to prosecute , detain and so on ) . However , the notions of \u201c unlawful \u201d prosecution or detention ( see LAW ) are not developed in the relevant provisions of LAW . Certain guidelines on this subject may be obtained from Decree No . CARDINAL-X of ORG of DATE , which concerns compensation for damage caused by unlawful acts by law - enforcement agencies . For example , point CARDINAL of that Decree provides that an acquitted person has the right to obtain damages from the ORG ; the only exception concerns cases when the person was charged after making a false confession . Furthermore , in the case of PERSON ( published in the Bulletin of ORG , DATE \u0433. , ORG , page CARDINAL ) , ORG of GPE used the following wording : \u201c ... unlawful attribution of criminal liability , namely when an acquittal judgment was given ... \u201d . These words , as well as the subsequent judicial practice suggest that the domestic courts regard criminal proceedings which ended with an acquittal to be \u201c unlawful \u201d as such . Therefore , if there was an acquittal , remand in custody would be \u201c unlawful \u201d even if all the substantive and procedural rules were complied with when it had been imposed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
