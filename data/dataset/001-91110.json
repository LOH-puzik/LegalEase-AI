She was represented before the Court by Mr J. Tuutti , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The police suspected the applicant \u2019s husband of an aggravated drugs offence . They obtained permission to place his telephone under secret surveillance .", "On DATE the applicant phoned a third person , PERSON , requesting him to come over and bring along a bag containing items belonging to her husband . The police intercepted this conversation . The facts are not clear on whether the conversation was recorded or not but , at any rate , it was cited in the subsequent criminal complaint and included in the pre - trial investigation material .", "By a letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s husband lodged a complaint with ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) criticising the conduct of the police , in particular their use and handling of the information obtained through the surveillance .", "The Deputy Ombudsman ( eduskunnan apulaisoikeusasiamies , riksdagens bitr\u00e4dande justitieombudsman , hereinafter \u201c the Ombudsman \u201d ) procured statements from ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) and from Chief PERSON , who had been in charge of the investigation . In his decision of DATE , the ORG noted , in regard to the above - mentioned conversation between the applicant and PERSON , that permission to intercept a suspect \u2019s telephone conversations did not authorise the police to intercept conversations involving persons other than the suspect . In his view , this kind of conversation could not even be regarded as superfluous information and the interception should have been stopped as soon as it was evident that the conversation did not involve the suspect . He further noted that interception of telecommunications constituted an interference with the essence of the secrecy of communications protected under LAW .", "The documents submitted to the ORG did not suggest that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s conversations with a person other than her husband had been intercepted . According to Chief Inspector A. , CARDINAL telephone conversation , that of DATE , was referred to in the pre - trial material and it was not included verbatim . The ORG stated that the police should not have intercepted the conversation between the applicant and PERSON Although the conversation had apparently not been very long , the interception seemed to have lasted longer than was acceptable , under the circumstances , to identify the persons speaking . Even if the conversation had not been recorded , its contents had been included in the pre - trial material in quite detailed terms either from memory or from notes . The information thus obtained was later used in the questioning of PERSON , who was suspected of a drugs offence . The ORG concluded that the interception of the conversation , having lasted longer than necessary , and the inclusion of its contents in the pre - trial material constituted an unlawful act .", "The ORG found , however , that there was no reason to suspect that the act was anything other than a CARDINAL - off mistake . He also considered its impact quite trivial under the circumstances . However he stressed the importance of the principle at stake . He did not find it necessary to engage in investigating which police officer should be held accountable for the unlawful act . He considered it sufficient to express his opinion on the matter to Chief Inspector A. and to the head of ORG . This opinion was also to be forwarded , for future guidance , to the police officers who had been involved in the investigation in question .", "The applicant did not resort to any other domestic remedies .", "Under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngmedelslag , Act no . PERSON , as amended by Act no .

According to LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the said LAW , the permission is granted by a competent court on the investigating authority \u2019s request for a limited period of time .", "The LAW ( PERSON , PERSON grundlag , Act no .

LAW applied to the right of the injured party to bring a charge for an offence in public office ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .
