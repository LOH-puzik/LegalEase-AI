Citizens\u2019 enjoyment of the right to disseminate information concerning the question of an individual \u2019s sexual self - determination ought not to infringe the rights and freedoms of others ; in regulating of this right by means of legislation , it is necessary to ensure that a balance is struck between the values protected by LAW . Consequently , bearing in mind the sensitive nature of such questions , since they belong to the sphere of individual autonomy , and without encroaching on its very essence , the ORG is entitled to introduce , on the basis of the above - mentioned requirements of LAW , specific restrictions on activities linked with the dissemination of such information if it becomes aggressive [ and ] importuning in nature and is capable of causing harm to the rights and legal interests of others , primarily minors , and is offensive in form .", "... In so far as one of the roles of the family is [ to provide for ] the birth and upbringing of children , an understanding of marriage as the union of a man and a woman underlies the legislative approach to resolving demographic and social issues in the area of family relations in GPE ...", "Regulation of freedom of speech and the freedom to disseminate information does not presuppose the creation of conditions which would facilitate the formation of other interpretations of the family as an institution , and the associated social and legal institutions , which would differ from the generally accepted interpretations nor society \u2019s approval of them as being equivalent in value ...", "These aims also determine the need to protect the child from the influence of information that is capable of causing harm to his or her health or development , particularly information that is combined with an aggressive imposition of specific models of sexual conduct , giving rise to distorted representations of the socially accepted models of family relations corresponding to the moral values that are generally accepted in NORP society , as these are expressed in the LAW and legislation .", "...", "In order to ensure the child \u2019s healthy development , GPE are required , in particular , to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual perversion .", "...", "The aim pursued by the federal legislature in establishing the given norm was to protect children from the impact of information that could lead them into non - traditional sexual relations , a predilection for which would prevent them from building family relationships as these are traditionally understood in GPE and expressed in LAW . ORG of GPE acknowledges that the possible impact on the child \u2019s future life of the information in question , even when delivered in a persistent manner , has not been proven beyond doubt . Nonetheless , in assessing the necessity of introducing one or another restriction , the federal legislature is entitled to use criteria that are based on the presumption that there exists a threat to the child \u2019s interests , especially as the restrictions introduced by it concern only the tendency of the information in question to target persons of a given age group , and can not therefore be regarded as excluding the possibility of exercising one \u2019s constitutional right to freedom of information in this area . ...", "The prohibition on public activities in relation to minors is intended to prevent their attention being increasingly focused on issues concerning sexual relations , which are capable , in unfavourable circumstances , of deforming significantly the child \u2019s understanding of such constitutional values as the family , motherhood , fatherhood and childhood , and adversely affecting not only his or her psychological state and development , but also his or her social adaptation . The fact that this ban does not extend to situations concerning the promotion of immoral conduct in the context of traditional sexual relationships , which may also require ORG regulation , including through [ the existence of ] administrative offences , is not grounds for finding that the given norm is incompatible with LAW from the perspective of infringing the principles of equality as applied to the protection of LAW values , which ensure the uninterrupted replacement of generations ...", "The imposition on minors of a set of social values which differ from those that are generally accepted in NORP society , and which are not shared by and indeed frequently perceived as unacceptable by parents \u2013 who bear primary responsibility for their children \u2019s development and upbringing and are required to provide for their health and their physical , psychological , spiritual and moral development \u2013 ... may result in the child \u2019s social estrangement and prevent his or her development within the family , especially if one considers that equality of rights as set out in the LAW , which also presupposes equality of rights irrespective of sexual orientation , does not yet guarantee that persons with a different sexual orientation are actually regarded in equal terms by public opinion ; this situation may entail objective difficulties when trying to avoid negative attitudes from individual members of society towards those persons on a day - to - DATE level . This is also true for instances where the very information that is banned from dissemination to minors may be intended , from the disseminator \u2019s perspective , to overcome such negative attitudes towards persons with a different sexual orientation ...", "The prohibition on the promotion of non - traditional sexual relationships does not in itself exclude the information in question from being presented in a neutral ( educational , artistic , historical ) context . Such transmission of information , if it is devoid of indications of promotion , that is , if it is not aimed at creating preferences linked to the choice of non - traditional forms of sexual identity and ensures an individualised approach , taking into account the specific features of the psychological and physiological development of children in a given age group and the nature of the specific issue being clarified , may be conducted with the help of experts such as teachers , doctors or psychologists .", "... does not signify a negative appraisal by the ORG of non - traditional sexual relationships as such , and is not intended to belittle the honour and dignity of citizens who are involved in such relationships ...", "... can not be regarded as containing official censure for non - traditional sexual relationships , in particular homosexuality , far less their prohibition ...", "... the person [ disseminating information ] must understand that what appears to him or her as the straightforward provision of information may , in a specific situation , resemble activism ( promotion ) , if it is shown that the aim was to disseminate ( or especially to impose ) information with the above - mentioned content .
