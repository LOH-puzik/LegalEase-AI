On DATE the ORG convicted the defendants of forgery and negligent bookkeeping , and acquitted them of the original charges of embezzlement and fraud .", "CARDINAL . By the same judgment , the trial court decided to leave the applicant \u2019s civil claims \u201c without examination \u201d . The court noted that the defendants had neither been accused of nor tried for offences which could have caused damage to the applicant \u2019s interests as a shareholder . It further reasoned that , as a shareholder , the applicant had no entitlement to any part of the property of a joint - stock company . Only if the company had been liquidated could she claim a part of its property , together with other shareholders . It noted that the applicant had a possibility to pursue her claims by way of a separate civil action . The court concluded that \u201c the applicant should not be deemed a victim or civil claimant in this case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that she had incurred significant pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , particularly as the examination of the case had taken DATE . She reiterated that the criminal case had been instituted on the basis of her civil action , and that she had been granted the status of victim and civil claimant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted :", "\u201c The victim , ORG , took part in the examination of the case throughout the proceedings ; she was entitled [ inter alia ] to submit a civil claim and the evidence in order to substantiate it . However ... the submission of a civil claim does not presuppose the obligation on the part of the court to satisfy it . ... The first - instance court has reasonably established that the victim \u2019s right to part of the company \u2019s property would only arise in accordance with company law , and has correctly noted that [ the applicant ] could defend her property rights in accordance with the civil procedure . ...", "When adopting the ... judgment , the court must also decide on the civil claim . Civil claims can only be granted if [ the defendants are convicted ] , and it is established that the civil claimant had suffered pecuniary damage due to the criminal acts in question ; finally , there must be a causal link between the criminal actions and the damage incurred . ...", "The defendants were not tried for any offence which could have caused damage to [ the applicant ] . ...", "As to [ the applicant \u2019s ] property rights , they are not the object of this criminal case . It is the object of civil law and has only to be decided in accordance with the civil proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the examination of the case had been unjustifiably long , in breach of LAW , LAW and LAW . The court concluded however that , despite the acknowledgement of the breach , \u201c it was not possible to remedy this flaw at the current stage of the proceedings \u201d . On DATE , the judgment of DATE entered into force .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , complaining , inter alia , that the courts had failed to bring additional charges of forgery against the defendants , which would have allowed their conviction and the satisfaction of her civil claims . She also alleged that the length of the proceedings had been excessive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal . ORG established that the prosecution had rightly refused to bring additional charges against the defendants , as they had found no evidence of the crimes alleged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the applicant \u2019s civil claims , ORG noted that her entitlement to a certain number of shares had not been questioned . It also found that , in the share certificates issued by the defendants , the number and value of shares belonging to the applicant had been wrongly calculated and did not correspond to the data appearing in the company \u2019s statute . ORG concluded , however , that this error did not restrict the applicant \u2019s rights as a shareholder ; nor did it cause her any pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage . ORG further concluded that , in such circumstances , there had been no basis to grant the applicant the status of a civil claimant .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG endorsed the findings of the appellate court as to the length of the proceedings . It emphasised , however , that it was not reasonable to consider that the excessive length was an \u201c essential violation \u201d of LAW since , in such a case , the decisions of the lower courts would have to be quashed , and this would have only further prolonged the examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not bring a new civil action .", "\u201c The person whose constitutional rights or freedoms are violated shall have the right to apply to court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ruling of ORG of DATE stipulates :", "\u201c ... by virtue of the LAW , a person has the right to claim compensation for damage caused by the unlawful actions of ORG institutions and agents , even if such compensation is not foreseen by law ; the courts adjudicating such cases ... have the power to award appropriate compensation by directly applying the principles of the LAW ... as well as the general principles of law , while being guided inter alia by the principle of reasonableness , etc \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
