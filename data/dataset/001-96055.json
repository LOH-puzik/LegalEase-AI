He was represented before the Court by Mr Z. Cicho\u0144 , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr J. PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant got married and on DATE the applicant \u2019s wife gave birth to a girl , J.", "The applicant did not try to rebut the legal presumption that he was J \u2019s father . Subsequently , a second daughter was born of the applicant \u2019s marriage .", "In DATE the applicant divorced from his wife . The court awarded custody of the children to the applicant \u2019s former wife and ordered the applicant to pay child maintenance for them . No doubts as to the applicant \u2019s paternity were raised in the divorce proceedings .", "The applicant submitted that he had had doubts as to his paternity of his older daughter since the beginning of his marriage which had been reinforced during the divorce proceedings when his wife had admitted to infidelity . However , the applicant had neither brought an action denying paternity after the birth of J nor raised doubts as to his paternity in the divorce proceedings , considering that at the material time there had been no reliable scientific method of ascertaining that he was not the biological father of J. When DNA evidence had become possible in GPE and the applicant had decided to bring an action denying paternity , J had refused to undergo the test .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) to initiate civil proceedings by which he could deny his paternity of J. The applicant based his application on his personal conviction that J was not his daughter and on his suspicion that a certain PERSON could be her biological father .", "On DATE the applicant supplemented his application by submitting documents that had been requested by the prosecutor .", "Subsequently , the prosecutor obtained the case file of the applicant \u2019s divorce proceedings from DATE and heard testimonies from the applicant \u2019s former wife . She denied having had an affair with PERSON , who had been her employer at the material time , and confirmed that the applicant was the father of her children . She also refused to submit to DNA testing .", "On CARDINAL occasions in DATE the prosecutor attempted to hear evidence from the applicant , but he failed to reply to the summons .", "On DATE the prosecutor sent him a letter refusing to initiate such proceedings . The prosecutor based that decision on the statements by the applicant \u2019s former wife that the applicant was the biological father of J. As the applicant himself had failed to appear for interview with the prosecutor and his former wife had refused to undergo a DNA test , the prosecutor concluded that there was no evidence supporting the applicant \u2019s request .", "The applicant contested this decision . On DATE ORG ( Prokurator Okr\u0119gowy ) informed him that he fully agreed with the findings of ORG . On DATE the applicant appeared before the prosecutor without being summoned .", "On DATE ORG questioned the applicant and again dismissed his request to bring civil proceedings denying his paternity . The prosecutor considered that it was not possible to grant the applicant \u2019s request solely on the basis of his statement . The prosecutor pointed to the fact that the applicant had not denied his paternity in the divorce proceedings DATE and that his former wife had confirmed that he was the biological father of J. In those circumstances only genetic evidence could cast doubt on the presumption that the applicant was the father of J. Such a medical test could be ordered by the prosecutor ; however , in the instant case it had not been possible given the lack of consent of all the parties involved , including his former wife .", "The applicant again contested the above decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint as groundless .", "Under LAW ( ORG i ORG \u2013 \u201c the Code \u201d ) , if a child was born in wedlock there is a legal presumption that the mother \u2019s husband is the father of her child . That presumption can be rebutted by bringing a civil action denying paternity ( zaprzeczenie ojcostwa ) ( LAW ) .", "Under LAW , an action denying paternity can be brought by the husband of the mother within DATE of learning that his wife has given birth to a child .", "Finally , Article CARDINAL of the Code provides that paternity may at any time be challenged by a prosecutor ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
