{"ITEMID": "001-23000", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "HAGMAN v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are PERSON and PERSON , NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants\u2019 dwelling , related buildings and their right to lease the land on which these were located were due to be forcibly sold on DATE at TIME by ORG of GPE . The ORG creditors had met in ORG office on DATE at TIME", "On DATE at TIME the applicants filed , with ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON , a request to have their debts adjusted , pending which they sought to have the forced sale suspended . The request had been drawn up by PERSON from ORG for ORG .", "At TIME a judge ordered as an interim measure that the forced sale be called off and enforcement be stayed . This decision was taken without any oral hearing having been held . The court based itself on the need to safeguard the applicants\u2019 effective possibility of retaining their dwelling , even though the evidence they had adduced to that effect was insufficient . The urgency of the matter nevertheless required that the court issue an interim order without hearing the creditors . No separate appeal lay against this order .", "The order was faxed to PERSON at TIME", "ORG and ORG were located on different floors of the same building . At TIME a court clerk placed the judge \u2019s decision \u2013 marked as urgent \u2013 on the desk of ORG messenger . The court \u2019s office hours ended at TIME but apparently the messenger had already left for DATE .", "On DATE the messenger brought the decision , together with the ordinary incoming mail , to ORG which was not situated on the same floor as ORG but from where the incoming mail was distributed further to the registry of ORG which was located on the third floor of the building .", "The forced sale was carried out as scheduled without the applicants being either present or represented .", "According to the applicants , a friend of the applicants , DATE , had allegedly enquired with the Enforcement Officer around TIME whether he had received the ORG decision . ORG had replied in the negative . TIME had made an initial telephone call to ORG on DATE .", "According to the Government , it is impossible to verify at this stage whether TIME actually telephoned ORG . They point to discrepancies in the applicants\u2019 account on this point in their various appeals . What appears clear to the Government is that TIME at least did not speak with ORG responsible for carrying out the forced sale . Moreover , the applicants did not find out TIME alleged enquiry until after the forced sale . Neither the applicants themselves nor their counsellor PERSON contacted the competent Enforcement Officer or any other person in ORG prior to the sale , even though they were aware of the PERSON meeting and the forced sale and had the right to attend both .", "The ORG appeal against the forced sale was dismissed by ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of PERSON on DATE , finding that they should themselves have ensured that ORG order reached ORG in time . As he had not been aware of the decision when proceeding to the sale , he had not acted incorrectly .", "The applicants appealed further to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , referring inter alia to the constant practice whereby ORG would pass on its interim orders directly to ORG . Relying on that practice and since time had not allowed for the original of the order to be communicated to them , the applicants and their counsellor had had no reason to take any further steps . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , upholding the reasons given by ORG .", "The applicants were granted leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) but , on DATE , their appeal was dismissed by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ( precedent no . CARDINAL ) . ORG inferred from the silence in GPE ( laki yksityishenkil\u00f6n velkaj\u00e4rjestelyst\u00e4 , lag om skuldsanering f\u00f6r privatpersoner CARDINAL ; \u201c the DATE LAW ) that the legislator had not intended to place on the court the responsibility for communicating to the enforcement authority an interim decision to suspend execution proceedings . Furthermore , since only the debtor could request such an interim order prior to the actual commencement of the debt adjustment , the LAW could not be interpreted so broadly as to place such a communication obligation on the court at that stage of the proceedings .", "ORG further noted that the applicants had sought the suspension TIME the day of the forced sale . The applicants had not pointed to any reason for being unable to communicate ORG decision to ORG , either personally or through their counsellor PERSON Neither had the telephone enquiry made in TIME the day of the sale placed ORG under an obligation to enquire of his own motion into whether the decision had actually been made . Finally , the applicants could themselves have attended the forced sale and in that connection informed ORG of ORG order .", "In the meantime , the merits of the applicants\u2019 debt adjustment request were examined by ORG on DATE . The payment schedules adopted for each of the applicants on DATE would have enabled them to retain their dwelling by paying off their debt within DATE . On DATE , however , the creditor bank requested that ORG annul those payment schedules as the applicants had failed to respect them . ORG found that the second applicant had knowingly given incorrect information about his income when his payment schedule had been considered . It therefore annulled his schedule . ORG upheld this decision on DATE .", "The applicants were forced to leave their property in DATE .", "In his decision of DATE , ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) considered that neither the conduct of ORG nor that of ORG could be considered incorrect . He nevertheless undertook to examine whether there was a need to improve the legal protection of debtors in similar situations , and whether amendments to LAW were necessary to that effect .", "In his further decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG noted that in light of ORG DATE LAW ( Suomen Hallitusmuoto , ORG ) the authorities were responsible in the last resort for the effective administration of justice . Debtors had been confused by the lack of clarity in the CARDINAL Act as to where the responsibility lay for notifying the enforcement authority of an interim order . Even though the wording of the CARDINAL Act did not require the district courts to inform the enforcement office of an order staying execution , they had nevertheless adopted such a practice . The ORG therefore proposed that the ORG should consider adding to LAW a provision explicitly rendering the courts responsible for notifying the enforcement office of such orders .", "According to LAW , a court may write off debts on condition that the debtor agrees to a payment schedule in favour of the creditors determined by the court ( section CARDINAL ) . If the debtor fails to adhere to the payment schedule or contracts a new debt the schedule may be revoked , thereby enabling all creditors to claim payment as if no debt adjustment had been granted ( section CARDINAL ) . Both the debtor and the creditors may seek to have the payment schedule amended , extended or revoked while it remains in force or , in certain circumstances , within DATE from the adoption of the schedule ( sections DATE ) . The court may hear CARDINAL or several creditors , guarantors and co - debtors before deciding on the request for debt adjustment ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The DATE Act , as in force at the relevant time , was silent as to whether the onus was on the competent court or on a physical debtor to communicate to the enforcement authority an interim order suspending enforcement while the court was examining his or her request for debt adjustment . By contrast , in the legislation on the adjustment of company debts such an obligation was imposed on the court as regards both the commencement of adjustment proceedings and any interim measure suspending execution .", "If a notice of a forced sale had been published before debt adjustment proceedings had been initiated , the sale could still be carried out . However , the court could stay enforcement and cancel the sale if the assets belonged to the debtor \u2019s basic necessities and it was evident that they were protected from being recovered in the course of the debt adjustment ( section CARDINAL ) .", "If so requested by the debtor , the court could order a stay of enforcement even before the debt adjustment had commenced , provided such an order was deemed necessary . The order could be issued without hearing the creditors if the urgency of the matter so required . No appeal lay against such an order . If the court refused to issue an order staying an enforcement measure whereby basic necessities would be realised to cover debts , the debtor was entitled to file an appeal which the court had to examine urgently , if necessary after hearing the creditors ( section DATE ) .", "When the actual debt adjustment proceedings had commenced the court was to notify the enforcement authorities at the debtor \u2019s place of residence of the debtor and wherever the debtor owned real property ( section DATE ) . According to the existing section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL ) , the court shall without delay inform those enforcement authorities already of an order staying enforcement ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
