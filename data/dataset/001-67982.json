The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested , brought before an investigator and detained on rape charges . A prosecutor confirmed the detention on DATE . Later in the course of the investigation he was also charged with abduction .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the investigator conducted searches in the applicant 's apartment , ordered an expert analysis of various traces and objects and questioned the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the detention order .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the established practice , the appeal was submitted through the investigation authorities , which transmitted it to ORG on DATE . The matter was listed for a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested access to the case file , which was refused by the judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested the withdrawal of the president of the bench as she had recently sought his prosecution for alleged defamatory statements . The lawyer was concerned that the judge 's hostility towards him might prejudice his client 's interests . The request for the judge 's withdrawal was granted and the case adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was assigned to another bench and listed for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer reiterated his request for access to the case file . The request was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal against his detention was eventually heard on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the opening of the hearing the judge refused to allow the participation of the applicant 's lawyer , considering that his written authority form was invalid . The judge stated that the authority had only been signed by the applicant 's wife and not by the applicant , that it bore no indication of the lawyer 's fees and that it had not been made on a sheet from the usual lawyers ' receipt - books .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , the applicant , who was also present , handed to the judge another written authorisation , signed by him . The court refused to accept it as the case file number had not been marked on it . As a result , the applicant had to present his case without legal representation .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the applicant , the court dismissed his appeal against detention , stating that he was charged with a serious criminal offence . The court went on to conclude that the fact that the applicant had refused to sign TIME of his first interrogations and to comment on the charges right away had demonstrated that he lacked critical judgment of his behaviour , which in turn revealed a danger that he would abscond and re - offend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a new appeal against detention , referring to passages in a psychiatrists ' report concerning his mental state ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the applicant also filed a request for the replacement of the president of the bench , arguing that his partiality had been demonstrated by his behaviour at the hearing on DATE . The lawyer did not enclose a power of attorney and did not indicate his address and telephone number .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was forwarded by the prosecution authorities to ORG , where it was registered on DATE . A hearing was listed for CARDINAL DATE . The applicant , but not his lawyer , was summoned .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested an adjournment as his lawyer was not present . ORG , sitting in a new composition , noted that the applicant 's lawyer had not been summoned as he had not indicated his address . It nevertheless decided to adjourn the case in view of the applicant 's request . A second hearing was listed for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested to be given access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the prosecutor , the applicant and CARDINAL lawyers acting for him . ORG dismissed the lawyers ' request for an adjournment to allow consultation of the case file , referring to \u201c the practice \u201d and endorsing the prosecutor 's view that it was for the investigator to decide what material should be provided to lawyers .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , the applicant argued that his health was unstable , that the conditions of detention were unacceptable and that he had to help his parents , CARDINAL of whom was ill , in their seasonal agricultural work .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against detention noting the psychiatrists ' conclusion that the applicant was mentally healthy and that other relatives had been taking care of the applicant 's sick mother . The court also had regard to the fact that the charges concerned a serious offence , allegedly committed during the operational period of the applicant 's suspended sentence for a previous conviction , and concluded that there was a danger that he might obstruct the course of justice and reoffend . As to the conditions of the applicant 's detention , the court stated that a transfer to another detention facility could be recommended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before completing the investigation , the investigator gave the applicant and his lawyer access to all the material in the case . On DATE the investigator drew up a report proposing that the applicant be indicted .", "CARDINAL . The indictment on charges of rape and abduction was prepared by a prosecutor and submitted to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the first hearing , held on DATE , ORG examined the applicant 's renewed appeal against his detention and dismissed it , noting that he was charged with a serious wilful offence which required his remand in custody and that , in any event , the charges concerned an offence allegedly committed during the operational period of the applicant 's previous suspended sentence for another offence . This latter fact left no doubt that there was a danger that the applicant would commit further offences . Finally , the court also endorsed the prosecutor 's position that there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and that the fact that the charges concerned a violent offence should be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE the applicant submitted another application for release on the grounds that his detention was unreasonably long , that the court failed to conduct a prompt trial and that there was no convincing evidence against him . PERSON , the victim , stated that she feared that if released the applicant may hurt her . She had learned that the applicant 's parents had been asking others about her new address . The court ruled against the applicant 's release . It noted that under the relevant law remand in custody was required in all cases where the charges concerned serious offences . It further stated that there was a danger that the applicant would obstruct the course of justice in view of the fact that he had been charged with CARDINAL offence and that he had a criminal record . Therefore , the applicant 's statements about his good character and family circumstances did not warrant release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of rape , sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and acquitted him of the charges of abduction . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction and sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant produced copies of correspondence in DATE and DATE from the presidents of ORG and of ORG to the local ORG , apparently in reaction to complaints made by lawyers about an existing practice of barring access to case files in cases concerning appeals against pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The president of ORG acknowledged that the complaints were well - founded and stated , inter alia , that , \u201c [ GPE , ORG judges rely on the hitherto prevailing practice and do not share my opinion ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The president of ORG informed ORG that the matter had been discussed at length and that the judges had agreed that , contrary to the opinion of ORG and ORG in GPE , there were no legal grounds for refusing access to case files in appeals against detention proceedings .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was kept in a lock - up at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The cell , where the applicant was detained together with CARDINAL other people , measured QUANTITY ( a surface of CARDINAL m\u00b2 ) . Since there were no beds , the detainees slept on mattresses on the floor . According to the applicant , the blankets were not washed regularly . The Government disputed that allegation . The cell did not have access to daylight and was equipped with a CARDINAL electric lamp . There was a ventilation system . According to the applicant the ventilation system was only installed \u201c in DATE \u201d . He also submitted that in DATE the temperature in his cell did not rise above ORG According to the Government , the cell was centrally heated and the temperature therein was normal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the other detainees were allowed to leave the cell twice a day , at TIME and TIME , for toilet purposes and washing . To relieve themselves outside the time earmarked for toilet visits , the detainees had to use a bucket . They had to empty the bucket and clean it themselves when leaving the cell to use the sanitary facilities . They were provided with detergents . Once per week the buckets were disinfected chemically . No possibility for spending time in the open or physical exercise was provided . The detainees could also leave the cell when they received visits or were brought for questioning or taken to court . They showered once per week in DATE and twice per week in DATE . Apparently hot water was available .", "CARDINAL . Food was provided CARDINAL times per day in the cell . It was served in pots or mugs which the detainees had to wash after every meal and which were collected and disinfected periodically . For security reasons , no forks or knives were provided . According to the applicant , the food was of bad quality . The Government stated that meat was available at least once per day .", "CARDINAL . In DATE psychiatry experts who had examined the applicant with a view to verifying his legal capacity to stand trial submitted their report . They noted that DATE or CARDINAL earlier the applicant had undergone periods of depression and violent or inadequate behaviour . He had been admitted for DATE to a psychiatric hospital on suspicion of suffering from paranoid schizophrenia . However , the experts concluded that the applicant 's mental condition was sound .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the GPE prison where the conditions were better .", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited GPE in DATE and again in DATE and DATE . ORG detention facility was visited in DATE and DATE . All reports included general observations about problems in all ORG facilities .", "CARDINAL . In this report the ORG found that most , albeit not all , of the ORG detention facilities were overcrowded . With the exception of CARDINAL detention facility where conditions were better , the conditions were as follows : detainees slept on mattresses on sleeping platforms on the floor ; hygiene was poor and blankets and pillows were dirty ; cells did not have access to natural light , the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently ; ventilation systems were in poor condition ; detainees could use a toilet and washbasin twice a day ( morning and evening ) for TIME and could take a DATE shower ; outside of the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilets , detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in the cell bucket ; although according to the establishments ' internal regulations detainees were entitled to a \u201c DATE walk \u201d of TIME , it was often reduced to TIME or not allowed at all ; no other form of out - of - cell activity was provided to persons detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity . In particular , the DATE 's \u201c hot meal \u201d generally consisted of a watery soup ( often lukewarm ) and inadequate quantities of bread . At the other meals , detainees only received bread and a little cheese or khalva . Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu . Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery - not even a spoon was provided .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that family visits were only possible with permission and that as a result detainees ' contact with the outside world was very limited . There was no radio or television .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the NORP authorities had failed in their obligation to provide detention conditions which were consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that \u201c almost without exception , the conditions in the ORG detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading . \u201d In reaction , the NORP authorities had agreed that the [ ORG ] delegation 's assessment had been \u201c objective and correctly presented \u201d but had indicated that the options for improvement were limited by the country 's difficult financial circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG recommended to the NORP authorities , inter alia , that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided , that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly , that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products ( soap , toothpaste , etc ) , that custodial staff be instructed that detainees should be allowed to leave their cells during DATE for the purpose of using a toilet facility unless overriding security considerations required otherwise , that the regulation providing for TIME exercise per day be fully respected in practice , that cell lighting and ventilation be improved , that the regime of family visits be revised and that pre - trial detainees should be more often transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed . The possibility of offering detainees outdoor exercise was to be examined as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that new rules , providing for better conditions , had been enacted but had not yet resulted in significant improvements .", "CARDINAL . In most places visited in DATE ( with the exception of a newly opened detention facility in GPE ) , the conditions of detention in ORG premises had remained generally the same as those observed during the ORG 's DATE visit , including as regards hygiene , overcrowding and outof - cell activities . In some places the situation had even deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . In ORG detention facility , as well as in CARDINAL other places , detainees \u201c still had to eat with their fingers , not having been provided with appropriate cutlery \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the same detention facility medical supervision was provided by a medical doctor on the LOC .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that most investigation detention facilities were undergoing renovation but that a lot remained to be done . The cells remained generally overcrowded .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , CARDINAL of the cells had benefited from a refurbishment which involved making windows in the cell doors , improving the artificial lighting and installing wash basins in the cells . However , the majority of the cells remained in the same inadequate condition as in DATE . The sanitary facilities were not in a satisfactory state of repair .", "CARDINAL . Despite the ORG 's recommendations in the report on their DATE visit , no proper regime of activities had been developed for detainees spending long periods in the investigation detention facilities . Those facilities did not have areas for outdoor exercise . At some of the establishments ( e.g. Botevgrad ) , attempts were being made to compensate for the lack of outdoor exercise facilities by allowing detainees to stroll in the corridor several times a day . The ORG stated that \u201c in this respect , the situation remain[ed ] of serious concern \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that a power of attorney shall be prepared in writing and signed by the defendant and his legal counsel .", "CARDINAL .
