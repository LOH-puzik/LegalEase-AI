Concurrently , in DATE , PERSON made an urgent application to the President of the GPE tribunal de grand instance for an interim order that ORG ( \" the ORG \" ) , an organisation created by the merger of ORG and ORG , should pay him the sum of MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of damage sustained .", "On DATE the judge ordered an expert opinion to be prepared . In a report of DATE the medical expert concluded that the applicant \u2019s infection had very probably originated in the blood products supplied by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE counsel for the applicant , without informing the court of the claim lodged with ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , brought a second action against the ORG for the sum of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

Compensation by the ORG is therefore not a ` ORG which precludes judicial remedies , unlike the aid granted by the public and private funds set up in DATE , but a compensation scheme based on the concept of risk and independent of any attempt to determine fault .", "A victim must , however , inform the ORG and the court of the various actions brought .
