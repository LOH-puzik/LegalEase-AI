{"ITEMID": "001-5108", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "PIARE v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and currently serving a prison sentence . He is represented by PERSON and PERSON , both lawyers practising in GPE and GPE respectively .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and placed in detention on suspicion of narcotics offences . He remained in detention during the criminal proceedings that were subsequently brought against him .", "On DATE , ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE handed down its judgment in the applicant \u2019s case .", "In its judgment of DATE , following proceedings on appeal , ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE , quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of participation in a criminal organisation and of narcotics offences and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and payment of a fine of ORG . CARDINAL .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s case - file was received by ORG . On DATE , ORG commenced its examination of the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation and , by judgment of DATE , rejected it . The applicant \u2019s sole complaint was that , given the delay between the judgment of ORG and the first examination of his appeal in cassation , the criminal proceedings against him had exceeded a reasonable time . ORG rejected this complaint , holding that the delay complained of was not of such a duration that the reasonable time requirement under LAW had been violated .", "The judgment of DATE thus became final . The date on which the applicant would become eligible for early release was DATE . On the basis of the contents of a letter addressed by the applicant to PERSON ( ORG ) , which raised certain concerns as to the applicant \u2019s mental health , it was decided to examine the applicant \u2019s situation . To this end he was admitted to ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) for a clinical psychological examination . The ORG examination resulted in a finding that the applicant \u2019s affective functioning was laboured , that he displayed an attitude of helplessness , that he was showing narcissistic , dependent and passive - aggressive tendencies and that is was clear that he was very vulnerable in detention and needed guidance and protection .", "The applicant was subsequently placed in the Individual Care Unit ( PERSON ; \u201c IBA \u201d ) of the PERSON prison , where inmates , who are unable to function in a regular prison environment on grounds of their mental state , are placed .", "According to reports of the mental health consultative body ( PERSON ; \u201c PMO \u201d ) of the PERSON prison on the applicant \u2019s situation in detention , the applicant required much attention and care , and had to be stimulated constantly in order not to sink into a serious depression . With the exception of a short period , special surveillance measures had to be taken during TIME on grounds of a perceived real risk of suicide .", "In DATE , the applicant filed a request for pardon ( gratie ) on , inter alia , compassionate grounds in relation to his mental problems caused by his detention . He argued that a continuation of his detention , in view of his resulting mental condition , constituted inhuman treatment . In a letter to the direction of the PERSON prison , the ORG of the ORG prison supported this request for pardon .", "The applicant \u2019s request was further supported in a report dated DATE by a rehabilitation officer ( reclasseringswerker ) . This report mentions that the ORG had found that the ORG was the only option for detaining the applicant , as the chances of a suicide were so high that the applicant could too easily escape the attention of the warders working on a regular prison unit . The report further sketches the increasing mental problems of the applicant arising from his feeling to have been convicted unjustly and the detrimental effects of the applicant \u2019s lengthy detention on his family life and his company . The applicant is described as a downcast , unstable and depressive man , who , as a consequence of continuous stress , develops more and more physical problems .", "Although the Advocate - General ( PERSON ) to ORG had issued a positive opinion as to the applicant \u2019s request for a pardon , ORG , on DATE , advised the Minister of ORG to grant the applicant \u2019s request only in part , i.e. by reducing the sentence from DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "As the applicant considered that his request for a pardon was not dealt with diligently , he instituted summary proceedings ( kort geding ) against ORG before ORG of GPE . He sought an injunction against the ORG , ordering the latter to immediately cease the execution of his sentence . He submitted that a continuation of his detention constituted inhuman treatment .", "On DATE , ORG examined the case and heard the parties . In the course of this hearing , ORG argued that the applicant could avail himself of the possibility of seeking an interruption of sentence ( strafonderbreking ) . Following the parties\u2019 hearing , ORG decided to adjourn its further examination until DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a request for interruption of sentence . In his reply of DATE , the Minister of ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s request for a pardon was still pending , that , according to a recent opinion of ORG to ORG , a further forensic psychiatric and psychological examination of the applicant was required in order to determine his suitability for detention ( detentiegeschiktheid ) and that , to this end , the ORG had agreed to admit the applicant with priority , namely during DATE . The Minister informed the applicant that the decision on his request for interruption of sentence was postponed until the submission of the ORG report .", "On DATE , the applicant was transferred from the ORG prison to the ORG for an examination of his suitability for detention . In its report of DATE , the ORG concluded that , on grounds of his mental problems , the applicant \u2019s suitability for detention was reduced to a significant extent and that his request for a pardon warranted support and that only a substantial reduction of his punishment by way of a pardon could reduce the stress factors which maintained the applicant \u2019s adjustment disorder .", "On DATE , ORG resumed its examination in the summary proceedings instituted by the applicant . After having heard the parties\u2019 further submissions , it decided to adjourn its further examination until DATE .", "In the light of the ORG report of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s request was re - submitted to ORG , requesting the court to consider whether or not these new elements gave reason to the court to alter its advice on the request for pardon ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
