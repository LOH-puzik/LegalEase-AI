On DATE the applicant rented a municipally - owned shop in the town of Primorsko . The shop consisted of a metal structure built on a concrete foundation on a municipally - owned plot of land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to be allowed to purchase the shop under the preferential privatisation procedure for tenants of ORG and municipally - owned property , as provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044f \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . She also expressed the wish to buy the plot of land on which the shop was built . As the municipal council did not reply , the applicant applied for judicial review of the municipality \u2019s tacit refusal to sell the shop to her . The first - instance court rejected that application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE , rectified for errors in DATE , ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment , finding that it had not dealt with all the evidence submitted by the applicant . The last - instance court then observed that the parties were in agreement that , at the time of her privatisation request , the applicant had had a valid rent contract for the shop with the municipal authorities . It further found , on the basis of the submitted evidence , that the shop constituted a separate property unit measuring QUANTITY and that all statutory conditions for privatising the shop under the preferential privatisation procedure had been present . As to the land on which the shop was built , the court observed that it was not part of the rental contract and thus its inclusion in the privatisation of the shop was a matter of discretion for the municipal authorities . The court referred the case back to ORG with instructions for it to open a privatisation procedure by offering to sell the shop to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant again asked ORG to examine her privatisation proposal . As she did not receive a reply , she applied for judicial review of its tacit refusal to sell the shop to her .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the applicant met the conditions for the privatisation of the shop . The court specified that , following changes to the country \u2019s administrative map , the privatisation decision had to be taken by ORG and it referred the case back to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and later again on DATE , ORG explicitly refused to sell the shop to the applicant . She brought judicial review proceedings in respect of those refusals .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG revoked the refusals as null and void , finding that the municipal council had been obliged to sell the shop to the applicant . The court briefly noted that , whatever the circumstances , no proof had been presented to it by the municipal council in support of its objection that the shop no longer physically existed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , in DATE and DATE , the municipal company managing the shop informed the applicant that she had no lease contract for DATE and invited her to vacate the LOC . On an unknown date in DATE , that company lodged a rei vindicatio claim against the applicant . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the company \u2019s claim , holding that the applicant \u2019s lease contract could not be terminated pending the privatisation procedure pursued by her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of Primorsko ( hereinafter \u201c the mayor \u201d ) ordered the municipal company to demolish the shop . Following a complaint lodged by the applicant with the Governor of GPE , the latter revoked the mayor \u2019s order on DATE , finding that the mayor had not been competent to dispose of municipal property without a prior decision of the municipal council to that effect . The Governor further stated that , pending the privatisation procedure , the lease contract with the applicant could not be terminated .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE , the municipal company sold the shop to a private company . On CARDINAL DATE the buyer , assisted by municipal employees , prevented the applicant from entering the shop . Following a complaint lodged by the applicant with the prosecutor , on DATE the latter established that the buyer had acted in an abusive manner and ordered the police to assist the applicant in regaining possession of the shop . According to the applicant , after she had re - entered the property she discovered that the electricity supply had been cut off . It appears that she ran the shop without electricity until an unspecified date in DATE , when the electricity supply was restored .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the buyer brought a rei vindicatio claim in court against the applicant . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed that claim , confirming the reasoning in the lower court \u2019s judgment . The last - instance court found in particular that the buyer had not acquired ownership of the shop and that , in any event , the applicant was protected by LAW in that she could not be evicted from the shop pending the examination of her privatisation proposal .", "CARDINAL . Primorsko Municipal Council considered that the shop was dilapidated and unsafe on account of the corrosion of its metal structure and ordered its sale for demolition . At some point in DATE the municipal council sold the shop to an individual and on DATE the mayor ordered the new buyer to demolish the shop . Even though on DATE , DATE , the mayor revoked his own order , the buyer dismantled the shop on DATE with the assistance of the police . The applicant was informed of the demolition by an acquaintance who happened to pass by the shop on DATE it was pulled down . She had not known about the sale of the shop before it was demolished .", "CARDINAL . The parties dispute what happened to the applicant \u2019s goods and belongings . According to the Government , they were listed and taken for safekeeping . According to the applicant , they were destroyed together with the shop .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested that criminal proceedings be opened against the mayor and the chairperson of ORG for breach of duties and obstruction of the enforcement of a final court judgment . In a decision of DATE the prosecutor refused her request . He found that it was impossible to open criminal proceedings as the refusals to privatise the shop had been issued by the municipal council , a collective body , whereas criminal responsibility was personal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively the applicant again requested ORG to examine her privatisation proposal . In a letter of DATE the council informed her that her case was factually and legally complex , and that an ad hoc commission would be formed to propose a solution . On DATE the ad hoc commission proposed that an enquiry be made with ORG ( the ORG body in charge of the privatisation of ORG - owned property ) . In CARDINAL letters dated DATE , sent respectively to the applicant and the municipality , ORG observed that the question about the demolition of the shop had not been raised in the proceedings before the courts . The Agency nonetheless held that the municipality was obliged to comply with court judgments .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant lodged a claim with ORG for damages against the Primorsko municipal authorities for their failure to implement the final judgments in her favour . The claim was lodged under the ORG and ORG DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The court split the claim to be examined into CARDINAL separate sets of proceedings \u2013 the first one against the municipality ( \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) and the second one against the municipal council ( \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0442 ) .", "CARDINAL . In the first set of proceedings , in which she challenged the mayor \u2019s order of DATE that the shop be demolished ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant sought damages for loss of opportunity ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0437\u0438 ) . ORG found that the applicant had no standing to pursue this claim because she had not been the addressee of the mayor \u2019s order . Although the shop had been demolished shortly after the order had been issued , that had been irrelevant in respect of the legal proceedings brought by the applicant , given that she had sought compensation for damage specifically stemming from the mayor \u2019s order . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim and terminated the proceedings . That ruling was upheld by ORG in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the second set of proceedings the applicant sought both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages stemming from the failure of the municipal council to decide on her privatisation request by implementing the final court judgments ordering it to offer to sell the shop to her .", "CARDINAL . She specified that she sought pecuniary damages in respect of : the rent she had had to pay DATE , when her request to privatise the shop should have been granted , and DATE , when the shop had been demolished ; those of her belongings that had been destroyed together with the shop ; the loss of income resulting from the impossibility of collecting rent from a company with which she had concluded a contract on DATE in respect of part of the shop ; and the impossibility of increasing her investment by buying the plot on which the shop stood and by building upon it .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , the applicant sought non - pecuniary damages in respect of the intense stress and emotional suffering that had led her to fall into a lasting and severe depression , which had been the result of the shop \u2019s demolition and of the failure of the municipal council to sell it to her , despite the final judgments . She provided medical records in respect of her failing health and the related hospital treatment she had undergone .", "CARDINAL . Examining the applicant \u2019s claim , ORG considered that she was complaining of the municipal council \u2019s tacit refusal to reply to her request of DATE to buy the shop . On DATE the court found that both claims , for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages , were admissible .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , the court held that the claim for pecuniary damages was unjustified and also that there was no causal link between the municipal council \u2019s refusal to privatise the shop and the applicant \u2019s claims for loss of financial opportunity as a result of the impossibility of buying the land and building on it .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damages , the court accepted it as justified on the basis of the evidence submitted during the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In particular it found that it had been demonstrated that the applicant had suffered significantly as a result of the municipal council \u2019s refusal to open a privatisation procedure vis - \u00e0 - vis her . The court held that the applicant \u2019s suffering had been caused by the municipal council \u2019s tacit refusal to act upon the final court judgment of DATE . The applicant had succumbed to depression , which had manifested itself in acute feelings of hopelessness and a perception that any future efforts would be futile , as well as in feelings of helplessness , insomnia , a disturbance of memory functions , and attention disorder . Those conditions had further led to a serious deterioration in the applicant \u2019s family environment , given that she had directed all her frustration and negative emotions towards her young daughter . The court awarded the applicant the entirety of her claim , namely MONEY ( ORG ) , plus interest , as well about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for costs and expenses . It further declared null and void the municipality \u2019s tacit refusal to act upon her request of DATE , and returned the case to it for it to take the appropriate action .", "CARDINAL . After an appeal lodged by the municipal council , ORG found that the lower court had wrongly concluded that the municipal council \u2019s silence amounted to a new tacit refusal to privatise the shop . The applicant was seeking damages stemming from the absence of a privatisation procedure launched by the municipality in respect of the shop . The administrative procedure concerning the privatisation of the shop had begun with the applicant \u2019s initial request of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and had not been completed . The applicant \u2019s subsequent requests to the same effect had not created a new obligation on the part of the municipality concerning the privatisation of the same shop .", "CARDINAL . The last - instance court further held that , as regards the first final court decision in the applicant \u2019s favour ( that of CARDINAL DATE ) it had not created obligations on the part of ORG , given that the respondent party required to act under that decision had been the PERSON municipality ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG had only been expected to act in respect of the second final judgment on that question ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the municipal authorities\u2019 explicit written refusal of CARDINAL DATE to open a privatisation procedure ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) , the court noted that that refusal had been declared null and void in DATE by another of its benches for being contrary to the first final court decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The last - instance court conceded that , objectively , the declaration of the municipal council \u2019s refusal as null and void corresponded to CARDINAL of the statutory prerequisites for the pecuniary liability of the council . However , the remaining conditions for the council being held so liable had not been met . In particular , the court held DATE without elaborating further \u2013 that the applicant had failed to prove both the existence of actual damage and the causal link of any such damage to the municipal council \u2019s refusal to privatise the shop by offering to sell it to her .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of the council \u2019s refusal of CARDINAL DATE had been inadmissible on account of the expiry of the DATE limitation period , as calculated as of the date of that refusal . Moreover , the council tacit refusal to act upon DATE court decision was of no consequence , given that the shop had no longer physically existed at that time .", "CARDINAL . Importantly , the obligation on the municipal authorities to privatise property under LAW existed only vis - \u00e0 - vis individuals who met the conditions stipulated under LAW . The applicant , however , was not among those persons . The reason was that she had not had a valid contract with the municipality at any of the times when she had requested the latter to sell the shop to her , because the contract concluded in DATE had expired prior to those times .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , as a matter of principle , the liability of a municipality , or of the ORG for that matter , under the ORG did not include loss of opportunity but only already incurred losses . Consequently , the applicant could not claim loss of opportunity in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damages , the court emphasised that these could only be incurred by an individual and not by an enterprise . It was true that in legal terms the sole trader was a physical , as opposed to a legal , person ; however , the damage suffered by the applicant stemmed specifically from the economic activity carried out by her in her capacity as a sole trader . Consequently , the applicant as an individual was not entitled to compensation for damage that could have been sustained in the context of the economic activity of the trader . In view of the above , the lower court had wrongly granted the applicant \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above , ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims in a final judgment on DATE . It also held that the applicant had to pay to the municipal council about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for legal costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to rectify its judgment of DATE in the part in which it had ordered her to pay the legal costs claimed by the other party ( the municipal council ) . She pointed out that the municipal council had not presented proof that it had indeed incurred those expenses and that , in any event , the council should not be allowed to benefit from its unlawful failure to implement the judgments in her favour . The applicant sought , alternatively , a reduction in those costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG found her request admissible but rejected it as unjustified ( \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 ) in a final decision of DATE . On DATE the bailiff invited the applicant to voluntarily comply with the final judgment of DATE , indicating that failure to pay the sum due would result in the forced sale of items of the applicant \u2019s personal movable and immovable property ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
