NORP The profit margins for chemists in GPE were fixed by a ministerial order ( ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government published a ministerial order in ORG ( PERSON ) reducing the profit margins .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( ORG general ORG ) commenced proceedings for judicial review with a view to obtaining an order quashing the ministerial order of CARDINAL DATE . ORG ordered a stay on the implementation of the order concerned . On DATE it quashed the order on its own initiative . The judgment of ORG was served on ORG on DATE , but not on the applicants , as they were not parties to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE became public when a ministerial order of CARDINAL DATE was published on CARDINAL DATE in edition no . CARDINAL of ORG , which reproduced the grounds of the judgment in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicants lodged claims ( dated DATE and DATE ) with ORG for the payment of compensation for the damage sustained as a result of the ministerial order , under LAW and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on the Legal Regime governing the Administration of the ORG . Those claims were deemed to have been rejected as the authorities did not reply to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review before ORG . They argued that the DATE limitation period for lodging their application had started to run on CARDINAL DATE , when ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE was published in ORG , or , at the very least , DATE , when it was served on ORG . Their applications were , however , dismissed on the ground that the time - limit for making a claim for compensation to the administrative authorities had been DATE from the date of delivery of ORG judgment , namely CARDINAL DATE , and that they had lodged their applications out of time .", "CARDINAL . The dates ORG delivered its judgments were as follows : DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . PERSON ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) ; CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ; DATE ( application no . CARDINAL ) ; and CARDINAL DATE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged CARDINAL amparo appeals with ORG , arguing that the starting - point of the DATE limitation period for lodging their applications with the authorities had been either CARDINAL DATE , when ORG judgment was published in ORG , or DATE , when it had been served on ORG .", "CARDINAL . State Counsel 's lodged memorials that were favourable to the applicants , in which he said :", "\u201c Whatever the position , ORG considers that the interpretation by ORG , an interpretation which led it to declare that the action for compensation was statute - barred and , consequently , to dismiss that claim , in fact reflected a formal restrictive approach which is not best suited to facilitate the right of access to a court . That is because , as ORG itself openly recognised in its decision of DATE , which was produced by the applicant , it is impossible to establish the date when a judgment will be delivered before it has been drawn up and signed . That means that in every case , even people who were parties to the proceedings in question ( which the applicant was not ) will only learn the content and date of the judgment when it is served on them . Thus , taking as the starting - point the date of delivery of a judgment ( which in practice is a fiction ) and not the date of its service results in a material reduction in the time allowed for lodging the relevant claim for compensation , a reduction which , depending on how long service is delayed ( which , admittedly , was for a very limited period in the present case ) , restricts and may even deny the effectiveness of the right to make a claim . Consequently , the decision of ORG entails a violation of the right to effective protection by the courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court nonetheless dismissed the appeals on the ground that the applicants had lodged their claims with ORG DATE after the date ORG judgment was delivered . It held that a presumption arose that the applicants had been aware of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in sufficient time , given their direct interest in it and the role played by ORG , which would have informed its members of the judgment .", "The dates of delivery and service on the applicants of the decisions of ORG were as follows : DATE ; DATE ; CARDINAL DATE ; DATE ; DATE ; and DATE .", "The judgments of DATE ( amparo appeal lodged by PERSON , application no . CARDINAL ) and DATE ( amparo appeal lodged by PERSON , application no . PERSON , Mr PERSON , application no . ORG , and PERSON , application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) were delivered by ORG sitting as a full court . CARDINAL judges expressed an opinion dissenting from the judgment of DATE ( amparo appeal no . CARDINAL ) . CARDINAL of the judgments of DATE referred to the grounds of that judgment and to the dissenting opinion annexed to it . In the dissenting judges ' view the starting - point for the limitation period was the date the person relying on it could reasonably act . In the instant case , that could not have been the date of \u201c delivery \u201d of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that being the date when the judges had voted in the parties ' absence . Accordingly , in those sets of proceedings , the starting - point for the limitation period had to be the date of service of the decision , that being the point at which the parties had been able to act . With regard to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the following view was expressed in the dissenting opinion :", "\u201c ... If regard is had to the fact that this latter rule provides that the limitation period for all types of action shall be calculated from the date the actions could have been brought , it is obvious that that date can under no circumstances be the date of delivery of the judgment , for the simple reason that the parties are not invited to be present at that ' act ' , which in general takes place in practice at the same time as the vote which , with the exception of judgments made public ' in open court ' , enables it to be considered as a fiction devoid of purpose . ...", "We therefore find ourselves confronted by a dangerous doctrine ( by reason of the legal uncertainty which it creates for the parties ) which , if extended to the calculation of the time - limits for appeals , may undermine the right to a remedy which is also fundamental . ...", "If account is taken of the fact that rules governing procedural time - limits are mandatory , that an interested party is at liberty to bring an action at any time within that period , and that any change to the rules for calculating the time - limits will affect the constitutional principle of legal certainty ( Article CARDINAL [ of LAW ] ) , the conclusion that we are faced not with a mere problem of interpretation of an ordinary legal rule ( for which ORG has sole jurisdiction ) , but with an unreasonable interpretation of a procedural requirement that prevented the claim for compensation being considered by a court on the merits is inescapable . In our view , that situation amounts to a violation of the right to effective protection by the courts , since the requirement that the courts must examine a case can not be satisfied by a mere decision containing formal reasoning , but requires a decision satisfying the criteria of legal and substantive debate or which , in accordance with LAW , protects ' legitimate rights and interests ' .", "The right to bring an action or to lodge an appeal must arise from the moment the parties may effectively become aware of a legal decision imposing an obligation on them or adversely affecting their legitimate rights or interests . As an act of communication between the court and the parties , service serves that purpose , namely to make the parties aware of the decision of the court and of the grounds for the decision . A pseudo - publication , a mere component of an esoteric judicial liturgy in which the parties play no role , can not constitute the act required by our LAW to enable the right to the effective protection by the courts or the right to a remedy to be exercised . \u201d", "The dissenting judges concluded :", "\u201c ... we have to conclude that we are not dealing with a mere problem of interpretation of an ordinary legal rule ... but with an unreasonable interpretation of a procedural requirement which prevented the claim for compensation being considered by a court , something which is , in our view , contrary to the right to effective protection by the courts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The courts shall supervise regulatory powers and the lawfulness of administrative acts and whether such acts are directed at aims which justify them .", "CARDINAL .

The limitation period starts to run from the moment that a possibility of asserting the right exists , that is to say , from the moment the cause of action becomes a matter of public knowledge and the right can logically and legally be asserted , since it would be absurd and unjust if time started to run when the act giving rise to the cause of action was still unknown or concealed , when , as a consequence , it was impossible to challenge or contest that act effectively or when an obstacle prevented any challenge ... \u201d", "\u201c ...
