GPE and GPE DATE . ) , ORG . ORG GPE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG must therefore reach its decision on the basis of the evidence submitted by the parties . In the proceedings before it , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions . According to its established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof , are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake ( see PERSON and Others v. PERSON [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) .", "CARDINAL .

Having particular regard to the age of the fifth applicant , this fact allows the inference that the other applicants accompanying the fifth applicant were also put off the train but not registered by ORG of the Interior . This inference is further corroborated by the television reports , showing the applicants in PERSON , and the applicants\u2019 detailed submission to the ORG as well as to ORG office .", "CARDINAL .
