For the same reasons as were given in the above - mentioned reports , it was concluded that the transplantation had been carried out in compliance with domestic law . The reports indicated that in his lifetime Mr Petrovs had not indicated any objection to the use of his body tissue and organs after death and that no objection to the use of his organs had been received from his relatives before the start of the transplantation . The coordinator of the transplantation centre had been responsible for informing the relatives about the issues pertaining to transplantation , and for obtaining records , consent , signatures and other relevant information . Taking into account the fact that the relatives had not been at the hospital at the time of the son \u2019s biological death and that the removal of organs in such cases has to be performed immediately , it had not been possible to obtain their consent or refusal in relation to the organ removal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed of this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to the applicant . According to the information at their disposal , there was nothing on record in ORG indicating whether Mr Petrovs would have allowed or refused the use of his body , tissue and organs after his death .

Finally , the applicant was advised that she should contact the prosecutor \u2019s office because ORG had not indicated any procedure or time - limits for lodging an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , further to a subsequent complaint , a meeting was convened at which the Minister for Health discussed with the representatives of the ORG and the transplantation centre the case of the removal of the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s organs . The Minister for Health was of the opinion that the relatives should have been informed about the organ removal and that their consent should have been obtained . The representatives stated that the organ removal had been conducted in compliance with the applicable law . The meeting record contained a note to the effect that in DATE a working group which had been established by ORG had prepared amendments to the above - mentioned PERSON in order to define its provisions more clearly . They had made CARDINAL proposals . The first proposal was to include in the PERSON a provision stating that on all occasions inquiries were to be made about the deceased person \u2019s wishes with his or her closest relatives . The second proposal was to rely on the person \u2019s wishes as expressed during his or her lifetime and , in the absence of any such wishes , to presume consent ( no inquiries made with the closest relatives ) . It was also noted that the relevant committee of the ORG had opted for the second option ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for the adopted text ) . It was also noted that once the proposed amendments were passed by the ORG , the occurrence of such \u201c problematic situations would be practically ruled out \u201d . On DATE the applicant received reply from ORG to this effect .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the refusal of CARDINAL DATE to institute criminal proceedings . She relied on LAW of the PERSON and indicated that consent from parents or from a legal guardian was required only in cases relating to the removal of organs for transplantation purposes from a dead child \u2019s body . Accordingly , the actions of the medical practitioners did not constitute a crime and the CARDINAL DATE decision had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a superior prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . He stated that \u2013 according to the information provided by ORG Being with regard to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had not been ratified by ORG and that GPE had not even signed LAW to ORG concerning Transplantation of Organs and ORG ; GPE was therefore not a party to this LAW . The prosecutor relied on LAW and indicated that at the relevant time ( DATE ) in GPE these issues were regulated in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON . These provisions did not require consent from close relatives unless the removal was from the body of a dead child . The rules relating to transplantation coordinators obliged them to obtain relatives\u2019 consent only in cases prescribed by law . The prosecutor concluded that there were no grounds to consider that the medical practitioners , in taking the decision to remove organs and in carrying out the removal of those organs , had infringed legal provisions . Therefore , there were no grounds to charge them with a crime under section CARDINAL of LAW ; at that time no other person had been charged with the crime . At the same time , the applicant was informed about DATE amendments to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON , in which it was specified that the organs of a deceased person might be removed for transplantation purposes if there was no information recorded in ORG indicating any objection and if the relatives of the deceased had not , before the start of the transplantation , informed the hospital in writing of the deceased person \u2019s objection \u2013 expressed during his or her DATE to the use of his or her organs and tissue after death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General in a final decision dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the decision of DATE . He also referred to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON and noted that these provisions prohibited removal in cases where a refusal or objection had been received but not in cases where wishes of the closest relatives had not been established . These provisions , as in force in DATE , therefore did not oblige medical practitioners to actively search for and inform the closest relatives of a deceased person about the possible removal for transplantation purposes of his or her body tissue and organs unless that person was a child . On CARDINAL DATE the medical practitioners did not have any information at their disposal concerning a refusal of or objection to the removal of Mr Petrovs\u2019 organs . He concluded that the organ removal had been performed in accordance with domestic law . ORG also observed that activities performed on the body of a deceased person could not be treated as interference with his or her private life ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
