Upon his return to GPE in DATE , the applicant unsuccessfully sought to receive his pension from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he complained to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG joined the applicant \u2019s case ( no . CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and those of PERSON and Ms Pa\u0161ali\u0107 ( nos . CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and adopted a single decision . It was read out at a public hearing on DATE . Having been taken by ORG , the decision became final immediately .", "ORG held that the applicant ( together with Mr PERSON and PERSON ) was discriminated against in his enjoyment of the right to social security as guaranteed by LAW . The reasons were set out in the decision which reads , in the relevant part , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the former ORG ( hereinafter \u201c SFRY \u201d ) , civilian pensions were administered by the CARDINAL ORG under their own respective laws and institutions . In addition , the state - level LAW ( ORG no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , and CARDINAL ) granted equal minimum rights to every SFRY citizen and regulated the rights of persons who moved from one Republic to another .", "CARDINAL . Following changes brought about by the armed conflict , pensions in GPE came to be administered by CARDINAL separate funds : ORG hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , ORG hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , and ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) . ORG and ORG subsequently merged , following a DATE decision by ORG , into ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which has been operational DATE . Presently there is CARDINAL pension fund in the ORG and one in ORG , and all legislation directly concerning pension systems is made at the Entity level .", "CARDINAL . The basic calculation schemes for determining rights to pension and disability insurance are different in each entity . CARDINAL result of this has been significantly lower pensions in ORG . In DATE , the average pension in the ORG was CARDINAL [ NORP markas ( BAM ) ] , and the average pension in ORG was CARDINAL [ BAM ] . The minimum pension payment prescribed by law in GPE is CARDINAL [ BAM ] , while the minimum pension in the Republika Srpska is DATE [ BAM ] .", "CARDINAL . The system of pension insurance in GPE , as inherited from the former SFRY , has been based on the \u201c pay / go \u201d principle that salary contributions from current workers support the current pensioners . Thus , money that comes into the system as contributions is immediately paid out as pensions , rather than becoming interest - generating capital from which the interest is paid out as pensions . When the current workers retire , salary contributions from the future generation of workers will finance the current workers\u2019 pensions . Therefore , the pension system as a whole has had the character of a general social insurance system . This is also the case with the current ORG Funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , ORG , and ORG entered into the Agreement on Mutual Rights and Obligations in Execution of Pension and ORG ( hereinafter the \u201c LAW \u201d ) ( ORG , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON , no CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , under which they agreed that the ORG that had made payments to pensioners before the LAW came into force would continue to pay those pensions regardless of the ORG place of temporary or permanent residence . ORG entered into force on DATE ...", "CARDINAL . ORG , with the authorisation of the Republika Srpska government , unilaterally terminated LAW in DATE ( ORG , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . According to a DATE report by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) , despite its withdrawal from the Agreement , ORG has continued to pay those pensioners already recognised as its beneficiaries . For its part , ORG has declared that it will continue to follow the Agreement and pay its beneficiaries now living in the Republika Srpska .", "CARDINAL . According to the DATE ORG report , the absence of harmonised legislation between the CARDINAL Entities and the lack of state - level legislation regulating pension and other social benefits causes problems for displaced pensioners and returnees . Specifically , these problems arise from the different pension calculation schemes and different pension amounts in each Entity .", "CARDINAL . As a practical matter , a person who retired in GPE and held a pension there before the armed conflict , but later began receiving pension payments from ORG after displacement to ORG , would continue , after returning to GPE , to receive the lower pension payment from ORG . Such a returnee , while receiving the smaller ORG pension , would also face a higher cost of living in GPE than in ORG . Moreover , such a returnee would receive a pension much lower than a person who had made similar pension contributions during their working life but remained in the GPE throughout the armed conflict .", "CARDINAL . Under various inter - state pension benefits agreements , some civil pensioners from ORG who moved to other countries during the armed conflict continue to enjoy their full pension rights from ORG . For example , under LAW GPE and GPE ( ORG on ORG , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , the responsible domestic insurer is obligated to pay full rights to a pension beneficiary , even if that person is residing in the other contracting state . According to ORG , no major problems are reported with regard to refugees from GPE and GPE receiving their full pensions in GPE . As of DATE , similar agreements had been signed and implemented between GPE and GPE and GPE and GPE , while other such agreements were in the works . According to ORG , users of pensions from GPE were receiving pensions in CARDINAL countries ( mostly in GPE and GPE ) in DATE .", "...", "CARDINAL . This disparity leaves no doubt that persons who were internally displaced during the armed conflict are , upon their return , treated differently . Each of the present applicants left GPE in DATE at the outset of the armed conflict . These applicants now receive smaller pensions simply because they left the Federation for a period of time , not on their own free will , to live in LOC . Those who remained enjoy greater pension rights than those who left , even though they may have been identically situated before the armed conflict .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , it appears that the present applicants ( and others who were internally displaced and have returned to ORG ) are in a worse position than Federation pensioners who moved to other countries during the armed conflict . Many Federation pensioners who moved to other countries during the armed conflict continue to enjoy full pension rights from ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the prospect of returning to live in the Federation ( where the cost of living is higher than in PERSON ) on a smaller ORG pension presents a significant obstacle to the return of displaced persons . The present applicants attest to these difficulties , and the Federation , in its observations , admits that they should have been aware of them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . CARDINAL of the important objectives of the settlement of the conflict in GPE was to facilitate the return of displaced persons ( see generally the General Framework Agreement for Peace in GPE , Annex CARDINAL ) . The ORG considers that displaced person status is a status relevant for the purposes of LAW ( b ) [ of LAW ] and further finds that the current situation regarding displaced ORG pensions is inimical to the goals of Annex CARDINAL . The only reason put forward for the different treatment is ORG , which , by its terms , makes displaced person status the basis for different treatment . But displaced person status can not serve as a justification for disparate treatment , especially where , as here , it carries with it a connotation of discrimination on ethnic grounds . Under the circumstances , the ORG concludes that the different , poorer treatment of the applicants with regard to their pension payments has no objective justification . \u201d", "ORG made the following orders :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG finds it appropriate to order ORG to take all necessary legislative and administrative actions by DATE to ensure that the applicants are no longer discriminated against in their enjoyment of pension rights guaranteed by LAW , particularly in comparison to those pensioners who remained in the Federation during the armed conflict .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further orders ORG to compensate each applicant for the difference between the pension that he or she would be due under LAW between the pension funds and the amount the applicant would have received from ORG , from DATE of his or her application to ORG [ i.e. from DATE ] until DATE the GPE \u2019s compliance with the remedy ordered in paragraph CARDINAL [ immediately above ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ( the exact date has not been indicated ) the applicant received CARDINAL NORP markas ( which corresponds to MONEY ) by way of compensation from ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant still receives his pension from ORG . Since the pension legislation has not yet been harmonised between the CARDINAL Entities , pensions in ORG are still generally lower than in GPE . Furthermore , pensioners in PERSON , as opposed to pensioners in GPE , do not receive the nominal amount of their pensions , but MONEY thereof ( this is owing to the financial difficulties of the Entity ) .", "CARDINAL . The Agreement on Human Rights was signed by GPE and its Entities on DATE , when it entered into force .
