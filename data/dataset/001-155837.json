NORP The applicant , PERSON M.M.A. PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Co - Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE in DATE in order to follow university studies in GPE . In DATE he moved to GPE , where he worked as salesman in a small store .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , during a search conducted at the applicant \u2019s flat , the police found QUANTITY of cannabis and QUANTITY of opium . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of possession of illegal drugs for personal use and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court also ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion upon completion of his sentence . In the course of the criminal investigation ORG , the applicant \u2019s girlfriend and a NORP citizen , was heard as witness . She declared that she had known the applicant for DATE and that they had a son together , but she did not live with him . She also stated that he was a decent person and a good father who helped her raising their son . She explained that she had a key to his flat , where she would go once DATE so , depending on the problems she encountered with her son .

On DATE ORG granted a request submitted by ORG and established the applicant \u2019s paternity of her child .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant requested the reduction of the DATE period laid down in the order of DATE . He based his request on an amendment to Emergency Ordinance No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL introduced in DATE , which allowed for a MONEY reduction in the term of a prohibition on entering GPE to be applied to illegal aliens who were married to a NORP citizen or had a child of NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to the applicant that the new amendment invoked by him did not apply to aliens who had committed crimes in GPE . Moreover , the applicant was informed that the amendment in question had come into force after he had already been expelled from GPE and it could not be applied retroactively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint before the administrative court against this reply . He requested the courts in his case to apply the more favourable provisions introduced by the new amendment to Emergency Ordinance No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Firstly , he argued that under amended LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the above - mentioned ordinance he would have the right to a MONEY reduction in the term of his prohibition on entering GPE because he had a wife and child who were NORP citizens . Secondly , he argued that the length of the ban on entering GPE could also be reduced to DATE as provided by the newly adopted provisions in cases of aliens who had committed crimes . Lastly , the applicant alleged that the initial measure imposed in his case and the letter of DATE rejecting his request for a reduction of the ban breached his right to family life as guaranteed by LAW since he had a child in GPE who was still a minor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint , reasoning that civil law did not apply retroactively and he could therefore not benefit from the more favourable provisions of Emergency Ordinance No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL since they had been adopted after his expulsion . The court pointed out that the applicant had not contested the order of DATE setting forth the prohibition on entering GPE . It further held that LAW had not been breached since the measure adopted in the applicant \u2019s case was provided for by law , pursued the legitimate aim of preserving public order and protecting the rights and liberties of others , and had been applied because of the applicant \u2019s criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against this judgment was rejected with final effect by ORG and ORG on DATE . ORG , like the lower court , pointed out that the applicant had not contested the initial measure of DATE prohibiting him from entering GPE . It further held that the lower court had correctly ruled that the new amendments to Emergency Ordinance No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not apply retroactively . ORG also held that the applicant \u2019s allegations of a breach of his right to family life guaranteed by LAW were ill - founded since he had married and had his paternity established after the issuance of the ban on his entering GPE . Moreover , ORG observed that the applicant had married in GPE and had not produced any proof concerning the existence of an actual family life in GPE . Under these conditions , relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE , DATE ) , ORG considered that the authorities\u2019 refusal to apply the newly adopted regulations in the applicant \u2019s case had been a proportionate decision falling within the ambit of the second paragraph of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
